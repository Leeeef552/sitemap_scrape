Industry experts attribute the increase to consumers re-allocating demand towards durable goods, creating a shortage of vessels and bottlenecks in ports. The pandemic has also led to a 4.1% decline in world maritime trade, but the outlook remains positive with a growing global vaccination drive expected to normalize spending and freight demand by mid-2021.", "truncated": false, "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/2114171a2a8dd51e5ec1ea1ac1260a6d1eaeab1fc814e95e0a75adddbf8deacb?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Bottlenecks have been created due to strict Covid-19 hygiene and sanitation measures in ports, logistics centres and storage depots worldwide."}]}

Draghi, a former ECB president, has been tasked with turning around Italy's worst crisis in the post-war era, including a deep recession, high unemployment, and a massive debt load. The country's chronic political instability and unlikelihood of a strong majority government pose significant hurdles, and Draghi's ability to deliver structural reforms is uncertain.

The lower-cost lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, used in power packs, are gaining popularity due to reduced EV subsidies and increasing competition in the automotive sector. As a result, lithium carbonate prices in China jumped 37% in January, with analysts attributing the increase to downstream restocking ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This tight market is expected to continue this year, benefiting lithium carbonate producers.", "truncated": false, "images": []}
