Ultimately, a rules-based multilateral system is indispensable to secure peace and prosperity for people and the planet, he added.\n\nDr Balakrishnan spoke of today's \"uncertain, volatile, disruptive times\". \"The digital revolution is increasingly disrupting the way we live, work, play, communicate, organise, mobilise our societies.\n\n\"Non-state actors and transboundary threats - terrorism, pandemics and climate change - remain a clear and present danger. Frontier issues such as artificial intelligence and cybercrime have leapt from the pages of science fiction into our daily lives. Our social cohesion is breaking down and all too often we operate in isolated social and political bubbles.\"\n\nAt the same time, the international order is being disrupted. He noted that since 1945, countries and regions had benefited from an open global system substantially underwritten by the United States. \"But other powers are quite rightly beginning to assume a greater role in multiple spheres. This is a transition that has to be managed carefully, delicately,\" Dr Balakrishnan said.\n\n\"Multilateralism is at a crossroads and in fact is facing a significant threat,\" he said. \"Whether in trade, security or dispute resolution, questions have arisen about whether the multilateral system can continue to deliver effective solutions to all the multitude of problems that we face as a world.\" And as a small, open and trade-dependent city state, \"Singapore has watched this recent retreat from multilateralism with grave concern\".\n\nDr Balakrishnan acknowledged that multilateralism may not be perfect and sometimes has been over-sold as a panacea for all problems.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The woman suffered a \"fractured\" arm and \"cut\" on her thigh, and had to be bandaged up and given painkillers.\n\nOccasionally, she would call out to her \"husband\" and Staff Sgt Kwek, who was tending to her, would have to calm her down.\n\n\"She was also meant to create a distraction for us to test how we handled patients and the elements around us,\" said Staff Sgt Kwek.\n\nThe \"man\", that was actually a mannequin, was more severely \"wounded\", with injuries to his head.\n\nWith the help of his team mates, WO Ang managed to perform an endotracheal intubation procedure on him.\n\nThe procedure was particularly challenging, as although the team had practised it during training, they had never performed it in real life.\n\nIt involved a tube being placed into the windpipe through the mouth to secure the airway of the patient.\n\nWO Wee said the team initially felt daunted when they saw participants from places such as New Zealand and Australia at the competition.\n\n\"They were tall and big-sized, and we felt physically small. But we reminded ourselves of the people who had invested their time, knowledge and expertise to prepare us for the competition, and we didn't want to let them down,\" said WO Wee.\n\nThe four SCDF paramedics come from different fire stations and divisions across Singapore, but one thing they have in common is their passion for the job.\n\nTo prepare themselves for the competition, they spent close to 70 hours while off-duty training for it.\n\nThey hope that bringing home the trophy can shine some light on the role and challenges that paramedics face.\n\nSaid WO Ang: \"Some people think we are just (a mode of) transport to the hospital and some often wonder why we don't just take (the patient) and go, but there are a lot of factors to consider when we reach a scene.\"\n\nLt Noraini has been in the force for 20 years and played the role of team manager.\n\nShe said: \"Hopefully, there will be a sense of pride for paramedics in Singapore.\n\n\"And this will continue to remind the public that we are more than capable of caring for them and their loved ones in an emergency.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSCDF\n\nEmergency services\n\nLimited-time offer\n\nGet a FREE Xiaomi vacuum cleaner (worth $109) with your subscription!\n\nBilled at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Just starting to hear the Democrats, who are only thinking Obstruct and Delay, are starting to put out the word that the 'time' and 'scope' of FBI looking into Judge Kavanaugh and witnesses is not enough,\" the President tweeted.\n\n\"Hello! For them, it will never be enough.\"\n\nAt a dramatic televised hearing last Thursday, university professor Christine Blasey Ford accused the judge of pinning her down and assaulting her in the 1980s. Mr Kavanaugh vigorously denied the allegations.\n\nTrump administration officials appearing on television on Sunday said the terms of the Kavanaugh inquiry were set by the US Senate, not by the President, but confusion was rife as to the scope of the new investigation.\n\nBoth the New York Times and NBC News cited multiple sources last Saturday as saying the White House was limiting the witnesses the FBI could question during a one-week background check.\n\nBut Mr Trump subsequently insisted on Twitter that the FBI had \"free rein\" to pursue the matter as it saw fit.\n\n\"I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion,\" the President tweeted late last Saturday.\n\n'Very concerned'\n\nThe Times said the FBI would question four witnesses, according to two people familiar with the matter. The list, reportedly drafted by Senate Republicans, did not include former classmates who had contradicted Kavanaugh's testimony about the extent of his youthful drinking and partying.\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg quoted Dr Ford's lawyer, Ms Debra Katz, as saying: \"We have not heard from the FBI, despite repeated efforts to speak with them.\" NBC said the FBI was not being allowed to investigate claims by Ms Julie Swetnick, who has accused Mr Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct at drink-fuelled parties in his student days.\n\nIn a separate report on Sunday, NBC quoted a senior US official and a second source as saying the limits imposed by the White House on the inquiry remained in place, despite Mr Trump's tweet.\n\nThe bureau has, however, contacted Ms Deborah Ramirez, a Yale University classmate of Mr Kavanaugh's who said he was sexually aggressive towards her at a party, the Washington Post reported.\n\nA Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Amy Klobuchar, told CNN that she was \"very concerned\" by the reported White House constraints on the inquiry.\n\n\"The White House should not be allowed to micromanage an FBI investigation,\" she said.\n\n\"We have to allow them to go ahead,\" said spokesman Sarah Sanders, who insisted that the White House was staying \"out of the way\", but also said the inquiry should not be allowed to become a \"total fishing expedition\" by the FBI.\n\nAsked on Fox News on Sunday whether the White House had given the FBI a list of permitted witnesses, she replied, \"Not that I'm aware of.\"\n\n\"The White House isn't intervening, we are not micromanaging this process,\" she said.\n\nDr Ford's wrenching testimony last Thursday engendered expressions of deep sympathy from many viewers, and scores of women shared accounts on social media of having been victims of sexual aggression.\n\n'I'm a victim'\n\nThe recent events also drew a stunning revelation Sunday from one of Mr Trump's own senior advisers, Ms Kellyanne Conway.\n\nWhile discussing the case on CNN, she said \"I feel very empathetic, frankly, towards victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape.\"\n\nContinuing after a brief, somber pause, she said, \"I'm a victim of sexual assault.\"\n\nBut she then added that it was unfair to condemn Mr Kavanaugh for an alleged action 36 years ago that could not be confirmed.\n\nWhile the White House has denied setting limits on the FBI inquiry, Mr Norman Eisen, who was special counsel for ethics under former president Barack Obama, tweeted that it would be highly unusual if it were to do so.\n\n\"I dealt with hundreds of these as WH Ethics Czar & it is malpractice for WH to rule out Swetnick, Yale boozing\" and more, he tweeted.\n\n\"I call cover-up.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/10/01/file724fvp0s76f13yl2ugxt.jpg?VersionId=EcnYv4esNXF1LolBm5vaonYJLg06xZ7V", "alt_text": null}]}

They argued that he was throwing away the best chance the world has to keep Iran from building nuclear weapons in coming years.\n\nIn an hour-long conversation with reporters, Mr Zarif, who negotiated the nuclear accord with Mr John Kerry, who was then the secretary of state, sounded far more optimistic than he had in recent months that he could peel away America's allies to break Mr Trump's effort to cut off Iran's revenues.\n\nMr Zarif is capitalising on a renewed enthusiasm among some of the allies to push back at what they term bullying by Washington to sever ties with Iran simply because Mr Trump decided to forsake the nuclear pact.\n\nAll the other signatories to the agreement - Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran and Russia - have vowed to stand by it.\n\n\"No sovereign country or organisation can accept that somebody else decides with whom you are allowed to do trade with,\" Ms Federica Mogherini, the European Union foreign policy chief, said this past week.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

There are between 120 and 180 eggs in each nest.\n\nShe added that the increased sightings were the results of the turtle management programme launched in 2016, and that more data will be needed to form clear population trends.\n\nBy chance, 16 hawksbill turtles hatched at the facility on the morning of the launch. They were later released into the sea.\n\nThe hatchery comprises two sections: an incubation sand pit area, where trained volunteers and staff take care of eggs, and a turtle field station that provides volunteer training, educational and research programmes, and other hatchery-related activities.\n\nNParks said the facility is located on Small Sister's Island because it sits between East Coast Park and other Southern Islands like Lazarus Island and Kusu Island, the two areas where most turtle nesting activities have been recorded since 2005.\n\nStaff and volunteers will transport eggs found across Singapore to the incubation sandpit if their original sites are not suitable, said Dr Tun, who is the Director for Coastal and Marine at the National Biodiversity Centre.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The eggs are due to hatch around Oct 26.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said: \"Aside from already being a popular nesting spot, Small Sister's Island is a protected area within the Sisters' Islands Marine Park that is zoned for conservation and research.\n\n\"This limits the disturbance to the nests caused by human traffic and light pollution. It also helps to maximise the number of hatchlings that are able to make it out to sea.\"\n\nSingapore is home to two species of turtles. The hawksbill turtle, which is most commonly seen around the coasts, is critically endangered. The green turtle, much less encountered, is endangered.\n\nNParks already monitors the various nests around the country, such as the one where eggs hatched on Pulau Satumu last Tuesday, but it said the public will be able to learn how to take care of these nests and eggs at the hatchery through a volunteer training programme.\n\nCalled the Biodiversity Beach Patrol, it will teach participants how to protect nesting turtles and how to move eggs safely, for instance.\n\nVolunteer Lisa Lim, 48, was at the hatchery's launch on Saturday and prepared the baby turtles for their maiden journey into the sea.\n\n\"Many people don't think that Singapore has sea turtles, but volunteering gives you the chance to see them and really understand what we have,\" said the science teacher, who volunteers weekly.\n\nNParks will announce new training dates by the end of 2018, but those interested in the Biodiversity Beach Patrol can read more here: https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/sisters-islands-marine-park/iyor/biodiversity-beach-patrol\n\nSEE\n\nINSIGHT\n\nSee more on\n\nNational Parks Board\n\nDesmond Lee", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/ST_20180930_XKIDS_4313601.jpg?VersionId=AROdkpB7m7u0McpUAjCfp.qyywb4t0zs", "alt_text": "Hatchlings at the incubation sandpit area (above), and being released by Bright Kids School House children and Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee (right), at the hatchery's launch yesterday."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/ST_20180930_XHATCH_4313584.jpg?VersionId=2FA_VjIobrquBVDJbkh_0_bgMG5yqV_J", "alt_text": "Hatchlings at the incubation sandpit area (above), and being released by Bright Kids School House children and Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee (right), at the hatchery's launch yesterday."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

In the accident scenario, the woman suffered a fractured arm and cut on her thigh, and had to be bandaged and given painkillers. The man was more severely wounded, with head injuries.\n\nWith the help of his teammates, WO Ang performed an endotracheal intubation procedure on the mannequin representing the man - placing a tube into the windpipe through the mouth to secure the patient's airway.

Even a year ago, teaching these yoga postures could have rendered them outlaws in the conservative Islamic kingdom.\n\nWidely perceived as a Hindu spiritual practice, yoga was not officially permitted for decades in Saudi Arabia, the cradle of Islam where all non-Muslim worship is banned.\n\nBut with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowing an \"open, moderate Islam\", the kingdom last November recognised yoga as a sport amid a new liberalisation drive that has sidelined religious hardliners.\n\nSpearheading efforts to normalise yoga in the kingdom is Ms Nouf Marwaai, a Saudi woman who has battled insults and threats from extremists to challenge the notion that yoga is incompatible with Islam.\n\n\"I have been harassed, (and) sent a lot of hate messages,\" said the 38-year-old head of the Arab Yoga Foundation, which has trained hundreds of yoga instructors in the kingdom.\n\n\"Five years ago, this (teaching yoga) would have been impossible,\" added Ms Marwaai, as she began training a cluster of women students at a private studio in the Red Sea city of Jeddah.\n\nHanging up their body-shrouding abayas and headscarves, the women stretched in unison in an arching warrior pose known as \"virabhadrasana\".\n\nArms outstretched, their bodies folded into a 180-degree backward bending posture known as \"chakrasana\", or wheel pose.\n\nIn a country where women have long been denied the right to exercise publicly, the students - some of whom regularly attend yoga retreats in India - said the exercise had transformed their lives.\n\nMs Ayat Samman, a 32-year-old health educator, said yoga helped alleviate her lifelong struggle with fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder that often left her bedridden.\n\nYoga also works as therapy, the women said, helping them vent bottled up emotions and tackle a woefully common ailment - depression.\n\n\"It just opened me up like a water balloon,\" said Ms Yasmin Machri, 32. \"After my first class... I started breaking down and crying.\"\n\nIn just a few months since yoga's recognition, a new industry of yoga studios and instructors has sprouted in various Saudi cities. That includes Mecca and Medina, Islam's holiest cities, Ms Marwaai said.\n\nPrince Mohammed, the de facto ruler, has\n\nsought to project a moderate image of the kingdom\n\n, long associated with a fundamentalist strain of Wahhabi Islam, with a new push for inter-religious exchange.\n\nSaudi Arabia in recent months has hosted officials linked to the Vatican, and the prince also met a group of Roman Catholic and Jewish leaders in New York earlier this year, in a rare interfaith gesture.\n\n\"The prince's outreach to other religions is apparent in the interfaith gatherings and the new enthusiasm for Saudi Arabia's pre-Islamic heritage,\" said Ms Kristin Diwan, of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.\n\nFor decades, Saudi rulers derived much of their legitimacy from their alliance with a clerical establishment that pushed a puritanical vision of Islam.\n\nBut the prince appears to have upturned the system, seeking instead to tap support from the kingdom's swelling youth base through a surge of nationalism and a much-hyped modernisation drive.\n\nSaudi columnists have openly called for abolishing the once-feared religious police as the kingdom introduces\n\nentertainment\n\n, including\n\nmixed-gender concerts\n\n, and\n\nreopens cinemas\n\nafter a decades-long ban.\n\nProminent hardline Salafist clerics with millions of followers on social media have been jailed, with some on death row, as the crown prince clamps down on dissent.\n\n\"The religious networks which once led campaigns against more liberal ideas appear cowed, but new practices like yoga are always subject to ad-hoc attacks,\" Ms Diwan said.\n\nYoga is still regarded as a deviant practice in conservative circles, sometimes associated with witchcraft, and Ms Marwaai's students say they often confront accusations of betraying their religion.\n\n\"I receive messages through social media asking, 'Are you a Hindu? Did you turn into a Hindu?'\" said recruitment specialist Budur al-Hamoud. \"Yoga has nothing to do with religion. It's a sport... It does not interfere with my faith.\"\n\nYoga is seen at odds with several other faiths, but the recognition of the practice in Saudi Arabia - the epicentre of the Islamic world - appears to have given a new impetus to Muslim yoga practitioners around the world.\n\nMs Marwaai is taking on conservatives not just in the kingdom but also in India, the birthplace of yoga, where clerics last year slapped a fatwa, or religious edict, against a female Muslim yoga teacher just days before the kingdom recognised the sport.\n\nIn a shrill Indian television debate, Ms Marwaai - a lupus survivor and recently awarded the Padma Shri, one of India's highest civilian honours - calmly sought to reason with Muslim clerics who hurled insults at her.\n\nThe clerics were particularly opposed to \"Surya Namaskar\", a yoga sequence designed to greet Surya, the Hindu sun god, and the chanting of Hindu mantras.\n\n\"It is not the worshipping of the sun and the moon,\" Ms Marwaai responded as tempers frayed, denying they engaged in chanting.\n\nUnconvinced, a cleric said the set of physical movements in the Muslim prayer ritual offered enough exercise.\n\nMs Marwaai retorted that the slow meditation does not increase the metabolic rate.\n\nSee more on\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nYoga", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/bp_yoga_300918_41.jpg?VersionId=ubU1Blh_ZK7Of_s0a68C0vFy33udBOIh", "alt_text": null}]}

Officials say there are concerns the deals were badly negotiated, too expensive or overly favoured China.\n\nBut to Islamabad's frustration, Beijing is willing to review only projects that have not yet begun, three senior government officials have told Reuters.\n\nIn a statement in response to questions faxed by Reuters, China's Foreign Ministry said that both sides were committed to pressing forward with BRI projects, \"to ensure those projects that are already built operate as normal, and those which are being built proceed smoothly\".\n\nPakistani officials say they remain committed to Chinese investment but want to push harder on price and affordability, while re-orientating the\n\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor\n\n(CPEC) - for which Beijing has pledged about US$60 billion in infrastructure funds - to focus on projects that deliver social development in line with Prime Minister Khan's election platform.\n\nChina's Ambassador to Pakistan, Mr Yao Jing, told Reuters that Beijing was open to changes proposed by the new government and \"we will definitely follow their agenda\" to work out a roadmap for BRI projects based on \"mutual consultation\".\n\n\"It constitutes a process of discussion with each other about this kind of model, about this kind of roadmap for the future,\" Mr Yao said.\n\nBeijing would proceed only with projects that Pakistan wanted, he added. \"This is Pakistan's economy, this is their society,\" he said.\n\nIslamabad's efforts to recalibrate CPEC are made trickier by its dependence on Chinese loans to prop up its vulnerable economy.\n\nGrowing fissures in relations with Pakistan's historic ally the United States have also weakened the country's negotiating hand, as has a current account crisis likely to lead to a bailout by the International Monetary Fund, which may demand spending cuts.\n\n\"We have reservations, but no other country is investing in Pakistan. What can we do?\" one Pakistani minister told Reuters.\n\nCRUMBLING RAILWAYS\n\nThe ML-1 rail line is the spine of country's dilapidated rail network, which has in recent years been edging towards collapse as passenger numbers plunge, train lines close and the vital freight business nosedives.\n\nMr Khan's government has vowed to make the 1,872km line a priority CPEC project, saying it will help the poor travel across the vast South Asian nation.\n\nBut Islamabad is exploring funding options for CPEC projects that depart from the traditional BRI lending model - whereby host nations take on Chinese debt to finance construction of infrastructure - and has invited Saudi Arabia and other countries to invest.\n\nOne option for ML-1, according to Pakistani officials, is the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model, which would see investors or companies finance and build the project and recoup their investment from cashflows generated mainly by the rail freight business, before returning it to Pakistan in a few decades time.\n\nMr Yao, the Chinese envoy, said Beijing was open to the build-operate-transfer model and would encourage its companies to invest.\n\nRail mega projects under China's BRI umbrella have run into problems elsewhere in Asia. A line linking Thailand and Laos has been\n\nbeset by delays over financing\n\n, while Malaysia's new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad outright cancelled the\n\nChinese-funded US$20 billion East Coast Rail Link\n\n.\n\nBeijing is happy to offer loans, but reticent to invest in the Pakistan venture, as such projects are seldom profitable, according to Mr Andrew Small, author of a book on China-Pakistan relations.\n\n\"The problem is that the Chinese don't think they can make money on this project and are not keen on BOT,\" said Mr Small.\n\nOFF-BOOKS DEBT\n\nDuring\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Pakistan in 2015\n\n, the ML-1 line was placed among a list of \"early harvest\" CPEC projects that would be prioritised, along with power plants urgently needed to end crippling electricity shortages.\n\nBut while many other projects from that list have now been completed the rail scheme has been stuck.\n\nPakistani officials say they became wary of how early BRI contracts were awarded to Chinese firms, and are pushing for a public tender for ML-1.\n\nPartly to help with price discovery, Pakistan asked the Asian Development Bank to finance a chunk of the rail project through tendering. The bank began discussions on a US$1.5 billion to US$2 billion loan, but China insisted that the project was \"too strategic\", and Islamabad kicked out the bank under pressure from Beijing in early 2017, according to Pakistani and Asian Development Bank officials.\n\n\"If it's such a strategic project then it should be a viable project for them to finance on very concessional terms or invest in?\" said one senior Pakistani official familiar with the project, referring to the BOT model.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said Beijing was engaged in friendly consultations with Pakistan on the rail project. Chinese companies participated in BRI projects in an open and transparent way, \"pooling benefits and sharing risks\", it said.\n\nAnalysts say Pakistan will struggle to attract non-Chinese investors into the project, which may force it to choose between piling on Chinese debt or walking away from the project.\n\nIn 2017, Pakistan turned down Chinese funding for a US$14 billion mega-dam project in the Himalayas due to cost concerns and worries Beijing could end up owning a vital national asset if Pakistan could not repay loans, as occurred with a Sri Lankan port.\n\nMr Khan's government chafes at several Chinese intercity mass transport projects in Punjab, the voter heartland of the previous government, which now need hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies every year.\n\nThey also fume about the risk of accumulating off-books sovereign debt through power contracts, where annual profits of above 20 per cent, in dollar terms, were guaranteed by the previous administration.\n\nWith the ML-1 line, there are also those who harbour doubts closer to home, including the previous government's finance minister Miftah Ismail, who said his ministry had always had concerns about its viability.\n\n\"When people say it's a project of national importance, that usually means it makes no sense financially,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nPakistan\n\nBelt and Road Initiative", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/bp_gwadar_300918_38.jpg?VersionId=1zgn8SpWzg49lAmrm_kOXYlas3GO_Q0M", "alt_text": null}]}

At the 11th hole, the duo were all square with both having won three holes.\n\nWhile they have the higher-ranked player in eight of the 12 singles matches, the US squad struggled in pairs play, reigning Masters champion Patrick Reed enduring a horror-show outing on Saturday and 48-year-old left-hander Phil Mickelson, a five-time Major champion, seeing action only once.\n\nReigning British Open champion Francesco Molinari and England's Tommy Fleetwood, who together went 4-0 in pairs matches, could each become the first European players to win 5-for-5 in Ryder Cup play with a singles triumph.\n\nFleetwood tees off in the fifth match against American Tony Finau and was 1 down after five holes, while Italian world No. 5 Molinari meets Mickelson in the ninth match.\n\nAlso chasing history is Spain's Sergio Garcia, who faces ninth-ranked Rickie Fowler in the eighth match.

I'm so thankful to Thomas Bjorn for believing in me.\n\n\"It's unreal. The crowds were amazing - they always are but it was just unbelievable how supportive. I've never had so many big cheers like I've had this week. It was amazing, and I'm just really happy that they get to celebrate now.\"\n\nStenson duly handed Bubba Watson his fourth defeat in four singles matches, by a thumping 5&4, with only Patrick Reed halting the cascade of blue by beating Tyrrell Hatton.\n\nAlex Noren and Bryson Dechambeau then found themselves alone on the course - but for 70,000 fans - as the final match carried on to decide only the margin of victory.\n\n\"You have to tip your cap, they outplayed us,\" said Furyk, who has cut a sporting and dignified figure through what turned out to be a tough week.\n\n\"Europe did a good job on a golf course they know pretty well.

Macedonia spun into political crisis on Sunday (Sept 30) as a referendum on a deal that would have unlocked the door to Nato and European Union membership fell well short of the required turnout, raising the prospect that the Balkan nation would be blocked from those Western clubs for years to come.\n\nWith most of the vote counted, only 37 per cent of eligible Macedonians had answered the question of whether to accept an agreement to change the country's name to North Macedonia in exchange for Greece's lifting of its veto on Nato and EU membership.\n\nThat was far short of the participation threshold of 50 per cent, even though 91 per cent of those who voted supported the deal.\n\nThe hotly contested campaign was closely watched by the Kremlin and Western leaders, who saw the vote as a signal for the geopolitical direction of the Balkans at a time when Russia and Nato nations are competing fiercely for influence in Europe.\n\nThe referendum was advisory, not binding, and Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said he would press on with efforts to pass the constitutional changes necessary to live up to the agreement with Greece that was reached in June.\n\nHe said he would call snap elections as early as November if he failed to muster the two-thirds vote in Parliament needed to implement the deal.\n\nDespite the low turnout, the result was a \"success for democracy and for a European Macedonia\", Mr Zaev said.\n\nThe referendum offered a chance for the Macedonian public to weigh in on the deal with Greece, which has kept Skopje from being a full participant in Western institutions since it declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.\n\nGreece, whose northern region is also called Macedonia, sees the country's name as a political and territorial threat.\n\nThe Greek government said the referendum result was \"contradictory\" and that it respected the result even as it hoped the agreement could be preserved.\n\n\"The climate of nationalism and suspicion, of daily fake news and rampant fanaticism, unfortunately do not allow for a sober assessment\" of the deal, the Greek Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe name deal has inflamed nationalist passions inside Macedonia, where many opponents of the current government, including some who describe themselves as pro-Western, said the bargain was an unacceptable humiliation at Greece's hands.\n\nAs often happens in referendums, the vote was also an unofficial plebiscite on Macedonia's rulers.\n\nThe country's main opposition party, which lost power to Mr Zaev last year, vehemently fought the renaming agreement, and its top leaders declared they would boycott the vote.\n\n\"The government has lost its legitimacy, and the only thing remaining is to respect the will of the people,\" Mr Hristijan Mickoski, leader of the main centre-right opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE, wrote on Facebook. \"Macedonia today voted against the agreement.\"\n\nWestern leaders had poured into Skopje in recent weeks to push for a \"yes\" vote, in a measure of the stakes of the referendum.\n\nUS Defence Secretary James Mattis, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg were among the heavyweights who passed through.\n\nMany of them described the deal as a once-in-a-generation chance for Macedonia to join the West.\n\nNato leaders in July approved membership talks for as soon as the country implements the agreement.\n\n\"I welcome the yes vote,\" Mr Stoltenberg wrote on Twitter. \"I urge all political leaders & parties to engage constructively & responsibly to seize this historic opportunity.\"\n\nAnalysts said Macedonia had been targeted by a wave of disinformation, much of it with ties to Russia, with dozens of new websites offering false information about the content of the deal and the consequences of going along with it.\n\nIn July, a group of rowdy soccer fans said they had been paid to stir up violence at protests against the deal.\n\nAnd Greece barred four Russian diplomats from the country for what leaders there said were efforts to foment nationalist opposition to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' willingness to make a compromise with Skopje.\n\nSee more on\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nNato\n\nEU", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/10/01/bp_vote_011018_27.jpg?VersionId=7uXsVWJD3YknB43Bf50kE_4smncKo6Rx", "alt_text": null}]}

It also displayed the administration's determination to challenge China beyond a growing trade war, even before it settles on a clear strategy.\n\nAt the United Nations last Tuesday (Sept 25), President Donald Trump announced that the State Department would undertake a thorough review of foreign aid, giving it only \"to those who respect us and, frankly, are our friends\".\n\nHe also cited \"the encroachment of expansionist foreign powers\" in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nBeijing has been quietly carrying out a wide-ranging effort to vastly expand its trade and influence in Latin America, and in 2015, China surpassed the US to become South America's largest trading partner.\n\nIn a speech on the eve of a trip through Latin America and the Caribbean in February, then secretary of state Rex Tillerson warned about the dangers of the region's growing ties with China.\n\nThe proposed penalties were raised by the national security adviser, Mr John Bolton, three US officials said, after El Salvador established sovereign relations with China in August. It was the third Latin American country in the past year to do so; the Dominican Republic cut ties to Taiwan in May, and Panama did so in June 2017.\n\nChina insists that Taiwan is part of its territory. Currently, 17 nations have resisted recognising Beijing's diplomatic sovereignty, and China has been pushing harder against the last holdouts since Ms Tsai Ing-wen, a critic of Beijing, became president of Taiwan in 2016.\n\nThe White House wanted to push back.\n\nMr Bolton called President Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n of El Salvador and warned him not to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan, a White House spokesman said.\n\nIn August, Mr S\u00e1nchez did it anyway.\n\nIn a blistering statement, the White House said Mr S\u00e1nchez's decision affected \"the economic health and security of the entire Americas region\".\n\n\"The El Salvadoran government's receptiveness to China's apparent interference in the domestic politics of a Western Hemisphere country is of grave concern to the United States, and will result in a re-evaluation of our relationship with El Salvador,\" the statement said.\n\nThat was followed by a threat from key Republican senators - Mr Marco Rubio of Florida and Mr Cory Gardner of Colorado - to push legislation to end foreign aid to El Salvador.\n\n\"Leftist leaders of #ElSalvador were clearly told ahead of time that switching from #Taiwan to #China would have negative impact on relations with US,\" Mr Rubio tweeted, \"but they either didn't believe it or didn't care. They will soon find out that this @POTUS doesn't bluff.\"\n\nBut the State Department warned that such punitive measures would undercut a host of other administration priorities - including attempts to deter Central American migrants who have flooded the south-western border this year, seeking entry into the US.\n\nDiplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little pushback from Washington. Mr Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organisation's management team.\n\nState Department officials decided to call back the US chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the \"recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan\", Ms Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, said in a statement this month.\n\nBut penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which received an estimated US$140 million (S$191 million) in US aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.\n\nThe proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.\n\nAs internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering in 2017 that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the US.\n\nBut by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador. US Vice-President Mike Pence is slated to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.\n\nAnd the three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS foreign policy\n\nEl Salvador\n\nTaiwan\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/bp_john_bolton_300918_40.jpg?VersionId=_dtbOLAW2USPjvC4yqm3LS4iO_NlbWd7", "alt_text": null}]}

Rescuers said they heard voices and a child's cries from under the rubble.\n\nIn a post to Twitter, the disaster agency spokesman also warned residents to be alert to the hoax forecasts of further tsunamis and earthquakes that he said were appearing on social media.\n\nDesperate survivors, now facing a third straight night sleeping outdoors, turned to looting shops for basics like food, water and fuel as police looked on, unwilling or unable to intervene.\n\nThe government was left with little option but to promise it would reimburse owners.\n\n\"Record everything taken, inventorise it.

The water was spinning me around,\" he said.\n\n\"This morning, I went back to the beach, I found my motorbike and my wife's wallet.\"\n\nOthers have centred their search around open-air morgues, where the dead lay in the baking sun - waiting to be claimed, waiting to be named.\n\nHelp at hand?\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo visited the region on Sunday afternoon, urging a \"day and night\" effort to save all those who can be saved.\n\nBut disaster agency spokesman Nugroho indicated sheer power of will may not be enough.\n\n\"Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,\" he said.\n\nStill, as dire as the situation in Palu was, it was at least clear. In outlying areas, the fate of thousands is still unknown.\n\nIndonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said the final death toll in the north of Sulawesi island could be in the \"thousands\" since many regions have still not been reached.\n\nIndonesia's Metro TV on Sunday broadcast aerial footage from a coastal community in Donggala, close to the epicentre of the quake. Some waterfront homes appeared crushed but a resident said most people fled to higher ground after the quake struck.\n\n\"When it shook really hard, we all ran up into the hills,\" a man identified as Iswan told the TV.\n\nThe 7.4-magnitude quake struck last Friday (Sept 28), sparking a tsunami that ripped apart Palu's coastline.\n\nSave The Children programme director Tom Howells said access was a \"huge issue\" hampering relief efforts.\n\n\"Aid agencies and local authorities are struggling to reach several communities around Donggala, where we are expecting there to be major damage and potential large-scale loss of life,\" Mr Howells said.\n\nThe national disaster agency said it believed about 71 foreigners were in Palu when the quake struck, with most safe.\n\nThree French nationals and a South Korean, who may have been staying at a flattened hotel, had not yet been accounted for, it added.\n\nGetting enough aid in may prove a problem.\n\nSatellite imagery provided by regional relief teams showed severe damage at some of the area's major ports, with large ships tossed on land, quays and bridges trashed and shipping containers thrown around.\n\nA double-arched yellow bridge had collapsed, its ribs twisted as cars bobbed in the water below.\n\nA key access road had been badly damaged and was partially blocked by landslides.\n\n\"People here need aid - food, drink, clean water,\" said 39-year-old Palu resident Anser Bachmid.\n\nFar and wide\n\nLast Friday's tremor was also felt in the far south of the island in its largest city Makassar and on neighbouring Kalimantan, Indonesia's portion of Borneo island.\n\nAs many as 2.4 million people could have felt the quake, it is believed.\n\nThe initial quake struck as evening prayers were about to begin in the world's biggest Muslim majority country on the holiest day of the week.\n\nAs news of the scale of the disaster spread, US State Department spokesman Heather Nauert conveyed \"condolences and support\" and said that the US was \"ready to assist in the relief effort\".\n\nFrom the Vatican, Pope Francis offered prayers for victims.\n\nSee more on\n\nIndonesia\n\nEarthquakes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/10/01/file724gx5ts6md1m0rwb9w3.jpg?VersionId=mjr1oJcv82B2ylr.PLfTOCKNRDjaBvlF", "alt_text": null}]}

City brushed aside the limited challenge of Brighton with goals from Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero after the Argentine linked superbly with the Englishman to net his seventh goal in all competitions this season.\n\nLACKLUSTRE SHOWING\n\nLiverpool and City are now nine points ahead of United, who are being quoted at an unlikely 150/1 to win the title this season.\n\nUnited manager Jose Mourinho will be more concerned with where their next win will come from after another lacklustre showing ended with him lambasting his team for their \"quality and mental approach\" at West Ham.\n\nThe defeat marked another low after a turbulent week in which Paul Pogba was stripped of the vice-captaincy and United were dumped out of the EFL Cup by Derby.\n\nMourinho responded by fielding an unfamiliar 3-5-2 formation and omitting his misfiring striker Alexis Sanchez from the squad in favour of Anthony Martial.\n\nPASSIONLESS\n\nBut the result was an equally passionless performance that led former United captain Rio Ferdinand, who now works as a TV pundit, openly to question how long Mourinho will remain in charge.\n\n\"There are some big decisions to be made at United now,\" Ferdinand said on BT Sport. \"There will be conversations at the top level, about the future of the manager and the squad, because the basics are not being done. There has to be something said.\"\n\nWest Ham took just five minutes to open the scoring with record signing Felipe Anderson producing an audacious back-foot flick.\n\nAn unlucky own goal increased their lead but even a superb strike from Marcus Rashford made little difference, with Marko Arnautovic scoring the winner.\n\nMourinho was predictably unhappy. \"One goal is offside, the second goal is own goal and the third goal is referee's mistake but for the next game we have to have a better start,\" he said, adding that Pogba, who was substituted in the second half, was \"trying hard\".\n\nElsewhere, goals by Jamie Vardy and Harry Maguire secured Leicester City's 2-0 win over Newcastle United, who have lost their opening four home games for the first time amid British media reports of a possible takeover fronted by Peter Kenyon, the former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive.\n\nHarry Kane scored twice, including a penalty, as Tottenham Hotspur inflicted further woe on bottom-placed Huddersfield Town. Arsenal also won 2-0, at home to Watford, although both goals came in the final 10 minutes as Unai Emery's side were made to work hard for their seventh successive win in all competitions.\n\nThe only worry was a hamstring injury to keeper Petr Cech, who was substituted and will be out for three weeks.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers' Ivan Cavaleiro scored with his first touch in the Premier League as Southampton were beaten 2-0. The Portuguese capitalised on excellent work from Adama Traore as the promoted side continued their impressive start to the season.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson had an eventful afternoon for Everton, atoning for his missed penalty with two goals in the 3-0 win over Fulham, who have never won at Goodison Park in the league.\n\nSee more on\n\nEPL\n\nFootball matches", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/2018-09-29t202640z_958585981_rc1d448f68e0_rtrmadp_3_soccer-england-che-liv.jpg?VersionId=kXwkqmUiUzBb5ODr8EAiUnGipRCy0hFO", "alt_text": null}]}

We seek to reconcile marginalised communities with society in a way that promotes respect and harmony across different communities in Singapore and the world.\"\n\nThe Buddhist Fellowship is a non-sectarian organisation that aims to serve Buddhist practitioners across three different traditions of Buddhism. Its website said that the group has a few thousand members.\n\nSeveral religious organisations in Singapore have spoken out against repealing the law, including the National Council of Churches of Singapore and the head of the Catholic Church in Singapore, who said the law should not be repealed under the present circumstances. The Singapore Islamic Scholars and Religious Teachers Association (Pergas) said a repeal of Section 377A could cause several \"worrying implications\".\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

These include fertility health awareness, changing mindsets on fertility treatments, making fertility treatments more accessible and affordable, as well as how recognising infertility as a disease might affect issues such as insurance.\n\nAs part of the study, ILC will also research different methods of fertility treatments, including the subsidies available and waiting times at both public and private hospitals.\n\nThe president of ILC, Mrs Joni Ong, 58, says: \"With the recent news of our low total fertility rate, it makes sense to share that ILC is embarking on this study. We invite key stakeholders, organisations, communities and couples with their own stories to come forward, share your insights and take part in this conversation.\"\n\nShe adds that ILC plans to speak with as many couples as possible, as well as gather insights from experts like doctors and sociologists, and engage with private sector and government representatives.\n\nOne in five married couples here, she notes, is affected by fertility issues.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But she put a positive spin on those talks, saying she was ready to consider the EU's concerns.\n\n\"My message to my party is let's come together and get the best deal for Britain,\" May told the BBC in the central English city of Birmingham.\n\n\"At the heart of the Chequers plan is a free trade deal, a free trade area and frictionless trade ... Chequers at the moment is the only plan on the table that delivers on the Brexit vote ... and also delivers for the people of Northern Ireland.\"\n\nMay has shown little sign of shifting away from her Chequers plan, named after her country residence where she hashed out an agreement on Brexit with her ministers in July, despite growing criticism that her proposals offer the worst of all worlds.\n\nJohnson, who quit May's cabinet after Chequers was agreed, called her plans \"deranged\" and attacked the prime minister for not believing in Brexit.\n\nHe, and the former Brexit minister David Davis, are pushing for a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU - a proposal May says will split Northern Ireland from mainland Britain by making the British province adhere to different customs rules.\n\nMichael Gove, May's environment minister, dismissed his former Brexit ally's proposals to leave the EU, which have been dubbed \"super Canada\".\n\n\"I'm in favour of a super Britain deal,\" he told an event on the sidelines of the conference. The prime minister has put forward a proposal, which I support.\"\n\nEU TAUNTING \"BEYOND THE PALE\"\n\nMay's team had hoped the party's conference would give her a platform to renew her pledge to help those people who are \"just about managing\", trying to pull the focus away from Brexit and on to a more domestic agenda where some party officials fear the main opposition Labour Party is gaining the upper hand.\n\nBut her first announcement - for an additional levy on foreign home buyers - did little to reset the conversation, with Sunday dominated again with Brexit, a possible leadership campaign and the prospect of an early election.\n\nThe conference has become the chance for those ministers with leadership ambitions to parade in front of the party faithful. Johnson's successor at the foreign office, Jeremy Hunt, gave a speech that, for some, sent a strong signal of intent.\n\nJohnson's interview in the Sunday Times in which he said, unlike May, he was a true Brexit believer, was also seen by many to be the start of a campaign for the top job - something that angered some Conservatives who are critical of the former foreign minister.\n\nIan Lavery, chairman of the opposition Labour Party, said the Conservatives were \"clearly too busy fighting amongst themselves and have neither the ideas nor the desire to offer real solutions to the problems they have caused\".\n\nEven though May has stuck to her Chequers plan and on Sunday won at least the outward support of most of her ministers, the EU rubbished some of her proposals at a summit in Austria this month.\n\n\"We have a right to expect our EU partners to engage seriously, and with respect, on our shared future relationship,\"Fox said.\n\n\"I'm sure I wasn't the only one after Salzburg to feel that the taunting of Theresa May, one of the most unfailingly polite people I have ever met, was absolutely beyond the pale.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nBrexit\n\nBritain", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/10/01/file724eq5svbav9cl2rlhz.jpg?VersionId=bFKEX9WmziHp22dywmIeTxFVh1aYTlGg", "alt_text": null}]}

Markets fear its demise would cause major economic disruption.\n\nTwo Ottawa sources directly familiar with the talks said a deal could be very close but stressed some challenging matters had yet to be solved.\n\nOne of the sources said Canada would take nothing for granted until Trump had signed off on the deal.\n\nUS Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House adviser Jared Kushner planned to brief Trump on Sunday on the talks, said a US source familiar with the discussions.\n\nLighthizer and Kushner have been keeping Trump updated through the weekend, added the source, who was not authorised to speak about the talks publicly.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it makes no sense to sign onto a new Nafta only to be hit by new tariffs and is seeking safeguards.\n\n\"It's a challenging task to figure that out and they're spending a lot of time on that right now,\" said the third Canadian source.\n\nOne solution might be to imitate the provisions of the bilateral Mexico-US deal on Nafta.\n\nThe two nations signed a side letter allowing Washington to pursue tariffs on annual Mexican car and SUV imports of over 2.4 million vehicles, a number that significantly exceeds last year's total. The Mexican government said the letter provided insurance that gave the auto industry scope to grow.\n\nA fourth Canadian source directly familiar with the negotiations said any suggestion Ottawa would accept a cap or quota on autos exports was completely inaccurate.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS foreign policy\n\nCanada", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/10/01/file722vm7c90mwbizb94fo_0.jpg?VersionId=NJr5tlmUrLr.V4BydlDFbLNVHx3yo3n8", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

I stepped outside the city hall in the afternoon, and the rain was swirling in very strong wind. Enormous wind... It was difficult to stay standing.

Some businesses were already putting up shutters and hunkering down.\n\nTrami is the latest in a string of extreme natural events in Japan, which has\n\nsuffered typhoons, flooding, earthquakes and heatwaves in recent months\n\n, claiming scores of lives and causing extensive damage.\n\nPacking maximum gusts of 216kmh, Trami was expected to travel over most of the archipelago, weakening slightly but causing extreme weather into Monday, forecasters said.\n\nStill classed as a \"very strong\" typhoon, Trami pounded Kagoshima on the western tip of Japan early on Sunday, causing minor injuries - such as cuts from broken windows and people knocked over by gusts.\n\n'IT'S REALLY DESERTED'\n\nThe western city of Osaka lay close to the path of the storm and its Kansai Airport, which is\n\nsituated on reclaimed land offshore\n\nand\n\nsuffered extensive damage in a storm earlier in September\n\n, closed two runways.\n\nOfficials piled up sandbags to avoid a repeat of flooding seen during the previous storm.\n\nSpeaking to AFP from a hotel near the airport, British businessman Richard Swart said: \"It's actually quite warm outside, very windy and with very heavy rain.\"\n\n\"The airport is closed. There are very few people around and all the shops are shut. It's really deserted,\" added Mr Swart, 56, who is from Durham in northern England.\n\nEven from the safety of the hotel, he said he could hear the wind \"howling\" outside.\n\nThe Japanese meteorological agency warned that the typhoon would bring strong winds and downpours, which could trigger landslides and floods as well as lightning strikes and tornados across the nation.\n\nCities in the expected path of the typhoon were already taking precautions.\n\nEast Japan Railway stopped all train services in and around Tokyo at 8pm, shortly before the typhoon was to draw near the Japanese capital.\n\nSome western regions are still recovering from\n\nTyphoon Jebi in early September\n\n, the\n\nmost powerful typhoon to strike the country in a quarter of a century\n\n.

Teaching people to tell fake news from real news\n\nIn this era of fake news, it has become more important than ever to ensure people are equipped with critical thinking skills, so that they can discern truth from falsehood, effectively interrogate information sources and understand how and why online falsehoods are spread in the digital age.\n\nTo that end, the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods recommended that the Government set up a national framework to coordinate and guide public education initiatives.\n\nProfessor of media and communication Lim Sun Sun from the Singapore University of Technology and Design points out that educators need to go beyond just inculcating media literacy.\n\nMuch of the media literacy education today provides people with checklists of telltale signs to assess the credibility of information.\n\nHowever, purveyors of online disinformation have greater access to technologies that fabricate information to seem so real that it has become very difficult for most people to identify fake news when they see it.\n\n\"We need to expand people's knowledge to aspects such as the business models behind online content, online advertising and social media platforms so that they understand how the ecosystem rewards news that is more sensational,\" Dr Lim says. \"As well, we need to explain how individual psychological biases can be exploited to make people more susceptible to online disinformation.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The 2018 Reuters Institute Digital News Report, which surveyed news consumers from across 37 countries including Singapore, found that while 58 per cent of respondents said they are worried about fake news, only 26 per cent could identify a recent example of a fake news report that they had seen.\n\nThe Media Literacy Council, a group spearheading public education on media and digital literacy, plans to do more to make sure people are better equipped with the skills they need to navigate online news and information, says chairman Lock Wai Han.\n\nFor example, the council will be stepping up efforts to help people understand \"that their cognitive bias can make them an easy target for fake news, as the way social media is designed makes it easier for online users to select only the information that supports and reinforces their ideas\", he says.\n\nThe ultimate aim is to \"make it second nature for Singaporeans to check what they read online and not to spread news that has not been verified\".\n\nDr Adrian Kwek from the Singapore University of Social Sciences believes that schools can infuse lessons on critical thinking into various subjects at every level.\n\nFor example, in a Secondary 2 class on statistics, teachers could include content on how statistics that are true could still be used to mislead.\n\n\"Suppose I conduct a poll of 10 people about a controversial topic like abortion. I ask them to rate, on a scale of 0 to 10, whether they think abortion is permissible,\" he says, adding: \"(And the results show) a mean rating of 5, a median rating of 2, and a mode rating of 10. Depending on what my agenda is, I can use the term 'average' to my advantage.\n\n\"If I want people to read the news of my poll and believe that the topic is not controversial, I'll say that the average rating is 5. If I want people to believe that the respondents are conservative, I'll say that the average rating is 2. If I want people to believe that the respondents are liberal, I'll say that the average rating is 10.\"\n\nHe goes a step further, saying that critical thinking alone is not enough. Citizens also need to care about truth and the society.\n\nWhile this is taught in Character and Citizenship Education, and critical thinking is taught by infusing the skill into academic subjects, students need these two fields to be explicitly brought together in the context of fake news, he says.\n\n\"We need a particular form of critical thinking - that which is motivated by care for the truth and care for society. Without these two motivators, good critical thinkers can make excellent fake news producers.\"\n\n2. A national plan to counter disinformation campaigns\n\nThe starkest example of the danger of fake news is also the most well-known one - how Russian operators manipulated social media to disseminate disinformation during the 2016 presidential election in the United States.\n\nIn its report, the Select Committee highlighted how foreign operators even created fake social media accounts to organise protests in the US. Singapore is not immune to such threats. In fact, the committee said it received evidence that foreign operators have already carried out disinformation campaigns here and can be expected to continue to do so.\n\nIt recommended that the Singapore Government consider what additional measures are needed to safeguard the integrity of elections here. It also said Singapore should have a national strategy to counter state-sponsored disinformation campaigns from abroad.\n\nDr Shashi Jayakumar, head of the Centre of Excellence for National Security at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, says this is much easier said than done. \"The aggressive actor, the one that is trying to carry out the subversion, can take advantage of technology, which is advancing at a breathtaking rate,\" he says.\n\nMr Jakub Janda, director at the Prague-based European Values Think-Tank, agrees. \"Modern technology, such as deep learning, deep 'fakes' or sophisticated bots, provides effective offensive tools of malign influence for state and non-state actors,\" he says.\n\n\"The offensively minded actors, such as Russia, China, extremist, criminal or terrorist groups, have the advantage because democracies are much slower in responding to this development.\"\n\nMr Janda, who submitted his views and research to the Select Committee, says the first step is to assess the threat level here.\n\n\"You analyse what is the current form and scope of the threat, project how it can evolve in the next five to 10 years, learn from the experience of other countries and tailor your own national policy framework,\" he says.\n\nThen, policies and specific action plans can be drawn up.\n\nSweden is a good example to take the lead from, he says. It began preparing for its elections, which were held earlier this month, two years ago by studying elections abroad, especially ones tampered with by Russia, he says.\n\nIt established an election task force and trained thousands of public officials on how to safeguard the integrity of its elections, and published an extensive manual on countering influence operations.\n\nIn Britain, an interim report by its Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee recently made its own list of recommendations on protecting the integrity of its elections.\n\nThese included mandating digital imprint requirements for all electronic campaigning, increasing fines for electoral fraud, establishing an advertising code which would apply to social media during election periods and increasing transparency around digital political advertisements.\n\nNOT JUST THE RUSSIANS\n\nDr Jayakumar notes that both reports from British and Singapore committees refer to Russia, but warns: \"We shouldn't be overly fixated on Russia.\n\n\"The techniques and stratagems pioneered by the Russians for a long time - in Ukraine, the Baltics, now in the US and parts of Europe - are transferable and portable, and can be tried by others.\n\n\"(But) they should not give anyone the impression that Russian fake news or subversion is a big trend in Singapore - I suspect it is not.\"\n\nInstead, he says, it might be \"more useful to look at the parts in the Select Committee report about the activities of an unnamed Asian country, presumably one much closer to home\".\n\nThe report makes mention of \"an Asian country\" that reportedly has an online army of content creators to promote its government's policies and attack criticisms of those policies, both within and outside that country.\n\nIn another part of the report, the committee notes that it received evidence about disinformation operations conducted in Asia allegedly by \"an Asian country\".\n\nThis is an important starting point for further study, Dr Jayakumar says: Who is trying to undermine Singapore's social stability and resilience?\n\nMr Janda notes: \"The strategic threat is how the Chinese government tries to use malign influence tools in the wider Asian region.\n\n\"We are effectively in an (information) arms race, and we can see that China is learning from what Russia does in Europe in terms of hostile foreign influence operations, and it is being deployed in Asia - and vice versa.\"\n\n3. Getting tech firms to shut down info feeds and funding\n\nA major motive driving fake news dissemination is financial profit.\n\nTo counter this, the Select Committee recommended the Government implement new laws allowing it to cut off the flow of digital advertising funds to shady operators peddling disinformation.\n\nThis will require the cooperation of technology companies, whom the committee believes could do more to fight fake news.\n\nIt suggested proactive actions they could take, from shutting down inauthentic accounts to increasing the transparency of digital advertising. It also suggested the Government bring in rules compelling tech companies to take steps against fake news.\n\nAmong the proposals, one for a \"demonetisation\" regime could easily be implemented, note experts. Professor Ang Peng Hwa of the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at Nanyang Technological University says the effectiveness of this has already been shown in the United States, when Facebook, Apple, Twitter, YouTube and Spotify removed podcasts, pages and channels of fake news peddler Infowars.\n\nProf Ang notes: \"Within weeks of the platforms taking action, traffic to the site halved and it's still declining.\" In future cases, he says, the same could apply. \"Any site that sends out fake news on a regular basis would have its feed cut off. Advertisers would be told not to advertise with them through a name-and-shame move.\"\n\nThe Select Committee also recommended new laws to require those who financially benefit from fake news to repay the profits they made. \"This should cover the 'hired guns' paid by others to create and spread online falsehoods,\" it said.\n\nProfessor Lim Sun Sun from the Singapore University of Technology and Design says this would mean, for example, a platform such as YouTube withholding payment to a vlogger found to have started and spread deliberate falsehoods.\n\nIt is an innovative proposal, she adds. \"If you look at legislation around the world, it's had to do with other aspects of regulation, not through demonetisation.\"\n\nThe committee noted that other specific measures tech companies should undertake would vary depending on the platform. For example, on a closed messaging platform such as WhatsApp, Telegram and WeChat, minimising amplification of an online falsehood may involve prohibiting it from being forwarded.\n\nHowever, Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information notes that tech companies face a huge challenge in stamping out falsehoods. \"The dissemination and circulation of information is so ubiquitous and voluminous that it would be administratively impossible for tech companies to police the Internet effectively against falsehoods,\" he says. \"For example, how would social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram check against the daily circulation of alarmist fake news between users?\"\n\nProf Liew believes any new regulations placed on tech firms should be carefully crafted so they do not cripple Singapore's position as a media and information hub.\n\nDuring the Select Committee's hearings, representatives from Twitter, Facebook and Google expressed concerns about new rules.\n\nAddressing this at a media briefing last week, committee member Janil Puthucheary said the desired outcome of new laws - that people can trust the engagements that happen online and have some security and confidence in the information that they receive - should be in line with what tech companies themselves want to achieve.\n\n\"If our objectives and our intent are all aligned to create a trusted space, trusted platforms, citizen engagement, I can't see why the tech companies would not want to find ways to enable that,\" he said.\n\n\"So we have to have a negotiation about what they think is possible and what we think is necessary and I think we can find a way forward.\"\n\nThe tech companies themselves have been stepping up their efforts. A Facebook spokesman says that over the last year, it has invested in technology and people to combat false news and disrupt attempts to manipulate civic discourse.\n\n\"This includes removing fake accounts, disrupting the financial incentives behind false news, reducing the posts people see that link to low-quality Web pages, partnering with threat intelligence experts, and promoting digital and news literacy,\" she says. Facebook has also introduced a policy that will remove false news with the potential to lead to offline violence, and introduced more ad transparency, she adds.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, notes it has improved its search algorithms and introduced new YouTube features to ensure credible information and authoritative news sources are weighted more heavily.\n\nSee more on\n\nInsight\n\nFake news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

For those who cannot take the heat of spicy foods like fish head curry, braised fish head is a good option. Cook rice to serve with the braised fish head, and it is possible to host a dinner party for six to eight without tiring yourself out in the kitchen. The dish is packed with vegetables for a nutritious and satisfying meal.\n\nInstead of cooking the fish head whole, I prefer to have it cut up into large pieces. This makes it easy to deep-fry and shortens the cooking time.\n\nCarrot, napa cabbage, onion and leek add natural sweetness to the dish. I particularly like the texture of dried beancurd sticks soaked in gravy. Tomatoes add a touch of tanginess to prevent the dish from being cloying.\n\nWhile the claypot is commonly used to serve up braised fish head, I find that the 5-litre sauce pot from Corningware Plasma Cast Aluminium Cookware puts in an admirable performance in place of a claypot.\n\nYou can prepare the gravy and braise the fish in the same pot. Better yet, the sleek design of the pot makes it attractive enough to double up as serveware. The non-stick coating also makes it easy to remove food remnants at the bottom of the pot after you are done with the meal.\n\nThe Corningware Plasma Cast Aluminium Cookware is a new line of cookware recently launched by kitchenware maker and distributor Corelle Brands. The product line includes a 28-cm saute pan and a 32-cm wok.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Before using the cookware for the first time, hand wash it thoroughly with warm soapy water. Rinse and dry.\n\n2. Use cooking utensils made of wood, nylon, silicone or plastic for your cookware.\n\n3. Always allow the cookware to cool completely before cleaning. For stubborn residue, make cleaning easier by pouring hot water and a little detergent into the cookware. Allow the water to cool before washing.\n\nYou can also use the sauce pot for deep-frying the fish, but I choose to use the 32-cm wok for this as I can fry more pieces of fish head at a time.\n\nThe cookware, crafted from cast aluminium, has excellent heat distribution and you need only low to medium heat to cook your food. The cookware also has a patented medical grade bio-ceramic coating that stands up to abrasion and heat well. The cookware can be used on gas, induction, halogen and electric coil cookers.\n\nThis recipe caps a six-part series featuring kitchenware from Corelle Brands.\n\nBRAISED FISH HEAD\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n1 whole garoupa fish head (2kg), cut into large pieces, about 8-cm in length\n\n2 tsp salt\n\n200g cornflour\n\n1.2 litres cooking oil (Reserve 3 Tbs of used cooking oil to cook the gravy later)\n\n25g ginger, thinly sliced\n\n3 garlic cloves, chopped\n\n1 carrot (140g) halved lengthwise and sliced\n\n200g napa cabbage, cut into 5cm by 3cm pieces\n\n4 Tbs oyster sauce\n\n120g dried beancurd sticks, soaked and broken into 8-cm lengths\n\n1.2 litres of water\n\n2 Tbs light light soy sauce\n\n1 Tbs Shaoxing wine\n\n2 tomatoes (280g), sectioned\n\n1 onion, 150g, sectioned\n\n3 Tbs cornflour\n\n3 Tbs water\n\nDash of white pepper\n\n1 stalk of leek (60g), diagonally sliced\n\n10g spring onion, sliced into 5-cm lengths\n\n5g fresh coriander leaves\n\nMETHOD\n\n1.

Without that underlying foundation it would not be possible to solve the Rakhine state problem which has been around for about two and a half centuries, he said.\n\nAt an Asean meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the key point made to Myanmar was that \"we stand ready to help\", said Dr Balakrishnan. And the important step next is that the refugees are repatriated in a safe and dignified manner, which needs to occur soon.\n\n\"Asean will work with Myanmar to facilitate this process,\" he said. \"This is something we will have to watch in the next few weeks, next few months.\"\n\nAsean supported the Independent Commission of Enquiry appointed by the Myanmar government in July to collect evidence of serious international crimes committed in Myanmar.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Then you came out with a statement saying we were exploring opportunities via a JV (joint venture),\" said Mr Khairy.\n\nUmno Youth chief Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki said any political cooperation shouldn't be at the expense of selling the party's dignity, with power gained via the backdoor.\n\nMr Zahid's deputy Mohamad Hasan was also quick to reject the idea on Sunday, saying Umno must strive to regain Putrajaya on its own, and not dream of being invited to form the government.\n\n\"We shouldn't play second fiddle. Why should we? We were in power and the government,\" he added, referring to the six decades of Barisan Nasional administration, led by Umno.\n\nWhile the assembly delegates were urged over the weekend to come together in an effort to renew and reform the party, the combative tone of Mr Zahid's winding-up speech showed there are still unresolved issues in the ranks.\n\n\"It's not a difference of opinion but betrayal of the party if ... (the opinion) is (given) not to plug holes, but to poke holes in the ship,\" Mr Zahid said.\n\nAt the assembly, Mr Zahid had outlined a seven-policy, 21-step strategy for Umno to revive itself. However, weak applause greeted his announcement that he would personally helm the secretariat tasked with implementing the strategy.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nUmno", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/yq-ahmad2-30092018_2x.jpg?VersionId=YOuTxx0j1wSiWpOfNEJkzk6hNF24Pz.M", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Rather, he saw jogging as a way to discourage younger residents in the area from glue-sniffing.\n\nThe club has since evolved into a gathering of recreational joggers today.\n\nFor his efforts, Mr Tan was one of four winners at the 5th Silent Heroes Award ceremony yesterday.\n\n\"I didn't expect what I have been doing would make a big difference, \" said Mr Tan, who has two children.\n\n\"But I hope young people will know that staying healthy will make their lives happier.\"\n\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nMr Sellvem added that the awards aim \"to inspire and encourage everyone else to follow in their trailblazing footsteps\".\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who was the guest of honour, said each of the winners was special. \"We are all capable of having happiness for life by consistently helping others when no one is watching and no one knows what we are doing... Not because you're doing it for yourself but you're creating a better society and it's a happier society in the deepest sense of the term,\" he said.\n\nThe other two winners were former Straits Times journalist Nirmala Murugaian, who won in the Outstanding Adults category, and Mr Yuvan Mohan, who won the Inspiring Youth award.\n\nMs Nirmala founded non-profit organisation Child@Street 11 that provides subsidised education to young children from low-income and dysfunctional families. More than 120 children have benefited since the initiative began 18 years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Yuvan has been guiding young people aged 15 to 35 to pursue their interests, in his role as chief curator at Young ChangeMakers, an initiative by the National Youth Council.\n\nMr Tan Kok Sing's son Yong Keng, who was at the event, said he is proud of his father. \"I hope I can follow his example and lead a healthy, long life like him,\" the 67-year-old said.\n\nSee more on\n\nAwards and prizes\n\nCommunity", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/ST_20180930_XAWARD0X37_4313936.jpg?VersionId=UygLfvgQpw9TUkk0NL_eA3fWRtBN6z4f", "alt_text": "Ms Nirmala Murugaian, who set up non profit organisation Child@Street 11 to help children from low-income families 18 years ago, and Mr Tan Kok Sing, who started the Tiong Bahru Garden Joggers in 1977, were among the award winners."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/ST_20180930_XNIRMALA_4313935.jpg?VersionId=gM0KQ4_rqZyFo60AGFWOLwGA1QRJuAcJ", "alt_text": "Ms Nirmala Murugaian, who set up non profit organisation Child@Street 11 to help children from low-income families 18 years ago, and Mr Tan Kok Sing, who started the Tiong Bahru Garden Joggers in 1977, were among the award winners."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The initiative \"has promoted the spirit of common prosperity and brought countries closer together\", she added.\n\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of the opening up of China.\n\nNoting that Singapore-China relations are excellent and have evolved over time, Madam Halimah said: \"Over the years, the cooperation between our two countries has grown beyond the traditional areas of trade and investment to cover new areas, including the Belt and Road Initiative, finance, and legal and judicial issues.\"\n\nShe said the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative, which includes the Southern Transport Corridor, has added further impetus to the two countries' BRI cooperation by linking the \"belt\" and the \"road\", as well as strengthening connectivity between China and Asean.\n\nAs Asean chair this year, \"Singapore will continue to work with our dialogue partners, including China, and enhance cooperation to build a resilient and innovative Asean\", said Madam Halimah.\n\n\"We are working together on a substantive and mutually beneficial Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

This means that the average electricity bill for families living in four-room Housing Board flats will increase by $1.76 a month.\n\nSP Group said that it reviews the electricity tariffs quarterly based on guidelines set by electricity industry regulator Energy Market Authority.\n\nThe electricity tariff consists of four components: energy costs, network costs, a market support services fee, and a market administration and power system operation fee. The energy costs component is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the cost of power generation. The network costs and the market support services fee are reviewed annually.\n\nThe market administration and power system operation fee is reviewed annually to recover the costs of operating the electricity wholesale market and power system.\n\nTimothy Goh\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

This referendum will change something if it opens the door for Europe and Nato,\" retired nurse Olivera Argirovska, 74, told AFP after casting her ballot. \"It will change things for the youth.\"\n\nSome feel that it is embarrassing to have to change the name at the request of another country.\n\nBut a desire to anchor their future to the West - and the economic prosperity that it could bring - is a powerful motivation to accept the deal in one of Europe's poorest nations.\n\n\"We cannot really say it is fair, but the EU and Nato matter more for all of us, so let's move forward,\" said 28-year-old Abedin Memeti ahead of the vote.\n\nThe referendum is not binding, but a \"yes\" majority would give Parliament a political mandate to change the Constitution.\n\nIf the deal is backed in the referendum and is ratified by two-thirds of MPs, the Greek Parliament will be called on to give the final stamp of approval.\n\nWhile the Macedonian government plans to call any significant majority in favour of the deal a success, the right-wing opposition may question the vote's credibility if turnout is below 50 per cent.\n\nSome critics of the name deal have been calling for a boycott, including President Gjorge Ivanov, who is allied with the nationalist opposition.\n\nMassive emigration in recent decades could also affect the numbers, with nearly a quarter of the 2.1 million population estimated to live abroad.\n\nLess than 3,000 of those overseas have signed up to vote.\n\nEurope and the United States have campaigned hard for the deal, with many leaders passing through Skopje to urge Macedonians to accept the historic opportunity.\n\nNato has already issued an invite - on hold until the deal passes - while EU accession talks are scheduled to begin next year.\n\nThe West is keen to have another foothold in the Western Balkans, a region where Russia, which is opposed to Nato expansion, has historically had influence.\n\nAt home, those in favour of the deal say a desire for an EU future is helping to bind ethnic Macedonians with the Albanian minority, who are broadly pro-West.\n\nWhile Macedonia avoided the full-scale inter-ethnic wars that rippled across the region during the collapse of Yugoslavia, it was roiled by an Albanian insurgency in 2001 that left more than 100 dead.\n\nA peace deal was reached later that year granting Albanians more political rights, but tensions have remained.\n\n\"This is the first time I am seeing Macedonians and Albanians campaigning together for common goals,\" said law professor Besa Arifi. \"This will give us more opportunities to unite all citizens around shared values.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nNorth Macedonia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/yq-vote-30092018.jpg?VersionId=FoHV0H6xLe9AJx.bNz5cxhkJXFftkbFz", "alt_text": null}]}

staple food crops will decline in yield and nutrition an extra 10 to 15 per cent; and coral reefs that may have a chance of surviving if air temperatures remain below 1.5 deg C will very likely perish with an additional half-degree of warming.\n\nMost worrying of all, perhaps, are temperature \"tipping points\" that could push methane-laden permafrost and the ice sheets of Greenland and West Antarctica - which hold enough frozen water to lift global oceans by a dozen metres - beyond the point of no return.\n\nSome experts, however, worry that focusing on the contrast between a 1.5 deg C and 2 deg C world obscures the fact that we are currently on a trajectory that will crash through both these thresholds.\n\n\"I don't think 2 deg C is safe, and I would never want to argue it,\" said Dr Frumhoff. \"By many measures, 1.5 deg C is not enough.\"\n\nHe added: \"But while we might call 2 deg C an upper bound, let's not pretend that we're on a 2 deg C path - we are way above that.\"\n\nEven taking into account voluntary national pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions, submitted in annex to the Paris treaty, the Earth is on track to heat up by an unliveable 3.5 deg C or more by century's end.\n\n\"If we want to save ourselves from the disasters that are looming, we only have unrealistic options left,\" said Greenpeace's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change campaign leader Kaisa Kosonen. \"We have to try to make the impossible possible.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUN\n\nClimate change", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/bp_climatechange_300918_42.jpg?VersionId=t9oJqX4wFxLVKiQDqx8_5HWqkNyAkaRo", "alt_text": null}]}

The Intercept, which first reported the allegation, has also denied that Ms Feinstein's office was its source.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, before leaving for the rally, Mr Trump struck an optimistic tone about Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation, saying an\n\nFBI investigation into sexual misconduct\n\nallegations against him that the White House and the Republican Party previously resisted could be a \"blessing in disguise\".\n\n\"Having the FBI go out and do a thorough investigation, whether it's three days or seven days - I think it's going to be less than a week,\" Mr Trump said. \"Having them do a thorough investigation, I actually think it will be a blessing in disguise.

He praised Judge Kavanaugh's angry and defiant testimony last Thursday, which followed Dr Ford's appearance in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"On Thursday, the American people saw the brilliant and really incredible character, quality and courage of our nominee for the United States Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh,\" Mr Trump said.\n\n\"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democrat Party.\"\n\nLast Friday, Mr Trump ordered a one-week delay in a vote on Judge Kavanaugh so that the FBI could investigate the sexual misconduct claims that have upended the nomination process. The probe, which the Republican Party had resisted, was forced by Senator Flake's last-minute decision to withhold his previously expressed support for Judge Kavanaugh.\n\nThis was Mr Trump's second trip to West Virginia in as many months in support of state Attorney-General Patrick Morrisey, who trails incumbent Senator Joe Manchin III in most polls. The president has frequented West Virginia, which is the closest strongly pro-Trump state to Washington, throughout his presidency.\n\nA RealClearPolitics average of polls has Mr Manchin ahead by just over nine points, but Republicans hope the state's conservative lean will narrow the gap in the weeks to come.\n\nMr Manchin is one of two key Democrats who has not signalled opposition to Judge Kavanaugh yet. Last Friday, he joined with Mr Flake and two other Republican senators to force the new FBI probe.\n\nMr Trump on Saturday night also continued to fight back against the perception that world leaders diminished him last week by laughing at his claims of success at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\"Everybody is respecting us again,\" he said. \"I just left the United Nations. Believe me: They respect us.\"\n\nMr Trump also said he \"fell in love\" with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom he met at a summit in June in Singapore.\n\n\"I was being tough and so was he, and we were back and forth, then we fell in love. He wrote me beautiful letters and they were great letters. We fell in love,\" he said, immediately noting that the news media would say he was being \"unpresidential\".\n\nThe evening rally begins a heavy campaign travel period for Mr Trump, who will visit five friendly states in the coming week as he seeks to boost Republican prospects in the Nov 6 midterm elections.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nElections", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/bp_trump_300918_30.jpg?VersionId=yvxemwl_XiPZgo.lp99eXBk1zZqxsVxi", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The evidence from not just Toyota and other manufacturers is we need absolutely to be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.\"\n\nA summit of EU leaders last week ended in a blunt dismissal of May's proposals, which they said would fail to resolve arguments over the land border of Northern Ireland, in the UK, with the Irish Republic, in the EU, one of the main sticking points to a deal.\n\nBritain's Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the Irish issue was being used by some in the EU Commission \"for political purposes\", but said he was open to suggestions from the bloc.\n\n\"We aren't pretending there aren't alternative proposals that we would look at,\" he told the Sun newspaper. \"But we need credible responses for the proposals we have set out or credible alternatives, and we haven't seen them yet.\"\n\nFEARS OVER NO DEAL\n\nAs Conservative lawmakers and party members began arriving in Birmingham, central England, for what is expected to be a fractious party conference which starts on Sunday, many have said the Chequers plans are dead and should be torn up.\n\nWhile May and government ministers continue to express confidence that a final Brexit deal can be agreed, they have also insisted no-deal would be better than a bad deal.\n\nHowever, Toyota became the latest high-profile business to warn that leaving the world's biggest trading bloc without any trading agreement could add costs and cripple output at plants which rely on the just-in-time delivery of tens of thousands of components.\n\n\"If we crash out of the EU at the end of March the supply chain will be impacted and we will see production stops in our factory,\" said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota's Burnaston plant, which produced 144,000 vehicles last year.\n\nEarlier this week, other carmakers in Britain including BMW, McLaren and Honda said they had triggered some contingency plans, such as certifying models in the EU, redrawing production schedules and stockpiling parts.\n\n\"The additional burden of import and export cost would add permanent costs to our business,\" Toyota's Cooke said. \"It would reduce our competitiveness.

For every foreign patient accepted by NUH, the agent is paid 8 per cent of the patient's hospital bill, excluding doctors' fees.\n\nIf patients brought in by the agent spend more than $500,000, the agent gets an additional 2 per cent cut for every dollar above the cap. If the fees go past $1 million, the agent gets an additional 4 per cent for every dollar above that.\n\nThe agent must ensure the patient pays the hospital first before getting the fee. The agent's duties include assisting potential patients with information they require before making \"the most suitable recommendation\", as well as helping patients arrange specialist appointments, according to the NUH contract.\n\nOther agents from Indonesia and Vietnam told The Sunday Times that they also had arrangements with SGH and CGH, both run by SingHealth. The hospitals declined to say how long such practices have been going on.\n\nTan Tock Seng Hospital, which is part of the National Healthcare Group, said it does not engage such agents.

They \"are not allowed to actively market themselves to foreign patients\".\n\n\"Some public healthcare institutions (PHIs) have contracts with agents who facilitate and assist foreign patients seeking medical treatment in Singapore. While these agents have not been tasked to market their services, we have asked the PHIs to discontinue such practices and terminate existing contracts with the agents, to avoid potential misinterpretation and misrepresentation,\" it said.\n\nSingHealth and NUH told The Sunday Times they will cease the agreements by the end of next month.\n\n\"NUH's foremost priority is to provide care for Singaporeans,\" the NUH spokesman added. \"NUH reviews all referrals to ensure that it has the capacity, capability and resources to provide treatment that will be beneficial to the patient. Singaporeans are given priority, for appointments and hospital beds.\"\n\nSingHealth said the primary role of medical associates is to help overseas patients navigate the healthcare system, including advising patients on relevant health records needed, and assisting with the administrative processes, paperwork and travel arrangements.\n\n\"Medical associates are non-exclusive to SingHealth and they charge an administrative fee (per patient) for their services,\" said SingHealth.\n\nDoctors whom The Sunday Times spoke to were surprised that public hospitals engaged such agents.\n\n\"This practice of giving a 'referral fee' to 'medical agents' is unethical,\" said Dr Keith Goh, consultant neurosurgeon of International Neuro Associates. The 8 per cent commission on a hospital bill of $500,000 would be $40,000 - \"which is more than the annual salary of a staff nurse\", he added.\n\nSome doctors pointed out how under the Singapore Medical Council's (SMC) ethical code and guidelines, they are not allowed to offer a percentage of a bill as a referral fee.\n\nDr Tan Chi Chiu, chairman of SMC's Medical Ethics Committee, said that there are no issues with public doctors treating foreigners. But foreign patients may pay more, and \"doctors need to ensure that this does not set up a financial incentive\" to favour such patients over subsidised ones.\n\nSEE\n\nTOP OF THE NEWS\n\nSee more on\n\nPublic hospitals\n\nMedical ethics/Bioethics\n\nMedical fees\n\nTourism", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/bp_print6_300918_6_0.jpg?VersionId=MKzkCcmXcEq1vL1Id5MYejf40iK91ON.", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Both Bardet and Woods are stronger climbers while all-rounder Dumoulin also lacks Valverde's top-end finishing speed.\n\n\"I should have attacked on the hill. It's easy to say what you should have done afterwards, but what's done is done,\" Bardet said.\n\n\"When you are on the flat with a guy like Valverde you have to expect him to win.\"\n\nPre-race favourite, Julian Alaphilippe of France, Briton Adam Yates and Italy's Vincenzo Nibali and the last of the Colombians were dropped on the steep gradients of the final climb.\n\n\"I have no excuses,\" said Alaphilippe, who claimed the King of the Mountains' polka dot jersey at the Tour de France.\n\n\"My legs just couldn't take it. I'm bitterly disappointed, but very happy for Romain.\" Woods, a former ice hockey player and middle distance athlete, only began cycling professionally at 25 and this season won a stage on the Tour of Spain.\n\n\"I was hoping for a podium finish at the Vuelta (Tour of Spain), but I fell. It tuned out to be a blessing in disguise because I got the stage and now this world championships bronze medal,\" he said.\n\n\"The fans on the hill were insanely loud, with the bells and all the cheering, my ears are still ringing now.\" Three-time and defending champion Peter Sagan had few hopes of winning a fourth title on the hilly circuit and after the fourth of seven ascensions of the climb the Slovakian called it a day.\n\nThe race started in the pretty town of Kufstein, where the temperature sat just above zero as the riders set off through the lush Inn valley. Soon, an 11-man breakaway formed and opened a gap of almost 2O minutes.\n\nThe two final heroic survivors of the original eleven, Kasper Asgreen of Denmark and Vegard Stake Laengen of Norway were eventually overtaken 22km out.\n\nThe peloton had upped the pace to catch the escape and with around 20km to go some of the pre-race favourites started to flag. Irish hope Dan Martin, whose wife recently had twins, began to struggle ahead of the last lap, then Simon Yates and Michal Kwiatkoski quickly buckled too.\n\nSee more on\n\nCycling - Sport\n\nSpain", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/10/01/file724gx60oidz55hjgc39.jpg?VersionId=tA.g5XH8r.YKPOcPRiKhseseEqTKf1RC", "alt_text": null}]}

most cats do\".\n\nSee more on\n\nSouth Africa\n\nLions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/bp_cubs_300918_32.jpg?VersionId=hFc0GKQ64sK.DH9Lw3pWBhNqd5Z6Hw0d", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Yet it has become a cultural mapping project for four young writers who have captured its community and stories on Instagram. This is the latest in a string of grassroots-level efforts which have sought to record stories about various neighbourhoods in Singapore. Cultural mapping was given mainstream impetus two years ago with the SG50 fund, which spurred a whole range of projects - from websites dedicated to traditional recipes to photography projects documenting HDB playgrounds.\n\nWhile there have always been systematic, institutional efforts to document Singapore's history, such as the National Heritage Board's Roots.sg website, it is encouraging to see the man in the street taking an active interest in rediscovering and documenting community stories. These efforts to unearth oral histories from the country's recent past also remind Singaporeans that short as the nation's history may be, there are rich veins of stories to be mined still not just from archives but also from living memories. The multiple kampungs that were razed and replaced by high-rise homes or low-rise industrial complexes in various neighbourhoods are gone.\n\nSee more on\n\nHeritage\n\nCommunity", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/st_20180930_steditorial30_1302359774.jpg?VersionId=GcODybV7xVJbuBE.Mt0PXciS0ynibkKQ", "alt_text": null}]}

Barcelona confirmed after the game he had picked up a thigh strain.\n\nThe last time Bilbao took a point at the Camp Nou, Valverde was sitting in the away team's dug-out, in 2004, during his first spell as Bilbao coach.\n\nNow in charge at Barca, he will have questions to answer, having made the bold decision to rest Messi with Spurs in mind, along with Sergio Busquets.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It was a risk and on this occasion, it didn't come off.\"\n\nLack of rotation was chief among the criticisms levelled at Valverde after they crashed out of the Champions League quarter-finals last season, with Luis Suarez admitting he regrets playing 90 minutes against Leganes, three days before the collapse against Roma.\n\nValverde has certainly acted. Of the preferred 11 that started a 4-0 win over PSV Eindhoven two weeks ago, eight have started at least one of the three games since on the bench. The trouble is that seven of those have been required to come on as substitutes.\n\n\"We can't expect Messi just to come on and fix things,\" Suarez said.\n\n\"We should have won the game before he came on, that's why we are Barca.\"\n\nBilbao took the lead in the 41st minute and could have scored earlier. Inaki Williams' attempted lob had Marc-Andre ter Stegen beaten but drifted wide. Ter Stegen had to push Raul Garcia's effort over and was then rounded by Williams but the angle proved too tight.\n\nFinally, four minutes before half-time, Ousmane Dembele conceded possession and Markel Susaeta's cross was perfectly weighted to evade the scrambling Sergi Roberto at the back post, where De Marcos slid the ball home.\n\nValverde waited until 10 minutes after the break before introducing Messi and Busquets. Sergi and Arturo Vidal made way, the latter with a glare and shake of the head.\n\nMessi got to work. His bending free-kick looked destined for the corner, only for De Marcos to head off the line and another shot hit the post.\n\nMunir replaced Dembele and made the difference. Messi shot twice, the first scrambled away by Simon but the second fizzed across the face of goal for Munir to divert in.\n\nBarca wanted a winner and they had six minutes to find one.

And that could prove to be a problem for England manager Gareth Southgate as well ahead of next month's Nations League internationals against Croatia and Spain.\n\nPromoted Cardiff always knew they were in for a tough season and things are unlikely to get any easier for Warnock's side, with trips to Tottenham Hotspur and high-flying Liverpool to come in October.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The former Norwich man then let fly from 20 yards only to be denied by Hart's fingertip save.\n\nIt was a stop made all the more important when the Clarets regained the lead when a stooping Vokes headed home in the 70th minute.\n\n\"Sam Vokes's goal was a great header, that's difficult,\" said Burnley manager Sean Dyche.\n\n\"He had to generate all the power into it.

His precision in the passing moves is exceptional. I think this was his best match of the season.\" Piotr Zielinski fired against the post after six minutes as Napoli made a bright start and they were rewarded four minutes later.\n\nBonucci's risky diagonal ball out of defence was intercepted by Allan who quickly found Jose Callejon and the Spaniard laid the ball off for Mertens to tap in.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The Portuguese twisted and turned past Elseid Hysaj and then dropped a perfect cross onto the head of Mandzukic who powered a downward effort past David Ospina.\n\nOspina then got down well to stop a Ronaldo free kick and did even better to block the rebound to prevent Juve getting a quick second.\n\nFour minutes after halftime, Ronaldo collected the ball on the edge of the area, fired a shot against the post and Mandzukic followed up to turn the rebound into the net.\n\nMario Rui was sent off for a second bookable offence after aiming a kick at Dybala and, although it seemed a fair decision, the Napoli players were enraged by the Argentine's theatrical reaction.\n\nNapoli threatened an equaliser when Callejon got through but his shot was blocked by Wojciech Szczesny and Bonucci wrapped up the game, tapping in Ronaldo's header at the far post following a corner in the 75th minute.\n\nRonaldo could have had a goal himself but fired a shot into the side-netting after getting clear of the defence.\n\n\"We played well for the first 20 minutes, then our opponents took control of the game,\" said Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti.\n\n\"We need to continue improving. We will be competitive right until the end.\"\n\nRome overcame their poor start to the season by beating Lazio for the seventh time in their last nine meetings.\n\nLorenzo Pellegrini back-heeled Roma ahead on the stroke of halftime, shortly after replacing the injured Javier Pastore.\n\nBut an awful mistake by Roma defender Federico Fazio allowed Lazio back into the match. The Argentine was dispossessed as he tried to dribble around Ciro Immobile, who ran on to fire the ball wide of Patrick Olsen for his first goal in a Rome derby.\n\nBut Roma were back in front within four minutes when Aleksandar Kolarov fired the free kick through a huge hole in the Lazio wall.\n\nDefender Fazio completed the win, and atoned for his earlier mistake, by meeting a free kick with a towering header to score four minutes from time.\n\nSee more on\n\nFootball matches\n\nCristiano Ronaldo", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/2018-09-29t180830z_1536841371_rc119ec26710_rtrmadp_3_soccer-italy-juv-nap.jpg?VersionId=qBzYJBxPCenWVyNtYoOKORJRzYx5oKPB", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

They have got him back and they've got the same problem back,\" said analyst Frank Nobilo on Golf Channel.\n\nPerhaps the expenditure of adrenaline from that victory, as well as jet lag, has contributed to his mediocre form at Le Golf National, though that explanation would be more convincing if he had arrived with a better career record.\n\nAt 42, and seemingly a changed man after defying the odds and recovering from a potentially career-ending back injury, Woods now embraces his team mates, and the younger generation feel comfortable around a man they revere as a father figure.\n\nBut it has not helped.\n\nWoods has now had 14 different partners over the years. He has a winning record with only two, with Patrick Reed and Bryson DeChambeau joining an unsuccessful list.\n\nWoods twice on Saturday had the misfortune to encounter his recent nemesis Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to go 4-0-0 this week.\n\nIt was Molinari who withstood Woods's charge at the British Open in July, staying calm amid frenzied scenes playing with the American, who electrified Carnoustie as he stormed into the lead halfway through the final round.\n\nTwo hours later the Italian was lifting the Claret Jug, having beaten Woods by three shots.\n\nSee more on\n\nGolf tournaments\n\nTiger Woods", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/golf-fra-ryder-cup-day_two-171046.jpg?VersionId=cps0J5qzPzArQOFkaWY.wL.vYy8jRNhf", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

He just has to work.\"\n\nTwice Salah wriggled into clear shooting positions on his favoured left foot on the edge of the box inside the first 10 minutes, but his first tame effort was easily saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga before he blazed his second high and wide.\n\nJust as in midweek when Hazard came off the bench to win the game with a stunning individual run and finish, Liverpool were undone by a moment of magic from Chelsea's number 10.\n\nHazard was picked out by a fine through ball from Mateo Kovacic. Although he was forced onto his weaker left foot Hazard still managed to drill the ball low past Alisson Becker for his seventh goal of the season.\n\nSalah should have levelled against his old club just after the half hour mark when he outmuscled Marcos Alonso and rounded Kepa, but his goalbound effort was cleared off the line by Antonio Rudiger.\n\nThe world's two most expensive goalkeepers were on show and Kepa and Alisson showed why they cost a combined \u00a3140 million (S$250 million) with big saves around the hour mark. First Kepa denied Mane an equaliser and then Alisson stopped Hazard scoring his second.\n\nShaqiri sliced a huge chance wide and David Luiz then hacked Firmino's header off the line as Liverpool seemed set to be held scoreless for the first time since they last visited Chelsea in May.\n\nHowever, Sturridge succeeded where Liverpool's first-choice front three had failed with a spectacular dipping effort from 25 yards against his old club to again prove his worth in Klopp's bid to end a 29-year wait to win the title.\n\nSee more on\n\nEPL\n\nChelsea\n\nLiverpool\n\nFootball matches", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/fbl-eng-pr-chelsea-liverpool-184237.jpg?VersionId=x9wvu.O_fVt1Us9ers8rnCyGjjvvNPyT", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/2018-09-29t182907z_795160981_rc12c04b2400_rtrmadp_3_soccer-england-che-liv.jpg?VersionId=oZZq0xY.ObPDxxMTJ8c5FvYMG04N9tMy", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Then the room went into absolute chaos.\n\n\"People were rushing about. There was a guy who tried to go out the room.\"\n\nMs Gallazzi said she was told to \"push again\", which confused her as she believed she had already delivered her baby.\n\nA few minutes later, she was told that she would be put under anaesthetic. When she awoke, she was told that her baby had been decapitated.\n\nThe worst was yet to come, however, as she was told that her son's head was still inside her body, and she would need to undergo a caesarean section to retrieve it.\n\nAfterwards, a doctor reattached the baby's head to his body and told Ms Gallazzi that the baby had been \"fixed\". She was then allowed to cradle her baby's body, which was placed inside a basket.\n\nMs Gallazzi later had her baby cremated, and placed his ashes inside a teddy bear so she could cuddle it.\n\nA later hearing by the British Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester found that the doctor who had decapitated the baby was nearing the end of a 24-hour split shift when she was called to attend to Ms Gallazzi.\n\nThe hearing ruled that the doctor's decision to attempt a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean section was mistaken.\n\nA later tribunal ruled that the doctor was fit to practise, and was allowed to return to work.\n\nMs Gallazzi said that during the course of investigations, she was told that, as her baby had not taken a breath, he had no legal persona in Scotland.\n\nThis meant that there could be no criminal action or fatal accident inquiry into her baby's death.\n\nMoved by how unfair she felt the situation was, Ms Gallazzi decided to launch a petition calling for a change in the law that would give stillborn babies a legal identity.\n\n\"I'm just trying to get as many signatures as possible so this law can be looked at,\" she told BBC Radio.\n\nSee more on\n\nBabies\n\nDoctors/Surgeons", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/colin-fbl2-29.jpg?VersionId=zvUQMGZAwtxTamtnsu0EendA.Vb6xySl", "alt_text": null}]}

The car just felt really strong.\"\n\nThe pole, in a track record of one minute 31.387 seconds, was only the second this season for Bottas, who is 110 points behind Hamilton.\n\nIt also came at the track where last year he celebrated his first win.\n\n\"He's driven brilliantly this weekend and he just did a better job,\" said Hamilton, who had been fastest in the first two parts of the session and looked set for a career 80th pole until he went wide at turn seven.\n\n\"My last two laps of Q3 weren't great - you can't always have it - but we're still in contention for tomorrow,\" added the Briton, who will be chasing his eighth win of the campaign.\n\n\"It's a long way down to turn one so we'll still have a fight at least tomorrow.\"\n\nTeam boss Toto Wolff said Bottas \"was so pumped the adrenaline was coming out of his ears\" but left open a question about whether Mercedes would enforce team orders in Hamilton's favour come race day.\n\nTABLES TURNED\n\nVettel, who had led an all-Ferrari front row in Russia last year with Bottas third, hoped Sunday could see the tables turned.\n\n\"I just spoke to Valtteri and reminded him what happened last year so maybe we can turn that around this time,\" the German told reporters.\n\n\"It was important to get as close to them but it is true they have been very quick.

If there is a gap we will go for it.\"\n\nThe second phase of qualifying had a strange feel to it, with five cars - the two Red Bulls, Renaults and Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly - doing no laps as a consequence of grid penalties.\n\nRenault had no need to do anything, since the other three cars were all going to start at the back of the grid, and failure to qualify in the top 10 gave them the benefit of tyre choice.\n\nDenmark's Kevin Magnussen will line up in fifth place for Haas, behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, with Frenchman Esteban Ocon - highly rated but looking increasingly likely to be sitting out next season - sixth for Force India.\n\n\"It's strange being best of the rest,\" commented Magnussen. \"You don't want to get involved with the guys in front as that can mess up your own race. Hopefully I will have a clean track.\"\n\nSauber's Ferrari-bound rookie Charles Leclerc qualified seventh.\n\nMcLaren and Williams filled the last four slots but that will change once Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen, along with Toro Rosso's Gasly and Brendon Hartley, take their penalties.\n\nThat should at least give the crowd some overtaking to look forward to and Verstappen something to make his 21st birthday more exciting.\n\nSee more on\n\nMotor racing\n\nMercedes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/colin-mers-29.jpg?VersionId=T4DRK8UWQGKmvgg1dm7dQGEqoPjq7nzZ", "alt_text": null}]}

But the FBI is moving quickly to contact people as part of the new background investigation, which President Donald Trump ordered on Friday (Sept 28) under pressure from key members of his party.\n\nThe FBI also is following up on allegations by Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychologist, who testified to the Senate this week that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the early 1980s when they were in high school in suburban Washington, DC.\n\nFord recounted in detail how Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge allegedly attacked her in a bedroom during a small gathering at a house when the teen boys were both drunk. Ford said the alleged attack had caused her lasting trauma, and she was visibly anguished as she recalled the events Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nFollowing Ford's testimony, Kavanaugh vigorously denied the allegations before the committee and accused Democrats of launching a last-minute attempt to derail his nomination. He decried the confirmation process as a \"circus.\"\n\nOn Friday, Republicans on the committee voted to proceed to a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination, but a series of back-room negotiations led to a surprise twist in what has already been a wrenching confirmation process for a Supreme Court nominee, among the most polarising in recent memory.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

A background investigation is, by its nature, more limited than a criminal probe, and FBI agents will not be able to obtain search warrants or issue subpoenas to compel testimony from potential witnesses.\n\nThe FBI's interviews, which will take a few days to conduct, won't turn into a sprawling inquest of everyone Kavanaugh went to a party with in high school, said a person familiar with the investigation.\n\nBut already, two potentially crucial witnesses have said they will cooperate with the FBI, raising the possibility that at least more statements and recollections will be added to the record, even if they're not ultimately definitive.\n\nAn attorney for Leland Keyser, a friend of Ford's who Ford says was at the party, said Keyser also was willing to cooperate with the FBI investigation. But the attorney emphasised that Keyser has no recollection of the party where Ford alleges Kavanaugh assaulted her.\n\n\"Notably, Ms Keyser does not refute Dr Ford's account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr Ford's account,\" the attorney, Howard J. Walsh III, wrote in an email to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"However, the simple and unchangeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question.\"\n\nJudge, the high school friend of Kavanaugh who Ford says was in the room during the alleged assault, has also agreed to cooperate with the FBI. His account has been particularly sought after because, unlike Kavanaugh, Judge has not denied Ford's allegations but has said he has no memory that such an assault occurred.\n\nFord told the Judiciary Committee that some weeks after the alleged assault, she ran into Judge at a local grocery store where he was working for the summer.\n\n\"I said 'hello' to him,\" she said. \"His face was white and very uncomfortable saying 'hello' back.\"\n\nFord continued, \"He was just nervous and not really wanting to speak with me, and he looked a little bit ill.\"\n\nIn addition to Ford and Ramirez, another woman, Julie Swetnik, who said she knew Kavanaugh in high school, alleged in a sworn statement this week that Kavanaugh and Judge got teenage girls drunk at parties, where the girls were sexually assaulted, sometimes by groups of boys.\n\nSwetnik claimed that she was raped by such a group at a party where Kavanaugh and Judge were present. She hasn't accused Kavanaugh of raping her. Swetnik described Kavanaugh as a \"mean drunk\" in high school who was physically and verbally aggressive with girls.\n\nKavanaugh has denied the accusations from Ramirez and Swetnik and has said emphatically that he never abused or assaulted anyone.\n\nHe has also pointed to half a dozen other background checks the FBI conducted on him for other federal positions over the years, none of which surfaced evidence or allegations of sexual assault.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nPolitics and government\n\nLimited-time offer\n\nGet a FREE Xiaomi vacuum cleaner (worth $109) with your subscription!\n\nBilled at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Ultimately, a rules-based multilateral system is indispensable to secure peace and prosperity for people and the planet, he added.\n\nDr Balakrishnan spoke of today's \"uncertain, volatile, disruptive times\". \"The digital revolution is increasingly disrupting the way we live, work, play, communicate, organise, mobilise our societies.\n\n\"Non-state actors and transboundary threats - terrorism, pandemics and climate change - remain a clear and present danger. Frontier issues such as artificial intelligence and cybercrime have leapt from the pages of science fiction into our daily lives. Our social cohesion is breaking down and all too often we operate in isolated social and political bubbles.\"\n\nAt the same time, the international order is being disrupted. He noted that since 1945, countries and regions had benefited from an open global system substantially underwritten by the United States.\n\n\"But other powers are quite rightly beginning to assume a greater role in multiple spheres. This is a transition that has to be managed carefully, delicately,\" Dr Balakrishnan said.\n\n\"Multilateralism is at a crossroads and in fact is facing a significant threat,\" he said. \"Whether in trade, security or dispute resolution, questions have arisen about whether the multilateral system can continue to deliver effective solutions to all the multitude of problems that we face as a world.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

In particular, the 3G ministers welcomed Argentina's ambitious and forward-looking G-20 agenda of \"Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development\".\n\nWhile stressing the importance of sustaining climate change action, the 3G ministers also welcomed the creation of the Climate Sustainability Working Group under Argentina's G-20 presidency, and reiterated their commitment to the Paris Agreement and issues related to its implementation in view of the upcoming 24th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 24) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nIn this context, they expressed their readiness to work closely with the G-20 to jointly address this urgent and global challenge.\n\nAnother focus area of the deliberations were rising global trade tensions, given that the 3G countries are open economies that are heavily reliant on trade. The 3G ministers emphasised the importance of maintaining an open, rules-based multilateral trading system as embodied by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and lauded efforts by Argentina's G-20 presidency to uphold the WTO rules.\n\nThe 3G members further expressed appreciation for Argentina's active engagement with the group. They also stated their desire to continue the partnership with the G-20 under Japan's presidency in 2019. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono briefed the meeting on Japan's priorities for its presidency of the G-20 as well.\n\nSeparately, German Minister of Foreign Affairs Heiko Maas briefed the 3G on the outcomes of the German presidency of the G-20 in 2017.\n\nIn a separate engagement, Dr Balakrishnan chaired the Informal Asean Foreign Ministers' Meeting (IAMM) on the sidelines of the UNGA. He also chaired the meeting of the Asean Foreign Ministers with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the president of the General Assembly, which took stock of Asean-UN cooperation.\n\nOn his trip to the UN, Dr Balakrishnan has\n\nalso held separate bilateral meetings\n\nwith Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Sabah Khalid Al Hamad Al Sabah, Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Ayman Safadi, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne, Grenadian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Labour Peter David, and Germany's Mr Maas.\n\nDr Balakrishnan also attended a high-level event on counter-terrorism convened by Kazakhstan.\n\nSee more on\n\nVivian Balakrishnan\n\nUN\n\nDiplomacy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/colin-vb-29.jpg?VersionId=WeUyKJ.amyyiq5BPyYRAr1i1I08wxyN4", "alt_text": null}]}

He said that boxing had lost its \"big personalities\".\n\nPHOTO: AFP\n\nFollow topic:\n\nBoxing\n\nPublished\n\nSep 29, 2018, 03:31 PM\n\nMUMBAI (REUTERS) - The current generation of boxers do not have the wild streak that Mike Tyson wore like a badge of honour during his career and the former world heavyweight champion says the lack of personalities in the sport has contributed to its decline.\n\nTyson, who was in Mumbai to promote the launch of the Kumite 1 League mixed martial arts competition, told reporters late on Friday (Sept 28) that he would be a rarity if he boxed today.\n\n\"It's just different because they are not the big personalities,\" said the 52-year-old when asked why boxing's popularity was on the wane.\n\n\"Most of the (current) fighters are very straightforward guys. They are real nice guys and they are good individuals.\n\n\"I was always in trouble. I was always here and there so that's why I was always in the papers and that's why it's different. These are really straight gentlemen guys. I was really wild and a young kid getting into trouble.\"\n\nUS broadcaster HBO said this week it would drop live boxing from its programming schedule from 2019 due to dwindling ratings, ending a 45-year association with the sport starting from 1973.\n\nWhile boxing seems to be on the way down, the sport of mixed martial arts is gaining traction in the mainstream with fighters such as trash-talking Irishman Conor McGregor becoming household names.\n\nTyson said he enjoyed last year's boxing match between undefeated multi-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr and the Ultimate Fighting Championship's (UFC) McGregor.\n\n\"I go to the UFC all the time,\" he said. \"That was a good fight. I was entertained.\"\n\nTyson became the youngest world heavyweight champion in 1986 at the age of 20 and was the undisputed champion until a stunning loss to Buster Douglas in Tokyo in 1990.\n\nHe served three years of a six-year US jail sentence after being convicted of rape in 1992 and returned to the ring in 1995. He then added to his notoriety when he bit off a chunk of Evander Holyfield's ear in a bout two years later.\n\nTyson, who had his last fight in 2005, picked Briton Anthony Joshua as the best of the current crop of heavyweights.\n\nThe 28-year-old Joshua holds the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO belts and has been in talks about a fight with WBC title holder Deontay Wilder which would give him a shot at becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion.\n\nAmerican Wilder will defend his title against Britain's former world champion Tyson Fury on Dec 1.\n\n\"I think Joshua right now,\" said Tyson when asked to pick the top heavyweight.\n\n\"Tyson Fury hasn't fought in a while.

People were not only leaving the bikes in forbidden places but picking up these hefty models - each can easily weigh more than 10kg - and\n\nhurling them\n\nfrom high places\n\n, and\n\ninto canals\n\n.\n\nBike abuse here became blatant -\n\nthey were stomped on, repainted,\n\nand in one case\n\nfound muddied and ditched in a drain.\n\nWas there no one riding on the bike rights movement? Were the wheels starting to come off, both literally and figuratively?\n\nA SMOOTHER RIDE FOR ALL\n\nIt was time to iron out the kinks, decided the authorities and bike-sharing companies.\n\nSolutions ranged from a\n\ncredit rating system\n\n, where errant users were booted out by the firms from their apps, to the\n\nLand Transport Authority (LTA) impounding stray bikes and dishing out fines to companies\n\n.\n\nThen, in October last year, bike-sharing companies were required to implement a more high-tech solution to tackle parking issues -\n\ngeofencing\n\n, which sends out an alert when a bike enters or leaves a designated parking area.\n\nThe public was also roped in to help report errant bikes,\n\nwith a new category created on the OneService app in November for this.\n\nSome even decided to take things into their own hands, or rather,\n\ntake damaged stray bikes into their own hands.\n\nIn this case, these fingers also tickled the ivories, as Mr Zhivko Girginov, who has lived in Singapore for more than nine years, is a piano teacher.\n\n\"Lifting the bikes on to the lorry can be very tiring,\" the Bulgarian said to The Straits Times last December, adding that he had taken to wearing gloves to protect his hands on his rounds.\n\nDespite these initiatives, bike-parking woes persisted. Hopefully, the latest measures grease the wheels to better user behaviour.\n\n100,000\n\n- the estimated number of shared bikes in Singapore as of March this year. Last month,\n\nthe LTA said it had removed more than 35,000 of oBike's bicycles from public spaces\n\nafter the bike-sharing firm abruptly ended its operations here on June 25.\n\n267,000\n\n- number of bicycle parking spaces that will be available by 2020, said LTA. There are currently slightly more than 200,000.\n\nAbout $9,000,000\n\n-\n\nthe amount in deposits owed to 220,000 users by bike-sharing firm oBike, according to its provisional liquidators, FTI Consulting, in July this year\n\n. The\n\nbike-sharing firm's chairman Shi Yi had told ST earlier in July\n\nthat the amount was $6.3 million.\n\n12 months\n\n- the duration a user can be banned up to under the latest LTA regulations for errant bike parking.

The landfills, covering an area the size of several football fields, contained thousands of unused and damaged shared bikes.\n\nCITIES PUT THE BRAKES ON\n\nSome cities have hit back with harsh regulations to rein in bike-sharing companies which they deem to be irresponsible.\n\nIn\n\nMelbourne, the environmental authority of Victoria hit oBike with a hefty fine of A$3,000 (S$2,960) for each abandoned bike that blocked a street for two hours, after which the company halted its business there\n\n.\n\nA London borough,\n\nWandsworth, also went on the offensive, impounding the yellow oBikes in August last year.\n\nA transport spokesman for the borough, Mr Jonathan Cook, did not spare oBike any blushes, and said: \"It is rather naive to simply dump thousands of bicycles on London's streets without any warning or discussion beforehand.\"\n\nIn Japan,\n\nwhere there are stringent laws against clutter on footpaths, bike-sharing companies were cautious not to heap bikes onto the streets overnight, but worked with local retailers and the authorities first to provide space for designated parking.\n\n\"You can't just expand willy-nilly,\" said an executive at Docomo Bikeshare, which has about 7,000 bicycles across 24 cities in the country.\n\nAs a result, firms like ofo have been taking it slow in Japan rather than flooding the streets with two-wheelers.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, where it all began, local governments in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen have banned companies from introducing more bikes to reduce parking issues,\n\nsaid the BBC.\n\nSee more on\n\nCycling/Bicycles", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/yq-obike-02082018.jpg?VersionId=9vB3B2Lsa894bjaCJFv8MOMh_a2uyKur", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

They play two games but they are not friendlies; instead, they play in the Nations League, and all the teams want the best players to play.\n\n\"Who cares about the player? It's so difficult.\n\n\"With the circumstances of the season, it's a massive challenge for everyone. It's not only us; there are a lot of teams that have the same problem.\n\n\"The players are not machines. You want to push and push and push them, and it's not easy. And no one helps, but we are warned before every single game to play the same players.\"\n\nAlli's injury is of particular concern to Pochettino, because it appears to be an old problem that has resurfaced.\n\nAsked how long the midfielder would be absent, the coach said: \"I don't know. He reinjured the same muscle as with England against Spain, and that is the problem. It's important to be relaxed and calm.\"\n\nKane is another player who could claim to have suffered from such a busy schedule, having struggled for form since returning from the World Cup, where he was the leading scorer.\n\nTottenham's star striker scored 13 goals in eight games during September last year, but had managed just one in six before Saturday's visit to the John Smith's Stadium.\n\nHowever, Kane showed signs his confidence and form are returning by scoring both goals against the Terriers, the first a header from Kieran Trippier's cross, the second a penalty after Florent Hadergjonaj was harshly ruled to have tugged Danny Rose back by the shirt.\n\n'READY TO FIGHT'\n\nKane's return to scoring form secured a second successive Premier League victory for Tottenham, who have climbed back up to fourth place after recovering from the disappointment of defeats by Watford and Liverpool earlier in September.\n\n\"I am so pleased because the team was ready to fight,\" said Pochettino. \"The ball was more in the air today than the grass, it was a massive fight.\n\n\"I'm sure it will be a completely different game on Wednesday (against Barcelona).\" Huddersfield are bottom of the Premier League, having managed only one league goal at home since February 11, but head coach David Wagner is confident they are playing well enough to move up the table.\n\n\"If you perform consistently as we've done and create opportunities, the reward will come,\" he said. \"We have to focus on this and nothing else.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nEPL\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nFootball matches", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/30/fbl-eng-pr-huddersfield-tottenham-150743.jpg?VersionId=Xwbbd4XB4hbNBEWilCV3b6ASfoOoGqMp", "alt_text": null}]}

'MEGATHRUST' QUAKE IN ACEH\n\nOn December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude \"megathrust\" earthquake hit Aceh on the northern tip of Sumatra island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that reached coastal areas as far away as Somalia.\n\nThe waves pounded several countries around the Indian Ocean, killing more than 170,000 in Indonesia alone, the vast majority in Aceh province.\n\nThe tsunami killed about 50,000 people in other countries, bringing the total fatalities to approximately 220,000, making it one of the\n\nworst natural disasters in human history.\n\nThere was no warning of the impending tsunami, giving little time for evacuation, despite the hours-long gaps between the waves striking different continents.\n\nThe earthquake unleashed energy equivalent to 23,000 of the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\n2. TSUNAMI, MELTDOWN IN JAPAN\n\nOn March 11, 2011, Japan was struck by an enormous 9.0-magnitude earthquake, unleashing a towering tsunami that levelled communities along the country's north-eastern coast.\n\nAbout 19,000 people were left dead or missing as the terrifying wall of water that travelled at the speed of a jet plane swallowed up everything in its path.\n\nThe water swamped reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, sparking reactor meltdowns in the worst atomic accident since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\nThe disaster is still deeply engrained in the nation's collective psyche and to this day, there are people from ravaged communities still living in temporary accommodation.\n\n3. CHILE: WORLD'S WORST QUAKE\n\nThe most powerful earthquake ever recorded - at magnitude 9.5 - devastated Chile in May 1960 and the resulting tsunami tore around the world.\n\nMore than 5,700 people were killed in Chile and 61 in Hawaii when the waves reached the coast there. The destruction spread as far as Japan, where 142 people were killed and 1,600 buildings damaged.\n\nSurvivors in Japan said the 1960 tsunami reached heights of up to 5m.\n\n4. MORO GULF\n\nJust after midnight on Aug 17, 1976, a quake measuring magnitude 7.9 struck near the Philippine islands of Mindanao and Sulu and the resulting tsunami with waves 5m at the highest point swept thousands away as they slept.\n\nBetween 5,000 and 8,000 people were killed, according to official estimates, making it one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the Philippines.\n\n5. PAPUA NEW GUINEA\n\nOn July 17, 1998, Papua New Guinea was rocked by two quakes, each of 7.0 magnitude.\n\nThe twin quakes prompted a tsunami that ravaged 30km of the northern coastline of the country, sweeping away seven villages in its path.\n\nAccording to official statistics, more than 2,000 lives were lost, but local sources put the death toll at between 6,000 and 8,000.\n\nMore than 12,000 were made homeless by the disaster.\n\nSee more on\n\nIndonesia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/nz-tsunamis-290919_0.jpg?VersionId=u7TjOtVDwoXhjVbAkA8Z.GZX7tlMaWYa", "alt_text": null}]}

Najib attended as an ordinary party member.\n\nAnd Datuk Seri Zahid, 65, said he supported the call by enemy-turned-ally Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS), that \"Islam should lead\" the country.\n\nIn short, while outsiders are keen to see whether Umno will move in a major, new direction to regain the trust of voters, Mr Zahid and his party leaders seemed unlikely to shift away from holding on to the race and religion card.\n\n\"Umno is not a racist party, or prejudiced, or a threat to other races.

The seats belong to Umno. The seats belong to Barisan Nasional (BN) supporters,\" he said, to loud cheers from the crowd.

He wants members to deliberate on this.\n\nAnd he wants a \"rebranded\" BN, consisting of five parties, by allowing direct membership into the coalition.\n\n\"The main core parties will consist of Umno, MCA, MIC, MyPPP, and Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah (PBRS), followed by the parties of other coalitions who understand the aspirations and ideals of struggling together,\" he said.\n\nBN shrunk to just Umno, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) after the May polls defeat.

Some great ships were hurled by the fury of the waves onto the rooftops, and others were thrown up to 3km from the shore.\"\n\nSeveral factors determine the height and destructiveness of a tsunami.\n\nThey include the size of the quake, the volume of displaced water, the topography of the sea floor as the waves race to the coast and whether there are natural obstacles that dampen the shock.\n\nDestruction of protective mangroves and coral reefs\n\nand the building of homes or hotels on exposed beaches are fingered as leading causes of high death tolls from tsunamis.\n\nKRAKATOA\n\nLarge quakes are the main drivers of tsunamis\n\n, but the phenomenon can also be sparked by other cataclysmic events, such as volcanic eruptions and even landslides.\n\nIn 1883, a volcano shattered the Pacific island of Krakatoa, causing a blast so loud that it could be heard 4,500km away, followed by a tsunami that killed some 30,000 people.\n\nThe tsunami of December 2004 in the Indian Ocean was caused by a monstrous 9.1-magnitude earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra.\n\nIt released energy equivalent to 23,000 of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey. Some 220,000 people in 11 nations were killed, many of them thousands of kilometres from the epicentre.\n\nThe Pacific Ocean is particularly prone to earthquakes and therefore to tsunamis.\n\nBut research has found that, over the millennia, tsunamis have occurred in many parts of the world, including the Atlantic and Mediterranean. A global monitoring network, overseen by the UN, has been set in place to alert areas at risk.\n\nSee more on\n\nIndonesia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/tsubnami_2x.jpg?VersionId=bJyPgzKjwOtVDf_QXWTto6fDeAYmU6Fc", "alt_text": null}]}

The airport is the country's third-largest by passenger numbers, behind the Haneda and Narita facilities that serve Tokyo, and is the gateway to the Osaka region.\n\nThe airport's operator said it will close two runways from 11 a.m. local time on Sunday to 6 a.m. on Monday, halting all takeoffs and landings. Train services also are expected to be impacted. West Japan Railway Co. said that it plans to halt local train services Sunday and will suspend bullet train services from late morning between Shin Osaka and Hiroshima stations.\n\nAirline cancellations from Trami so far have centered on Okinawa.

We do what we can to limit the damage.\"\n\nIf the forecast holds, it will be the latest in a series of extreme natural events to strike Japan.\n\nWestern regions are still recovering from the most powerful typhoon to strike the country in a quarter of a century in early September.\n\nTyphoon Jebi claimed 11 lives and shut down Kansai Airport.\n\nKansai Airport's operator has been preparing sandbags since Thursday and plans to deploy about 24,000 this weekend, said an official who asked not to be identified because of the airport's policy.

This latest reverse added to the pressure on under-fire manager Mourinho.\n\n\"For many months people are asking for Martial,\" Mourinho told BT Sport about his choice of attackers. \"This week it was time to agree and to say let's give a chance to Martial and let's leave Alexis out.\"\n\nUnited, who kicked off eight points adrift of leaders Liverpool, were behind as early as the fifth minute at the London Stadium, when Anderson opened the scoring for West Ham.\n\nAnd they were 2-0 down before half-time when Andriy Yarmalenko's shot from inside the box deflected off Victor Lindelof for an own-goal.\n\nBarely 60 seconds after midfielder Paul Pogba - whose stand-off with Mourinho during a training session earlier this week featured heavily on social media - was substituted, United cut the deficit through Marcus Rashford's 71st-minute goal.\n\nBut hopes this might spark a major recovery by the visitors were soon dashed when Marko Arnautovic - who played under Mourinho at Inter Milan - restored the Hammers' two-goal lead three minutes later.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

An offside goal and an own goal.\"\n\nThe Portuguese boss added: \"The third goal killed our mentality because the referee did not see the foul before.\"\n\nNevertheless, Mourinho insisted: \"I have no complaints with the players' attitude. You have always to try, that's my nature as a football professional.\"\n\nHowever, former United defender Rio Ferdinand accused Mourinho's men of a lack of effort and said questions remained over the former Chelsea manager's future at Old Trafford.\n\n\"As a footballer your DNA is about hard work and effort,\" said Ferdinand, now a pundit with BT Sport.\n\n\"I didn't see that today,\" added the former England centre-half, who began his career at West Ham.\n\nAnd a concerned Ferdinand insisted: \"There are some big decisions to be made at United now. There will be conversations at the top level, about the future of the manager and the squad, because the basics are not being done. There has to be something said.\"\n\nVictory saw West Ham continue to climb the table after starting the season with four straight league defeats under new manager Manuel Pellegrini.\n\nArnautovic was in no doubt the Hammers had earned their victory.\n\n\"We have to do our job and we did it excellently, and that is why we deserved to win,\" he said.\n\nAs for Mourinho, Arnautovic added: \"I have nothing to say.

His verdict is due on Monday (Oct 1), and the prosecution has sought a three-year sentence.\n\nA HAEMORRHAGING ACADEMY\n\nThe academy has been deeply divided over how to deal with Arnault and on the reforms it needs to undertake.\n\nSome of the 18 members, who are appointed for life, have refused to participate in the academy's work over the row - including its first female permanent secretary Sara Danius - leaving it without a quorum.\n\nAnd in the months since the scandal erupted, the usually discreet members have exchanged ugly jibes in the media.\n\nParalysed and ridiculed around the world, the scandal forced the academy's hand: it announced in May that it would postpone by one year the 2018 Nobel Literature Prize, a first in 70 years.\n\nThe 2018 laureate will be announced at the same time as the 2019 prize.\n\n\"I could see that there were weaknesses in their organisation but I would never have thought something like this could happen,\" Lars Heikensten, director of the Nobel Foundation that finances the prizes, told AFP.\n\n\"We hope that they will be able to clear up their things.\" .\n\n'RIDICULOUS' AND 'CHAUVINIST'\n\nWith the academy in shambles and no literature prize to look forward to this year, a group of Swedish cultural figures decided to create their own award pending the Nobel's return next year.\n\nThe \"New Academy Prize in Literature\" was devised as a protest to denounce \"bias, arrogance and sexism\", and \"remind people that literature and culture at large should promote democracy, transparency, empathy and respect, without privilege\", according to the founders who include authors, artists and journalists.\n\nIt will be announced on Oct 12.\n\nThe Swedish Academy, a hermetic circle whose deliberations in Stockholm's cobblestoned Old Town whose deliberations are kept secret for 50 years, is seen as out of touch with reality and modern times.\n\n\"Lifetime membership and an ageing population also create a difficult situation, with some members still active at an age where they no longer have the capacity to work professionally, or understand how the academy is perceived by the public,\" Madelaine Levy, literary critic at daily Svenska Dagbladet, told AFP.\n\nThe public has lost confidence in the body, perceiving it as \"ridiculous\" and \"chauvinist\", she said.\n\n\"The academy needs reform, namely more transparency and stricter conflict of interest regulations.\"\n\nPublishers meanwhile fear the academy's crisis is far from over.\n\n\"I'm keeping my fingers crossed but as things are now I would say I am uncertain\" there will be a Nobel Literature Prize in 2019, Hakan Bravinger, an editor at Sweden's second-biggest publishing house Norstedts, told AFP.\n\nSee more on\n\nNobel Prize\n\nLiterature", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/nz-nobel-290919.jpg?VersionId=lf3LmSV5s4Q8NiKJtX0tbjdDf6zaihj2", "alt_text": null}]}

But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust.\"\n\nRi made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.\n\nThe minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: \"If the party to this issue of denuclearisation were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock.\"\n\nDIFFERENT TONE\n\nEven so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after \"Mr Evil President\" Trump called Kim a \"rocket man\" on a suicide mission.\n\nThis year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to \"totally destroy\" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearises.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying \"If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter.\"\n\nChina and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.\n\nHowever, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: \"Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearisation.\"\n\nThe Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\n\nPompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.\n\nPompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well. He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making \"gangster-like demands.\"\n\nNorth Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took \"corresponding measures.\"\n\nMoon told an event in New York on the sidelines of the UN meeting that declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War would encourage North Korea to move further with denuclearisation.\n\nHe said Kim had told him the \"corresponding measures\" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalisation of relations with Washington.\n\nSee more on\n\nNorth Korea\n\nNuclear weapons", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/un-assembly-diplomacy-153623.jpg?VersionId=Yf0CWMp6HPFNrZQC4bs0Jb.uQL0dcfda", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

So we had to use the data we had and make a call based on that,\" said Mr Rahmat Triyono, head of the earthquakes and tsunami centre at BMKG.\n\nHe said the closest tide gauge, which measures changes in sea level, recorded only an \"insignificant\" 6cm wave and did not account for the giant waves near Palu.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The most devastating came on Boxing Day in 2004, when a magnitude 9.5 quake triggered a massive tsunami that killed around 226,000 people along the shorelines of the Indian Ocean, including over 126,000 in Indonesia.\n\nThe scenic town of Palu sits at the mouth of a narrow bay in north-eastern Sulawesi and is home to around 380,000 people. It was hit by a tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to Indonesia's national disaster mitigation agency (BNPB).\n\nDr Baptiste Gombert, a geophysics researcher at University of Oxford, said it was \"surprising\" the quake had generated a tsunami.\n\nLast Friday's quake was recorded as a \"strike-slip\" event, where neighbouring tectonic plates move horizontally against each other, rather than vertically, which is what usually generates a tsunami.\n\n\"There is some speculation that there was a landslide under the sea which displaced a lot of water and caused the tsunami,\" Dr Gombert said, adding that the narrow bay may have concentrated the force of the waves as they moved toward the shore.\n\nMr Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency, told reporters his team had been \"preparing to send public warnings that were easy to understand\" when the tsunami warning was \"suddenly ended\".\n\nThe communications ministry said repeated warnings were sent out to residents via text message, but Mr Sutopo said the quake had brought down the area's power and communications lines and there were no sirens along the coast.\n\nIndonesians took to social media to question the BMKG's move to lift the tsunami warning and a failure to release information in a timely manner.\n\n\"So upset... the warning was lifted.. although a tsunami happened...\" said one Twitter user @zanoguccy in a direct message to BMKG.\n\nSee more on\n\nIndonesia\n\nEarthquakes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/07056396.jpg?VersionId=JZI11jCAER5inMT1h406UAs6U8m18XU9", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/topshots-topshot-indonesia-quake-tsunami-144407.jpg?VersionId=EsWmIVWRym84PcgD9F2wVUNdyobAkQnL", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/07056438.jpg?VersionId=DIDRUhZkhWIPzR6b4LSkEiWe5qJ0Mm4s", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The victim's chance of surviving decreases by around 7 per cent for every minute that passes, the Singapore Heart Foundation said in a press release.\n\nThe bystander response rate to such cardiac arrest cases currently stands at 54 per cent in Singapore, the foundation said. It hopes to increase the response rate with the CPR kiosks, which were launched in commemoration of National Heart Week/World Heart Day 2018.\n\nEach kiosk lets users try CPR by using their hands to perform chest compressions on a mannequin's torso. There are short, written instructions as well as an informational video. The mannequin's head lights up with the right depth and rate of chest compressions.\n\nIn hands-only CPR, the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in conventional CPR is eliminated.\n\n\"There's evidence that using hands alone is life-saving. (Some) people are not comfortable with mouth-to-mouth,\" said Professor Terrance Chua, chairman of the Singapore Heart Foundation.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

An AED, or automated external defibrillator, is a portable device to send an electric shock to the heart to try and restore its normal rhythm.\n\nThe eight CPR kiosks are located in \"high-traffic\" areas, such as universities and cinemas, and there are plans to put more at 13 other locations, Prof Chua said.\n\nThe kiosks are located at Chevron House, National Heart Centre Singapore, National Institute of Education (NIE), Northpoint City, Singapore Institute of Management, Singapore Institute of Technology, The Cathay Cineplex and Toa Payoh HDB Hub, where the launch was held on Saturday.\n\nMr Dhiyab Alsharki, 31, director of a company that sells yogurt, was among those who tried his hands at a kiosk yesterday (Sat).\n\n\"Within two minutes, I can have an understanding of CPR. Everyone should have this knowledge,\" he said.\n\nIn a speech at the launch, the guest-of-honour, Mr Amrin Amin, senior parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Health, noted that 17 people died every day last year (2017) from heart diseases and stroke, accounting for 30 per cent of all deaths in the year.\n\nMr Amrin, the member of parliament for Sembawang GRC, said: \"The risk factors leading to heart disease and stroke are well-studied and many of them such as obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor eating habits are preventable if we can make healthier choices in our daily lives.\"\n\nIn a survey, whose key findings were unveiled at the launch, the Singapore Heart Foundation found that some Singaporeans were reluctant to take steps to decrease their risk of heart disease.\n\nWhile eight out of 10 of those surveyed had a good knowledge of the disease, more than half of the respondents were unwilling to change their lifestyles or believed that they were not at risk of it.\n\nThis was in spite of the fact that the survey found that six out of 10 Singaporeans faced the risk of being overweight or obese, making them more at risk of heart disease and health problems. One out of three did not participate in any form of exercise or physical activity outside of their regular job.\n\nA thousand Singaporeans between the ages of 21 to 75 took part in the Singapore Heart Foundation survey.\n\nProf Chua noted that the survey also showed that only 37 per cent of respondents could identify diabetes as a risk factor for heart disease.\n\nThe Singapore Heart Foundation, together with Diabetes Singapore and pharmaceutical firm Boehringer Ingelheim have unveiled the For Your Sweetheart Singapore campaign to help raise awareness of the link between diabetes and heart disease.\n\nThe campaign's ambassadors are Left Profile artiste Michelle Chong and her father, Mr Steven Chong, also known as Papa Chong, who has been living with both condition for more than 30 years.\n\nMichelle Chong said: \"It was just after my A Levels when my father had his triple bypass surgery. My sister and I were pretty shaken up... At that time, we were not aware that diabetes and heart disease were closely linked. It is my hope that this campaign will help people with diabetes and their loved ones get the right support.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nDiabetes\n\nHeart/Cardiac diseases", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/colin-aa-29.jpg?VersionId=q4rgdyb12QeTmNyhTP0Qsh_86RvM_JM3", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

They confirmed the tsunami had hit Palu and Donggala with an estimated height of between a half metre and three metres,\" BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a media briefing on Saturday (Sept 29).\n\nDr Sutopo also said he expects a higher death toll not only from the worst affected regions of Donggala, about two hours north of Palu, but also from the yet-to-be-counted bodies of the victims who were swept by the second phase of tsunami that badly hit Palu bay.\n\nBNPB has yet to receive reports from rescuers deployed to Donggala, where communication lines have been cut off.\n\n\"Sea bed in Palu bay failed, caused by the strong quake, leading to an underwater landslide, according to experts,\" Dr Sutopo said, explaining that sand and silt carried in suspension in river water reached the seabed of Palu bay, deposited by sedimentation and buried.\n\nThis did not hold too strongly and triggered a landslide, Dr Sutopo elaborated.\n\nExperts concluded the above by analysing the fact that the water in the first tsunami that hit Palu bay was clear and was in small amplitude, but the second one was big and the water was very dark.\n\nDr Sutopo said electricity in many parts of Palu was also cut off and communications have not been restored.\n\nHe noted that areas hit by the tsunami in Donggala had a population in the thousands. Tsunami early warnings were issued, including to those regions, Dr Sutopo said.\n\nHowever, he reiterated that there has been no update from those regions as communication lines to Donggala had not been re-established\n\n\"Up to this morning (Saturday), we have not yet established contacts with the Central Sulawesi governor, Palu mayor, Donggala regent,\" Dr Sutopo said.\n\nThe land route from Poso to Palu, about a five-hour drive under normal conditions, was also cut off due to landslides, said Dr Sutopo.\n\nHe said that only two out of a total seven main electricity distribution boxes in Palu are working now.\n\nDr Sutopo said that aid and supplies were currently being brought using helicopters to Palu airport from Jakarta and Balikpapan, in east Kalimantan province.\n\nThe Communications and Information Ministry dispatched teams on Saturday morning with 30 satellite phones and equipment needed to set up a satellite Internet system to help revive flows of information from the regions affected by the quake and tsunami.\n\nAs of 5am, more than 500 mobile phone towers in quake-affected areas were not functioning because electricity had been cut off, the ministry said in a statement.\n\nMr Syamsul Huda, a Sulawesi-based business director with state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara, said his teams from around Palu are bringing in portable electricity generators and have started to comb the affected regions in Palu to identify the spots that are safe for them to reconnect power.\n\n\"Some spots affected by the tsunami should not yet be reconnected with power supply as it would pose risks of electrocution. In some cases, we have to fix the damaged installation first before reconnecting,\" Mr Syamsul told Metro TV.\n\nIndonesia sits on the Pacific's \"Ring of Fire\", making it vulnerable to earthquakes as well as volcanic eruptions.\n\nIn December 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that claimed 226,000 lives in 13 countries, including over 120,000 in Indonesia.\n\nSee more on\n\nNatural disasters\n\nIndonesia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/colin-e4-29.jpg?VersionId=ItldGqCLCGq29AM06kEdJBJY7AT.ZM_4", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/colin-e1-29.jpg?VersionId=MDe5Wo3YjbBQi7NGlJXxPFJjwStSOtOu", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/colin-e2-29.jpg?VersionId=iP8LDcY143RZ0KHKTf3NfoxEKljRYWSR", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/colin-e3-29.jpg?VersionId=KUHvxIyKgwyATZjzKtUUdLkNo8O39qg5", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/colin-e5-29.jpg?VersionId=apMZN2wkBOqY.hyNmcYlGV_tylfKqYlQ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/nz-quake-290921.jpg?VersionId=9HZritkSvPPX_Rh.A7NM3WaVJc_oY4rx", "alt_text": null}]}

StarHub will not be able to comment further prior to completing its efficiency exercise.\"\n\nLike its rivals in Singapore, StarHub, the second-largest telco here after Singtel, has been bracing itself for even fiercer competition when a fourth mobile network operator - Australia's TPG Telecom - is expected to start operations later this year in what most analysts described as an \"already crowded space\".\n\nStarHub is 55.8 per cent owned by Asia Mobile Holdings, a subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Telemedia. Japan's Nippon Telegraph & Telephone owns 9.9 per cent and BlackRock Fund Advisors 5 per cent. Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), which owns BT, has a 0.75 per cent interest.\n\nThe first hint of a possible staff cut was seen in the telco's fourth-quarter earnings. Staff costs rose by $11 million, or 15 per cent, to $84.7 million. These included \"provisions for certain staff benefits in order to rationalise and retain talent in recognition of the business challenges and operating conditions\".\n\nStarHub - which offers mobile, cable TV, broadband and fixed network services - was listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange in October 2004. It rose quickly within a year to overtake M1 to become Singapore's second-largest telco in the mobile space.\n\nWhen it started operations, Singapore's mobile penetration rate was 48 per cent. It has now more than tripled to 148 per cent.\n\nCurrently, StarHub has a 26.7 per cent share of the domestic mobile market, compared with 48.1 per cent for Singtel and 25.2 per cent for M1. StarHub's share prices have gained 19 per cent in the past month, touching $1.93 a share on Friday, before settling at $1.87 a share.\n\nJoel Ng, an analyst at KGI Securities Singapore, said Keppel Corp's and SPH's offer to buy M1 could be a re-rating catalyst for the telecom sector. The two plan to offer $2.06 a share for the M1 shares they don't own.\n\n\"Overall, we believe that as the telcos accelerate their digital transformations and leverage partnerships with strategic shareholders, valuations may see an upward re-rating over the next few quarters,\" he noted.\n\nAnalysts said Mr Kaliaropoulos, who took over as StarHub's CEO on July 9, 2018, believes digitalisation of enterprises is an external revenue opportunity and a means to improve marketing and cost control internally.\n\nMobile virtual network operator models on average, according to him, do not last beyond a few years as incumbents make adjustments to business structures and marketing plans.\n\n\"There is a possibility of industry consolidation two to three years out,\" said Luis Hilado, analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Research, which has a \"buy\" call on StarHub. UOB Kay Hian, too, has a \"buy\" on StarHub, with a target price of $1.92 a share.\n\n\"Execution has improved since Peter Kaliaropoulos took over as CEO on July 9.

Trump granted the request.\n\nFlake's action came a day after the committee's jarring and emotional hearing into the allegations against Kavanaugh that gripped the country, with a university professor named Christine Blasey Ford accusing him of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when both were high schools students in Maryland.

Eligible groups include those under the People's Association and the community development councils, as well as organised groups from all pre-schools, government schools and government-aided schools.\n\nCyclists and personal mobility device (PMD) users will also enjoy free island admission, allowing them to explore the island's network of on-road and off-road cycling trails. This is in line with the push towards a car-lite Singapore, the SDC said. Cyclists and PMD users are reminded to comply with the Active Mobility Act, which applies to public paths in Sentosa, it added.\n\nSenior citizens, persons with disabilities and other TransitLink concession card holders will also have their entry fees halved or waived.\n\nThe SDC said the admission fee changes will be implemented for an initial period of two years.\n\nAlready, those who enter Sentosa via the boardwalk or on SBS Transit bus service 123 enjoy an admission fee waiver. Bus commuters need to pay only the prevailing distance-based bus fare.\n\nSDC assistant chief executive Chin Sak Hin said: \"We are constantly looking for ways to deepen our engagement with the local community and we believe these island admission fee revisions will be positively received by Singaporeans.\"\n\nCurrently, those entering Sentosa via coach need to pay an admission charge of $2. The admission charge for cyclists was also $2.\n\nSentosa has hosted a series of free events, such as MegaFun and Sandsation, in the past few months, Mr Chin said. The island will continue to offer guests a unique line-up of events this year, including one featuring Instagram-worthy light-ups, he added.\n\nTo enjoy the waiver, community and school group organisers are required to pre-register their visits by writing in to\n\neducation@sentosa.com.sg\n\nThe public can visit\n\nwww.sentosa.com.sg\n\nfor more information.\n\nSee more on\n\nSentosa\n\nTourist attractions", "images": []}

He sent it to Allscripts' rival, Epic Systems.\n\nThis supposed coding flaw could allow hackers to \"gain admin control of the whole database easily\", he wrote. Even medical students, nurses and pharmacists could have such access, Mr Zhao alleged.\n\nYesterday, the COI scrutinised the actions Mr Zhao took, his dismissal on the same day that then IHiS chief executive officer Chong Yoke Sin found out about the e-mail, and why his superiors did not take action on the supposed \"loophole\" found.\n\nIHiS is an agency formed in 2008 to manage the IT systems of all public healthcare institutions here.\n\nSolicitor-General Kwek Mean Luck said on Friday last week that the failure to plug the alleged security hole could have contributed to June's cyber attack on SingHealth.\n\nHackers gained access to SingHealth's EMR system and transferred information from June 27 to July 4. The breach compromised the personal data of 1.5 million patients and the outpatient prescription information of 160,000 people, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and several ministers.\n\nBut during yesterday's hearing, IHiS staff revealed they did not think much about the \"loophole\". Therefore, they did not investigate if it was indeed true. Instead, they focused on disciplining Mr Zhao.\n\nDr Chong, who left IHiS in 2016 and is now StarHub's chief of enterprise business group, said she had considered Mr Zhao's action to be \"primarily a disciplinary issue, and not an IT security issue\", and that she had an impression that his motive for disclosing the discovery to Epic was for personal gain.\n\nShe also did not know the details of the alleged loophole. Neither did she ask her staff for it to be verified. She also assumed that the problem would be rendered \"irrelevant\" as IHiS had just upgraded the EMR system architecture. She received the \"loophole\" e-mail from Allscripts, which had got it from Epic Systems, on Sept 18, 2014.\n\nIn the e-mail, Allscripts Asia Pacific chief executive David Chambers wrote that what Mr Zhao flagged was \"very serious\" and must be taken as \"genuine\", as the latter had worked for Allscripts in its development laboratory. On the same day, Dr Chong forwarded the e-mail to Mr Clarence Kua, who works for IHiS and is assigned to SingHealth as its deputy director (chief information officer's office).\n\nYesterday, COI chairman Richard Magnus and deputy senior state counsel Sarah Shi took turns to ask why Mr Kua did not take the initiative to check what the alleged security flaw was. Mr Kua repeatedly replied that he did only what he was asked to by Dr Chong. \"My focus was to double-check the private e-mail address of Mr Zhao to verify that he was the person who had sent the e-mail to Epic,\" he said.\n\nMr Zhao's accounts with IHiS and SingHealth were terminated on Sept 18, 2014 - the day Dr Chong received the \"loophole\" e-mail. Mr Zhao was dismissed and escorted out of the office on the same day.\n\nYesterday, IHiS' lawyer, Senior Counsel Philip Jeyaretnam, said Mr Zhao - who testified during a private hearing on Thursday - had confessed he was \"angry\" with IHiS and Allscripts over not being allowed to do coding. He said that as a result, Mr Zhao would not have shared details of the flaw with IHiS to help the organisation.\n\nDr Chong supported the character assessment, saying Mr Zhao had \"a history of poor work performance\", citing information received at that time from human resources.\n\nBut Mr Zhao's supervisor, Ms Angela Chen, testified yesterday that he had a good relationship with his colleagues, and was a \"very good worker\" and \"technically strong\".\n\nDr Chong, who was involved in the formation of IHiS as its first chief executive officer, said she was involved in evaluating the EMR system from its supplier Allscripts. She did so along with cluster leaders as well as SingHealth's then deputy chief executive Karen Koh.\n\nDr Chong said the EMR system - which was adopted around the time she became chief executive in April 2008 - was chosen because of its functionality, and the main focus at that time was not on its security.\n\nShe cited other factors like resilience, though she added that a balance needed to be struck between functionality and security. The inquiry continues on Monday.\n\nCorrection note:\n\nAn earlier version of the report stated that Dr Chong Yoke Sin said she was involved in evaluating the EMR system from supplier Allscripts with cluster leaders as well as SingHealth's then deputy chief executive Ivy Ng. SingHealth has clarified that SingHealth's then deputy chief executive was Ms Karen Koh.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingHealth COI\n\nCyber security\n\nSingapore health", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/hzsinghealth0928.jpg?VersionId=EeKeH9ymtDry9WqZ4_uV3YD35YcSrGrq", "alt_text": null}]}

The value of the transaction - which is expected to be completed by the year end, subject to regulatory approvals - has not been disclosed.\n\nNTUC Enterprise is the holding entity and single largest shareholder of NTUC Social Enterprises, which includes NTUC Foodfare. NTUC Foodfare manages 14 foodcourts, 10 coffee shops and nine hawker centres.\n\nThe firms said NTUC Foodfare and Kopitiam will continue to operate separately, while making quality cooked food affordable and accessible to all.\n\nThe CCCS said in a statement yesterday that it is assessing whether the proposed deal would infringe the Competition Act, which prohibits mergers that have resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market in Singapore. It is not known how much market share the two firms have.\n\nIn its notification, NTUC Enterprise made the case that it overlaps with Kopitiam in two markets: the sale of cooked food to individual consumers in quick-service eateries, and the rental of stalls to vendors located within coffee shops, foodcourts and hawker centres.\n\nIt argued that the proposed acquisition would not give rise to anti-competitive consequences in either market, given the numerous cooked food vendors in quick-service eateries as well as strong competition from other operators.\n\nCustomers in both markets would have little issue switching to competitors, as individual consumers often have their pick of foodcourts, hawker centres and coffee shops within walking distance, while food vendors are \"generally indifferent to stall location so long as the rental terms are competitive and there is sufficient consumer traffic\", NTUC Enterprise said.\n\nThe proposed acquisition would allow NTUC Enterprise, via Foodfare and Kopitiam, to create a more efficient business through economies of scale, it said.\n\nCost savings could be used to offer tenants better rental terms, as well as to invest in new technologies and in-store practices that will benefit both vendors and consumers, NTUC Enterprise said.\n\nMs Esther Ho, director of Nanyang Polytechnic's School of Business Management, said NTUC Foodfare would become a \"more significant competitor\" if the acquisition goes through.\n\nThe cooperative would benefit from its stronger bargaining power and higher market share, which may make it easier for it to outbid competitors.\n\n\"There is also this concern that with its strong bargaining power, small suppliers that supply raw ingredients and provide services to Foodfare may find their margins thinning,\" she said. Still, being able to leverage more efficiencies may mean cost savings can be passed on to consumers, she added.\n\nMembers of the public can provide feedback on the matter between Oct 1 and Oct 12 through the CCCS website.\n\nSee more on\n\nCompetition laws\n\nNTUC\n\nFood and beverage sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/yq-kopitiam-28092018.jpg?VersionId=NXcH4q0YjCY5g5Zk.pTvijSnKxo14lQD", "alt_text": null}]}

No cause of death was immediately available.\n\nPHOTO: REUTERS\n\nFollow topic:\n\nMusic\n\nPublished\n\nSep 29, 2018, 07:23 PM\n\nFLORIDA (THE NEW YORK TIMES) - Marty Balin, a founder, lead singer and songwriter of the groundbreaking San Francisco psychedelic band Jefferson Airplane and a key member of that band's 1970s successor, Jefferson Starship, died on Thursday (Sept 27) in Tampa, Florida, where he lived.\n\nHe was 76. His death was announced by his wife Susan Joy Balin.\n\nA representative, Ryan Romanesco, said Balin had died en route to a hospital. No cause of death was immediately available.\n\nBalin was a prime mover in the flowering of psychedelic rock in mid-1960s San Francisco, not only as a founding member of Jefferson Airplane in 1965 but also as an original owner of the Matrix, a club that opened that year and also nurtured bands and artists like the Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Santana and Steppenwolf.\n\nBalin's voice could offer the intimate solace of ballads like Jefferson Airplane's Today, the siren wails of a frantic acid-rocker like the group's Plastic Fantastic Lover, or the soul-pop entreaties of Jefferson Starship's Miracles.\n\nJefferson Airplane would earn its place in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with music that was the epitome of 1960s psychedelia: a molten, improvisatory mixture of folk, rock, blues, jazz, R&B, ragas and more, sometimes adopting pop-song structures and sometimes exploding them.\n\nThe songs were about love, freedom, altered perception, rebellion and possibilities that could be transcendent or apocalyptic. Jefferson Airplane was a staple at the Fillmore in San Francisco and the Fillmore East in New York City, and it performed at 1960s milestones including the Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967 and both the Woodstock and Altamont festivals in 1969.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But it also led to increasing friction within the band; Slick was often singled out for attention, and she sang lead on White Rabbit and Somebody To Love, the 1967 hits that made the band national headliners.\n\n\"I always let everybody else take the credit,\" Balin told High Times magazine in 2000. \"Grace was the most beautiful girl in rock at the time, so they gave her credit for everything.\" In the documentary film Monterey Pop, when Balin sings his ballad Today, the camera shows Slick instead, who was mouthing the words with him. Balin quit Jefferson Airplane in 1971.\n\nYet he never entirely left behind his Jefferson Airplane bandmates. Jefferson Starship, a band formed by Kantner with Slick, featured Balin as a guest in 1974 and reached its commercial peak when he became a full member in 1975; he wrote and sang Jefferson Starship's biggest hit, Miracles. Jefferson Starship evolved into the hit-making 1980s band Starship without Balin.\n\nSoon after leaving Jefferson Starship, an exhausted Balin turned down an offer to become lead singer of a new San Francisco band: Journey. Instead, he went on to a solo career in the 1980s, beginning with the 1981 album Balin.\n\nIn 1987, Balin joined Kantner and Jefferson Airplane's bassist Jack Casady to make an album as the KBC Band. He also reunited with Slick, Kantner, Kaukonen and Casady to tour and record as Jefferson Airplane in 1989. \"We went out and did 36 shows, and I thought we were dynamite,\" he told High Times.\n\n\"At the end, we finished, and everyone said, 'This was great,' then split apart. Everybody went home. Nobody calls anybody, nobody says anything. Same old band.\"\n\nBalin sang with a new iteration of Jefferson Starship, which did not include Slick, from 1993 to 2003, and he occasionally worked with that band's shifting line-up in later years. But he also continued to record and perform regularly with his own band, and late in 2015 - 50 years after Jefferson Airplane began - he released Good Memories, new versions of songs from the Airplane catalogue.\n\nIn addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Jennifer Edwards and Delaney Balin, and two stepdaughters, Rebekah Geier and Moriah Geier.\n\nIn 2016, the year Jefferson Airplane received a Grammy lifetime achievement award, Balin told Relix magazine that he was happy leading his own acoustic band.\n\n\"People want to hear me sing, and now that's what I'm doing; I'm just singing. The whole night is me - and if you dig it, cool,\" he said. \"Let's get to the music, man. That's what I'm doing - just flying along.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMusic\n\nCelebrities", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/colin-mb-29.jpg?VersionId=gi97ALjjO6BM1sRY5xTHkOZX.KeHRWuv", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

There are between 120 and 180 eggs in each nest.\n\nBy chance, 16 hawksbill turtles hatched at the facility on the morning of the launch. They were later released into the sea.\n\nThe hatchery comprises two sections: An incubation sand pit area, where trained volunteers and staff take care of eggs as they incubate, and a turtle field station that provides volunteer training, educational and research programmes, and other hatchery-related activities.\n\nNParks said the facility is located on Small Sister's Island because it sits between East Coast Park and\n\nthe other Southern Islands\n\n, the two areas where most turtle nesting activities have been recorded since 2005.\n\nStaff and volunteers will transport eggs found across Singapore to the incubation sandpit if their original sites are not suitable, said Dr Tun, who is the director for coastal and marine at the National Biodiversity Centre.\n\nAt other sites, turtles may lay their nests in places with high human footfall that could threaten the eggs.\n\nThe nesting site at the hatchery uses high-tech systems such as a Bluetooth water level detector that can tell if seawater is entering the nests; a temperature sensor; and a motion trigger camera that can tell when the turtles are emerging from the sand.\n\nThe incubation area consists of three metal cages that protect the eggs from predators, and they can hold up to four nests each.\n\nA hawksbill turtle, which laid 99 eggs on Sept 2 on a Sisters' Island beach, has had its nest relocated to one of the cages. The eggs are due to hatch around Oct 26.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the hatchery, Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said: \"Aside from already being a popular nesting spot, Small Sister's Island is a protected area within the Sisters' Island Marine Park that is zoned for conservation and research.\n\n\"This limits the disturbance to the nests caused by human traffic and light pollution. It also helps to maximise the number of hatchlings that are able to make it out to sea.\"\n\nSingapore is home to two species of turtles, both of which are at high risk of extinction.\n\nThe hawksbill turtle, which is most commonly seen around the Republic's coasts, is critically endangered. The green turtle, which is much less encountered, is endangered.\n\nNParks already monitors the various nests around the country, such as the one where the eggs had hatched on Pulau Satumu last Tuesday (Sept 25), but it said the public will be able to learn how to take care of these nests and eggs at the hatchery through a volunteer training programme.\n\nCalled the Biodiversity Beach Patrol, it will teach participants how to protect nesting turtles and how to move eggs safely, for instance.\n\nVolunteer Lisa Lim was at the hatchery's launch on Saturday and preparing the baby turtles for their maiden journey into the sea.\n\n\"Many people don't think that Singapore has sea turtles, but volunteering gives you the chance to see them and really understand what we have,\" said the science teacher, who volunteers weekly.\n\n\"This hatchery gives us the chance to share why we need to conserve turtles, why they're so vulnerable and how we can sustain their population,\" said Ms Lim, 48.\n\nNParks will announce new training dates by the end of 2018, but those interested in the Biodiversity Beach Patrol can read more\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nSee more on\n\nNational Parks Board\n\nDesmond Lee", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/photo6159084687486724137.jpg?VersionId=DPgd4E3BABtfWjqrVevEtTxcM7sVuYbN", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/photo6158923527428876282.jpg?VersionId=1kcDX0lJXbRfRzTfHbG.qK53pDfxAkY.", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/photo6158923527428876283.jpg?VersionId=_fd9C3EGn8Je4aiSnuavBUvx_xonmhWk", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/photo6158923527428876285.jpg?VersionId=wRbH93YGtRADx_HUsoNjo0fnLKc0GYpD", "alt_text": null}]}

It is important that we know where our children stand.\"\n\nMadam Karen Lim, 41, who works in the banking sector and has two children in primary school, said: \"Even if the school doesn't tell us, I am sure teachers will know who the stronger students are, and if mindsets don't change, students will keep comparing between themselves.\"\n\nIn an address to about 1,700 school leaders earlier this week, Mr Ong said: \"I know that coming in first or second, in class or level, has traditionally been a proud recognition of a student's achievement. But removing these indicators is for a good reason, so that the child understands from a young age that learning is not a competition, but a self-discipline you need to master for life.\n\n\"Notwithstanding, the report book should still contain some form of yardstick and information to allow students to judge their relative performance, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.\"\n\nOther information to be dropped from report books will be students' L1R5 or L1R4 scores - which are based on results of subjects. These will not be reflected for the lower secondary levels.\n\nFailing marks will also not be coloured or underlined, and a student's final pass or fail result will not be shown.\n\nMarks for each subject will be kept, but rounded off and presented as whole numbers, without decimal points - to reduce the focus on academic scores.\n\nOther aspects like conduct, form teacher comments, physical fitness records, school attendance and community and co-curricular activity involvement will be retained.\n\nNational Institute of Education don Jason Tan said the changes to the report books are in line with MOE's shift in policy rhetoric - to move away from being \"extrinsically motivated\" to do well to having a genuine interest in learning.\n\n\"With fewer exams, schools will have to develop other ways of informing parents about their children's progress and give them a more detailed picture of their learning experiences, besides cursory remarks from teachers about examination results and personal conduct.\"\n\nParent Lim Wee Ming, who has three children in primary and secondary schools, believes the changes will reduce stress among school-going kids.\n\n\"Not knowing your class or cohort position is good.

These projects by national water agency PUB cost $227 million and took more than two million man-hours across four years of construction.\n\nThe Stamford Diversion Canal (SDC) and Stamford Detention Tank (SDT) aim to ensure that should the same intensity of rain happen again over the Stamford Catchment area as it did in June 2010, June 2011 and December 2011, Orchard Road would not flood.\n\nThe two new drainage projects will ease the load on Stamford Canal, which is 4.7km long and runs from Tanglin to Marina Reservoir, by about 30 per cent.\n\nThe 2km-long SDC will divert excess rainwater from Holland Road, Napier Road and Grange Road - which are in the upstream section of Stamford Catchment - into the nearby Singapore River, which then merges with Marina Reservoir farther on.\n\nPUB chief executive Ng Joo Hee said: \"The same rain that led to the Orchard Road floods eight years ago should not threaten our famous shopping street again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Building bigger and bigger drains to deal with more and more intense rain is not a good method. The SDT and SDC are better ways. By detaining, delaying and diverting storm run-off before it can do serious harm, the SDT and SDC offer long-term flood protection for Orchard Road.\"\n\nThe principal engineer of PUB's catchment and waterways department, Mr James Koh, said the point at which the SDC joins Stamford Canal is now blocked off, preventing rainwater run-off from these upstream areas from flowing towards Orchard Road.\n\nDuring heavy rainfall, the detention tank will be able to store excess water from the drains. Its capacity is 38,000 cubic m, or 15 Olympic-sized swimming pools. It will take around four hours to completely empty the tank when it is full.\n\nWhen the rain stops and sensors detect that the drains are less than 25 per cent filled, the water from the tank will be pumped back and released.\n\nOrchard Road Business Association executive director Steven Goh said they welcomed the two projects \"very, very much\". \"There was some inconvenience during the eight-year planning and construction, such as taking two minutes longer to get from one building to another due to traffic diversions, but all of our stakeholders were supportive because they understood why this project was being done.\"\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the two drainage projects, Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli said one of the key challenges was minimising disruption to users of the Orchard Road area.\n\n\"PUB engineers had to exercise great care to protect the structural integrity of nearby buildings and roads,\" he said, adding: \"Throughout the four years of construction, motorists remained unaware that they were driving on top of major tunnelling works, as the roads above remained open and safe to use.\"\n\nMr Masagos said: \"The Government has invested $1.2 billion in drainage improvement works since 2012, and will spend another $500 million in the next two to three years... We have to prioritise our investments and look for cost-effective and practical solutions to meet our needs. The SDT and SDC are key outcomes of (this) pragmatic approach.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nPUB\n\nMasagos Zulkifli\n\nFloods\n\nOrchard Road", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/ST_20180929_VNCANAL1_4312072.jpg?VersionId=qwF61RtoXdzLw2tueZvrt49fQmmDSii4", "alt_text": "The interior of the Stamford Detention Tank, which lies 30m beneath the Botanic Gardens.

These were announced by owner CapitaLand Mall Trust yesterday at a ceremony to mark the structural completion of the mall in North Bridge Road.\n\nFinance Minister Heng Swee Keat said at the event that the new Funan mall will be Singapore's first \"online and offline mall\", powered by sensors, data analytics and facial recognition tools to better understand consumer shopping habits.\n\nIt will be the first mall here to use technology such as a smart directory that uses facial recognition to provide shoppers with customised recommendations, said CapitaLand.\n\nThe mall will have a touch screen directory, equipped with a camera, that can scan the faces of shoppers to sort them into general profiles such as young female and senior male, and recommend stores that target that demographic.\n\nThe facial recognition function of the directory, which will also be rolled out to other CapitaLand malls, does not capture or store personal data, CapitaLand Retail's chief executive Wilson Tan told The Straits Times yesterday.\n\nThe new six-storey Funan mall will utilise video analytics to study shopper traffic and crowd density, which will help CapitaLand to adjust tenant mix and placement.\n\nShoppers will be able to search for their cars in the carpark by using a video system that can scan licence plates. They can also collect items purchased online at a 24-hour drive-through by flashing a QR code on their phones in front of a scanner for a robotic arm to retrieve the items for them.\n\nThe former Funan DigitaLife Mall, which closed in July 2016 and was originally scheduled to reopen by the third quarter of next year, has been undergoing a $560 million transformation into an integrated development centred on lifestyle, technology and the arts.\n\nAbout 70 per cent of Funan's retail space has been leased to tenants such as Golden Village, FairPrice Finest and theatre company Wild Rice. New tenants announced yesterday include foldable bike brand Brompton Bicycle, which will be opening its flagship Singapore store, a farm-to-table restaurant concept by Spa Esprit Group and gaming store GamePro, which will host e-gaming tournaments in a dedicated eSports zone in the mall.\n\nElaborating on the use of facial recognition technology, Mr Tan said CapitaStar loyalty programme members may in the future opt to have their faces scanned to receive personal recommendations based on their purchase history.\n\n\"The idea is that a retailer has a digital screen or wall that can recognise I am a CapitaStar member and have been a previous customer of that store, and the screen will be customised for me,\" said Mr Tan. Other plans for the CapitaStar programme, which has about 920,000 members, include having data captured from receipts provided to members as insights into their spending patterns, he said.\n\nMr Tan added that facial recognition technology may also be used for entry at Funan's office complex as well as lyf Funan.\n\nSee more on\n\nShopping\n\nRetail", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/st_20180929_tffunan_4312527.jpg?VersionId=kyzL0J7XFwLs.JrESomQWvL0h0E3QAXV", "alt_text": null}]}

More than half were about professional negligence or incompetence.\n\nA complaint is typically looked into by a three-member complaints committee, which decides whether the matter should be escalated to a disciplinary tribunal. The entire process can take years, especially if either party makes an appeal.\n\nOne of the nine proposed amendments suggests that doctors with the necessary experience and expertise can be drawn from a complaints panel to chair complaints committees. Currently, only the 25 SMC council members are allowed to fulfil this role.\n\nChanging the way this works would result in \"better efficiency and timeliness\" when resolving cases, the SMC and Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a joint statement yesterday.\n\nAnother change will see the formation of a new committee to develop sentencing guidelines and the removal of the minimum suspension period of three months.\n\nAt present, sentences are based on precedent. But disciplinary tribunals have said that this makes it difficult to decide on appropriate sentences.\n\nThe changes put forward are meant to ensure \"consistency and fairness\" in sentences meted out, and also to allow \"greater flexibility\" in determining the appropriate penalty.\n\nA third change to improve transparency and accountability proposes that appeals against complaints committee decisions be made to an independent appeals committee instead of the health minister, which is currently the case.\n\nThis committee will comprise a medical doctor, a legal professional and a \"distinguished lay person\" - such as an academic or a professional from a different field.\n\nAnyone wanting to know more about the proposed amendments and give their feedback can view the draft Bill on the Reach website or at www.moh.gov.sg/e-consultation/ mra_amendments\n\nFeedback should be e-mailed, by 6pm on Oct 26, to:\n\nmra_public_ consult@moh.gov.sg\n\nSEE\n\nLots of sleepless nights for doc who's cleared only 6 years later\n\nSee more on\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nDoctors/Surgeons", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/colin-ds-28.jpg?VersionId=jzDuL5kJ5B9qoCXK4ZJMRjgxBPeZ1KM.", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

In April, the 50-year-old had his application rejected after he reportedly had insufficient documents in his filing for candidacy in the Bayan Baru federal seat and Batu Uban state seat.\n\nThe nomination process kicked off at 9am on Saturday (Sept 29) in the army town with crowds gathering to support the various candidates despite the sweltering heat.\n\nSome of the supporters arrived as early as 6am, sporting headgear and clothes bearing the logos of their respective parties.\n\nMs Devamalar Arumugam, a self-proclaimed hardcore supporter of Datuk Seri Anwar, said she woke up at 4am to drive to Port Dickson to show her support.\n\nClad in a tailor-made sari made of 14 flags of the Pakatan Harapan ruling coalition, the 45-year-old from Puchong expressed her hopes for Mr Anwar's victory.\n\n\"I'm confident that he will win.

Anwar needs to fire Malaysians' imagination - not just the local voters - on what changes he can bring,\" he said.\n\n\"He did that with the 2008 Permatang Pauh by-election. But this time, the game is trickier, he needs to appear visionary, statesman-like (not defensive) without looking that he may make Mahathir a lame duck.

These include recalibrating the balance between academic rigour and a love of learning. This is an edited excerpt from his speech to heads of schools at the annual Schools Work Plan Seminar on Monday (Sept 24).\n\nFind out what\u2019s new on\n\nST website and app.\n\nFollow topic:\n\nEducation and schools\n\nPublished\n\nSep 29, 2018, 05:00 AM\n\nChange is a constant in education. Change is a constant in life. We do not change for change's sake. As we change, we are careful to retain the core strengths of our system to deliver students sound values and strong fundamentals in numeracy, literacy, and critical soft skills. The system is already well developed and I don't think we are in the building-up phase anymore. However, as it becomes more complex, we need to be clear-eyed that in this matured system, there are trade-offs within the system, and we must take sufficient bold steps to rebalance those trade-offs when needed.\n\nIn my speech at the Economic Society of Singapore, I stated four such trade-offs.\n\nFirst, the balance between rigour and joy - how much robustness we want in the system and hard work we require from students, versus making learning fun and nurturing the joy of learning in our students. And we know that many of us realise education in schools is at risk of becoming too stressful and maybe some unwinding is in order.\n\nSecond, sharpening versus blurring of academic differentiation - how finely differentiated we want examination results to be as a tool for placement and admission, versus blunting the distinction of results between students so that we can gauge learning outcomes without encouraging an overly competitive culture in our schools.\n\nThird trade-off, customisation versus stigmatisation - how our curriculum caters to students of different learning paces and learning needs, versus inadvertently stigmatising certain groups of students who are less academically inclined. Fourth, skills versus paper qualifications - the importance of attaining credentials such as Nitec certificates, diplomas or degrees, versus acquiring skills that make a person effective at the job.\n\nThe next phase of change in education will involve re-balancing these trade-offs effectively, decisively, and many initiatives are already under way.\n\nIn 1997, we developed the \"Thinking Schools, Learning Nation\" vision, to strengthen thinking and inquiry among students. During this earlier phase of change, we reduced curriculum content by about 30 per cent, enhanced teacher training and encouraged the sharing of best practices and ideas across schools.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Our aim was to help teachers better engage students and develop their critical faculties through real-life learning experiences. Curriculum then was further reduced by 20 per cent, to create time and space for more active and independent learning.\n\n\"Thinking Schools, Learning Nation\" was framed from a national and systemic perspective; \"Teach Less, Learn More\", from the teacher's perspective. Both remain relevant and important, but to help our students meet the challenges of an uncertain, fluid future, we must remember they are the ones that will face the future. We need to usher in a new phase of change - one that is framed based on the students' perspective.\n\nLEARN FOR LIFE - THE NEXT PHASE\n\nI call this phase of change - \"Learn for Life\".\"Learn for Life\" is a value, an attitude and a skill that our students need to possess. It also has to be a principal consideration in our school system.\n\nWhy has this become so important? In the past, Singapore attracted multinational corporations (MNCs) to set up factories and offices here. We were the world's leading producer of disk drives. We knew what kind of talent those MNCs needed, and we teach, we educate and we prepare our students well to fill up those defined job roles.\n\nToday, the MNCs are putting their innovation hubs and R&D centres here. Start-ups are sprouting all over, hoping to come up with the next big thing. We are witnessing the advent of \"lights-out manufacturing\", where entire factories are automated. You step into it and you don't see anything, but in the background, you have personnel with different skill sets to design the system and ensure it hums along.\n\nToday, you can check in and board the aircraft in Changi Airport Terminal 4 without interfacing with a single human, and that has totally redefined what a customer officer is supposed to do. These innovation centres, start-ups and automated environments are creating the jobs of tomorrow. We have some ideas but not definitive ideas of what these jobs will be; what are these jobs that our students are going to take up.\n\nWhat we do know, however, is the shape of things to come. We know that our students need to be resilient, adaptable and global in their outlook. They must leave the education system still feeling curious and eager to learn, for the rest of their lives. These traits are not just adjectives that we tick off, one by one. It is a fundamental shift in our mindset.\n\nI came across a recent article about how the author of the article, who is a middle-aged man, was trying to learn coding. I thought it explained the concept of lifelong learning quite well. It is really not about searching for the next course to attend and trying to use up the $500 SkillsFuture Credit.\n\nInstead, it is about getting used to a state of discomfort. His key takeaway was not the technical coding skills that he picked up, but getting used to the feeling of constantly being inadequate.\n\nSo in the article, he described what a coding coach told him: \"You need to get used to the idea of being out of depth all the time. You do not solve the same problem twice. You solve one and the next level is even more challenging and once again you feel inadequate. But there is a global coding fraternity that you must learn how to tap, and then you learn from one another, from that network.\"\n\nI see this attitude among many elderly learners, who are obviously lifelong learners. Many do not know English well, and are not IT-literate. But they are motivated to learn to use the computer, the apps on their smartphones, and embrace e-payment to minimise their trips to the ATMs. It is uncomfortable for them, but I see the determination among these members of the Pioneer and Merdeka generations.\n\nOnce we recognise this broader objective of education, examination and grades are comparatively small milestones in the life journey of a child. The ability to score in an examination frankly may not matter very much later on in the life of a child.\n\nBALANCE BETWEEN RIGOUR AND JOY\n\nWe know that students derive more joy in learning when they move away from memorisation, rote learning, drilling and taking high-stakes exams. Very few students enjoy that.\n\nIt is not to say that these are undesirable in learning; quite the contrary, they help form the building blocks for more advanced concepts and learning, and can inculcate discipline and resilience. But there needs to be a balance between rigour and joy, and there is a fairly strong consensus that we have tilted too much to the former. Our students will benefit when some of their time and energy devoted to drilling and preparing for examinations is instead allocated to preparing them for what matters to their future.\n\nIn doing so, we have a few considerations. First, there is little room for further cuts in curriculum. We have already done two significant rounds of reduction, in 1998 and then in 2005. Further reduction will risk under-teaching. What we should focus on is to curb effort inflation and review our assessment load and tuition load - both of which add to the repetitive and unnecessary effort of studying the same, or even less material, for the sake of scoring well in examinations.\n\nSecond,\n\nwhatever time we may free up for the students\n\n, we must avoid the tendency to fill it up with extra practice and drills. Instead, treat this as curriculum time that we return to the schools, return to the principals and teachers, for better teaching and learning.\n\nTHE YUTORI CHALLENGE\n\nFinally, we must be careful not to overdo the correction, and inadvertently undermine the rigour in our system. Japan offers us a very useful experience that we can learn from. In the 1990s, they implemented in their school system an initiative called Yutori. For those who know Japanese, Yutori means \"relax\".\n\nThe objective was to reduce rote learning and memory work, and redirect students to learning creativity and soft skills. But the move backfired - as Pisa (Programme for International Student Assessment) scores of Japanese students deteriorated, parents' anxieties went up, and students started to worry that they can't do well in the university entrance examinations. Hence the Yutori policy had to be unwound, and five years later, the government had to increase the curriculum content back and teaching hours back again.\n\nWhile well intentioned, Yutori's objective was ahead of its time, and its implementation, not helped by a rather inappropriate name, was perceived as too drastic a move.\n\nWe can learn from Japan's experience. It is an instructive example, demonstrating the challenge we might face as we recalibrate the balance between joy and rigour within our system.\n\nREDUCTION OF ASSESSMENT LOAD\n\nGiven these considerations, we decided to take the approach of reducing school-based assessment.\n\nWe have succeeded in doing this before. MOE removed mid-year examinations and year-end examinations in P1 from 2010. For P2 students, we further removed the mid-year examinations.\n\nAs a result, we reduced the stress for lower primary students. Today, everyone - teachers, students, parents - have got used to not having to worry about examinations in P1 and for most of P2. Academic results and rigour have not been affected. We will build on this good work. We know that teaching and learning comprises three important components - curricular goals and content, pedagogy and assessment, and together they form a strong triangle. Today, the three components are not balanced. As we overemphasised assessment, we inadvertently reduced the time available for schools to focus on teaching and learning. We will therefore make another significant move, and reduce school-based assessment load by 25 per cent in each of the two-year blocks in primary and secondary schools.\n\nWe will remove all weighted assessments for P1 and P2 students. This means that in addition to what had been removed, we will further remove year-end examinations for P2. Schools will also not count any assessments towards an overall score for P1 and P2.\n\nWe need to recognise that students go through different stages of learning: from lower to middle to upper primary, and then to lower secondary and eventually, upper secondary. Each stage requires a significant transition and pupils need an adequate runway to adapt to the new demands.\n\nTo help students build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn during the transition, we should be less hasty in testing and examining students during these critical years. Hence, we will also remove the mid-year examinations at P3, P5, S1 and S3.\n\nSchools and parents need not worry about the pace of change being fast. We will implement these changes in stages.\n\nIn 2019, we will remove all weighted assessments in P1 and P2, as well as the mid-year examination in S1. The removal of mid-year examinations at P3, P5 and S3 will be carried out over two years, in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with having examinations and class tests, but we need to use them in suitable quantities. They are part and parcel of teaching and learning. They help teachers gauge their students' learning, and students to gauge their own learning along the way.\n\nBy all means, use formative tools such as worksheets, class work and homework to gauge learning outcomes and the strengths of each child. These are not high-stakes tests or examinations, which result in substantial loss of curriculum time. Our focus is to return the curriculum time to the schools to free up learning and teaching.\n\nBETTER TEACHING AND LEARNING\n\nHow will these changes add up? They will free up about three weeks of curriculum time every two years. This time is now returned to the schools and teachers, and with it, the flexibility to pace out teaching and learning so as to avoid a mad rush to complete the syllabus to prepare for tests and examinations. I hope schools will use the time well, for example, to conduct applied and inquiry-based learning.\n\nIn applied and inquiry-based learning, our students observe, investigate, reflect and create knowledge. And that naturally will take up more time.\n\nFor example, we can teach a child the area of a field is length multiplied by breadth. Go memorise the formula and take the tests. It can be done in a short time. But in an inquiry approach, we will ask the child, how do you find out the area of the field and have them discuss and brainstorm.\n\nSome may decide drawing those squares to fill up the field and count them. Others may have their ingenious methods. After that, the teacher may take them out to the school field to measure the length and breadth of the field, before allowing the students to discover that length multiplied by breadth equals area.\n\nIn art, we do not just ask students to draw something - when I was in primary school, my teacher asked me to draw a cat or apple and I would just draw. Now, we show them masterpieces, ask them what they observe, and why the artist had expressed himself that way. We ask them what do you think Monet is thinking of, what do they think Van Gogh is thinking of. We ask them what they want to express, how to express, and from there conjure their artistic creation.\n\nThrough the inquiry approach, students think and internalise concepts. The lessons are fun and more applied in nature. They are more likely to remember and enjoy the lesson, even though that could take up more time. The learning outcomes are better, and these are backed up by research, and also by ancient wisdom.\n\nWith the time and space created from reducing the assessment load, we hope teachers will leverage effective inquiry-based pedagogies, to enhance students' learning experiences.\n\nOur decision to reduce examinations is also backed by the experiences of trailblazers. One such school is Woodlands Ring Secondary School. It has removed mid-year examinations for S1 to S3 students since 2012. It has gone beyond what MOE is stipulating today, without affecting its students' O-and N-level examination performances.\n\nWith the time freed up, the school can dive deeper into the curriculum at a pace that suits each learner. For example, the mathematics department designed a learning trail for S1 students to extend their learning beyond the classroom. The school has received positive feedback from the teachers, students and parents, that the students are becoming more self-directed and motivated.\n\nHenry Park Primary School has removed term assessments in terms one and three for P3 to P6 students since 2014, and channelled the additional time into inquiry-based learning and student-initiated investigation.\n\nCHANGES IN REPORT BOOKS\n\nWe will also make adjustments to the Holistic Development Profile, or more commonly known as the report book, to better reflect a student's progress in learning, and to discourage excessive peer comparison. These adjustments will also help to reduce test anxiety.\n\nFor P1 and P2 where there will be no more weighted assessments, we will use qualitative descriptors instead of marks to inform parents of their child's progress. For other levels, where marks are available, they will be reflected as whole numbers instead of decimal points, which are an unnecessary precision.\n\nWe will also\n\nremove certain academic indicators\n\n, such as the students' class and level positions. I know that \"coming in first or second\", in class or level, has traditionally been a proud recognition of a student's achievement. But removing these indicators is for a good reason, so that the child understands from a young age that learning is not a competition, but a self-discipline he needs to master for life.\n\nNotwithstanding, the report book should still contain some form of yardstick and information to allow students to judge their relative performance, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nPARENTS AND TUITION\n\nI am confident that the students who are experiencing the changes first-hand will be able to see the value in what we are doing. However, for this shift to succeed, we will also need to bring in the most important stakeholder - parents - on board. We will need to show parents that the reduction does not compromise on academic rigour. Instead, we are optimising the number of assessments students have to sit today for better results.\n\nWe must expect some things are beyond MOE's or the schools' control - such as parents comparing notes in their WhatsApp groups that often raise anxieties, and sending their children for tuition and enrichment. I have no intention to heed the calls to ban tuition. Parents do this out of care and concern for their children, and many do-gooders in the community conduct free or low-cost tuition to help weaker students cope with their studies, and that's a good thing.\n\nBut there are negative tuition stories too. During my school visits, sometimes I'll ask them - do you find it stressful in schools?\n\nThey will tell me \"no\", but that tuition is stressful. They are very tired on weeknights after school or on weekends, because their day is packed with many tuition classes. Worst, they find that learning is not fun as a result and lessons have taken over their days and weekends.\n\nSo there is room for parents to step back, give children space to explore and play. On MOE's end, there is also room for us to step back, review the way we have been involving and engaging parents in school life, and make the nature of partnership between parents and schools clearer.\n\nCALIBRATED STRUCTURAL CHANGE\n\nWhat I just talked about is a significant but calibrated structural change, to reduce effort inflation and to create a better environment for holistic development. It is part of our journey to constantly evolve and improve.\n\nWith the removal of one mid-year examination in every two-year block, teachers will not need to rush through the syllabus. This gives them the time and space to explore new areas, and try out more effective pedagogies. If we expect our students to learn through trying and failing and trying again, teachers should also embody this spirit and set a good example of lifelong learning and lead by example.\n\nWe have a strong and excellent teaching force, an advantage that not many countries enjoy.\n\nIf we harness the passion, creativity and dynamism of our teaching force, we can make bold and meaningful changes to prepare our students well for the future. This is our collective moral imperative.\n\nSee more on\n\nEducation and schools\n\nOng Ye Kung", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

He said: \"On the ground, teachers are on a high-speed train... rushing, assessments and preparing the students for exams... I think it is time to take a pause.\"\n\nMOE said cutting the mid-year examinations will provide students with more time to adjust during \"key transition\" years, when they have to study new subjects and deal with higher content rigour. It will also free up about three weeks of curriculum time every two years.\n\nIn a speech to school heads earlier this week when he briefed them on the changes, Mr Ong urged educators to use the time well.\n\nFor instance, a pupil can be spoon-fed the formula on how to calculate area. \"It can be done in a short time,\" he said. \"But in an inquiry approach, we will ask children, how do you find out the area of the field, and have them discuss and brainstorm.\"\n\nThis may take more time, but pupils are \"more likely to remember and enjoy the lesson\", he said.\n\nMr Ong said that moves over the last few years, from not naming the top Primary School Leaving Examination scorers to the reform of the PSLE scoring system which kicks in in 2021, are all part of a new phase in Singapore's education system, which he termed \"Learn for Life\".\n\n\"Learn for Life is a value, an attitude and a skill that our students need to possess, and it is fundamental in ensuring that education remains an uplifting force in society.\"\n\nSome parents were concerned over the changes, especially how it will be harder to gauge their children's performance against their peers' as report books will no longer show rankings and mean scores.\n\n\"It is important we know where our children stand,\" said Madam Grace Chua, 37. The business development manager has a son in Primary 3 and a daughter turning two.\n\nFor the shift to succeed, Mr Ong said, MOE needs to \"bring the most important stakeholder - parents - on board\" and convince them that the changes do not compromise on academic standards.\n\nSchools also need to engage parents differently, he added.\n\nInstead of telling parents that their children have to get their homework done or comparing results with those of their classmates, the question that matters, said Mr Ong, is: \"What makes your child's eyes light up?\"\n\nSEE TOP OF THE NEWS:\n\nReport books: No class and cohort positions\n\nFewer exams: Time freed up for other learning activities\n\nNo exams in P1, P2: Progress will be measured in other ways\n\nEdusave: Awards for lower primary pupils to be based on learning attitudes\n\nREAD MORE Sandra Davie's analysis: Parents can help rekindle joy of learning\n\nParents too can play a part in rekindling joy of learning\n\nFewer exams: Commonly asked questions\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore education\n\nOng Ye Kung", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/nz-school-260918.jpg?VersionId=PGyO2bHUHjA37kNUlv6E1kUJMDc7X.V8", "alt_text": null}]}

As part of a routine background check, agents examined domestic abuse allegations against Mr Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary, and provided the information to the White House. Mr Porter, who has denied the accusations, was forced to resign this year.\n\nHere is what you need to know:\n\n1. WHAT HAS THE FBI ALREADY EXAMINED ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH?\n\nIn Thursday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Kavanaugh pointed to \"six separate FBI background investigations over 26 years\".\n\nFor background checks of federal judicial nominees, agents typically focus on their professional lives.\n\nAccording to former FBI officials, agents must interview a minimum of 30 people with whom nominees worked, including judges, lawyers and law enforcement officials. Agents would also talk to anyone else whom those people suggested they interview.\n\n2. WHAT COULD AGENTS EXAMINE ABOUT DR BLASEY'S ALLEGATION?\n\nThe FBI can follow several leads. They can interview Mr Mark Judge, Mr Leland Keyser and Mr P.J. Smyth, high school friends of either Dr Blasey or Judge Kavanaugh.\n\nDr Blasey has said they were at the party. Mr Judge said on Friday that he would be willing to talk to law enforcement officials.\n\nAgents could also investigate several details that could corroborate Dr Blasey's story.\n\nWeeks after she was assaulted, Dr Blasey said, she saw Mr Judge at a local Safeway grocery store.\n\nIn his book, Wasted, Mr Judge wrote that he worked as a bag boy in a local supermarket.\n\nThe FBI could ask either Safeway or Judge for employment records to determine whether he worked there during that period.\n\nIf they find any records, they could bolster Dr Blasey's credibility and potentially narrow the window of time in which the assault could have happened.\n\nAgents could also study Judge Kavanaugh's calendars from the summer of 1982 for possible dates and locations for a party like the one Dr Blasey described and ask Columbia Country Club - where Dr Blasey said she swam earlier that day - for visitor logs or other records dating to that summer.\n\nAnd they could check municipal housing records from 1982 for homes of high school friends of Dr Blasey or Judge Kavanaugh with floor plans that might match descriptions Dr Blasey has given: a narrow staircase, a bedroom at the top of the stairs with a bathroom directly across from it, and a front door that would have required her to exit by passing through the living room.\n\n3. WHAT ABOUT INVESTIGATING THE ALLEGATIONS OF OTHER WOMEN?\n\nThe scope of the background check is not clear, but two other women have come forward with claims against Judge Kavanaugh.\n\nOne of them, Ms Deborah Ramirez, has said that Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a night of drinking when they were both freshmen at Yale.\n\nAgents could interview Judge Kavanaugh's college friends, roommates and fraternity brothers about his drinking habits at Yale, asking questions about parties in Lawrance Hall, where he lived that year and where Ms Ramirez said the episode occurred.\n\nAgents could also request student records from Yale that might contain disciplinary violations and any medical records from hospitals in and around New Haven, Connecticut, that might reveal nights of heavy drinking.\n\nAlthough no one has publicly accused Judge Kavanaugh of any acts that prompted disciplinary measures at Yale or spoken of hospitalisations, universities and hospitals are typical sources of information in background checks.\n\nA third woman, Ms Julie Swetnick, has said that Judge Kavanaugh attended multiple parties in high school where he plied women with alcohol to try to take advantage of them.\n\nFBI agents could interview a broader circle of alumni from Judge Kavanaugh's and Ms Swetnick's high schools in suburban Washington to determine whether such parties took place.\n\n4. WILL THE FBI FIGURE OUT THE TRUTH?\n\nThat will be difficult. The allegations are decades old, and the key witness to Dr Blasey's account, Mr Judge, has also denied it. Memories have faded, and documents or other information might not exist anymore. And not everyone tells the FBI the truth.\n\nBut Mr Robert Cromwell, a former agent who oversaw these types of investigations, which are known at the bureau as special presidential inquiries, said he would expect the FBI to follow every lead.\n\n\"They will report what the results are - whether they are exculpatory or not,\" he said. \"The results will stand on their own.\"\n\nThe FBI interview summaries, called 302s after the number of the form that agents fill out, are likely to be dry and factual.\n\nSome agents could note any changes in witness behaviour if they find them meaningful.\n\nAny material contradictions would be noted in the summary of an interview. That information would ultimately be provided to the White House.\n\n5. CAN THE FBI FINISH INVESTIGATING IN A WEEK?\n\nIt's not impossible. The FBI has plenty of experience mounting large investigations and getting results quickly.\n\nIn the days and weeks after terrorism attacks or mass shootings, the FBI has completed hundreds of interviews and processed mountains of evidence, like video footage or the contents of computers and phones.\n\nIn this case, the FBI is likely to make the investigation a top priority, instructing agents across the country to conduct interviews.\n\n\"The FBI investigation can easily be done in a week,\" said Ms Lauren Anderson, a former top FBI official.\n\n6. WILL ANYONE BELIEVE THE FBI?\n\nOnce again, the FBI has been thrust into a politically fraught moment.\n\nThe bureau has been the target of Mr Trump's fury since before he became President, claiming without evidence that a cabal of FBI officials was against him.\n\nHe has called the investigation into whether any of his associates conspired with Russian's election interference a witch hunt and a hoax, prompting concern among agents that he has damaged the FBI's credibility.\n\nNow, some Republicans have dismissed the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh as nothing more than a political smear to derail his nomination. And Democrats are demanding a credible investigation before his nomination comes to a vote.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats alike are all but certain to seize on the FBI's findings to bolster their cases, and some current and former agents fear that politics will drown out any truth uncovered by the investigation.\n\nNonetheless, Mr James Gagliano, a former agent, said on Twitter, the background check is the \"right path forward?\".\n\nSee more on\n\nUS crime\n\nSex offences\n\nUS politics", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/nz-chuck-290921.jpg?VersionId=Wkf3m7bvFooXlsogxRtc5.CeeNMmBcuG", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

It offers information on the risk factors for breast cancer, to encourage women to get screened for the condition early.\n\nFirst launched in 2016, the Pink Train is an initiative to spread awareness of breast cancer here during October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n\nYesterday, the Pink Train - which features the message \"Every Woman Matters\" - was launched at the Bukit Panjang MRT station.\n\n\"The Pink Train is a reminder that all of us have a role to play in the fight against breast cancer, which affects not just women but also the people around us,\" said Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth, and Communications and Information, at the launch.\n\nThere are also wall murals displaying facts on breast cancer, screening options and funding assistance at Dhoby Ghaut and Serangoon MRT stations as well as bus interchanges in Bedok and Boon Lay. The campaign is expected to reach an estimated 34 million commuters. The initiative is a collaboration between non-profit organisation Breast Cancer Foundation (BCF), Land Transport Authority and ComfortDelGro's advertising arm Moove Media.\n\nBreast cancer is the most common form of cancer for women here. It accounted for almost one in three cancer cases among women from 2011 to 2015, based on the Singapore Cancer Registry's annual report for 2015. It is more common in women aged 40 and above and the risk increases with age.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

As we overemphasised assessment, we inadvertently reduced the time available for schools to focus on teaching and learning. We need to redress this balance.\"\n\nEducators said bite-sized assessments would give them a more holistic understanding of pupils' progress. The two exam-free years would also allow them to reflect and explore the way they teach.\n\nMadam Siti Farhaana, year head for lower primary at Anchor Green Primary School, said: \"Freeing up these two years means more time for experiential learning to take place. There will be more space and opportunities for pupils to discover their strengths, interests and improve in their areas of weaknesses.\"\n\nMr Dominic Sy, year head of the Primary 1 and 2 levels at Henry Park Primary School, said teachers would be able to \"explore curriculum innovation that will further cater to the needs of our pupils and heighten their joy of learning\".\n\nParents said the removal of exams should mean less stress for their young children who are getting used to the formal school system.\n\nSaid Mrs Dadina Wong, 42, whose son will start Primary 1 in Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) next year: \"I am comforted (to hear of the change). Maybe we don't have to send him for tuition - we can revise slowly with him in our own time.\"\n\nHowever, some parents raised the concern that without a proper benchmark, they might be unable to gauge their children's standards.\n\nMrs Cheryl Sim, 49, who has a Primary 1 son in Tao Nan School, said: \"In Primary 1, it is good not to have exams so the kids can adjust to a new learning environment. But once they are in Primary 2, it might actually be good to have a formal assessment of how they are doing.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of Education\n\nOng Ye Kung\n\nEducation and schools\n\nPrimary school", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/nz-exam-290919.jpg?VersionId=0cOc1sJz3Q9J8G4.A8V5AQq.ZX3HaD6z", "alt_text": null}]}

There was a slight drop in interest in the United States, Britain and Canada, which came in third, fourth and fifth, respectively.\n\nAccording to the annual Population In Brief report released on Thursday, there were 216,400 overseas Singaporeans as of June this year. This is an increase from the 214,700 at the same time last year, and continues a steady upward trend over the past decade, from 181,900 in 2008.\n\nMs Denise Phua, a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Social and Family Development, said the world has shrunk in a sense due to technology, and countries are experiencing challenges similar to those of Singapore in the economy and other areas.\n\n\"If we are indeed part of a Singapore family and care about ensuring that everyone's potential can be maximised, then stay and help build a nation that is not only successful economically, but also significant and purposeful,\" she said.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/aknusstudents2809.jpg?VersionId=7e1u1b_fOmj0GQmBmn.u8lmJSK6trVw4", "alt_text": null}]}

(but) it's Phil Mickelson, major champion.\n\n\"He's a very good iron player so I felt comfortable.\n\n\"I put that confidence in him and I'll be honest I'd do it again. I have a lot of confidence in all 12.\"\n\nAs much as he publicly backed Mickelson, speculation was rife that Furyk would bench the player in Saturday's foursomes.\n\nA subdued Furyk also downplayed the health of Woods' back, amid on-course reports that the 14-times major champion was moving gingerly.\n\nWoods was also rested in the afternoon after teaming up with Patrick Reed for a morning loss, though it was not clear if that had been the plan all along.\n\nIt was only the second time Woods has sat out a Ryder Cup session.\n\n\"I have not heard that he's had a back problem,\" Furyk said.\n\n\"You'd have to ask Tiger, but no, I saw him out on the golf course. He said he was all good.\n\n\"He was actually out practising tonight after the matches. Tiger draws so much attention - any time Tiger doesn't play, or maybe he stretches a little bit, everyone gets a little hypersensitive that he might have a back issue.\"\n\nFuryk praised the Europeans for the way they fought back.\n\n\"Don't take anything away from the Europeans. They played a great session of golf from top to bottom in all four sessions today and had some great ball-strikers out there,\" he said.\n\n\"Hat's off to them.

We got them going. They started believing ... then it seemed like nothing could go wrong.\"\n\nBut the cool-headed Dane made clear his players would have little time to savour their wins before refocusing ahead of Saturday's play.\n\nBjorn had special praise for British Open Champion Francesco Molinari and rookie Tommy Fleetwood, who in the morning left Tiger Woods licking his wounds on his much-anticipated Ryder Cup return before defeating Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth in the second session.\n\n\"They just love playing to each other. I think they just have a very special bond and relationship, and they have for a long time, and they love being on the golf course together.\"\n\nMolinari and Fleetwood's morning win had spared Europe the worst possible start, and a less daunting challenge in the afternoon, Bjorn said.\n\n\"That two guys stand up and hole the putts on 15, 16 and 17 to win the match when it really matters, it gives them belief, but also gives their team mates a hope,\" the Europe skipper said.\n\nNEVER DOUBTED RORY\n\nGoing out as the third pairing in the afternoon, wildcard Sergio Garcia and debutant Alex Noren stunned Phil Mickelson, making his 12th Ryder Cup appearance, and US rookie Bryson Dechambeau, racing to a seven-hole lead after nine holes.\n\nMickelson and Dechambeau could only look on with envy at the budding new partnership between the Spaniard and Swede.\n\n\"(Garcia) really is that type of guy that binds it all together in the team room,\" Bjorn said. \"You know, they went out and did fantastically on the golf course, but with Sergio it's not just about what he does on the course.\"\n\nAfter a torrid morning with the putter, Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy had to dig deep alongside Ian Poulter in the afternoon.

After carefully considering representations from the Registrar of Companies and Dr Thum, the minister \"notes that the proposed company, if allowed to be registered, could provide an avenue for foreigners or foreign entities to influence or interfere with Singapore domestic politics\".\n\n\"Such foreign influence or interference can arise from conditions imposed by foreign entities through their direct or indirect funding of the proposed company's political activities impacting Singapore,\" it added.\n\nAs such, the minster held that it was \"proper and correct\" for the registrar to conclude, based on the evidence, that the application must be refused as it is contrary to the national interest for the company to be registered.\n\nThe statement said that under the Companies Act, the minister's decision is final.\n\nIn April, when the application was rejected, Acra noted that the purposes of OSEA were\n\n\"clearly political in nature\"\n\n.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He also said OSEA Pte Ltd would be \"controlled\" by Singaporeans, and its activities would be \"similar\" to other programmes here.\n\nThe ministry noted that the registrar's representations stated that the intended purposes of OSEA Pte Ltd were clearly political in nature, and that the company would be funded by foreign entities and foreigners.

The Edusave Good Progress Award is worth $100 for Primary 2 and 3 pupils.

Our focus is to return the curriculum time to the schools to free up learning and teaching.\"\n\nParents said that while removing mid-year exams will relieve some stress, they wondered if it would end up shifting the pressure to the final-year assessments.\n\nSome felt that it might be harder to know where their child stands with no Primary 3 mid-year paper on top of not having exams and overall grades in Primary 1 and 2.\n\nMadam Karen Lim, 41, a banker with a Primary 1 daughter and Primary 5 son, said: \"It is good that I won't have to stress so much over preparing for exams, but my worry is that they become too relaxed in the first two years, and then panic at the end of Primary 3.\n\n\"At the end of the day, they are still taking a very major exam - the Primary School Leaving Examination - and that is crucial for secondary school placement.\"\n\nBut Madam Karen Kang, 51, believes that there is room in schools for other activities beyond tests and exams.\n\nThe housewife said that her Secondary 3 son and Primary 6 daughter benefited from Henry Park Primary's scrapping of continual assessments.\n\n\"We still get feedback from smaller tests which flag areas of weakness,\" she said, adding that her daughter had the chance to be part of an investigative project that saw her making presentations, working in a team and testing theories.\n\nAmelia Teng\n\nSee more on\n\nPrimary school\n\nSecondary school", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/ST_20180929_VNHENRYPARK_4312520.jpg?VersionId=vKxSJlBrLaN60M9l9F.3gIT.Fiq6c5iZ", "alt_text": "Henry Park Primary principal Martin Koh and Anchor Green Primary principal Norliza Rahim, whose schools have done away with continual assessments in favour of smaller assessments like topical tests or quizzes."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

A study last year found that each bike was used on average to make only between 0.62 and 1.64 trips a day.\n\n\"This is much lower than the utilisation rates in other cities such as New York City and Chicago, where each shared bicycle is used about three to six times a day,\" said the LTA, adding that about half the bikes here are not actively used.\n\nThe new regime is aimed at addressing the rampant indiscriminate parking of bikes resulting from the aggressive expansion of bike-sharing fleets, the LTA added.\n\nChinese firms Mobike and ofo as well as Singapore-based SG Bike have been granted full licences.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Aimed at firms without a \"sufficiently long track record\" in operating a bike-sharing service, the licence lets them operate a smaller fleet.\n\nAnywheel and GrabCycle will each be allowed to operate 1,000 bicycles and Qiqi Zhixiang up to 500.\n\nAnywheel also declined to say how many bikes it has now, but confirmed it has been recalling them to comply with regulations.\n\nThe LTA will monitor the performances of the three \"sandbox\" firms before determining whether to grant them full licences.\n\nGBikes, another firm that applied, will not be granted a licence as it did not satisfy the assessment criteria.\n\nLicences will be granted following the payment of relevant fees.\n\nEarlier this year, both oBike and ShareBikeSG ceased operations, citing difficulty in complying with the new regime.\n\nOperators that do not comply with the conditions face penalties, including a fine of up to $100,000 for each offence, or the suspension or termination of their licences.\n\nAn unlicensed operator can be fined up to $10,000 and jailed up to six months, with a further fine of $500 for each day that it continues to operate after conviction.\n\nFleet sizes will be reviewed regularly to support demand, and licensed operators can apply to expand their fleets twice a year, in January and July. New operators that intend to provide bike-sharing or personal mobility device-sharing services can apply for a licence in January next year.\n\nSingapore University of Social Sciences transport economist Walter Theseira said firms which previously relied on dumping bikes on the streets to grow market share will have to shift their mode of operation under the new regime.\n\n\"They will instead have to focus on profitability and sustainability,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nLTA\n\nCycling/Bicycles", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/ST_20180929_AZBIKE29_4312443.jpg?VersionId=ETdFOsQIXHHytp2WWivhLjge1Km.cgTS", "alt_text": "Bike-sharing operator Anywheel has been recalling some of its green bicycles to meet LTA's ceiling of 1,000 shared bicycles that the company has received approval to operate from the end of next month under the new licensing scheme."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

This often results in him being overwhelmed by stress while getting a family photograph taken, causing the process to take up to two hours.\n\nLast week, however, Levi's mother, 26-year-old Samantha Bishop was able to solve the problem by dressing him up as a Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-Rex).\n\nImages of the subsequent photo shoot, which took only 20 minutes, were uploaded on internet forum Reddit on Wednesday where they received more than 123,000 upvotes.\n\nMs Bishop also shared the photos on her Facebook page, This Life With Levi, where she described the challenges she had faced raising Levi as a single mother.\n\nShe wrote that photographing Levi was always difficult and exhausting, needing \"coaxing, bribery, dancing like a fool and a whole lot of bathroom jokes\".\n\nThis was because Levi found eye contact, smiling, and showing emotion on command uncomfortable.\n\nWith the T-Rex suit, however, everything was different.\n\nMs Bishop said that Levi \"loved\" the photo shoot, which featured him in the T-Rex suit alongside her niece, who is also his best friend.\n\n\"This is him in his element. There are no forced smiles, no bribery, no pretend happiness. This is the goofy, hilarious, kindhearted boy I was given,\" said Ms Bishop.\n\nThough some parents criticised her for making her son's autism the focus of the photo shoot, Ms Bishop said that she chose to \"celebrate his 'labels' and teach him to use them to his advantage rather than see them as an obstacle.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMental health\n\nPhotography\n\nFamilies", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/tg-dino-28.jpg?VersionId=YmcbqZmaE3LetveyoBvkrpp1nrWJNqCa", "alt_text": null}]}

Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson resumed their highly successful partnership to hammer Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler 3 and 2 having been 5-up after 11.\n\nIan Poulter and Rory McIlory, who was badly off form in the morning, came from 2-down to triumph 4 and 2 over Webb Simpson and Bubba Watson as Poulter was yet again inspired to new heights by the emotion of team competition.\n\nRookie Tommy Fleetwood took a far more chilled approach and saw it pay off handsomely as he and Francesco Molinari, who had won Europe's solitary fourballs point, completed the memorable day by smashing Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas 5 and 4.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

For sure, there's added motivation. We want to strike back, it's sport. Fighting back is a duty in sport.\n\n\"It will be tough, it will be intense. It's a big one, Chelsea v Liverpool, but our best preparation was the Wednesday game. We'll try to use our information from that match to do better.\"\n\nWednesday's loss was Liverpool's first blemish after a spotless start to the season which had seen them open up a two-point lead over unbeaten Chelsea at the top of the league after six straight wins. They also beat Paris St Germain in the Champions League.\n\nLiverpool had been on top and leading Chelsea 1-0 when undone by an Emerson equaliser and then one of the goals of the season from Hazard, who cut inside from the right flank, sliced through Liverpool's defence and fired in from a narrow angle.\n\nIt was a great goal but one which Klopp felt should have been cut out at source by Liverpool's rearguard.\n\n\"We all know we could have defended that goal he scored. Yes, he did well but we had three challenges. We have to make sure we close the right spaces... No player is not defendable.\"\n\nYet Hazard, in current form, can make their life a torment again.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, we played Chelsea when they had (Diego) Costa and Hazard and it felt like 'wow, we can defend all of them - but not him.'\n\n\"Eden Hazard is a special player but I didn't need Wednesday's game to know that; it was already clear before.\"\n\nPOTENTIAL\n\nWhen asked if he was now the world's best player, Sarri told reporters later: \"I think for sure he is one of the best but I am convinced he can improve. I think we have seen only 70, 75, 80 per cent of his potential.\n\n\"For example, he can play with more intensity in training.\" If he did, said Sarri, he could go on to be voted the world's best next season.\n\nAsked if he was the best player he had coached, the Italian added: \"It's very difficult to compare him with another player. He's a genius. He's unique.\"\n\nKlopp's main concern is the fitness of his defensive lynchpin Virgil van Dijk, who was injured in the previous league game against Southampton and missed the midweek match.\n\nAsked if the Dutchman would play, Klopp said: \"We have to wait, he didn't train with the team so far.

Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay has said the court was independent and followed due process in the case.\n\nThe reporters pleaded not guilty and have been detained since December.

Trump granted the request.\n\nFlake's action came a day after the committee's jarring and emotional hearing into the allegations against Kavanaugh that gripped the country, with a university professor named Christine Blasey Ford accusing him of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when both were high schools students in Maryland. Kavanaugh denied the accusation.\n\nIn a statement issued by the White House, Kavanaugh said he would cooperate with the FBI.\n\n\"Throughout this process, I've been interviewed by the FBI, I've done a number of 'background' calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me. I've done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe prospect of a new investigation put the confirmation chances for Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge nominated for a lifetime job on the top US court, in further jeopardy in a Senate only narrowly controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nFlake said it is up to the FBI to determine what allegations are credible. Two other women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, allegations he also denied.\n\nIf confirmed, Kavanaugh would consolidate conservative control of the nation's highest court and advance Trump's broad effort to shift the American judiciary to the right.\n\n\"This country's being ripped apart here,\" Flake, with a pained look on his face, told his fellow senators about the nomination fight. \"I think we can have a short pause,\" he added.\n\n\"We ought to do what we can to make sure that we do all due diligence with a nomination this important,\" said Flake, who earlier in the day announced he would vote for Kavanaugh in the committee.\n\nEven before Flake's announcement, it was unclear if Republicans had the votes to confirm Kavanaugh on the Senate floor. Republicans hold a slim Senate 51-49 majority, making the votes of two other so-far undecided Republican moderates crucial: Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins.\n\nTrump said Murkowski and Collins must do what they think is right. Murkowski and Collins said they supported Flake's move, as did moderate Democrats Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, who have not yet announced how they will vote on Kavanaugh.\n\n\"I'm going to let the Senate handle that. They'll make their decisions. And they've been doing a good job,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when told about Flake's move.\n\nThe Republican president, however, indicated he was sticking with Kavanaugh's nomination, saying he has not thought \"even a little bit\" about replacing him.\n\nFord's lawyer, Debra Katz, welcomed the investigation and thanked the senators who pushed for it but decried the limits imposed on it. \"A thorough FBI investigation is critical to developing all the relevant facts,\" Katz said.\n\nThe committee advanced the nomination 11-10 along party lines. On the Senate floor, Trump can afford to lose the vote of only one senator in his own party if all the Democrats vote against Kavanaugh and Vice-President Mike Pence casts a tie-breaking vote.\n\nJust before the scheduled vote in the committee, Flake left the room to talk to some Democrats, adding turmoil to the proceedings. During the delay, senators and aides could be seen in the committee room having hushed conversations, with some going back and forth to an anteroom of the committee chamber.\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Coons played an important role in the negotiations.\n\nEarlier in the day Flake, who had previously raised concerns about the allegations against Kavanaugh, said Ford gave \"compelling testimony\" but Kavanaugh provided \"a persuasive response.\"\n\nSoon after Flake made his announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the senator was confronted in an elevator while on his way to the committee meeting by two protesters who said they were sexual assault survivors.\n\n\"That's what you're telling all women in America - that they don't matter, they should just keep it to themselves,\" one of the protesters shouted at Flake in an exchange aired by CNN.\n\n\"I need to go to my hearing. I've issued my statement,\" Flake said.\n\nThe timing of the panel's session gave committee members little time to digest Thursday's extraordinary testimony from Kavanaugh and Ford. Kavanaugh accused Democrats of a \"calculated and orchestrated political hit.\"\n\nTrump said he found Ford's testimony \"very compelling\" and Kavanaugh's angry and defiant response \"incredible.\"\n\nBefore Flake's move, committee Republicans voted down a Democratic motion seeking to subpoena Mark Judge, a Kavanaugh friend who Ford said witnessed the assault. Judge had told the committee in a written statement he does not recall any such incident. He is likely to be central to any FBI probe.\n\n\"If the FBI or any law enforcement agency requests Mr. Judge's cooperation, he will answer any and all questions posed to him,\" said his lawyer, Barbara Van Gelder.\n\n'INTERGALACTIC FREAK SHOW'\n\nAs the committee set its vote, some Democrats left the room in protest.\n\n\"What a railroad job,\" Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono said.\n\nOne Republican, Senator John Kennedy, called Kavanaugh's confirmation process \"an intergalactic freak show.\"\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's senior Democrat, called Kavanaugh's remarks unseemly for a judicial nominee.\n\n\"This was someone who was aggressive and belligerent. I have never seen someone who wants to be elevated to the highest court in the country behave in that manner. In stark contrast, the person who testified yesterday and demonstrated a balanced temperament was Dr Ford,\" Feinstein said.\n\nAfter Flake's move, some of the partisan rancour appeared to dissipate.\n\n\"We had a good day today by moving the nominee, a good day. We're very happy with the progress we made,\" Republican committee chairman Chuck Grassley said.\n\nThe controversy has unfolded just weeks ahead of the Nov 6 congressional elections in which Democrats are trying to seize control of Congress from the Republicans, against a backdrop of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault.\n\nThe American Bar Association, which earlier endorsed Kavanaugh, and the dean of Yale Law School, which Kavanaugh attended, also called for an FBI probe on Friday, the first indication of the legal profession turning on the nominee.\n\nKavanaugh could be the deciding vote on contentious legal issues if he is confirmed to the nine-member court, with disputes involving abortion, immigration, gay rights, voting rights and transgender troops possibly heading to the court soon. The court begins its next term on Monday, down one justice after the retirement of conservative Anthony Kennedy effective in July. Trump nominated Kavanaugh to replace Kennedy.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/07053058.jpg?VersionId=VXK7g5ryi0WY_h5Vuo1DoxF7YloQW150", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Chiong then issued a cease and desist order to stop the quarrying activities. She also asked the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) in Central Visayas to inspect and assess the area.\n\nThe MGB, together with barangay officials and ALQC representatives, did a joint inspection on Aug 29. In their report to Chiong, they said the cracks or fissures were a \"natural phenomenon\" unrelated to the quarry operations; they were \"not considered critical\" and did not pose any imminent danger to the immediate community.\n\nOn Sept 4, the MGB regional office informed Chiong that it was allowing ALQC to resume operations. The mayor agreed, but on condition that the ground fissures be monitored and safety standards be strictly observed.\n\nA week later, on Sept 11, ALQC reported that a 3mm crack on the north of the facility's main tower - first noticed on Aug 31 - has become a 35-mm crack.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

According to reports, that area was not among those surveyed by the MGB.\n\nWhy was Sindulan overlooked in the inspection despite its location and proximity? Why was one community saved while another was seemingly left to its own defences?\n\nIn the grim aftermath of the disaster, Chiong has downplayed the responsibility of city hall; this is not the time to play the blame game, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu has created a team to probe the accountability of at least four MGB regional officials, including the geologists who conducted the inspections. Cimatu has also ordered the suspension of quarry operations in Central Visayas and seven other regions, pending safety assessments.\n\nResidents are clear about who should bear ultimate responsibility for what happened. During a meeting with landslide victims last week, a woman told President Rodrigo Duterte: \"Stop the Apo cement quarry\u2026 We don't need food.

The flaw inadvertently put the wrong digital code, similar to a browser cookie, on the devices of people using\"view as\".\n\nThat code could allow the person using \"view as\" to post and browse from someone else's Facebook account, potentially exposing private messages, photos and posts.\n\n\"The implications of this are huge,\" Justin Fier, director of cyber intelligence at security company Darktrace, told Reuters.\n\nGuy Rosen, the Facebook vice-president overseeing security, said the flaw was \"complex\" in that it resulted from three failings.\n\nA video upload feature should not have displayed on a user's profile page when accessed through \"view as,\" Rosen told reporters on a conference call. That alone would not have been problematic except that the video feature wrongly triggered the placement of the powerful login code. And it placed the code not for the \"view as\" user, but for who they were pretending to be.\n\nFacebook fixed the issue on Thursday. It also notified the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Congressional aides and the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, where the company has European headquarters.\n\nThe Irish authority expressed concern in a statement that Facebook has been \"unable to clarify the nature of the breach and risk to users\" and said it was pressing Facebook for answers.\n\nFacebook reset the digital keys of the 50 million affected accounts, and as a precaution temporarily disabled \"view as\" and reset those keys for another 40 million that have been looked up through \"view as\" over the last year.\n\nAbout 90 million people will have to log back into Facebook or any of their apps that use a Facebook login, the company said.\n\nMore than 6,000 Facebook users flocked to Zuckerberg's Facebook page to complain about the latest glitch.\n\n\"I'm so scared now. All my activities are on Facebook,\" Mohammad ZR Zia, a 25-year-old college student in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who has been using the social media platform since 2009, told Reuters. His account was logged out earlier on Friday.\n\nThe level of concern expressed on Facebook was enough that the company's automated systems blocked sharing of a Guardian newspaper article about the breach.\n\n\"Our security systems have detected that a lot of people are posting the same content, which could mean that it's spam,\" a message told users. \"Please try a different post.\"\n\nThe company did not respond to a request to comment on the issue.\n\nFacebook has suffered narrower breaches before.\n\nIn 2013, Facebook disclosed a software flaw that exposed six million users' phone numbers and email addresses to unauthorized viewers for a year, while a technical glitch in 2008 revealed confidential birth-dates on 80 million Facebook users' profiles.\n\nSee more on\n\nFacebook\n\nHacking", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/07054950.jpg?VersionId=wssLtwunWK_c.CCnXY756jkW8SMzVmia", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

I'm not a physio,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"He arrived late, that happens sometimes, in the last period a lot have arrived late because of the traffic. Manchester is under construction, the players arrive late. They have to drop their kids at school.\n\n\"I expect him back when he's fit. Now he's injured, he's not a problem with physical condition.\n\n\"He's injured and when he's ok he's coming back and when he decides to play he's going to play.\"\n\nSTEP BY STEP\n\nAnother injured City star, Kevin De Bruyne, is making better progress from his knee injury and will return to some parts of the team's training sessions next week.\n\n\"He's making the last steps, starting training in part in the next days. Everything is going well,\" Guardiola said.\n\nGuardiola, talking ahead of City's home Premier League game with Brighton on Saturday, refused to divulge whether promising young midfielder Phil Foden will start in the game after impressing on a rare start against Oxford in the League Cup in midweek.\n\nBut he did insist that the Foden is very much in his thoughts.\n\n\"He needs to go step by step, don't read too much, watch too much, train hard and his career will speak for himself,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"He has to make his own career. It's important to do it day after day, especially for the young players.\n\n\"It's not important if he starts, a few minutes, he's part of the group, it's about my decisions, he's ready to start in any competition, after that he has to compete with his team-mates and sometimes it is not possible but he's ready.\"\n\nFoden is out of contract in 2020 although talks have opened over an extended deal.\n\nAnd, while Guardiola is not directly involved in negotiations, he is optimistic they will end successfully.\n\n\"I didn't speak about it,\" he said. \"But I think Phil would like to be here and the club, there is no doubt, and the manager - hopefully it will happen sooner or later but I'm not involved.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nEPL\n\nManchester City\n\nPep Guardiola", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/fbl-nations-fra-training-111651.jpg?VersionId=6VWbsTEwolXJnWzdJ_sUSVYLKtOoD2xz", "alt_text": null}]}

That meant he was still a priest, although he could not minister in public.\n\nKaradima, who has always denied wrongdoing, escaped civilian justice because of the statute of limitations in the country.\n\nSeven Chilean bishops have resigned since June after an investigation into an alleged cover-up of Karadima's crimes, some of them former proteges of Karadima, who prepared them for the priesthood as young men in Santiago's up-scale, conservative El Bosque neighbourhood.\n\nThree Chilean men who said they were abused by Karadima accused one, Juan Barros, the former bishop of Osorno, of having witnessed Karadima abuse them.\n\nDuring a trip to Chile in January, the Pope said he had no proof against Barros, believed he was innocent, and that accusations against him were \"slander\" until proven otherwise.\n\nBut days after returning to Rome, the Pope, citing new information, sent sexual abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to Chile to speak to victims, witnesses and other Church members.\n\nScicluna produced a 2,300-page report accusing Chile's bishops of \"grave negligence\" in investigating the allegations and said evidence of sex crimes had been destroyed.\n\nIn April, Francis, who is also grappling with sexual abuse crises in the United States, Germany and Australia, held four days of meetings in Rome with the three victims - Juan Carlos Cruz, James Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo.\n\n\"I have a knot in my stomach. I never thought I would see this day,\" Cruz said in a tweet thanking the Pope. \"He (Karadima) is criminal who has ruined so many people's lives with his abuse. I hope thousands of survivors feel a bit of the relief I feel today.\"\n\nFollowing the meeting with the victims, Francis summoned all of Chile's 34 bishops to Rome in May and they offered their resignations en masse. Francis has so far accepted seven, and appointed \"apostolic administrators\" to run their dioceses.\n\nSee more on\n\nChile\n\nVatican\n\nSex offences", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/29/2018-09-28t154618z_1284701301_rc12f026f400_rtrmadp_3_chile-abuse-karadima.jpg?VersionId=omruSI.EWl1LDECAIp2T9bDXO09ewLJe", "alt_text": null}]}

We are a claimant state and Malaysia takes the position that all claims must be based and resolved in accordance with international law, in particular the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) on the overlapping claims.\n\nWhen contacted, several officials insisted that the Mindef statement did not reflect the true picture of Malaysia's claim in the area.\n\n\"I don't recall any discussion on Malaysia changing its position on claims in South China Sea. In addition, the code of conduct (CoC) negotiation is still ongoing between Asean and China,\" said an official.\n\nThe official was referring to the Asean and China negotiations on a binding code to address numerous issues faced by claimant parties since 2002.\n\nThe proposed code seeks to advance a 2002 Declaration of Conduct (DoC) of Parties in the South China Sea, which commits to following the Unclos, ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight, and refraining from the action of inhabiting the presently uninhabited island, reefs, shoals, cays and other features.\n\nThe area, which has rich fishing grounds along with oil and gas deposits, is claimed by four Asean countries - Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. China and Taiwan are the two non-Asean claimant parties.\n\nIn August this year, Asean and China agreed on a draft CoC that will lay the foundation for negotiations over the disputed maritime area.\n\nNegotiations on the code is under the purview of the Foreign Ministry.\n\nWhile these negotiations are taking place, China continues to aggressively make its presence felt with militarisation activities in the region which Beijing says are being done peacefully.\n\nLately, more countries including Britain, Japan and the United States have found common cause in countering growing Chinese influence in the region that they worry could put key commercial sea lanes linking Asia with Europe, the United States and elsewhere under Beijing's sway.\n\nWith more countries getting involved in the South China Sea area, it came as a surprise that Mindef decided to issue a statement on Malaysia's \"stance of neutrality\" after the meeting between Mohamad and Mattis.\n\nIt is understood the Foreign Ministry is seeking a clarification from Mindef on this \"change\" of the national position.\n\nThe statement which used the word neutrality can be interpreted in many different ways, according to an official.\n\n\"For a layman when we say we are neutral on South China Sea, it means that we are not a claimant state and we are showing no interest at all on this.\n\n\"Perhaps the statement did not give a clear indication on what actually transpired at the Pentagon meeting,\" he said.\n\nIt also points to one thing. There was lack of consultation among the ministries and agencies involved in this issue.\n\nThis means these ministries are working in silos instead of working and coordinating with each other especially on issues affecting national policies and positions.\n\nPerhaps, there is also a lack of understanding among Mindef personnel on how sensitive this issue is.\n\n\"This is a national position.

We need the Russian energy like oil and natural gas and they need Chinese processed goods... and inexpensive Chinese goods.\"\n\nWang said China had exercised \"utmost restraint\" in the South China Sea and seeks peaceful solutions to disputes there. He said Beijing's sovereignty over the South China Sea islands was \"very clear\" and that people there felt the need for enhanced defences given \"heavy\" US military patrols, Wang said.\n\nChina claims most of the South China Sea, through which about US$3 trillion worth of trade passes every year. Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei also claim parts of the sea, which has oil and gas deposits and rich fishing grounds.\n\nWang said that while Asia belonged to the people of Asia, China did not seek a closed continent or to create \"a new order\"or hegemony.\n\n\"China will not, repeat, not repeat the old practice of a strong country seeking hegemony,\" Wang said. \"I don't think China will become the United States and China will not challenge the United States, still less will China take the place of the United States.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nTrade\n\nUN", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/un-assembly-diplomacy-china-151308.jpg?VersionId=9QvtaxnWJIvxt53WOz8BJ3I9Otwz1GNJ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

One sister included his employer as well in her court action.\n\nMs Tang Bei, who is a Singapore permanent resident, is seeking $50,000 in damages from Mr Quek Choon Kiat, now 65, as well as from his employer Hilandas Property and Facilities Management. Her sister, Ms Tang Lei, is seeking $5,000 in damages from only Mr Quek.\n\nThe two 50-year-old Chinese nationals filed their statement of claims in November 2016.\n\nIn her suit, Ms Tang Bei said she had gone to the condominium's management office to apply for a replacement access card in February 2015 as the one she had was faulty.\n\nShe said that Mr Quek refused to process her application before uttering \"something to the effect that he would fall in love\" with her. Ms Tang Bei then claimed that he assaulted her.\n\nShe also said that when she walked out of the office he followed her and shouted: \"Get out of Singapore.\" Court documents said that she suffered \"indignity and emotional trauma\".\n\nShe stated in her claim that Mr Quek again attended to her when she returned to the office on April 28, 2015.\n\nShe claimed the condominium manager \"directed xenophobic remarks\" at her when she told him that she did not want to be served by him.\n\nMs Tang Bei said her sister, Ms Tang Lei, who was waiting outside, heard the commotion and went to help her. The claim stated that Mr Quek then directed \"similar xenophobic remarks\" at Ms Tang Lei before hitting Ms Tang Bei's head forcefully.\n\nMr Quek, who denied these accusations in court documents, said in his defence that Ms Tang Bei entered the management office in February 2015 \"demanding\" a resident cum access card and handed him $100.\n\nHe stated that she asked for the money to be returned after refusing to provide a photograph and show proof of her residency in the complex.\n\n\"Suddenly and without warning, the plaintiff lifted the service counter flap and forced her way into the area behind the service counter... Instinctively, (Mr Quek) raised his hand... and managed to stop her,\" the condominium manager said in his defence.\n\nA female colleague returned the money after Ms Tang Bei \"retreated to her original position\", he said.\n\nTurning to the later incident, Mr Quek stated in his defence that Ms Tang Bei and her sister returned to his office on April 28, 2015. He added that Ms Tang Bei then said that she did not want to be served by him. A scuffle broke out and the two women hit his face, according to Mr Quek.\n\nThe civil cases of the two sisters, who are both represented by Richard Siaw, are still pending.\n\nIn July, after a separate 20-day criminal trial, Ms Tang Bei was convicted of causing hurt to condominium security officer Charles Kenneth Bligh, as well as one count each of assaulting and using criminal force on Mr Quek. Ms Tang Lei was convicted of four charges: Causing hurt to Mr Bligh, as well as two counts of using criminal force and an assault charge involving Mr Quek.\n\nLast month, District Judge Sarah Tan fined Ms Tang Bei $2,100 and Ms Tang Lei $2,500.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts\n\nCivil lawsuits", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/colin-cn2-28.jpg?VersionId=vUDiz5GrVP.GPiRCFq4WcsFi.IyZFLur", "alt_text": null}]}

The weak will have to submit.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Dr Mahathir has earned attention for attempting to buck this trend. His new government\n\ncancelled two multibillion-dollar Chinese investment projects\n\n, a move perceived by analysts as a rejection of Beijing's geopolitical ambitions in Asia.\n\nBut Dr Mahathir pushed back on any suggestion that he was \"anti-Chinese\".\n\n\"China does not have a history of creating empires through conquests,\" Dr Mahathir said, contrasting that history to centuries of European colonial violence and plunder. \"We have relations with China for almost 2,000 years, but they never conquered us.\"\n\nHe condemned the\n\nimminent trade war between the United States and China\n\nas \"silly\", \"old-fashioned\" and something Beijing does not want.\n\nHe also looks dourly upon Mr Trump, a new antagonist in the White House. \"I find it difficult to make out what he is like, because he seems to be rather mercurial, changing his mind in a short space of time,\" he said of the American president. \"When he expresses an opinion, it seems to be not in keeping with reality.\"\n\nDr Mahathir argued that he cancelled the Chinese contracts in question not as an act of defiance against China, but because the debt-laden deal didn't serve the national interest and was the work of his allegedly corrupt predecessor as prime minister Najib Razak.\n\nDr Mahathir's return to the world stage followed a remarkable election campaign this year to\n\nunseat Najib\n\n, his former protege.\n\nPopular discontent with Malaysia's political status quo, intensified by spiraling corruption scandals surrounding Najib, compelled his mentor to head up an opposition coalition and bring down the ruling party he had dominated for decades.\n\nThe opposition victory was \"a textbook example of democracy\", Dr Mahathir said. \"Democracy can only function if people understand and respect the vote.\"\n\nIn a high-stakes contest in Malaysia, he argued, the vote was respected.\n\nThere are profound ironies about this turn of events.\n\nFor years, Dr Mahathir was viewed by many as an autocrat in democratic clothing, a charismatic politico who ruthlessly consolidated power even as he pioneered his nation's modernisation.\n\nHe is still irked by this characterisation, casting it as a \"trick\" played by the Western media.\n\n\"Whether my policies were good or bad is up for others to evaluate,\" he said. \"But I stayed on for 22 years. I led five elections and in all five elections, I won with a very good majority. The people were not so disappointed with me to the extent of wanting to throw me out.\"\n\nNor does he take any responsibility for the political legacy he may have bequeathed to his country - a certain political elite engaging in astonishing graft, enabled in part by a compromised judiciary.\n\nSince leaving office in 2003, Dr Mahathir has become a vocal critic of his successors. \"I don't see why I should be blamed. Without anybody asking me to, I resigned to give way to other people,\" he said, referring to his departure in favour of then Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi.\n\nInstead, he blames \"the character of the people who succeeded me, not the political system\" itself.\n\nHe said his government will work towards cleaning up the country's judiciary and reviving foreign investment.\n\nIn the 1990s, Dr Mahathir was the chief proponent of \"Asian values\", a set of principles that challenged the universality of human rights and seemed to justify authoritarian governance if it delivers prosperity and development.\n\nNow, he has softened his rhetoric to fit his new democratic bona fides.\"It can't be a case of one-size-fits-all,\" he said, pointing to the failure of democratic uprisings in the Middle East.\n\n\"Democracy is not perfect, it does not guarantee good governance. Democracy can throw up a leader who can manipulate the law and so he actually becomes a dictator.\" Dr Mahathir then added: \"Trump is what happens with democracy.\"\n\nMalaysia's nonagenarian leader is eager to avoid any more talk about dictatorship at home. He came to power on a pledge to eventually cede office to once-jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, a politician who Dr Mahathir targeted for prosecution 20 years ago.\n\nThey've since buried the hatchet, and Dr Mahathir said that he will give way to Datuk Seri Anwar in \"two or three years\".\n\nHe ended on a matter-of-fact note: \"I don't want to stay forever.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nUN\n\nMahathir Mohamad", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/colin-mata-28.jpg?VersionId=GFpRssoW7YNsjyw7XJFhAHmCrcVgzWfP", "alt_text": null}]}

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to build infrastructure in countries along land and sea trade routes linking Asia to Europe and Africa.\n\nMr Wong on Friday also said that any replication would not just cover \"green buildings\", but include other areas such as how the wastewater pond and saline land of the Eco-city were rehabilitated, and also the training of officials and city planners.\n\n\"Singapore started on the path of sustainable development very early in our development experience because of our circumstances. We are just one very small island one third of the size of the (TBNA), and we cannot afford to spoil this small little island which is also our home,\" Mr Wong said earlier in the day when he delivered the opening address at the two-day China-Singapore International Green Building Conference at the Eco-city.\n\nMr Wong is in China for a three-day working visit to attend the anniversary celebrations of the Eco-city. He is accompanied by a delegation comprising of businessmen and government officials.\n\nMr Mah Bow Tan, who was National Development Minister when the Eco-city project was launched in 2008, is among those in the delegation.\n\nOn Friday, he told reporters that the project was launched on a barren plot of land with \"not a single blade of grass.\" Now it is a leafy township of over 100,000 people with close to 7,000 registered companies.\n\nMr Mah, who retired from politics in 2015 and is now a businessman, hailed the transformation as \"unbelievable\".\n\nMr Mah said Singapore learnt about the Chinese ability to deliver results from the project, noting that within a year of its launch grass was growing on the land.\n\n\"It's quite amazing, when they say they will do it, they will do it,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday (Sept 28), Mr Wong also met China's vice minister of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ms Huang Yan, and TBNA party chief Zhang Yuzhuo, and they endorsed a new key performance indicator (KPI) framework to guide future development of the Eco-city .\n\nSome of the KPIs included achieving 100 per cent wastewater reuse by 2020, and making sure all homes were within a five minute walk to parks and green spaces by 2035.\n\nMr Wong on Friday also toured the TBNA, visiting the Dongjiang Bonded Port, located in a free trade area, as well as a temperature-controlled logistics facility. Later, he watched a friendly video game match between teams from Singapore and China at the an e-sports centre, and visited the soon-to-opened China-Singapore Friendship Library.\n\nIn the evening he attended a commemorative dinner for the Eco-city's 10th anniversary.\n\nMr Wong told reporters that the Eco-city had been a good platform to facilitate bilateral cooperation.\n\n\"I believe that this platform remains very relevant. For 10 years it has proven very useful for both sides, it has led to many mutually beneficial outcomes... and I believe that we can keep this platform a useful one, a relevant one for both countries,\" he said.\n\nMr Wong will leave China on Saturday (Sept 29).\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nLawrence Wong\n\nMah Bow Tan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/yq-datianjin2-28092018.jpg?VersionId=H3kehXa1CNrs7TD1i7Jvy4DD0I4Q3_DS", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/yq-datianjin3-28092018.jpg?VersionId=89NHnPdZbis6znldtbTbWpcMP4ETA3Cp", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

More than half were about professional negligence or incompetence.\n\nA complaint is typically looked into by a three-member complaints committee, which decides whether the matter should be escalated to a disciplinary tribunal. The entire process can take years, especially if either party makes an appeal.\n\nOne of the nine proposed amendments suggests that doctors with the necessary experience and expertise can be drawn from a complaints panel to chair complaints committees. Currently, only the 25 SMC council members are allowed to fulfil this role.\n\nChanging the way this works would result in \"better efficiency and timeliness\" when resolving cases, the SMC and Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a joint statement on Friday (Sept 28).\n\nAnother change will see the formation of a new committee to develop sentencing guidelines and do away with the minimum suspension period of three months.\n\nAt present, sentences are based on precedent. But disciplinary tribunals have said that this makes it difficult to decide on appropriate sentences.\n\nThe changes put forward are meant to ensure \"consistency and fairness\" in sentences meted out, and also to allow \"greater flexibility\" in determining the appropriate penalty.\n\nA third change to improve transparency and accountability proposes that appeals against complaints committee decisions be made to an independent appeals committee instead of the Health Minister, which is currently the case.\n\nThis committee will comprise a medical doctor, a legal professional and a \"distinguished lay person\" - such as an academic or a professional from a different field.\n\nAnyone wanting to know more about the proposed amendments and give their feedback can view the draft Bill on the Reach website or www.moh.gov.sg/e-consultation/mra_amendments\n\nFeedback should be e-mailed, by 6pm on Oct 26, to: mra_public_consult@moh.gov.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nDoctors/Surgeons", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/colin-ds-28.jpg?VersionId=jzDuL5kJ5B9qoCXK4ZJMRjgxBPeZ1KM.", "alt_text": null}]}

There was a slight drop in interest in the US, UK and Canada, which came in third, fourth and fifth respectively.\n\nAccording to the annual Population in Brief report released on Thursday (Sept 27), there are 216,400 Overseas Singaporeans as of June this year.\n\nThis is an increase from the 214,700 at the same time last year, and continues a steady upward trend over the past decade, from 181,900 in 2008.\n\nMs Denise Phua, member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Social and Family Development, said the world has shrunk in a sense, due to technology, and countries are experiencing similar challenges to Singapore in the economy and other areas.\n\n\"If we are indeed part of a Singapore family and care about ensuring that everyone's potential can be maximised, then stay and help build a nation that is not only successful economically, but also significant and purposeful.\"", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/aknusstudents2809.jpg?VersionId=7e1u1b_fOmj0GQmBmn.u8lmJSK6trVw4", "alt_text": null}]}

This includes usinga \"jail broken phone\", in which a mobile phone's firmware is altered without the manufacturer's approval.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

It will also have to bear full liability even if third parties caused the incident, for transactions up to $1,000. All other situations, including losses above $1,000 and attributed to third-party fault, will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the financial institution.\n\nFor transactions which are made in error, a user will also need to inform the financial institution immediately, while the institution cannot debit the recipient's account without his consent. Simple cases will require the user's and recipient's financial institutions to make reasonable efforts to recover the erroneous sum within a one-week period.\n\nHowever, scams are not considered as unauthorised or erroneous transactions, as the user was deceived by a scammer unrelated to financial institutions or merchants.\n\nThe guidelines encourage the wider adoption of e-payments by setting standards on the responsibilities of both groups, said the MAS. They are part of e-payment road map set out by MAS in 2016 to modernise regulations on cashless transactions.\n\nEarlier this year, MAS conducted a month-long public consultation with 21 respondents, including the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and law firm Linklaters Singapore, which represented the Singapore FinTech Association.\n\nThe ABS had asked if the new rules could create situations in which liabilities of users and financial institutions are not commensurate with their responsibilities.\n\nFor example, it said fraudsters may engineer unauthorised transactions in which the end-user is still deemed to be innocent. The institutions could end up shouldering the blame in such cases.\n\nABS' existing Credit Card Code makes cardholders fully liable if they are involved in fraud or acted with gross negligence.\n\nIn response, MAS said it studied the feedback carefully and weighed the duties of financial institutions to protect users from losses they are not responsible for. It revised the guidelines to clarify that these institutions bear the loss if the unauthorised transaction is due to their action or omission.\n\nFintech firm TransferWise, which handles more than $1 billion in money transfers to and from Singapore each year, told The Straits Times that MAS is leading the way in Asia towards an \"activity-based regulatory framework\".\n\nIts head of banking Lukas May said: \"The way in which this regulation applies equally to all e-payment institutions - whether banks or stored value facility providers - is a sensible approach and helps build consumer trust in regulated non-banks.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nE-banking\n\nMAS/Monetary Authority of Singapore", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/colin-mas2-28.jpg?VersionId=TJDXrEE56n63UufE83hbJWSGxwuR_qGi", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

At around 7.20pm, officers spotted three suspects arriving at the location in a blue Suzuki. A white Volkswagen was also spotted arriving at the location a while later.\n\nA 21-year-old male passenger from the Suzuki was spotted leaving the car and approaching the Volkswagen. The Volkswagen then drove away from the area, and the 21-year-old returned to the Suzuki.\n\nCNB officers then moved in and arrested the suspects in the Suzuki, who are in their 20s. About 11kg of cannabis, enough to feed the addiction of about 1,570 abusers for a week, was found in the vehicle along with 31 LSD stamps.\n\nAt the same time, other officers tailed the Volkswagen to a carpark in the vicinity of Tampines Street 21, where two men alighted after parking the car.\n\nCNB officers arrested the two suspects, aged 26 and 29. A total of 524g of the drug \"Ice\" was found in the vehicle, and a small packet of the same drug was also found in the bag of the 26-year-old suspect.\n\nOfficers subsequently raided the residential unit of the 26-year-old suspect, located in the vicinity, and recovered about 16g of cannabis and a small amount of \"Ice\" from within the unit. A 26-year-old female, suspected to be a drug abuser, was also arrested at the unit.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

But he stood uncontested after three rivals boycotted the ballot.\n\nThe rivals accused a powerful and scandal-tainted former president named Jaseung of unfairly pulling strings in favour of Wonhaeng.\n\nJaseung's eight-year leadership of the sect, which ended in 2017, was marred by allegations of corruption, gambling and broken celibacy.\n\nHis successor Seoljeong then resigned last month after just nine months in office amid allegations that he forged his academic credentials, amassed vast wealth and fathered a child.\n\nOn Friday, representatives from from 26 pro-reform groups rallied outside the Jogye denomination's headquarters in central Seoul, calling for the cancellation of the leadership vote.\n\n\"This election has already become null and void with the resignation of the three other candidates,\" the group said in a statement, adding that the 318-member electoral college was acting like a rubber stamp for Jaseung.\n\nThey urged Wonhaeng to step down voluntarily and called for a direct referendum by lay members to elect a new president.\n\n\"Under the current system, even Buddha himself would have no election chance\", leading activist Chang Duck-soo said at the rally.\n\nBut Wonhaeng, who won more than two-thirds of 315 ballots cast on Friday, said his election had been democratic and that his critics should accept the outcome.\n\n\"I will do my best to have (the denomination) fully restore its Buddhist virtue\", the 65-year-old senior monk said at a post-election press conference.\n\nIn 1994 the sect's main temple in Seoul was the scene of violent clashes between rival factions of monks over control of the order's executive posts, with many monks and riot police injured.\n\nWhat is now South Korea was for centuries predominantly Buddhist with the Jogye sect coming to dominate.\n\nBut the late 20th century saw huge economic and social changes including enormously successful proselytising by Christian missionaries.\n\nA 2014 survey by Korea Gallup showed 22 per cent of South Koreans identify themselves as Buddhist, while nearly 30 per cent are Christian.\n\nSee more on\n\nSouth Korea\n\nBuddhism", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/colin-jo-28.jpg?VersionId=m83Mtl3YLI_0zEKzXLw3ftYqd1zukjz4", "alt_text": null}]}

Some web providers don't hold a government-issued operating license or liability insurance, the person said.\n\nThe move to regulate the sector comes as Beijing battles to overcome a consumer confidence crisis triggered by scandals in its drug industry. Millions of Chinese tourists are expected to hit the road in the coming days as the country begins an annual \"Golden Week\" break to mark its National Day holiday on Oct 1.\n\nThe ministry did not immediately reply to a faxed request for comment on Friday (Sept 28).\n\nURGENT PUSH\n\nBefore the regulation can be implemented, Chinese law stipulates that it must solicit opinions from the public.

The prices are fixed and not subject to dynamic pricing.\n\nIn addition, GrabShuttle Plus users can also expect six-seater vehicles when they make a booking.\n\nThe Grab spokesman explained that Grab aims to minimise the number of vehicles it uses on the road.\n\n\"By adding existing six-seater vehicles in our fleet, we help drivers maximise their time on the road, while serving more commuters efficiently,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe drivers will need to obtain the relevant licence and go through an additional training session to join GrabShuttle Plus.\n\nGrab also dismissed concerns that the expansion of GrabShuttle Plus might cannibalise its other services, such as GrabCar or JustGrab.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"By providing different transport options at different price points, we believe that we can serve more consumers with varying needs and budget.\"\n\nGrab also does not see itself competing with the Land Transport Authority's on-demand bus service, which will launch a trial run soon.\n\nGrab Singapore head of transport Andrew Chan said that Grab has received plenty of positive feedback from users since the launch of the trials.\n\nHe said: \"Many have also requested for us to expand this service to more neighbourhoods, while increasing accessibility for commuters in the north-eastern and eastern areas.\n\n\"We are confident that this expansion will address these needs and better utilise existing vehicles, while contributing to Singapore's car-lite vision.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nGrab\n\nCar-lite initiatives", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/akgsbus2809.jpg?VersionId=7oUEbbVLWBCYfLG2z2ABwfzYls.AKV0w", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

But that lead remains a narrow one, and there is little sign of it growing,\"said Mr John Curtice, senior research fellow at the National Centre for Social Research.\n\nMrs May, who voted to stay in the EU, is trying to clinch a divorce deal with the EU while grappling with an open rebellion in her Conservative Party, which convenes in the English city of Birmingham on Sunday for its annual party conference.\n\n\"There has been a collective failure of government, and a collapse of will by the British establishment, to deliver on the mandate of the people,\" Mr Johnson wrote.\n\nMrs May has repeatedly said her Brexit proposals are the only viable ones.\n\nA 30-year schism inside her party over Europe helped sink the premierships of the past three Conservative prime ministers - Mrs Margaret Thatcher, Mr John Major and Mr David Cameron.\n\nSee more on\n\nBritain\n\nBrexit\n\nTheresa May\n\nEU", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/yq-boris-280918.jpg?VersionId=zty7xWCOiC1JO0vm0vsh82IGprbnjzJN", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

From next year, all assessments and exams for Primary 1 and 2 pupils\n\nwill be removed\n\n. Teachers will continue using bite-sized forms of assessments like quizzes to gauge their pupils' learning but they will not be taken into account, as there will be no grades.\n\nCurrently, Primary 1 pupils do not have exams, but weighted assessments - which make up the final grade - are conducted throughout the year. Primary 2 pupils now have weighted assessments throughout the year, as well as a year-end exam.\n\n2. Secondary 1 students will also\n\nno longer have a mid-year exam from next year\n\n. From 2020 and 2021, this will also apply to Primary 3, Primary 5 and Sec 3 students. The aim is to free up more time for students during these transition years to adjust to the increased curriculum demands, such as taking on new subjects.\n\n3. The MOE will set guidelines for schools so that there should be only one class test per subject per term that can be counted towards the year-end score. In addition, teachers will use assessment tools such as worksheets, class work and homework to gauge students' learning progress.\n\n4. Report books\n\nwill from next year no longer show a student's position\n\nin relation to class or cohort, to allow each student to focus on his or her learning progress and discourage them from being overly concerned with comparisons. Failing marks will also not be highlighted, and other academic indicators like students' L1R5 (English plus five relevant subjects) or L1R4 score will not be reflected for the lower secondary levels.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

You don't travel to other countries to play their tennis courts or football pitches.\n\n\"The uniqueness of our game is that each golf course is written into the landscape of its home. This distinction creates a different, unique relationship between golf and tourism.\"\n\nIn addition to more than \u20ac106 million (S$168 million) of economic activity for Scotland, the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles brought in an extra \u20ac41 million to the nation from outside from about 62,000 spectators, nearly one in six who spent more time there as tourists.\n\nAdd more than 416 hours of global media exposure valued at \u20ac11.3 million for the nation and it's easy to see how France could eclipse that and become a hit with golfers who might have not considered the nation without the Ryder Cup.\n\nThere's also a more tangible legacy, with 89 \"pitch and putt\" style smaller courses built in France and nine more under construction to boost the sport's popularity with French citizens.\n\nAnd an educational programme for French schoolchildren about golf has reached more than 32,000 students in 1,300 classrooms, with plans to add another 10,000 students.\n\nSee more on\n\nGolf tournaments\n\nFrance", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/yq-ryder-280918.jpg?VersionId=xPdTFrTIgb23RRtRs9dr3sJaEQWfBelU", "alt_text": null}]}

Allscripts somehow got hold of the e-mail and forwarded it to Dr Chong.\n\nMr David Chambers, Allscripts Asia Pacific chief executive officer, wrote in an e-mail to Dr Chong saying that the matter was \"very serious\" and must be taken as \"genuine\" as Mr Zhao had worked for Allscripts in its development laboratory.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Mr Zhao was also dismissed by Dr Chong and escorted out of the office on the same day.\n\nOn Friday, IHiS' lawyer, Senior Counsel Philip Jeyaretnam, said that Mr Zhao, during a private hearing a day before, had confessed he was \"angry\" with IHiS and Allscripts over not being allowed to do coding. As a result, Mr Zhao would not have shared details of the flaw with IHiS to help the organisation.\n\nIn contrast, Mr Zhao's supervisor, Ms Angela Chen, testified during Friday's public hearing that he had a good relationship with his colleagues, and was a \"very good worker\" and \"technically strong\".\n\nFormed in 2008, IHiS is an agency which runs the IT systems of all public healthcare institutions here.\n\nMs Foong Lai Choo, IHiS director of programme delivery for clinical care, was also sent the first e-mail Dr Chong sent to Mr Kua.

Shoppers will also be able to search for their car in the carpark using a video system that can scan licence plates.\n\nThe former Funan DigitaLife Mall in North Bridge Road, which closed in July 2016, has been undergoing a $560 million transformation into an integrated development centred on lifestyle, technology, and the arts.\n\nAbout 70 per cent of Funan's retail space has already been leased to tenants such as Golden Village, FairPrice Finest and theatre company Wild Rice.\n\nNew tenants announced on Friday include foldable bike brand Brompton Bicycle, which will be opening its flagship Singapore store, a farm-to-table restaurant concept by Spa Esprit Group and gaming store GamePro, which will host eSports tournaments in a dedicated eSports zone in the mall.\n\nCapitaLand Group's president and group chief executive Lee Chee Koon said that with the growing market share of online sales, brick-and-mortar businesses must go beyond passively selling products and services and create quality retail experiences and emotional connections.\n\n\"We are taking a close examination of our retail portfolio in Singapore and abroad to identify areas for reinvention,\" he said.\n\nElaborating on the use of facial recognition technology, Mr Tan said some may choose to have their faces scanned to receive personal recommendations.\n\nFor instance, CapitaStar loyalty programme members who provide consent may in the future have their faces scanned to receive personal recommendations based on their purchase history.\n\n\"The idea is that a retailer has a digital screen or wall that can recognise I am a CapitaStar member and have been a previous customer of that store, and the screen will be customised for me,\" said Mr Tan, who added that facial recognition technology may also be used for entry at Funan's office complex as well as lyf Funan.\n\nOther plans for the CapitaStar programme, which has about 920,000 members, include having data captured from receipts provided to members as insights into their spending patterns, he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalls\n\nRetail", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/bp_funan_280918_72.jpg?VersionId=L9xTrmmLnNg4OdnHTOqt_ZBLQvo3BZ1_", "alt_text": null}]}

From 2019, all graded assessments and examinations at Primary 2 will also be removed to give young pupils two test-free years. Teachers will use qualitative descriptors to report on their pupils' learning.\n\nAnd to stress the message that\n\nlearning is not a competition\n\n, report books\n\nwill no longer state the class and level ranking of a student\n\nat both primary and secondary levels. Marks for each subject will be rounded off and presented as whole numbers, without decimal points, to reduce the excessive focus on marks.\n\nThe MOE will also adjust the academic criteria for awarding Edusave awards in Primary 1 and 2, focusing more on pupils' attitudes towards learning.\n\nThese changes, announced by the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Friday (Sept 28), were described by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung as a step forward in improving the balance between the joy of learning and the rigour of education.\n\n\"We are at a strong position of rigour, and can afford to unwind a bit without undermining the performance outcomes,\" he told the media at a press conference.\n\nThe changes will also encourage teachers to explore different ways of teaching. He said: \"On the ground, teachers are on a high-speed train... rushing, assessments, and preparing the students for exams... I think it's time to take a pause.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

It will free up about three weeks of curriculum time every two years.\n\nIn a speech to school heads earlier this week when he briefed them on the changes, Mr Ong urged educators to use the time well to use applied and inquiry-based learning. For example, to calculate area, the child can be given a formula. Alternatively, they can asked to brainstorm how they can find out the size of their school field and even taken down to the school field to measure it for themselves.\n\nHe said that the moves instituted over the last few years, from not naming the top Primary School Leaving Examination scorers, changing the PSLE scoring system and now cutting down on school examinations are all part of a new phase of change in Singapore's education system here - one he termed \"Learn for Life\".\n\n\"Learn for Life is a value, an attitude and a skill that our students need to possess, and it is fundamental in ensuring that education remains an uplifting force in society. It is what underpins the SkillsFuture movement. It also has to be a principal consideration in our school system,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it may be hard to predict the jobs of tomorrow but looking at the changes, educators know that students need to be resilient, adaptable and global in their outlook.\n\n\"They must leave the education system still feeling curious and eager to learn, for the rest of their lives.

What is the difference between weighted assessments and non-weighted assessments?\n\nAssessment is the process of gathering and analysing evidence about student learning to enhance teaching and learning, and to inform educational decision-making.\n\nBoth weighted and non-weighted assessments are conducted to check for understanding and to use the information to support students in achieving the intended learning outcomes. Teachers conduct these assessments to find out what students have learnt, provide them with feedback on learning gaps and their mastery of concepts, and improve teaching and learning. Information from these assessments also serves to provide a gauge of students' academic competencies and readiness for the next level of education.\n\nThe difference is that the score from a weighted assessment counts towards a student's overall result in a subject for the semester or the year.\n\n2. What are the key transition stages for students in primary and secondary education and why do we need to pay attention to the transition?\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select. Stay informed.\n\nSingapore\n\nSingapore to train more aviation and maritime officials from around the world\n\nSingapore\n\nSpecial edition SG60 Nets card now on sale for $10\n\nSingapore\n\n18 years\u2019 jail for woman who hacked adoptive father to death after tussle over Sengkang flat\n\nBusiness\n\nSingapore\u2019s economy sees surprise expansion in Q2 despite US tariff uncertainty: Advance estimate\n\nSingapore\n\nJail, caning for man who had 285 child porn videos, including those that show infants\n\nSingapore\n\nJail for woman who opened bank accounts that received over $640.7m, including scam proceeds\n\nSingapore\n\nDriver assisting with police probe after e-bike rider injured in hit-and-run in Hougang\n\nSport\n\nAfter Olympic heartbreak, Singaporean swimmer Chantal Liew turns pain into inspiration\n\nStudents move through various transition stages from lower, to middle and upper primary, and then from upper primary to lower secondary, and upper secondary. During these transition years, students may offer new subjects or take up more subjects as part of progression to the next level of learning. For example, at Primary 3, students learn science as a subject for the first time and at Sec 1, students offer more subjects compared to the primary level, including new subjects such as history and design and technology.\n\nAt these key transition stages, we want to provide students with adequate time and space to adjust to the increased curriculum demands. This can help them to manage this transition more smoothly and with greater confidence, and not feel rushed into being exam-ready just half way through the transition year.\n\n3. With the mid-year exams removed for Primary 3, Primary 5, Sec 1 and Sec 3 - will this raise the stakes of the year-end examination?\n\nSchool-based assessments, including the year-end exam, are platforms to inform and enhance teaching and learning. They are not high-stake in nature.\n\nWhile the mid-year exam is removed in the transition years, schools can still conduct weighted assessments such as class tests, projects and presentations at suitable junctures in the academic year.\n\nSchools will be guided on how to assign appropriate weightings for the different assessments.\n\n4. There are some schools that have already done away with continual assessments and mid-year exams for all levels. Will these schools be asked to review their existing school-based assessment structures, to align with MOE's focus on implementing these measures only at the transition levels?\n\nThe aim of adjusting the school-based assessment structures is to reduce the overemphasis on academic results and to nurture a stronger intrinsic motivation to learn in our students. The changes are meant to establish a minimum threshold on the recalibration of the assessment load. Schools that have made more reduction to the assessment load than this minimum threshold are not required to reverse their reduction.\n\nFor instance, a secondary school that has removed mid-year exams for Sec 1 to Sec 3 need not reinstate the exam in Sec 2.\n\n5. At Primary 1, 2, 3, 5 and Sec 1 and 3 - what will schools put in place to replace mid-year exams and weighted assessments?\n\nThe removal of mid-year exams will free up to about three weeks of curriculum time for each two-year block (that is, Primary 3 and Primary 4, Primary 5 and Primary 6, Sec 1 and 2, Sec 3 and 4). Schools are encouraged to use the time and space freed up for quality teaching and learning.\n\nSchools can use this time to pace out teaching and learning and adopt varied pedagogies to deepen students' learning. For example, schools could leverage applied and inquiry based teaching and learning approaches to encourage students to observe, investigate, reflect, and create knowledge as part of their learning processes. This will further enrich our students' learning experiences and enable them to learn deeply and develop holistically, especially in 21st century competencies.\n\nSchools will also continue to use non-weighted assessments to support students' learning, inform their learning progress and address learning gaps.\n\n6. Will students' readiness for the national exams be reduced?\n\nTo provide students with timely and specific feedback and address any learning gaps that they might have, teachers will regularly gather information about students' understanding and content mastery through checkpoints such as reviewing students' homework, class work and tests.\n\nThe other exam points, such as the year-end exam and the mid-year exams in other academic years, will continue to provide adequate opportunities to assess students' ability to apply their learning across a range of topics or subjects, and familiarise them with the national exam requirements\n\n7. How will a student's academic progress be measured if there are completely no exams and weighted assessments at Primary 1 and 2?\n\nWith the removal of all exams and weighted assessments at Primary 1 and 2, schools will continue to use non-weighted assessments to support students' learning, inform their learning progress and address learning gaps.\n\nSchools will continue with their current practices to gather information about students' learning through checkpoints such as class discussions, class work, homework and bite-sized tests. The change is that these assessments no longer count towards an overall result.\n\nInstead of using marks and grades, schools will now use qualitative descriptors to report students' learning progress in the Holistic Development Profile (HDP).\n\n8. Will the removal of all weighted assessments for Primary 1 and 2 students risk over-correcting the school-based assessment load?\n\nLearning at the early stages, particularly at the lower primary levels, should focus on building students' confidence and intrinsic motivation to learn, and avoid conditioning them to be extrinsically motivated from a young age.\n\nFeedback from students, teachers, school leaders, and parents on the removal of year-end exam in Primary 1 and mid-year exam at both Primary 1 and 2 since 2010 has been positive.\n\nSchools have observed that students have more time to learn, and experience more joy in their learning. Teachers use the freed-up lesson time to focus on enhancing content mastery, and academic rigour has not been affected.\n\nWhile all weighted assessments will be removed for Primary 1 and 2 students, schools will continue to conduct non-weighted assessments regularly to gauge students' mastery of learning outcomes. Students will also be provided with opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of the concepts taught.\n\n9. How will schools ensure the quality of teaching and learning?\n\nExams serve only as periodic points to gather information on teaching and learning practices. Above and beyond exams, schools have been adopting and will continue to adopt practices that ensure quality teaching and learning, such as through lesson observations, monitoring of students' daily assignments, mentoring of teachers and engaging them in professional discussions.\n\n10. What kind of support will MOE/schools be rendering to parents to help them better understand the changes to school-based assessments?\n\nParents' support and partnership are crucial in making the changes impactful to our students. Schools, with the support from MOE, will be communicating these changes to parents next year, to help them better understand the rationale behind the changes and how they impact their children.\n\nSchools will also be gathering parents' feedback and addressing their concerns through regular updates and touchpoints, such as Meet-the-Parents sessions.\n\nSee more on\n\nPrimary school\n\nSecondary school\n\nMinistry of Education", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/jteaxm280918.jpg?VersionId=3xJT0XGHwRh74FhsgdR_gipPSrD8WxXp", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

While slight, it marked first decline since March 2016, a cooling sign for one of the world's more expensive property markets.\n\nStill, prices have surged 11.7 per cent so far this year, and rocketed 16 per cent year-on-year, according to Reuters' calculations based on an index compiled by Hong Kong's Rating and Valuation Department.\n\nUltra low interest rates, limited housing supply and large flows of capital from mainland Chinese buyers helped push housing prices up 165 per cent over a decade, prompting repeated warnings from authorities about the risks of an asset bubble.\n\nSoaring real estate prices have angered many Hong Kong residents and prompted the city's government to set aside plots of land for public housing and propose a vacancy tax on empty new homes to discourage developers from hoarding.\n\nThe latest UBS Global Real Estate Bubble Index published on Thursday ranked Hong Kong as the city with the greatest bubble risk.\n\nPeople who earn the average annual income in the highly skilled service sector would need to work 22 years to afford a 60 square metre (646 sq ft) flat, surging from 12 years required 10 years ago, the study showed.\n\nA flat of that size on Hong Kong Island cost an average of HK$10.8 million (S$1.89 million) in August, according to official data.\n\nBut the days of cheap money are coming to an end.\n\nHong Kong commercial banks raised their benchmark lending rates on Thursday for the first time in 12 years, increasing the cost of home mortgage repayments. More hikes are expected into 2019.\n\nIncreasingly, potential home buyers have stayed on the sidelines.\n\nAccording to a survey published by realtor Hong Kong Property Services last week, 33 per cent of the 379 respondents said they were considering buying an apartment in the next 12 months, less than the 36 per cent surveyed in the second quarter and 64 per cent in the first quarter.\n\nData from another realtor Centaline showed total housing transaction volume in September was expected to shrink to the lowest since July 2017.\n\nTo lure buyers, developers were selling new flats at prices closer to the secondary market, with premiums dropping to 5.3 per cent in the third quarter to the lowest in seven quarters, according to Midland Realty data. The premium was 20.7 per cent in the second quarter.\n\nMany investment banks and realtors revised their forecasts on Hong Kong property prices in the last few week, predicting a 10 to 15 per cent correction in the next 12 months.\n\n\"But a sharp correction seems unlikely, given the pent-up investment demand and ongoing low mortgage rates,\" UBS said in a report.\n\nSee more on\n\nProperty prices\n\nHong Kong", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/akhkboat2809.jpg?VersionId=A7Ve1HFA3Mua0lNh5geGnLJPvTbDrQ2z", "alt_text": null}]}

They have to weigh at least 45kg.\n\nDonors who have not made a donation in the past 12 weeks are also encouraged to come forward.\n\nTo donate blood, Singaporeans are required to take along their NRIC, while non-Singaporeans should go with their passport.\n\nA signed parental consent form is required for 16- or 17-year-old donors.\n\nThe form can be found at www.hsa.gov.sg/parent_consent\n\nBefore a donation, donors are advised to eat a light meal and drink plenty of fluids.\n\nThey should also ensure that they have adequate rest the night before the donation and on the day itself.\n\nFor more information, or to make an appointment, visit www.hsa.gov.sg/donor_criteria or call 6220-0183.\n\nInformation on upcoming community blood drives can be found at www.redcross.sg/donateblood\n\nCommunity and corporate groups who wish to organise group donations at the blood banks can call the Singapore Red Cross on 6220-0183 for more details.\n\nSee more on\n\nBlood donation\n\nHealth Sciences Authority\n\nRed Cross", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/nh-blood-280918.jpg?VersionId=MjUVgPe1pTwB7M3xz9hJTjctqdm_Ng2A", "alt_text": null}]}

Did I steal even one peso?\" Mr Duterte said. \"My only sin is the extrajudicial killings.\" He did not elaborate.\n\nBut it was the first time Mr Duterte publicly acknowledged that extrajudicial killings by the authorities had occurred in his presidency, and it added credibility to claims by rights groups that he had engineered mass killings of alleged drug suspects.\n\nTwo criminal complaints against the President have been filed with the International Criminal Court, based in The Hague. Angered by what he called foreign interference in the Philippines' internal affairs, Mr Duterte subsequently pulled out of an international treaty that established the court.\n\nThe Philippine National Police estimate that they have killed about 4,500 users and dealers in drug enforcement operations in the past two years, and insist that all of the killings were legitimate uses of force.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The SDT and SDC are better ways. By detaining, delaying and diverting storm runoff before it can do serious harm, the SDT and SDC offer long-term flood protection for Orchard Road.\"\n\nThe two new drainage projects will ease the load on Stamford Canal, which is 4.7km long and runs from Tanglin to the Marina Reservoir, by about 30 per cent.\n\nThe 2km-long SDC will divert excess rainwater from Holland Road, Napier Road and Grange Road - which are in the upstream section of Stamford Catchment - into the nearby Singapore River, which then merges with the Marina Reservoir farther on. Rainwater runoff from these areas would flow into Stamford Canal otherwise.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Its capacity is 38,000 cubic metres, or 15 Olympic sized swimming pools.\n\nIt will take around four hours to completely empty the tank when it is full.\n\nWhen the rain stops and sensors detect that the drains are less than 25 per cent filled, the water from the tank will be pumped back and released.\n\nOrchard Road Business Association (Orba) executive director Steven Goh said that they welcomed the two projects \"very very much\".\n\n\"There was some inconvenience during the eight-year planning and construction, such as taking two minutes longer to get from one building to another due to traffic diversions, but all of our stakeholders were supportive because they understood why this project was being done,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the two drainage projects, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said one of the key challenges was minimising disruption to users of the Orchard Road area.\n\n\"PUB engineers had to exercise great care to protect the structural integrity of nearby buildings and roads,\" he said, adding: \"Throughout the four years of construction, motorists remained unaware that they were driving on top of major tunnelling works, as the roads above remained open and safe to use.\"\n\nMr Masagos said: \"The Government has invested $1.2 billion in drainage improvement works since 2012 and will spend another $500 million in the next two to three years... We have to prioritise our investments and look for cost-effective and practical solutions to meet our needs. The SDT and SDC are key outcomes of (this) pragmatic approach.\"\n\nAssistant Professor Aron Meltzner from the Earth Observatory of Singapore said it is almost impossible to calculate how much extra capacity the SDC and SDT would have if the same rains as 2010 and 2011 happened because many factors cause floods.\n\n\"If a similar deluge happens in a slightly different location, say even 1 km away from where it happened in 2011, the water would take a different path and the details would be different,\" said Prof Meltzner.\n\nHe said that Singapore should expect more intense rains because of climate change, and that the highly developed urban landscape adds to the country's flood risk.\n\nSee more on\n\nPUB\n\nEnvironmental issues\n\nMasagos Zulkifli\n\nLimited-time offer\n\nGet a FREE Xiaomi vacuum cleaner (worth $109) with your subscription!\n\nBilled at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Not only was a potential justice on the highest court raging against one of the country's two major political parties, but he was also levelling a serious allegation - that the process itself was being manipulated.\n\nIn her testimony,\n\nhis accuser, Dr Christine Blasey Ford\n\n, stressed that, despite having sent her allegations to two Democrats in Congress, she viewed herself as non-partisan.\"I am nobody's pawn,\" she said.\n\nBut over the course of Thursday's hearing, partisan tensions repeatedly boiled over as Republicans echoed Judge Kavanaugh's claim that the Democrats had engineered the process to ensure his demise in the final weeks before the mid-term elections.\n\nAt issue was whether the Democrats, who had first received Dr Blasey Ford's allegations in an early July letter that she sent to her local congresswoman, had purposefully waited to make them public until after the initial confirmation hearings were over and the Senate was preparing to vote.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

I don't know who leaked the information, but it wasn't my office.\"\n\nUnder questioning during the hearing from Ms Rachel Mitchell, an Arizona sex crimes prosecutor hired by the Republicans, Dr Blasey Ford acknowledged that she had contacted two Democratic lawmakers with her allegations.\n\nShe said that she made her initial contact upon learning that Judge Kavanaugh was on the shortlist of possible picks but before he was nominated, and that she had intended to remain anonymous.\n\nWhile it has become common for senators to engage in partisan jousting over judicial nominations, Judge Kavanaugh took an unusual path for a nominee in tying himself so closely with President Donald Trump and the GOP.\n\nBy turns seething and scornful, Judge Kavanaugh seemed to adopt Mr Trump's assertion on Wednesday that the attacks against him were a \"con job\".\n\nIn fighting back so forcefully, Mr Kavanaugh also adopted the President's oft-stated belief in hitting back 100 times harder against attackers.\n\nSoon after the hearing ended, Mr Trump issued a tweet praising Judge Kavanaugh's testimony as \"powerful, honest, and riveting\".\n\nMr Trump borrowed a line from Judge Kavanaugh, who cited the constitutional role of the Senate during the hearing to say that Democrats had \"replaced advise and consent with search and destroy\".\n\nSaid Mr Trump in his tweet: \"Democrats' search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist.\"\n\nCasting aside the norms of decorum that have traditionally characterised such Senate hearings - norms that Judge Kavanaugh had largely adhered to during his earlier appearances - the nominee appeared unconstrained as he expressed clear hostility toward Democratic members.\n\n\"Since my nomination in July, there's been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything, to block my nomination,\" Judge Kavanaugh said.\n\nDemocrats, he said, want to \"blow me up and take me down\".\n\nHe lashed out at the Democrats for their behaviour at his prior appearance, likening their treatment of him to Democrats' successful effort decades earlier to defeat the nomination of conservative Judge Robert Bork.\n\n\"The behaviour of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment,\" he said. \"But at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at Borking.\"\n\nWhen Ms Feinstein complained that the FBI wasn't interviewing witnesses and providing the committee with facts, Judge Kavanaugh interjected: \"You're interviewing me. You're - you're doing it, senator. I'm sorry to interrupt.\"\n\nMs Feinstein then asked him whether allegations by two other women - who didn't testify on Thursday - \"are wrong\".\n\nAsked about an allegation by another accuser, Ms Julie Swetnick, who said Judge Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct at parties, Judge Kavanaugh said her allegation was a \"a joke. That is a farce.\"\n\n\"Would you like to say more about it?\" Ms Feinstein asked.\n\n\"No,\" Judge Kavanaugh responded.\n\nWhen Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, asked whether he had suffered memory loss from drinking, Judge Kavanaugh denied it and then challenged her, saying \"You're asking about blackout. I don't know, have you?\"\n\nShe ignored his query, and he later apologised.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh also responded to questions from Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse about his drinking by telling the Rhode Island senator, \"I like beer.\"\n\nWhen Mr Whitehouse said Judge Kavanaugh was ducking his question, Judge Kavanaugh interjected: \"Do you like beer, senator, or not?\"\n\nJudge Kavanaugh's testimony could raise questions about his temperament and whether, if he is confirmed, he can ever be seen as a neutral figure on the Supreme Court.\n\nDr Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor and expert on ethics, said Judge Kavanaugh's responses to Democratic questioners were \"ill advised\".\n\n\"We can only assume that he's doing this for an audience of one, who may be watching,\" Dr Gillers said, referring to Mr Trump.\n\nDr Gillers said Judge Kavanaugh was \"exhibiting the very uncontrolled anger that others have described as a problem he has when drunk, but he's not drunk. He's squandering the sympathy some of his opening statement encouraged. Or he just doesn't know how to handle cross-examination and no one prepared him.\"\n\nAnalysts said that while the hearing was always expected to be partisan, Thursday's testimony marked a remarkable devolution from which the Senate will struggle to recover.\n\n\"What we saw all afternoon from both Judge Kavanaugh and senators in the majority was an effort to portray this whole episode as a nefarious plot,\" said Dr Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.\n\n\"People can disagree about whether they find that claim plausible, but for the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the country, it's a sad moment - and a very bad look.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nSex offences", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/akkavanaugh2809.jpg?VersionId=ktw5aBkQKRrMEXacV09lnyLUm4VcaMie", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The Senate must vote!\"\n\nDr Christine Blasey Ford\n\n, a California psychology professor, told the Senate on Thursday (Sept 27) that\n\nJudge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\n\nwhile they were both in high school. She said she is \"one hundred per cent\" certain Judge Kavanaugh is the one who attacked her.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh tearfully and \"unequivocally\" denied sexually assaulting Dr Ford.\n\nHe accused Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee of dragging out his confirmation and turning the process into \"'a national disgrace\".\n\nJudge Kavanaugh's appointment may now hinge\n\non how his testimony and that of his accuser is assessed by a handful of Republican senators who so far have avoided taking a position on his confirmation, including Ms Susan Collins of Maine, Ms Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mr Jeff Flake of Arizona. Each said they wanted to watch the hearing before making up their minds.\n\nShe told of fearing she would die as she was pinned to a bed, her mouth covered to keep her from screaming.\n\nShe said the 1982 incident - including the \"uproarious laughter\" of Judge Kavanaugh and his friend who she says witnessed the attack - was \"seared into my memory\" even though she didn't remember all the details.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh repeatedly flashed his anger at Democrats on the panel, scowling, arguing with them and jabbing his finger toward the table in front of him.\n\n\"This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fuelled with apparently pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside, left-wing opposition groups,\" Judge Kavanaugh told the committee. \"This is a circus.\"\n\nThe Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination on Friday, and the full Senate could act as early as next week.\n\nThe outcome and how the American public perceives it could redefine the \"Me Too\" era and affect the fight for control of Congress in the Nov 6 election.\n\n\"I was not at the party described by Dr Ford,\" Judge Kavanaugh said as he tried to save his nomination in the face of public claims of sexual misconduct by three women.\n\nDr Ford said she was pushed into a bedroom and attacked while attending a small gathering.\n\nDemocratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois challenged Judge Kavanaugh to ask the White House to order the FBI to question other witnesses about Dr Ford's allegations against him, a suggestion rejected by Mr Trump and Senate Republicans.\n\n\"You know that's a phony question because the FBI doesn't reach conclusions,\" Judge Kavanaugh responded.\n\nSoon afterward, GOP Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina erupted in anger.\n\n\"What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020,\" he said, pointing angrily at his Democratic colleagues. \"This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics.\"\n\nDr Ford told the committee that she's an independent person and \"no one's pawn\".\n\nShe said she was \"terrified\" to testify before the committee and that she \"agonised daily\" about whether to come forward with her claim.\n\nDr Ford said the attack occurred after she went upstairs to use the bathroom. She said she was pushed into a bedroom and onto a bed and that Judge Kavanaugh got on top of her. His friend was in the room and encouraged the attack, she said.\n\n\"I believed he was going to rape me,\" Dr Ford said.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh put his hand on her mouth to keep her from screaming, she said, and because it was hard for her to breathe, \"I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me.\"\n\nShe said the friend, who has denied any part in such an attack, jumped on them and she was able to escape.\n\nAsked what she remembers from that night, Dr Ford responded: \"The stairwell, the living room, the bedroom, the bed on the right side of the room as you walk into the room - there was a bed to the right - the bathroom in close proximity, the laughter - the uproarious laughter - and the multiple attempts to escape and the final ability to do so.\"\n\nJudge Kavanaugh said Dr Ford's allegation is \"refuted by the very people she says were there\", who have said they don't recall the gathering.\n\nA second woman, Ms Deborah Ramirez of Colorado, claims Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken party when they were freshmen at Yale University.\n\nAnd in the most lurid allegation yet, Ms Julie Swetnick of Washington said in a sworn statement released on Wednesday that Judge Kavanaugh took part in efforts during high school to get girls intoxicated so that a group of boys could have sex with them.\n\n\"The Swetnick thing is a joke, that is a farce,\" Judge Kavanaugh said at the hearing.\n\nRepublicans are trying to get Judge Kavanaugh, 53, confirmed as early as next week.

The counter went into the midday trading break up by 46 cents, or 28.22 per cent, to $2.09. It was the second-most active stock on a churn of 21.6 million shares on Friday, more popular than even blue chip telco Singtel.\n\nKeppel T&T was up by 51 cents, or 37.5 per cent, at $1.87, on 6.3 million shares.\n\nThe offerors were also on the actives list. Keppel Corp slipped by $0.12, or 1.68 per cent, to $7.04, but SPH was ahead by 3 cents, or 1.08 per cent, to $2.82.\n\nRHB Securities said in a report on Friday morning that it believed the M1 offer to be fair, and \"at an attractive premium\", based on the telco's enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio of nine times.\n\nThe offer \"presents an opportunity for minorities to exit, given intense competition in the market, which portends downside risks to M1's earnings and dividends\", it said.\n\nCGS-CIMB analyst Foong Choong Chen upgraded M1 from \"hold\" to \"add\", writing in a Thursday note that the offer is likely to go through even if Malaysian carrier Axiata Group, which is the largest single shareholder in M1, does not accept the deal.\n\nBut OCBC Investment Research analyst Joseph Ng said that his team has not ruled out the possibility of either a hike in the M1 offer price or Axiata launching its own offer, based on Axiata's statement that it would \"evaluate options available\" for its stake.\n\nMeanwhile, UOB Kay Hian called both offers \"fair\", in a note on Friday morning, and urged shareholders to accept them.\n\nAnalyst Jonathan Koh said that M1 shareholders could \"avoid a painful period of intense competition and (average revenue per user) erosion\" if they tendered their shares to the offeror ahead of TPG Telecom's arrival in the Singapore market.\n\n\"We expect the consolidation of the mobile industry from four to three players to materialise in 2021 or beyond,\" he added. \"Holding on to M1 shares would subject investors to a long wait before industry consolidation materialises.\"\n\nFoo Zhiwei, also an analyst at UOB Kay Hian, added that the Keppel T&T privatisation attempt marked \"a clean exit for minority shareholders\".\n\n\"The deal is at a 26.5 per cent premium to our fair value of $1.51, and likely reflects the future value of its data centre project pipeline,\" he said. \"The offer gives investors the chance to cash in on the potential now, rather than await its execution over a longer period.\"\n\nThe team of UOB Kay Hian analysts wrote, in a reference to mafia movie The Godfather, that Keppel Corp was making \"offers you can't refuse\".\n\nOCBC's Mr Ng said: \"As we understand, SPH would be looking to leverage M1's mobile platform to offer on-demand and ready digital content.\n\n\"Nonetheless, we note that the anticipated transformation... could see dividends from M1 being affected, not only because of the competitive landscape, but also due to the allocation of resources as part of the transformation efforts.\"\n\nCGS-CIMB analyst Ngoh Yi Sin told BT on Thursday evening that the house is neutral about the impact of the deal on SPH \"as we see little strategic reason for additional investment in M1\", but added that it could be \"slightly earnings-accretive\" if SPH manages to hike its effective stake in M1 to the maximum 16.13 per cent.\n\nIts balance sheet \"is still healthy and should not have issues funding the potential $51 million investment needed\", she added in an e-mail.\n\nSee more on\n\nM1\n\nKeppel Corp\n\nSingapore Press Holdings\n\nTakeover/Buyout", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/nm-collagecompany-2609.jpg?VersionId=eP8eZ5NMf.vxf56Zy1hsY1Dqx87N4kzo", "alt_text": null}]}

We are asking Okinawa to provide those bases. That has a great influence on the degree of cooperation with the US.\"\n\nUnnerved by Mr Trump's apparent willingness to turn his back on traditional US allies, the ruling parties are anxious to show that Japan is keeping its end of the military bargain.\n\nAn opportunity presented itself when anti-base Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga, died in August, forcing an election earlier than expected.\n\n\"They are afraid that a short-tempered leader like Donald Trump could just say forget it and pull the Marines out altogether\" should the project not go forward, said Mr Hiroshi Meguro, research fellow at Hosei University Institute of Okinawan Studies in Tokyo.\n\nIf Mr Abe's coalition manages to defeat Mr Tamaki, construction on the base could speed up, he added.\n\nDespite comprising just 0.6 per cent of Japan's total land area, Okinawa is home to more than 1.4 million people and welcomed more tourists last year than Hawaii.\n\nOne of the country's poorest prefectures, it also hosts roughly half of the 50,000 Japan-based US military personnel, a legacy of the post-war occupation that ended in 1972.\n\nAt the core of the dispute is the planned move of the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma - located in the heart of Ginowan city - to a less heavily populated area.\n\nIn exchange for closing the facility and freeing the land for development, Japan agreed to allow new runways to be constructed on reclaimed land off the coast at Henoko. Mr Abe agreed in 2016 to suspend work on the project in a bid to end the ongoing battle with the island's government and residents over the issue.\n\nPolls show the relocation is opposed by most Okinawans, who want the base moved out of the prefecture altogether - or even out of the country.\n\nMr Tamaki and his supporters agree, though many say they are not against Japan's alliance with the US.\n\n\"We can't allow the base to be built using bayonets and bulldozers, against the will of the people,\" said Mr Morimasa Goya, chairman of Okinawa-based business conglomerate Kanehide Group, who is campaigning for Mr Tamaki.\n\nMr Tamaki has said his father returned to the US before he was born. But he grew up fascinated with Western rock music - hanging around outside bars catering to the military as a teenager just to hear what was being played on the jukebox.\n\nHe learned the guitar, and videos on YouTube show him playing a Jimi Hendrix cover with his \"middle-aged man band\".\n\nA national lawmaker, he emerged as a candidate last month after former Okinawa governor Onaga - who won a landslide victory four years ago - reportedly named him as a successor in a recording made shortly before dying of cancer.\n\nHe has since faced both a rushed timeline and the might of Mr Abe's long-ruling LDP and its partners.\n\nA Yomiuri newspaper poll carried out from Sept 21-23 found he and Mr Sakima were neck-and-neck, though it didn't report percentages.\n\nIf Mr Tamaki wins, the base's opponents will dig their heels in, said Ms Keiko Itozaku, an independent Upper House lawmaker campaigning for him.\n\n\"The people of Okinawa will do anything, they will stage sit-ins, and they will block it,\" she told Bloomberg News. \"They have done this all along and it has prevented the base being built for 20 years.\"\n\nBut a victory for Mr Abe's favoured candidate would embolden Tokyo to push ahead with construction by any means at its disposal, she said.\n\n\"As Okinawans, all of us would prefer it if Henoko weren't built and the facility could be outside the prefecture or outside the country,\" said Mr Tetsuji Matsumoto, mayor of the Okinawa town of Urasoe and Mr Sakima's campaign manager.\n\n\"But our opinions differ on whether that is realistically possible.\"\n\nHe said the decision on the base should be left to Japan's court system, and that local people should seek to make the best use of the returned land.\n\nMr Matsumoto also wants help from Tokyo to improve infrastructure and relieve the congestion that has turned Okinawa into an \"island of traffic jams\".\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nElections\n\nDonald Trump\n\nShinzo Abe", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/bp_denny_tamaki_280918_38.jpg?VersionId=Nx.qKsNKy.xsLzhojLWfiApfnnZAgKLd", "alt_text": null}]}

CDW had held 82.36 per cent in ABio before the deal, and will be left with just shy of half the company.\n\nUnder the transaction agreement, Tomoike also has the option, but not an obligation, to buy up to 140,000 shares in ABio from Mr Yoshimi - whose father, Kunikazu, owns 50.51 per cent of CDW - for five years after a proposed initial public offering. It will pay 85 per cent of whatever the ABio market share price is at the time that it gives notice of exercising the option.\n\nProceeds from the proposed disposal will be used entirely for working capital purposes, said CDW, adding that the sale consideration is worth about twice as much as the net asset value attributable to the shares, based on unaudited management accounts as at June 30.\n\nNo valuation was commissioned for the disposal, with negotiations based instead on valuations from an initial share issue to seven third-party subscribers in June, including ABio management.\n\nThe payment will be made in three tranches, with the last one due by Oct 31, 2019. The company also disclosed that CDW will receive three million yen (S$36,210) a month from ABio from Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2018, as fees under a joint research and development and assistance agreement.\n\nCDW noted in its announcement that ABio was incorporated after Tomoike entered the life sciences business when it bought 95 per cent of synthetic antibody firm GSP Enterprise on Dec 31, 2017.\n\n\"The life science business, as undertaken by GSP and ABio, represents a non-core business of the group and ABio is not a principal subsidiary of the group,\" it said, adding that ABio's business is in a high-risk stage and highly dependent on cash flow.\n\nGiving its rationale for the deal, CDW said that \"the group wishes to realise some value of its initial investment in ABio and also to further align (with) the interest of Mr Yoshimi\", who it called \"instrumental in the early-stage development of ABio\". It added that Mr Yoshimi already has a personal network of contacts in the research, government and pharmaceutical field, in Japan and South Korea.\n\nAfter the disposal, Tomoike will have one director on the six-person ABio board, with three directors to be nominated by Mr Yoshimi, alongside two independent directors. \"After the proposed disposal, the company will hold less than 50 per cent of ABio and does not exercise board and management control over ABio, and will no longer recognise ABio as a subsidiary of the group,\" said CDW.\n\nCDW closed flat at $0.235 on Thursday, before the news.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore companies\n\nSGX", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/23/placeholdernewspapers.jpg?VersionId=esswv71oN18vPBJdh.KkINsI5ZmOgPjr", "alt_text": null}]}

She did not want to be there. She was badly in need of caffeine.\n\nWhen Dr Christine Blasey Ford, a 51-year-old California university professor, entered a hearing room on Capitol Hill on Thursday (Sept 27) morning - returning to a city she fled decades ago to publicly relive the sexual assault that first prompted her to leave - she was not sure she would make it through her opening statement.\n\nBut Dr Blasey Ford, surrounded by her lawyers, publicists and a sisterhood of friends who had convened to support her and zealously protect her privacy, said her piece.\n\nShe delivered a harrowing tale of casual teenage violence that put a human face on an allegation that has threatened a Supreme Court nomination and captured the attention of the nation in the throes of a profound reckoning with the realities of sexual assault.\n\nVisibly anxious but firm in her recollections\n\n, traumatised but graphic in her description of what she called a life-altering trauma, Dr Blasey Ford testified over three hours of questioning about the night in the Washington suburbs 36 years ago when she said an incoherently drunk Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, pinned her down on a bed and ground his body against hers, trying to remove her clothing as he clamped a hand over her mouth to stifle her screams while a friend watched.\n\n\"Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter - the uproarious laughter - between the two, and their having fun at my expense,\" said Dr Blasey Ford, a research psychologist, using the clinical language of neuroscience to describe a horrifying recollection of Judge Kavanaugh and the friend, in essence acting as both victim and expert witness in her own story.\n\n\"I've had to relive this trauma in front of the world,\" she said later.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It was intense.\"\n\nUntil Thursday, Dr Blasey Ford had mostly remained an enigma, known to the public only by a single blurry photograph that showed her on the beach wearing sunglasses that obscured much of her face.\n\nWhen she arrived at the Dirksen Senate Office Building in the flesh, bespectacled in a blue dress and matching jacket, she was mostly recognisable by her shoulder-length blond hair.\n\nIn a roomful of senators locked in a highly charged political battle over the nation's highest court, Dr Blasey Ford was strikingly out of place, clearly unschooled in the art of testifying before Congress or being questioned by a prosecutor.\n\nShe said she had initially not understood why she would need a lawyer to relay her allegation against Judge Kavanaugh, and eventually sat in a Walgreen's parking lot in Delaware interviewing lawyers she could never have imagined needing.\n\nShe often perched her glasses on top of her head as she marked up documents carefully with a pencil, a professor bending to a task she had always dreaded. And when she spoke, she sometimes leaned on her training as a scientist, often resorting to the technical language and concepts of brain function and memory.\n\nAsked how she could be certain in her recollection of what happened with Judge Kavanaugh, she told the prosecutor, Ms Rachel Mitchell: \"Just basic memory functions, and also just the level of norepinephrine and the epinephrine in the brain that, you know, encodes that neurotransmitter that codes memories into the hippocampus and so the trauma-related experience is locked there, whereas other details kind of drift.\"\n\nDuring the attempted rape, Dr Blasey Ford said, she had a typical \"fight or flight\" reaction.\n\n\"I was definitely experiencing the surge of cortisol and adrenaline and epinephrine,\" she said.\n\nSenate Republicans, mindful of the optics of a row of white men questioning a sexual assault survivor in a high-stakes hearing, left their questioning to Ms Mitchell, a matter-of-fact sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona, rarely addressing Dr Blasey Ford themselves.\n\nMs Mitchell's trial-like line of inquiry drew steady but sometimes befuddled responses from Dr Blasey Ford, particularly as Ms Mitchell tried to determine whether Democrats or outside interest groups had selected her legal team or paid the expenses for her representation and polygraph test.\n\nDr Blasey Ford said that aides to Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, her home state senator and the ranking Democrat on the panel, had recommended she retain Ms Debra Katz, one of her lawyers, but when Ms Mitchell pressed on the matter of legal expenses, Mr Michael Bromwich, another of Dr Blasey Ford's lawyers, jumped in.\n\n\"We are not being paid, and we have no expectation of being paid,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats peppered their questioning of Dr Blasey Ford with expressions of support and gratitude, calling her decision to come forward selfless and heroic.\n\n\"I believe you,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat. \"You have given America an amazing teaching moment.\"\n\nSenator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican and chairman of the panel, took pains to show sympathy to Dr Blasey Ford, telling her as he opened the session that she could have a break anytime, and agreeing to a request from Mr Bromwich that she be allowed to leave as soon as her questioning had ended.\n\n\"Let's just be nice to her,\" he said.\n\nDr Blasey Ford did not stay to hear Judge Kavanaugh give an angry, impassioned, aggrieved defence of himself, and her advisers said she had not listened to his sometimes tearful testimony.\n\nShe departed the Dirksen building as she had come Thursday morning: shrouded in secrecy and shielded from public view by her lawyers, who refused to give even the slightest detail about her time in Washington.\n\nAfter she left Capitol Hill, Dr Blasey Ford spent the afternoon visiting family and friends - some from childhood days, some from her clique of surfing buddies from Palo Alto, California.\n\n\"We are just telling her that she did it and she's like an unwitting hero,\" said Ms Cheryl Amitay, another friend from Holton-Arms who was heading to the gathering.\n\n\"She didn't expect this, but she's embraced it without losing who she is.\"\n\n\"She wasn't trying to impress anybody today,\" Ms Amitay added, \"and that's what ended up being so impressive.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nSex offences", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/bp_christine_blasey_ford_280918_48.jpg?VersionId=e.4YRCNNB425ov.ehb4eGx9VfjCKtIZu", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

A total of 750 Singapore citizens and permanent residents, aged 15 to 65, participated in the survey between July 30 and Aug 2.\n\nWhen asked whether they were confident in their ability to tell the difference between legitimate news and fake news, 79 per cent said they were at least \"somewhat confident\".\n\nYounger Singaporeans and university graduates were more confident about this, the survey found.\n\nBut when the participants were given 10 news headlines from digital channels and asked to indicate which ones were fake, only 43 per cent correctly identified two or fewer fake headlines. Of the 10, half were fake. In fact, 91 per cent had incorrectly chosen at least one of the five fake headlines as being real.\n\nIn response to media queries, an Ipsos spokesman said the fake headlines were sourced from newnation.sg, a satirical news site.\n\nExamples of the fake headlines included \"Orchard Road smoking ban to improve suburban malls' attractiveness\" and \"Increasing food costs will deter eating, help Singaporeans fight obesity\".\n\nMeanwhile, almost half of the Singaporeans surveyed said they had been previously duped by a news report they first believed to be real.\n\nYounger Singaporeans between 15 and 24 years old were particularly susceptible, with more than half of them (55 per cent) admitting that this had happened to them.\n\nAlso, more than a quarter of Singaporeans said that if they disagreed with a news story, it was likely fake.\n\nOnline sites, including social media platforms, have become key sources of information for many Singaporeans, according to Ipsos.\n\nAbout 60 per cent access news via Facebook, 53 per cent on other social media platforms and 52 per cent read newspapers' websites.\n\nOnly 38 per cent get their news from broadcast/cable television, 30 per cent tune in to news radio and 14 per cent listen to talk radio.\n\nDespite the fact that Singaporeans enjoy getting their news from digital media, participants still relied on traditional news platforms for accurate news, with 60 per cent saying they trusted these platforms \"a fair amount\", and about 20 per cent saying they had \"a great deal\" of trust.\n\nWhile they may be reliant on social media as a news source, Singaporeans are discerning about who is sharing the information online.\n\nTraditional Singapore news media companies, as well as government ministries and statutory boards, are the most trusted sources on social media, the survey found.\n\nMeanwhile, sponsored posts have the least credibility.\n\nWhile the majority of Singaporeans value veracity of the news above all else (77 per cent), 14 per cent place greater weight on the ability of the news to evoke emotions, while 9 per cent appreciate if the content aligns with their beliefs.\n\nAssociate research director of Ipsos in Singapore Robert McPhedran said the research corroborated the Government's strong concern about fake news. \"Despite their high levels of confidence, all Singaporeans - irrespective of educational attainment and media consumption habits - find it difficult to discern between real and fake news.\" He added that it was \"a serious social issue\", with the proliferation of digital media here and the dire consequences of fake news seen globally.\n\nMr Benjamin Ang, a senior fellow at the S.

It's fuelling concern among Western governments about whether Xinjiang is being used to test a new model of authoritarian rule that could transform the way the country is governed, and potentially be exported around the region.\n\nIt risks a new front to growing US-China tensions that already span trade, cyber security, and a battle for influence across much of Asia-Pacific as Mr Xi seeks to make his nation a global superpower by 2050.\n\nAny US move to sanction Mr Chen would stoke fears in China of a foreign plot to undercut its sovereignty in a region it has struggled to control, a sensitive subject for a party persistently worried about independence movements in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Tibet.\n\nMore than any of China's top leaders currently in power, Mr Chen has been at the forefront of China's efforts to subdue those restive regions.\n\n\"What we have is a clash of values,\" said Dr James Leibold, a senior lecturer at La Trobe University in Melbourne.\n\n\"The policies that have been enacted under his watch in Xinjiang are the leading edge of a far more heavy-handed coercive form of Chinese governance that some in the West are starting to realise could have big consequences for China's position in the world, as well as China's relationship with the liberal West.\"\n\nWithin the Communist Party, Mr Chen amounts to a self-made man. Unlike Mr Xi, whose father was a senior revolutionary under Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, Mr Chen had no known family connections to help him climb through the ranks.\n\nRelatively little has been written about him compared with China's other top leaders, with only scraps of information appearing on party websites in Hebei, Tibet and Xinjiang.\n\nMr Chen grew up in the inland province of Henan around the time of Mao's Great Leap Forward, which saw almost one in eight adults in his prefecture die of starvation, beatings or suicide.\n\nHe joined the military after turning 18, eventually became a Communist Party member, and attended college.\n\nThough Mr Chen graduated when China was opening up to the world, his first job saw him join a rural commune in Henan, beginning a nearly four-decade journey from lowly apparatchik to Politburo member.\n\nWhile rising through the ranks, he served at one point under Mr Li Keqiang, China's current Premier.\n\nMr Chen received his big break in 2011, when he was appointed as the party's top official in Tibet - one of the only places in China where foreign diplomats and journalists need permission to travel.\n\nIt was a prestigious appointment: Mr Hu Jintao headed the region about a decade before he became president.\n\nAt the time, Tibet was still reeling from an outbreak of violence against Beijing's rule.\n\nMr Chen gave speeches celebrating the Communist Party's \"peaceful liberation\" of Tibet, saying its leadership had taken the region \"from darkness to light\".\n\nMr Chen then rolled out a set of policies that would establish him as Beijing's point man for quelling ethnic unrest.\n\nHe told the cadres that social stability was their \"first responsibility\", instructed them to live in Tibetan villages and assigned party officials to Buddhist temples.\n\nBuddhism in Tibet, Mr Chen said, should be adapted to \"socialist civilisation\". Temples were ordered to display Chinese flags and images of Communist Party leaders.\n\nBy 2015, Mr Chen stationed some 100,000 cadres in Tibetan villages and more than 1,700 temples had established party organisations, according to state media.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, the Tibetan government advertised for 12,313 police-related positions - more than four times as many positions as the preceding five years combined, according to research by Dr Leibold and scholar Adrian Zenz.\n\nMr Meng Jianzhu, the head of China's security apparatus during Mr Chen's time in Tibet, described it as a \"leading example for the whole country\" in \"stability maintenance\".\n\nMr Chen also kept a close eye on power shifts in Beijing. In February 2016, he publicly hailed Mr Xi as China's \"core\" leader months before his title was made official, and has described Mr Xi as a \"wise leader\" with a \"magnificent plan\" for China.\n\nMembers of Mr Chen's delegation to China's national legislative sessions that year wore lapel pins emblazoned with Mr Xi's portrait - the type of adulation common during Mao's reign of personality.\n\nAs Mr Chen clamped down on dissent in Tibet, Mr Xi had a problem in Xinjiang - a region with some 10 million Turkic-speaking Uighurs where Beijing has long struggled to enforce its rule.\n\nThey have chafed under Chinese authority, seen by a rise in terrorist attacks and ethnic violence beginning in 2009.\n\nXinjiang also sits at the centre of Mr Xi's signature Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which has promised more than US$100 billion (S$136.7 billion) to reconstruct ancient trading routes from China to Eurasia.\n\nMr Xi needed it under firm control, and in August 2016, he put Mr Chen in charge of the region to implement a policy to \"strike first\" against domestic terrorism and unrest.\n\nMr Chen immediately set about replicating the system that brought him success in Tibet.\n\nHe sent Communist Party officials to Uighur villages, created a network of checkpoints and facial-recognition cameras, and shuttered mosques in an effort to \"Sinify\" Islam in the region.\n\nAccording to one Chinese-language profile, Mr Chen drilled Xinjiang's security forces using a technique perfected in Tibet: timing police to the second on responding to emergency calls.\n\nMost controversially, Mr Chen set up the mass re-education camps that have sparked an outcry in the US and Europe, as well as barbs from US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.\n\nA fax to Xinjiang's publicity department asking about the camps wasn't immediately answered.\n\nMr Chen is the only person ever to have served as both party boss of both Xinjiang and Tibet, according to domestic media reports.\n\nHis dual strategy of tough security measures and re-education are designed to \"take the ethnicity out of the people and lock them down\", said Professor James Millward of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.\n\nIn Xinjiang, Mr Chen \"came in and he was highly positioned in the party and was given a mandate to do what he wanted to do and tonnes of funding to do it\", Prof Millward said.\n\n\"He clearly has Xi's support to a remarkable degree.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nPolitics and government\n\nXi Jinping", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/08/30/colin-usc-30.jpg?VersionId=hqUpHM9XIXRf9t2cg9nVCJgMyeD84qVR", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

This was in exchange for advancing the business interests of Chia's companies - 19-ANC Enterprise and 19-NS2 Enterprise, which did work such as repairs and redecoration for town councils.\n\nBoth firms were awarded contracts and tenders worth millions of dollars by Ang Mo Kio Town Council during the time the alleged bribery took place, the prosecution said.\n\nOf the 55 charges brought against Wong, one of them involves the free use of a mobile phone, with total charges of more than $2,500 incurred in 2015 and 2016.\n\nMr Ng said on the third day of the trial that he had been asked by Mr Tay Eng Chuan, a director with 19-NS2, to apply for the line, and he was unaware of who was using the line.

Its efforts contributed to zero piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden in the past three months, said the Ministry of Defence in a statement.\n\nSAF's Rear-Admiral Saw Shi Tat handed over command of Combined Task Force 151 (CTF 151) to Captain Ali Alrashidi of the Kuwait Naval Force in a ceremony at the Naval Support Activity base in Bahrain.\n\nOver the past three months\n\n, the SAF led CTF 151 in coordinating operations to deter and disrupt piracy in the Gulf of Aden from its base in Bahrain.\n\nRADM Saw and his team left an \"impressive mark\" on the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), said CMF commander, US Vice-Admiral Scott A. Stearney.\n\nCTF 151 comes under the CMF, a multinational naval partnership led by the United States.\n\nVice-Adm Stearney said the good performance by the team was a testament to the professionalism, dedication and commitment of SAF personnel.\n\n\"Whether it was improving our relationships with key leaders in the region, overseeing hundreds of hours of airborne surveillance of critical maritime reaches or keeping the sea lanes of the Gulf of Aden safe while rendering assistance to mariners at risk when needed, RADM Saw and his team left an impressive mark on the CMF, \" he said.\n\nRADM Saw, 42, said the strong relationship between the Singapore-led team and the various counter-piracy agencies in the region was one success factor for the deployment.\n\nThis enabled effective information sharing and better operational coordination of forces for counter-piracy operations, he said.\n\n\"The successful deployment is important to Singapore because the efforts helped to protect the strategic waterways in the Gulf of Aden through which a large proportion of global maritime trade passes,\" he added.\n\nDuring the term, the CTF 151 command team shared information with partners such as the European Union Naval Force and independently deployed navies from China and India.\n\nThe team also coordinated a series of counter-piracy operations involving CMF units, European Union Naval Force forces and international maritime agencies to improve inter-operability.\n\nThe command team comprised 53 SAF personnel and 11 international officers from countries such as Australia, Bahrain, Indonesia, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Thailand.\n\nOne of them was SAF Captain Dean Wong, 29, who served as a battle watch captain.\n\nHe said the main challenge he faced was connectivity with the ships under the task force's command. He added: \"However, the task force managed to work out procedures that enabled ships at sea to still be able to continue with their mission regardless of the connectivity.\"\n\nSince the SAF's first contribution to CTF 151 in 2009, it has deployed more than 1,400 personnel, five command teams, five task groups, and one detachment of an F-50 maritime patrol aircraft.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel (Volunteer) Neo Su Yin, 38, who was a public affairs officer, helped in planning and developing public communication plans.\n\nShe took time off from her job as a general manager for ground operations and customer service with Changi Airport Group to take part.\n\n\"Given that I was in service for more than 17 years, my family was fully supportive...

Beijing on Saturday summoned the US ambassador in Beijing and postponed joint military talks.\n\n'INCREASED PRESSURE ACROSS THE BOARD'\n\nThe Trump administration is looking to push back harder against China on several fronts, including so-called political \"influence operations,\" an issue on which Mr Trump recently has been given a lot more information in his intelligence briefings, according to the official.\n\n\"We are in a spot where we can start acting with increased pressure across the board, especially because of trade action,\" the official said.\n\nWashington has long identified China as a major culprit in the cyber hacking of US government and corporate databases, but US officials and independent analysts say they have not detected the kind of systematic political campaign, including manipulation of social media, that Russia is alleged to have conducted during the 2016 election.\n\nChina has strongly denied any effort to interfere in the US elections, calling such accusations \"slander\".\n\nOn Wednesday, the only specific action by China that Mr Trump cited was that it was \"placing propaganda ads\" in US newspapers, referring to a Chinese government-run media company's four-page supplement in the Sunday Des Moines Register promoting the mutual benefits of US-China trade.\n\nIowa, which voted for Mr Trump in 2016, is a state whose farmers face damage from any protracted trade war, which has already featured billions of dollars in tit-for-tax tariffs.\n\nHowever, the practice of foreign governments buying space in US newspapers to promote trade is common and differs from a clandestine operation run by a national intelligence agency.\n\n\"The Chinese government uses all kinds of methods to try to get us to turn back our policies,\" a White House National Security Council spokesman said when asked for comment.\n\n\"They are targeting tariffs and retaliation at farmers and workers in states and districts that voted for President Trump, and they are using other political, economic, commercial, military, and media tools to benefit the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n\nThe Trump administration appears determined to push back more broadly, even at the risk of a harsh response from Beijing.\n\nWashington, for instance, is considering tougher action against Chinese cyber theft and cyber espionage, the US official said, but declined to provide details.\n\nEarlier this week, the US military showed it was willing to continue bucking China's claim to the disputed South China Sea when it flew B-52 bombers over the strategic waterway. China was also angered this week when the United States approved the sale of spare parts for F-16 fighter planes and other military aircraft worth up to US$330 million (S$451.62 million) to Taiwan, which China considers a wayward province.\n\nUS officials, meanwhile, are increasingly concerned that China is no longer fully enforcing some sanctions on North Korea, and say they intend to keep up pressure in this area.\n\nBut some analysts questioned the wisdom of going too far.\n\n\"Friction and leverage can be useful tools in international relations if used judiciously, particularly in response to problematic behaviour like China's,\" said Mr Daniel Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute, who was until last year the State Department's top diplomat for East Asia.\n\n\"But an aggressive, frontal assault across sectors is unlikely to succeed, particularly against a country as large and powerful as China,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS foreign policy\n\nChina\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/bp_trump_280918_36.jpg?VersionId=lcWO2_ho.K16ajGVEWMwGOv6akb5Dqdc", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Vijayan\n\nFollow topic:\n\nLawyers\n\nPublished\n\nSep 28, 2018, 05:00 AM\n\nA tribunal has decided a veteran lawyer must be dealt with by the Court of Three Judges for gross professional misconduct after someone he brought in to drum up the firm's conveyancing business\n\nturned out to be a conman and cheated 17 clients.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges is the highest disciplinary body to deal with lawyer misconduct.\n\nIn prosecuting him, the Law Society said Mr Troy Yeo, a lawyer of 35 years' standing, had failed to properly supervise Sim Tee Peng despite \"red flags\" that should have increasingly alerted Mr Yeo to \"highly unconventional and questionable practices\" adopted by Sim.\n\nThe tribunal, in its report released on Wednesday, found that the Law Society had made a compelling case for gross professional misconduct.\n\nIt said a duty of supervision is imposed to protect the public and to protect client monies against any misapplication.\n\nMr Yeo had brought in Sim, who is 41 this year, to set up a conveyancing department in 2011 in his firm, Troy Yeo & Co.\n\nSim brought in the majority of the firm's conveyancing clients and interacted extensively with each of them. But he is not a lawyer and before meeting Mr Yeo, had worked as a paralegal in the conveyancing departments of other law firms.\n\nDuring his time at Mr Yeo's firm, Sim forged stamp duty certificates, passed himself off as a lawyer, and cheated and misappropriated monies belonging to the firm's clients. The tribunal said $448,000 was wrongfully deposited into the firm's office account, of which $336,000 was paid out to Sim without proper verification.\n\nAfter Sim stopped dealing with the firm's clients, he went on to con the clients of three other law firms. Between June 2011 and September 2012, he cheated the property buyers of $1.8 million.\n\nIn 2016, he was jailed for 89 months for, among other charges, criminal misappropriation, creating counterfeit certificates of stamp duty and cheating.\n\n\"This is not a case of a one-off trivial or technical breach, but rather closer to a case of wilful and persistent default, given (Mr Yeo's) knowledge of Sim's unorthodox conduct and his failure to resolve and prevent even further breaches,\" said the tribunal in its report.\n\nThe tribunal, appointed by the Chief Justice, comprised Senior Counsel Edwin Tong, who is now Senior Minister of State for Law and Health, and lawyer Joy Tan Whei Mien.\n\nMr Yeo had admitted to two other charges that he breached lawyers' accounting rules in relation to conveyancing monies matters related to Sim.\n\nIn prosecuting the Law Society's case, lawyers Abraham Vergis and Lim Mingguan argued that Mr Yeo had breached the Legal Profession (Professional Misconduct) Rules 2010 in relation to the first charge of failing to exercise proper supervision over Sim.\n\nSenior Counsel Kenneth Tan, who represented Mr Yeo, denied he had breached the rules as he had taken reasonable steps in response to Sim's illegal activities.\n\nAfter a four-day hearing earlier this year, the tribunal found that the Law Society had made out a compelling case beyond reasonable doubt and that Mr Yeo was liable on the first charge.\n\n\"Although we express sympathy for the fact that (Mr Yeo) himself was a victim of Sim's fraud, in our view, a finding of liability for the first charge is inescapable,\" the tribunal added. It found the case to be of sufficient gravity to be referred to the Court of Three Judges, where he may be fined, suspended or struck off, if found guilty.\n\nSee more on\n\nLawyers\n\nDisciplinary proceedings", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/ST_20180928_VITROY28_4309514.jpg?VersionId=KKPFXz8R8jIkBi6yFI6N0Vbs_6Wap5GL", "alt_text": "Sim Tee Peng (left) forged stamp duty certificates and misappropriated clients' monies while at Mr Troy Yeo's firm."}]}

But we believe in long-term enlightened self-interest.\"\n\nHe said this meant both competing and cooperating with neighbours, particularly on existential challenges, including climate change, the digital revolution and the next pandemic. \"All these big challenges require multilateralism, cross-border cooperation, a set of rules by which we can all operate.\"\n\nCiting the loss of public support for free trade between 2015 and late 2016 in America, and the apparent erosion of global consensus, Dr Balakrishnan said: \"The real issue is technology, but it is very easy, it is very Twitter-worthy, to blame foreigners, to blame competition and free trade, for stagnation of wages and potential loss of jobs.\"\n\nOn the digital revolution, he said South-east Asia needs to train people for new jobs \"because if you compete for old jobs, that is the route to middle-class stagnation, middle-class angst and increasing unemployment\".\n\n\"There is a larger political message. Whenever the middle class feels stressed... you always see reactionary right-or left-wing extremes, whether it is fascism or communism,\" he said.\n\nTo cope with change, Dr Balakrishnan said, countries need to focus on research and development and collaboration, and use new tools such as artificial intelligence.\n\n\"That is where the future is, that is where the future wealth is. We need to transform our societies to be able to harvest that wealth.\"\n\nDr Balakrishnan, who is in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, also met representatives of the Pacific Alliance, which comprises Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico. Singapore has been an observer in the alliance since 2014.\n\nThey discussed ways to promote inter-regional economic integration and reaffirmed their commitment to conclude the Pacific Alliance-Singapore Free Trade Agreement expeditiously.\n\nThe minister also took part in the Global Cooperation and Artificial Intelligence Roundtable at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum, facilitated by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger.\n\nSee more on\n\nVivian Balakrishnan\n\nTrade", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/st_20180928_vnvivian_4309173.jpg?VersionId=R.6wDfEeqfiE_a2s3vb.WvF.gm6wSXq4", "alt_text": "Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan speaking on New Realities For South-east Asia at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York yesterday."}]}

The Ministry rejected several suggestions relating to the GST on imported services that kicks in on Jan 1, 2020.\n\nThe draft Bill seeks to impose an Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) regime on business-to-consumer imported services, such as video streaming, apps, listing fees on electronic marketplaces, software and online subscription fees.\n\nA reverse charge system will be used for business-to-business imported services like marketing, IT and management services.\n\nSome respondents wanted more flexibility for overseas GST-registered suppliers under the OVR regime on how to determine a customer's status, such as whether he resides in or outside Singapore.\n\nThe MOF did not concur, stating that the approach in the draft Bill will need these suppliers to obtain payment, residence and access details, a process consistent with how other countries run OVR systems.\n\nThis is done through the credit card used, the billing address submitted by the customer and his Internet protocol address.\n\n\"The proposed approach is unlikely to impose significant compliance cost on businesses as the information prescribed is typically already gathered by the supplier in the normal course of business,\" said the MOF.\n\nSome people also wanted a similar concession for the reverse charge regime, to determine if suppliers are subject to it through its GST-registration status in Singapore. The MOF said the GST-registration status may not accurately reflect whether services are imported from overseas.\n\nThe Bill is slated to be introduced in Parliament next month.\n\nSee more on\n\nGST\n\nPolitics and government", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/bp_print3_280918_13.jpg?VersionId=.S8I4Oy4LsteL7sWuGfI_5uq6QLYLNwX", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Users may also be susceptible to bone disorders and an increased risk of infections and muscle weakness.\n\nDiclofenac, a potent painkiller, was also found in the \"Gold\" product. It can cause serious gastric bleeding, heart attacks and stroke when used over a prolonged period, especially in patients with underlying heart conditions, the authority said.\n\nLast Saturday, Chinese-language evening daily Shin Min Daily News reported that a 28-year-old woman died in hospital after consuming for about six months a juice drink that contained dexamethasone.\n\nIn response to queries, the Singapore Civil Defence Force said that it responded to a call for assistance at 428 Yishun Avenue 11 at around 1.30pm last Friday. A woman in her 20s was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Her family told Shin Min that she had bought the product in the Geylang Serai area.\n\nChecks by The Straits Times also found that Jus Al Sunnah products were available on the Carousell retail website and were advertised as treatment for various conditions, including body pain, tiredness and gout. The listings have since been removed.\n\nIn June, Brunei's Ministry of Health issued a statement banning the import and sale of Jus Al Sunnah products in the country after its tests detected dexamethasone.\n\nOn Tuesday, Malaysian Health Ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah also issued a ban on the products. He said that the company listed as the products' producer, Sri Saga Marketing S/B, did not exist.\n\nThe HSA advised members of the public to consult a doctor if they are taking the products, as sudden discontinuation of steroids without medical supervision can cause withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue, confusion and low blood pressure.\n\nThe authority also said that sellers must stop sales of the products immediately.\n\nSee more on\n\nHealth Sciences Authority\n\nFood hygiene/safety", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/ST_20180928_RKJUICETBRC_4309816.jpg?VersionId=Ym5jmI4Jsk0.Hkg9ZDolUswO_HKDnHBg", "alt_text": "Jus Al Sunnah Gold 1001 Khasiat Jus Alternatif (left) and Jus Al Sunnah 1001 Khasiat Jus Alternatif (above) were tested and found to contain potent medicinal ingredients, including steroids."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

In 2015, registered charities attracted about $2.7 billion in donations.\n\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu launched the Visibility Guide framework during the 2018 Charity Governance Conference yesterday.\n\nTo encourage more giving, trust is crucial, and to build trust, good governance is necessary, she said.\n\nTo this end, amendments were made to the Charities Act to strengthen the regulatory framework for charities. In January, the COC's Code of Practice for Charitable Online Fund-Raising Appeals was launched to enhance transparency in the online giving sphere.\n\nThe Visibility Guide framework and the annual report template \"will complement our efforts to enhance transparency and make more information available to the public\", said Ms Fu.\n\nCommissioner of Charities Ang Hak Seng said the framework will help charities explain to donors what they do.\n\n\"One of the challenges small charities shared with us is that they have difficulty in communicating the good work done by them,\" he added.\n\nCharity Council chairman Gerard Ee said that the framework \"helps donors to discern and decide which charity they want to support. There are so many charities today, and donors actually agonise as to which one should they be supporting, where should they give the money\".\n\nThe annual report template will include both mandatory obligations as well as good-to-have information to complement the Visibility Guide.\n\nMs Fu said that by the end of this year, the COC will also introduce regulations on electronic filing of annual submissions, including annual reports.\n\nShe added that report requirements will be streamlined to make them easier for charities to follow. More details will be released next year.\n\nMs Saleemah Ismail, the 49-year-old co-Founder of New Life Stories, an initiative to help former women inmates bond with their children through reading, said: \"The easy-to-remember framework is also a good tool that can be used to educate staff throughout the organisation because it is clear, precise and compact.\n\n\"It helps communicate the outcomes to not just the public, but even staff throughout the organisation.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nGrace Fu\n\nCharities", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/st_20180928_vngrace_4309574.jpg?VersionId=Q2xk87.3c62SwP2_AgGDrUJo4hwZtXlt", "alt_text": "Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu launched the Visibility Guide framework at the 2018 Charity Governance Conference yesterday."}]}

On paper, he was not supposed to manage the server, but had been doing so since 2014.\n\nAs the server is located at the NCCS, his counterparts at IHiS felt it was \"convenient\" to give him the username and password for the administrator account \"in case they need me to help\", he said before the four-member committee.\n\nThese counterparts later left the organisation, and no one else took over the management of the server.\n\nNCCS belongs to the SingHealth cluster. Formed in 2008, IHiS is an agency which runs the IT systems of all public healthcare institutions here.\n\nMr Tan, whose main job is to plan business continuation programmes, said he was not trained in cyber security or server administration, and had not been given any standard operating procedures for managing security incidents.\n\nThe exploited server last received software updates in May last year, following the spread of the WannaCry ransomware that disrupted operations around the world. IHiS had circulated instructions to update all Windows servers. Some time in July this year, Mr Tan learnt that the exploited server became infected with a virus.\n\nAutomatic anti-virus software updates could not be made to the server as the software was too old. Mr Tan had to disconnect the server from the SingHealth network to do manual anti-virus software installation. Only then could the virus signatures be updated.\n\nOn July 10, when Mr Tan scanned the server, he detected three security threats: Two had been cleaned up, but one had been \"quarantined\".\n\nThe intrusions into SingHealth's electronic medical records system began undetected on June 27 before being discovered on July 4 and terminated by an IHiS staff member. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and upper management at IHiS and SingHealth were informed of the attack on July 10.\n\nThat was the day when Ms Yong realised Mr Tan had been managing this server. She had given a directive in 2014, under a previous role, that IHiS would not manage eight research servers, which then came under the care of Mr Tan.\n\nThe exploited server was not supposed to be among the eight, and the public hearings have not addressed how IHiS lost oversight of it. Ms Yong said she would review processes and structures for greater accountability, when asked by COI chairman Richard Magnus.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingHealth\n\nCyber security\n\nSingHealth COI", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/st_20180928_vncoi_4309575.jpg?VersionId=78mOqS91gqGePTuwozuzsSAttMjgyS1L", "alt_text": "Ms Serena Yong, director of IHiS infrastructure services division, told the COI she would review processes and structures for greater accountability."}]}

He said: \"We have a shared destiny in upholding a rules-based global system for our individual and collective good.\"\n\nBut Mr Chan added that globalisation requires governments to share the created wealth among all members of society. \"There will be net winners and net losers in a country, and we will need to find ways to redistribute some of these gains and... help those who have been losing out... to make the adjustments to catch up with the rest of the pack.\n\n\"Failing which, there will be the inevitable local backlash, leading to global consequences,\" he said.\n\nMr Chan said that despite being separated by a large physical distance, both Britain and Singapore have had many opportunities to work together.\n\nEarlier in the evening, chamber president Bicky Bhangu said Singapore was Britain's largest trading partner in Asean, with a total trade of around $11.4 billion last year.\n\nMr Chan said that beyond bilateral trade, both countries should \"use each other as a platform, as a launchpad, and as a gateway to the larger markets around us\".\n\nSpeaking to the audience of business people at the event at the Shangri-La Hotel, he said: \"Many of you have shared with me how you have used Singapore to service the regional economies.

Kitchenware courtesy of Corelle Brands.\n\nPHOTO: HEDY KHOO\n\nHedy Khoo\n\nFollow topic:\n\nChinese food\n\nPublished\n\nOct 01, 2018, 05:00 AM\n\nSINGAPORE - Braised fish head slathered in piping hot savoury gravy is one of the top items on my list of comfort foods. The fishmonger I go to recommends black garoupa as its meat can withstand the double-cooking process of deep-frying - for a crispy exterior - and quick braise.\n\nFish head aficionados will appreciate the fine meatiness of garoupa, as well as the luscious gumminess of its gelatinous parts. For those who cannot take the heat of spicy foods like fish head curry, braised fish head is a good option. Cook rice to serve with the braised fish head, and it is possible to host a dinner party for six to eight without tiring yourself out in the kitchen. The dish is packed with vegetables for a nutritious and satisfying meal.\n\nInstead of cooking the fish head whole, I prefer to have it cut up into large pieces. This makes it easy to deep-fry and shortens the cooking time.\n\nCarrot, napa cabbage, onion and leek add natural sweetness to the dish. I particularly like the texture of dried beancurd sticks soaked in gravy. Tomatoes add a touch of tanginess to prevent the dish from being cloying.\n\nWhile the claypot is commonly used to serve up braised fish head, I find that the 5-litre sauce pot from Corningware Plasma Cast Aluminium Cookware puts in an admirable performance in place of a claypot.\n\nYou can prepare the gravy and braise the fish in the same pot. Better yet, the sleek design of the pot makes it attractive enough to double up as serveware. The non-stick coating also makes it easy to remove food remnants at the bottom of the pot after you are done with the meal.\n\nThe Corningware Plasma Cast Aluminium Cookware is a new line of cookware recently launched by kitchenware maker and distributor Corelle Brands. The product line includes a 28-cm saute pan and a 32-cm wok.\n\nCare for your cookware\n\nCorningware Plasma Cast Aluminium Cookware 24-cm (5-litre) sauce pot\n\n1. Before using the cookware for the first time, hand wash it thoroughly with warm soapy water. Rinse and dry.\n\n2. Use cooking utensils made of wood, nylon, silicone or plastic for your cookware.\n\n3. Always allow the cookware to cool completely before cleaning. For stubborn residue, make cleaning easier by pouring hot water and a little detergent into the cookware. Allow the water to cool before washing.\n\nYou can also use the sauce pot for deep-frying the fish, but I choose to use the 32-cm wok for this as I can fry more pieces of fish head at a time.\n\nThe cookware, crafted from cast aluminium, has excellent heat distribution and you need only low to medium heat to cook your food. The cookware also has a patented medical grade bio-ceramic coating that stands up to abrasion and heat well.

Several cells identical to his own lined the walls in this section of State Correctional Institution Phoenix, and every one of them was vacant.\n\nCosby ate breakfast, lunch and dinner by himself. He walked the yard without company. Four times that day - at precisely 6.10am, 12.30pm, 4.30pm and at 9pm before lights out - a guard walked the unit to count the prisoners, and the count was always one.\n\nThis quasi-isolation won't last forever - maybe only a week or two. It's mostly a coincidence that Cosby was assigned to a brand-new prison that is still just barely half full. Administrators decided out of caution to isolate him from the other prisoners until they can figure out what to do with one of the most famous sex offenders in the country for the duration of his three-to-10 year sentence.\n\n\"It's basically his own space,\" said Amy Worden, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. \"He's a high-profile inmate... and obviously, safety is the paramount issue inside a prison.\"\n\nState corrections secretary John Wetzel said in a statement that integrating Cosby into the prison's general population - about 3,600 inmates, once Phoenix is at capacity - was the \"long-term goal.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

No family members were present.\n\n\"Flanked by armed sheriff's deputies, he disappeared through an arched doorway, bound for a holding cell - Cosby's first stop in a journey that will take him to a state prison where he will be confined to a tiny cell that could have fit into the corner of a room in any of his mansions,\" Roig-Franzia wrote.\n\nCosby was driven through a rainstorm and arrived that evening at SCI Phoenix: a 66ha compound of maximum security cell blocks, separated from the community by a couple of kilometres of razor wire and electronic fencing. The state began building the prison in the early 2010s - around the same time that Cosby's career began disintegrating under dozens of women's accusations that he had assaulted them.\n\nGuards walked Cosby into the prison's central building some time after 6pm on Tuesday. He posed for his mug shot, traded what was left of his court outfit for a prison uniform and boots, and became inmate NN7687.\n\nHe was then taken to the vacant cell unit, where he set up the toiletries and sheets that were his only provisions, and sat down to a dinner of porcupine meatballs, under the supervision of a guard at the monitoring desk.\n\nAfter dinner, at 9pm, Cosby stood outside his cell for the first of many regulated head counts. A guard shone a flashlight into his cell some time in the middle of the night to make sure the unit's lone prisoner was still there.\n\n\"He still has to do it,\" Worden said. \"It's part of the prison ritual.\"\n\nThe full SCI Phoenix ritual is a mammoth daily schedule broken down into five-minute increments. Breakfast in the cafeteria at 7am. Vocational classes at 8am. Chapel at 8.20. Cease movement at 12.25. Head count at half past the hour, then off to work for those with jobs in the laundry or the shoe factory.\n\nBut Cosby is a special case, and for the first week or so, at least, his ritual is a spartan thing.\n\nHe eats, sleeps and recreates in his empty corner of the prison, served the same thing as the general population prisoners who congregate in cafeterias sprawled across the campus. Wednesday's lunch menu was macaroni and cheese. Thursday's includes strawberry gelatin for dessert.\n\n\"He didn't have Jell-O,\" Worden said, aware that Cosby famously starred in Jell-O ads before his disgrace. \"The word 'Jell-O' may appear on the menu, but it is not a Jell-O brand product.\"\n\nCosby can take no classes and no job, yet. He is allowed no visitors except his lawyers and religious mentors, if he has any. He cannot mingle. He can watch TV alone in the empty common room when he's not locked in his cell. He can walk alone in the small yard outside his unit for up to four hours each day.\n\nCNN reported that Cosby phoned his wife on Wednesday morning, though Worden could not confirm it.\n\nThis quasi-isolation will continue until Cosby completes the standard battery of psychological and medical exams for new inmates and sex offenders - a process called \"classification\" that normally takes about 10 days, though Worden said that estimate can range widely, and it is unclear how Cosby's combination of celebrity and medical issues will affect the process.\n\nOnce he is classified, he will presumably be allowed to visit with his family, and purchase a TV and tablet for his cell, and perhaps look for classes or work to pass he days. If things go well, he may even get a roommate; almost all the cells at Phoenix are double bunks.\n\nSo far, Worden said, Cosby has adjusted well to his new life. \"Good spirits,\" is the term that state officials use.\n\nThat said, Cosby's publicist told the New York Times that \"no one disclosed to us that they were taking him to that facility.\"\n\nHis lawyers tried and failed to convince a judge to let him live under house arrest while he appeals his sentence. And the Associated Press reported that Cosby has hopes of being transferred to a lower-security prison on the other side of Pittsburgh that caters to geriatric inmates.\n\nWorden, however, said there are no plans to move him out of SCI Phoenix.\n\n\"That's his lawyer,\" she said of the AP report. \"He doesn't make the decision. As of right now, he's staying.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nBill Cosby\n\nSex offences", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/us-entertainment-television-cosby-court-200335.jpg?VersionId=lnSWgxmL9TnT2sqYHt3jVeda_B0jMCoP", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

This figure, which excludes foreign domestic workers, was due mainly to the fall in the number of Work Permit holders in the construction and marine shipyard sectors.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of citizen births in the last calendar year totalled 32,356, a 2.4 per cent drop against that in 2016.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The rate needed to replace the population is 2.1.\n\nThe number of marriages involving citizens, however, rose 2.3 per cent to 24,417, an annual increase that is above the past decade's average of 22,500 citizen marriages.\n\nSingapore gave citizenship to 22,076 people last year, among whom are 1,600 children born overseas to Singaporean parents.\n\nThe figure is in line with the 15,000 to 25,000 new citizenships that are granted each year, as part of Singapore's long-term policy to moderate the impact of an ageing population and low birth rates.\n\nStill, Singapore continues to age, with people aged 65 and older making up 15.2 per cent of the population as of June this year, compared with 14.4 per cent a year ago.\n\nThe faster pace of growth of the elderly population is partly due to large cohorts of baby boomers entering the post-65 age category, the report said.\n\nThe median age of the citizen population also inched up from 41.3 to 41.7 years.\n\nThere are now about 4.2 citizens in the working age band of 20 to 64 years for every elderly citizen, a drop from 6.7 a decade ago.

For the population to replace itself without immigration, women need to have an average of 2.1 babies.\n\n\"Singleness rate is the most important reason fertility rate in Singapore is low because among those who get married, only 10 per cent do not have any children,\" said Professor Jean Yeung, director of the Centre for Family and Population Research.\n\nBut overall, Singapore's total population for the 12-month period ending in June this year\n\nrose to 5.64 million, a 0.5 per cent expansion\n\nthat is an improvement on the previous period's 0.1 per cent, which was the lowest rate in a decade.\n\nThe increase, after taking into account factors such as death and immigration, is largely from 32,356 Singaporean births and 22,076 new citizens. But what made experts sit up is the growing share of singles across genders, with the rate of increase for women far exceeding that for men.\n\nIt is especially noticeable among women aged between 25 and 29, with the proportion rising from 60.9 per cent in 2007 to 68.1 per cent last year - a jump of 7.2 percentage points.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It is not very manly if you can't do that.\"\n\nBut for women, the major reason for staying single is that they no longer have to marry for economic survival, said experts.\n\n\"Like more than 100 other countries, more Singapore women are in tertiary educational institutions than men... Getting married is no longer a necessity,\" said Professor Jean Yeung, director of the Centre for Family and Population Research.\n\nOther reasons include long work hours, the high cost of living and a relatively long wait for Housing Board flats, said experts.\n\nAlso, many women still get passed up for promotion or high positions because of motherhood.\n\n\"These are fundamental factors that young people consider when deciding whether to form a family or not. They need to be addressed if fertility rates are to be increased in Singapore,\" Prof Yeung said.\n\nAnother factor is the exorbitant spending on weddings, said Dr Mathews.\n\n\"Our culture has made it such that a wedding is an 'investment' to save for, because couples think they look bad if it is not grand enough. Elsewhere, people seldom delay weddings because they need to save for it,\" he said.\n\nBut 28-year-old investment analyst Ho Xing Xian said that staying single is not so much a choice as it is a case of being unable to find a suitable match.\n\n\"The idea that women put their careers first is only part of the story. The reality for me is that most of the good men are taken,\" she said.\n\nSee more on\n\nPopulation/Demographics\n\nSingapore Statistics", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/bp_sgpop_280918_7.jpg?VersionId=ZyMiN3vDZYAKc.h7m7LrIv3DUXqIfVIg", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Only humanitarian solutions?\"\n\nPalestinian leaders have long seen President Donald Trump's administration as blatantly biased in favour of Israel and seeking to blackmail them into accepting their terms.\n\nThe Palestinian leadership cut off contact with the White House after Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital last December and the United States has also cut more than US$500 million (S$680 million) in Palestinian aid.\n\n\"From this august platform, I renew my call to President Trump to rescind his decisions and decrees... in order to salvage the prospects for peace and to achieve stability and security for future generations,\" Abbas said.\n\n'EXTEND OUR HANDS FOR PEACE'\n\nLast February, Abbas called for an international conference to re-launch the peace process under a new mediator to replace the United States, in an address to the UN Security Council.\n\nOn Thursday, he said there could be no peace without an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital, calling on countries around the world to recognise the state of Palestine.\n\n\"We are not against negotiations,\" the Palestinian leader added. \"We will continue to extend our hands for peace.\"\n\nAt the United Nations on Wednesday, Trump pledged to unveil a new Middle East peace plan by the end of the year, turning heads by supporting for the first time a two-state solution to the conflict.\n\nWhen meeting Netanyahu on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, Trump said he backed a two-state solution since \"that's what I think works best, that's my feeling.\"\n\nHis endorsement of the goal of a Palestinian state, long the focus of US peace efforts before he came into office, was decidedly lukewarm - and he even slightly backtracked from it later in the day.\n\n\"If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, that's OK with me,\" he later told a news conference. \"If they want two states, that's OK with me. I'm happy if they're happy.\"\n\nWhile Trump's comments sparked concern among some Israeli right-wing politicians who hoped he would bury the idea of Palestinian statehood once and for all, Netanyahu had warm words for the US president.\n\n\"I looked forward to working with President Trump and his peace deal,\" said Netanyahu in his speech which was largely devoted to attacking Iran.\n\nHe also praised Trump and the American ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, for their \"unwavering support they have provided Israel\" before lashing out at Abbas.\n\nCriticising payments by the Palestinian Authority to militants behind deadly anti-Israeli attacks, Netanyahu said: \"This is not the way to peace, the way to a peace to which Israel remains committed.\"\n\nTrump's son-in-law and aide Jared Kushner is part of a team working on the peace deal, whose efforts have been met with derision from the Palestinians, who note that Israel has so far not been asked publicly for any concessions in return for the Jerusalem recognition and other moves they favour.\n\nSee more on\n\nPalestine\n\nUN", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/07051836.jpg?VersionId=PgiXCIq2MrbH.c3VbHKJ_UXTmuu5_PGU", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

A seat was made vacant just to make way for an individual (Anwar) to become the Selangor Menteri Besar... And now, another seat is made vacant because someone wants to be a Prime Minister.\n\n\"This a black dot in the nation's democracy in, this election should not have happened. When we're faced with this, we have to fight. How can we give it for free? Even though we would not win, we need to give a strong message to PH (Pakatan Harapan) that what they did, did not go well with the people.\"\n\nThe Kajang Move was engineered to oust then-Selangor Menteri Besar Khalid Ibrahim from his post, which triggered the Kajang by-election.\n\nBut Mr Anwar was blocked from contesting in Kajang after he was charged with a second sodomy accusation. His wife Dr Wan Azizah Ismail became the PKR candidate and won the state poll.\n\nBut it was Datuk Seri Azmin Ali, the PKR deputy president, who later became the Selangor chief minister.\n\nMeanwhile, in a surprising move on Thursday, controversial former Negeri Sembilan menteri besar Isa Samad said he too plans to join the Port Dickson race as an independent.\n\nMr Isa, who told reporters he quit Umno two days ago, was also former chairman for scandal plagued national land development agency Felda.\n\nOthers who were expected to stand include independent candidate Stevie Chan Keng Leong and a contestant from small Parti Rakyat Malaysia Ahmad Kamaruddin.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nElections\n\nAnwar Ibrahim", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/bp_pas_280918_15.jpg?VersionId=tfVBPegvHmJnMmvIlueRsPZkSOT1NN4J", "alt_text": null}]}

Lavrov said that \"any negotiation is a two-way street. Steps by the DPRK towards gradual disarmament should be followed by the easing of sanctions.\"\n\nHe was also critical of several US attempts to tighten UN sanctions on North Korea in recent months. In July, Russia and China delayed a US push for the council's sanctions committee to order a halt to refined petroleum exports to North Korea, asking for more detail on a US accusation that Pyongyang breached sanctions, diplomats said.\n\nThen last month, Russia and China objected to a US proposal to add a Russian bank, a Moscow-based North Korean banker and two other entities to a UN Security Council blacklist, diplomats said.\n\n\"Further increase of sanctions goes beyond cutting off financing of banned missile and nuclear programmes, and is in fact a threat to North Korean citizens and would bring extreme socio-economic and humanitarian suffering,\" Lavrov said.\n\nLavrov said the Security Council should send a clear signal in support of the positive momentum on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n\"This could be done, for example, by adopting a relevant resolution and we want to prepare a draft of such a resolution and propose it to the Security Council,\" he said.\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom, speaking at the same meeting, agreed that the council should recognise that \"recent progress has shown that is possible to diffuse tensions through dialogue and cooperation.\"\n\nDiplomats have said the United States did not want the Security Council to issue a statement on the developments.\n\nSee more on\n\nNorth Korea\n\nNuclear weapons", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/28/2018-09-27t160031z_1448136330_rc1cc7862710_rtrmadp_3_northkorea-usa-un.jpg?VersionId=HfnQ6UqXKqnMYCz0dJvA4xTS93O17xik", "alt_text": null}]}

Another victory on Sunday would be his eighth of the campaign and leave him in a position to take the title without having to win again.\n\nThe Briton said if it had taken time to work up to his current level of performance, that was because he had started the season still exploring the car's complexities and how to get more out of it than even the team imagined possible.\n\nThe Russian Grand Prix was held in April last year, with Hamilton finishing fourth, but the schedule change means Mercedes come to Sochi with the car and driver much more in tune.\n\n\"I really do believe this weekend we will be in a better position than we were last year,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Our understanding is far greater of the tyre than it was last year when we arrived here.\n\n\"It's still a challenge to get right. We will take our understanding of last year with a pinch of salt because the car is different and we've got a different tyre this weekend. We'll be faced with different challenges, I would assume.\"\n\nSpeaking separately to reporters, Vettel felt he could still close the gap.\n\n\"Last year, it was a surprise to be so competitive here, this year we expect to be competitive,\" said the German.\n\n\"I think we need to not get distracted by the results but focus on the job we need to do.\n\n\"I think we have a fair chance.

I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process,\" Mr Kavanaugh said. \"I have been through hell and then some.\"\n\nMr Kavanaugh's testimony gave senators a stark choice. Earlier in the day, Dr Ford said her accusation was \"absolutely not\" a case of mistaken identity. She said the 1982 incident - including the \"uproarious laughter\" of Mr Kavanaugh and his friend who she says witnessed the attack - was \"seared into my memory\" even though she didn't remember all the details.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Mr Kavanaugh's nomination on Friday, and the full Senate could act as early as next week.\n\nThe hearing marked the first time Dr Ford had spoken publicly about her accusation, which could derail the confirmation, redefine the \"Me Too\" era and affect the fight for control of Congress in the Nov 6 election.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But as Mr Kavanaugh started to respond, Mr Leahy tried to cut him off.\n\nMr Kavanaugh retorted: \"I'm going to talk about my high school record if you're going to sit here and mock me.\"\n\nAfter Mr Kavanaugh talked about how he \"busted his butt\" on academics and played sports in high school, Mr Leahy said: \"We got a filibuster but not a single answer.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Dick Durbin challenged Mr Kavanaugh to ask the White House to order the FBI to question other witnesses about Dr Ford's allegations against him, a suggestion rejected by President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans.\n\n\"You know that's a phony question because the FBI doesn't reach conclusions,\" Mr Kavanaugh responded.\n\nSoon afterwards, GOP Senator Lindsey Graham erupted in anger. \"What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020,\" he said, pointing angrily at his Democratic colleagues. \"You've said that, not me. You've got nothing to apologise for.\"\n\n\"When you see Sotomayor and Kagan, tell them that Lindsey said hello because I voted for them,\" Mr Graham said, referring to Democratic-appointed Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\n\"I would never do to them what you've done to this guy. This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics.\"\n\nDr Ford told the committee that she's an independent person and \"no one's pawn\". She said she was sure that Mr Kavanaugh was the person who attacked her.\n\n\"With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?\" Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois asked Dr Ford.\n\n\"One hundred per cent,\" she responded.\n\nDr Ford, a California psychology professor, said the incident has \"haunted me episodically as an adult\".\n\nShe said she was \"terrified\" to testify before the committee and that she \"agonised daily\" about whether to come forward with her claim.\n\nMr Kavanaugh said: \"I intend no ill will to Dr Ford and her family.\"\n\nHe choked back tears while saying that his 10-year-old daughter, in saying her evening prayers recently, told his wife Ashley, \"we should pray for the woman\".\n\nThe nominee was tearful through portions of his opening statement: While expressing gratitude to his friends, saying he had no sexual intercourse until well after high school, and saying he drank beer in high school.\n\n\"But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out and I did not sexually assault anyone,\" he said.\n\nMr Kavanaugh said Dr Ford's allegation is \"refuted by the very people she says were there\", including a female friend of Dr Ford's who says she doesn't remember the party. He said his calendar for the summer of 1982 \"shows all but definitely that I was not there\".\n\nIf an unproven allegation \"is enough to destroy a person's life and career we will have abandoned the basic principles of fairness and due process that define our legal system and our country\", Mr Kavanaugh said.\n\nRepublicans are looking for Mr Kavanaugh to cement a conservative majority on the court, while Democrats say he could provide the fifth vote to overturn the Roe versus Wade decision that legalised abortion.\n\nPresident Trump watched the morning portion of the hearing from Air Force One and the afternoon session from the White House residence, aides said. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said he hasn't talked to Mr Kavanaugh in a couple of days.\n\nMr Kavanaugh forcefully assailed the committee's handling of Dr Ford's claims, saying that during the 11 days since the allegation became public, \"my family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false accusations\".\n\nDr Ford said Mr Kavanaugh's friend, Mr Mark Judge, was in the room during the attack and that the two were laughing at her. She said she had an \"indelible\" memory of \"the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense\".\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, brought Dr Ford to tears when he thanked her for coming forward.\n\n\"If we agree on nothing else today, I hope on a bipartisan basis we can agree on how much courage it has taken for you to come forward, and I think you have earned America's gratitude,\" Mr Blumenthal said.\n\nDr Ford silently mouthed, \"thank you\".\n\nShe cried again when Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey called her \"heroic\".\n\nDuring a break, GOP Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said he still expects the Judiciary panel to vote on Mr Kavanaugh on Friday and expects him to be voted out favourably.\n\nQuestioning of Dr Ford proceeded in five-minute chunks. Other than committee chairman Chuck Grassley, the committee's Republicans stayed mum, each instead having Arizona sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell ask questions during his allotted minutes. The 11 Republicans on the committee are all men.\n\n\"I found no reason to find her not credible,\" Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas said after Dr Ford completed her testimony, though he said Mr Kavanaugh's \"reputation is on the line, his career as well\".\n\nMs Mitchell's questioning presented a stark contrast to the sweeping statements of support from Democrats. Mitchell spent most of her time trying to clarify details of Dr Ford's story, covering the night of the alleged assault and the professor's decision to come forward by confidentially telling her congressional representative and the Washington Post.\n\nDr Ford said that though they went to different high schools, she had been friendly with a classmate of Mr Kavanaugh's and attended a number of parties that the future judge also attended.\n\nShe said the attack occurred after she went upstairs to use the bathroom. She said she was pushed into a bedroom and onto a bed and that Mr Kavanaugh got on top of her. Mr Judge was in the room and encouraged the attack, she said.\n\n\"I believed he was going to rape me,\" Dr Ford said. Mr Kavanaugh put his hand on her mouth to keep her from screaming, she said, and because it was hard for her to breathe, \"I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me.\"\n\nShe said Mr Judge, who has denied any part in such an attack, jumped on them and she was able to escape.\n\nAsked what she remembers from that night, Dr Ford responded: \"The stairwell, the living room, the bedroom, the bed on the right side of the room as you walk into the room - there was a bed to the right - the bathroom in close proximity, the laughter - the uproarious laughter - and the multiple attempts to escape and the final ability to do so.\"\n\nUnder questioning from Ms Mitchell, Dr Ford said she didn't know how she got home that night. She said the party took place \"somewhere between\" her home and the Columbia Country Club, about seven miles away.\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported she told the paper the party took place near the country club.\n\n\"Has anyone come forward to say to you, 'Hey, remember, I was the one that drove you home'?\" Ms Mitchell asked.\n\n\"No,\" Dr Ford responded. She said she didn't have her driver's licence at the time.\n\n'I WANT TO APOLOGISE'\n\nIn opening the hearing, Mr Grassley said, \"I want to apologise to you both for the way you've been treated\", referring to threats made against Dr Ford and Mr Kavanaugh after her allegation became public.\n\nAs she prepared to leave, he thanked her \"for your bravery coming out and trying to answer our questions as best you could remember\".\n\nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California thanked Ford for her \"strength and bravery in coming forward\".\n\n\"This is not a trial for Dr Ford,\" Senator Feinstein said. \"It's a job interview for Judge Kavanaugh.\"\n\nSenator Feinstein noted that two other accusers came forward in the last several days.

It now looks a wise move indeed.\n\nThe last time these two players met was back in 2016, when Murray was storming towards the world's number one ranking and enjoying a season that would end with nine singles titles, including his second Wimbledon crown and his second Olympic gold.\n\nBack then Murray won untroubled and 6-2, 6-2 at the Shanghai Masters, but it has been hard times for the Scotland-born player ever since his hip problems arose and then intensified in 2017.\n\nGoffin seems to bring out the best in the Brit, however, as Murray moved their head-to-head record to 6-0 in his favour.\n\nMurray had struggled with the steamy conditions at the Shenzhen Longgang Sports Centre in his opening match against Chinese world number 340 Zhang Zhizhen on Tuesday, dropping a set but then progressing when his opponent retired with cramp with the scoreline at 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 4-2.\n\nA day's rest looked to have done its work and he was all action on Thursday, before heading off into the night ahead of his return to the fray for Friday's quarter-finals.\n\nSee more on\n\nMen's tennis\n\nAndy Murray", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/2018-09-22t115336z_777524702_rc194fd91470_rtrmadp_3_tennis-britain-murray.jpg?VersionId=N3VXofLt88vyk.E8NRw4RamsQPLfLQKb", "alt_text": null}]}

She said the 1982 incident was \"seared into my memory\" even though she doesn't remember all the details.\n\nIt was the first time the American public saw the person whose accusations had dominated the headlines for weeks, having only seen her before mostly in a single grainy photo in which she was wearing sunglasses. Her nerves were evident, and her voice cracked during her testimony.\n\nSeating Mr Kavanaugh on the nation's top court - or not seating him - could affect the fight for control of Congress in the Nov 6 election. Republicans are looking for Mr Kavanaugh to cement a conservative majority on the court, while Democrats say he could provide the fifth vote to overturn the Roe versus Wade decision that legalised abortion.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was watching the hearing from Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. He hasn't talked to Mr Kavanaugh in a couple of days, she said.\n\nThe California psychology professor said the incident has \"haunted me episodically as an adult\".\n\nShe said she was \"terrified\" to testify before the committee and that she she \"agonised daily\" about whether to come forward with her claim.\n\nDr Ford said Mr Kavanaugh's friend, Mr Mark Judge, was in the room during the attack and that the two were laughing at her. She said she had an \"indelible\" memory of \"the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense\".\n\nSenate Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, brought Dr Ford to tears when he thanked her for coming forward.\n\n\"If we agree on nothing else today, I hope on a bipartisan basis we can agree on how much courage it has taken for you to come forward, and I think you have earned America's gratitude,\" Mr Blumenthal said.\n\nDr Ford silently mouthed, \"thank you\".\n\nShe cried again when Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey called her \"heroic\".\n\nDuring a break, GOP Senator Orrin Hatch told reporters that Dr Ford was \"an attractive, good witness\" but that it was too early to make a judgment. \"I don't think she's uncredible.\"\n\nAn aide said on Twitter that the senator meant to describe her personality, not her appearance.\n\nSenator Hatch said he still expects the Judiciary panel to vote on Mr Kavanaugh on Friday and expects him to be voted out favourably.\n\nQuestioning of Dr Ford proceeded in five-minute chunks. Other than committee chairman Chuck Grassley, the committee's Republicans stayed mum, each instead having Arizona sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell ask questions during his allotted minutes. The 11 Republicans on the committee are all men.\n\nMs Mitchell's questioning presented a stark contrast to the sweeping statements of support from Democrats. Ms Mitchell spent most of her time trying to clarify details of Dr Ford's story, covering the night of the alleged assault and the professor's decision to come forward by confidentially telling her congressional representative and the Washington Post.\n\nMr Kavanaugh's prepared statement said he doesn't question that Dr Ford may have been sexually assaulted by someone, but strongly denied that he was the attacker.\n\n\"I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr Ford,\" Mr Kavanaugh said. \"I have never done that to her or anyone. I am innocent of this charge.\"\n\nDr Ford said that though they went to different high schools, she had been friendly with a classmate of Mr Kavanaugh's and attended a number of parties that the future judge also attended.\n\nShe said the attack occurred after she went upstairs to use the bathroom. She said she was pushed into a bedroom and onto a bed and that Mr Kavanaugh got on top of her. Mr Judge was in the room and encouraged the attack, she said.\n\n\"I believed he was going to rape me,\" Dr Ford said.\n\nMr Kavanaugh put his hand on her mouth to keep her from screaming, she said, and because it was hard for her to breathe, \"I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me.\"\n\nShe said Mr Judge, who has denied any part in such an attack, jumped on them and she was able to escape.\n\nAsked what she remembers from that night, Dr Ford responded: \"The stairwell, the living room, the bedroom, the bed on the right side of the room as you walk into the room - there was a bed to the right - the bathroom in close proximity, the laughter - the uproarious laughter - and the multiple attempts to escape and the final ability to do so.\"\n\nUnder questioning from Ms Mitchell, Dr Ford said she didn't know how she got home that night. She said the party took place \"somewhere between\" her home and the Columbia Country Club, about seven miles away.\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported she told the paper the party took place near the country club.\n\n\"Has anyone come forward to say to you, 'Hey, remember, I was the one that drove you home'?\" Ms Mitchell asked.\n\n\"No,\" Dr Ford responded. She said she didn't have her driver's licence at the time.\n\n'I WANT TO APOLOGISE'\n\nIn opening the hearing, Mr Grassley said, \"I want to apologise to you both for the way you've been treated,\" referring to threats made against Dr Ford and Mr Kavanaugh after her allegation became public.\n\nAs she prepared to leave, he thanked her \"for your bravery coming out and trying to answer our questions as best you could remember\".\n\nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California thanked Ford for her \"strength and bravery in coming forward.\"\n\n\"This is not a trial for Dr Ford,\" Ms Feinstein said. \"It's a job interview for Judge Kavanaugh.\"\n\nMs Feinstein noted that two other accusers came forward in the last several days. They aren't scheduled to testify before the committee.\n\nA second woman, Ms Deborah Ramirez of Colorado, claims Mr Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken party when they were freshmen at Yale University.

Mr Peh had taken Chia's statement in October 2016.\n\nChia had said in his statement that he is \"just friends\" with Wong, whom he met some time in 2005 and 2007 when Wong was working at Marine Parade Town Council.\n\nWhile a handwritten ledger seized from Chia showed expenses that included charges for a mobile phone given to Wong, a sum of $20,000 given to Wong's mistress in China, and meals and other entertainment expenses, Mr Loh argued that these did not suggest there was anything illegal being done as the two men were friends.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to resume in November.\n\nSee more on\n\nTown councils\n\nCorruption\n\nAng Mo Kio", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/yq-c2-27092018_0.jpg?VersionId=nUblPp0cG.TnAVPN0s0xPhxe8QcRiqQv", "alt_text": null}]}

On whether the trend is expected to continue, he said: \"Much will depend on Malaysia's political landscape.\"\n\nThe Singdollar's ascent against the ringgit may also be a reflection of its strength, said Mr Khoon Goh, head of Asia research for ANZ.\n\nIt can also be attributed to market expectations that the Monetary Authority of Singapore may further tighten monetary policy at its upcoming October review, he added.\n\nMr Barakath Ali, first vice-president of the Money Changers Association (Singapore), said: \"We are expecting more consumers to buy up the ringgit.\"\n\nMr Barakath, who is also managing director at Aramex International Exchange in Sim Lim Square, said the spike in consumers buying ringgit usually comes when the Singdollar could buy at least RM3, which happened last month. Good ringgit sales have persisted since, he added.\n\nOn Thursday, the Indonesian rupiah slumped to 10,910.99 against the Singdollar, about the lowest it has been since at least 1992.\n\nFollowing the United States Federal Reserve's interest rate hike on Wednesday, however, the greenback strengthened against the Singdollar to S$1.3660 on Thursday, up from S$1.3644 a day earlier.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore dollar\n\nCurrencies", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/yq-sgdollarexchange-27092018.jpg?VersionId=c6cKHkQRi0zC9bnYlWV1.9RWa2XDN7Zh", "alt_text": null}]}

It is one of three government-to-government projects between Singapore and China. .\n\nTianjin Eco-city is sited on a\n\n30 sq km plot of land which was heavily polluted\n\nwhen the project was launched 10 years ago.\n\n\"Through the hard work and close collaboration between Tianjin and Singapore partners, we have built up the Eco-city into a green, vibrant, integrated township,\" said Mr Wong, as he opened the eighth STETC meeting at the Tianjin Guesthouse.\n\nMr Wong, who is in China to co-chair the STETC meeting and attend the\n\n10th anniversary celebrations of the Eco-city\n\n, noted that it has enjoyed significant growth with nearly 6,700 companies registered there.\n\nSingapore also remained committed to working with Tianjin to make the Eco-city, located in Tianjin's Binhai New Area, the \"forerunner in eco-city and eco-friendly development\", said Mr Wong.\n\nWork on the Eco-city was also one of several areas of cooperation flagged by Mr Wong's co-chair of the STETC, Tianjin mayor Zhang Guoqing.\n\nMr Zhang said the Eco-city was now prospering, and should now be upgraded and promoted on a larger scale.\n\n\"We hope to build a certain area that is a model or demonstration area for smart cities,\" said Mr Zhang.

The other reason is because Umno has decided against contesting,\" he said.\n\nMr Isa had served as Linggi state assemblyman for five terms. And he also won the Bagan Pinang state seat in a by-election in 2009.\n\nBoth seats are under the Port Dickson parliamentary constituency.\n\nMr Isa was also the former Teluk Kemang Umno chief. He said he has a good chance of winning as he had served the people there for a long time.\n\nPrior to a redrawing of constituency boundaries before the May 9 general election, the Port Dickson seat was known as Teluk Kemang.\n\nMr Isa is a controversial Umno leader who was found guilty of bribing voters in the party's internal polls in 2004. He was suspended from Umno for six years between 2005 and 2011.\n\nHe was made chairman of government agency Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) for six years from 2011, with allegations of financial misappropriation.\n\nThe fight for the Port Dickson seat could turn out to be a five-way contest, if three other candidates were to join in as announced earlier.\n\nParti Islam SeMalaysia on Thursday (Sept 27) evening announced retired Lieutenant-Colonel of the Royal Malaysian Air Force, Mohd Nazari Mokhtar, as its candidate. Two other possible candidates are the small Parti Rakyat Malaysia and\n\nanother person who plans to run as an independent\n\n.\n\nThere was also speculation that former Selangor menteri besar and a former PKR treasurer, Khalid Ibrahim, might throw his hat into the ring.\n\nNomination day is set for Saturday (Sept 29) and voting on Oct 13.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nElections", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/yq-isasamad-27092018.jpg?VersionId=Ew9DfqUSe63U0t4zvXZLkA.r03wXputi", "alt_text": null}]}

Mr Ong had led the review when he was the minister in charge of public service innovation.\n\nThe price-quality method has been widely used by government agencies for some years already, particularly in the IT and construction industries. Now, it will be the main option that they will use to evaluate tenders.\n\nMr Chee, who is also Senior Minister of State for Education, said the review is meant to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which take on government projects through enterprise and innovation. More than 80 per cent of government contracts go to SMEs today.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

This is paid over and above the current extra 1 per cent interest that is earned on the first $60,000 of their combined balances.\n\nAs a result, CPF members aged 55 and above will earn up to 6 per cent interest per year on their retirement balances.\n\nThe extra interest received on a member's Ordinary Account will go into their Special Account or Retirement Account to enhance their retirement savings.\n\nIf a member is above 55 years old and participates in the CPF Life scheme, the extra interest will still be earned on their combined balances, which includes the savings used for CPF Life.\n\nAdditionally, the interest rate for Ordinary Accounts will be maintained at 2.5 per cent per annum from Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2018, as the computed rate of 0.32 per cent is lower than the legislated minimum interest rate.\n\nCorrespondingly, the concessionary interest rate for HDB mortgage loans, which is pegged at 0.1 per cent above the Ordinary Account interest rate, will remain unchanged at 2.6 per cent per annum during the same time period.\n\nCPF members who have further inquiries may visit cpf.gov.sg or call the CPF call centre on 1800-227-1188.\n\nSee more on\n\nCPF\n\nHDB", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/yq-cpf-27092018.jpg?VersionId=0CPjZq74GCaHX1QzYrl7UYCV7SNhBDOo", "alt_text": null}]}

The next biggest trading partners were Japan, with trade worth A$68.6 billion, and the United States at A$66.5 billion. Singapore was in eighth place, with trade worth A$24.7 billion.\n\nAn analysis by auditing firm KPMG found that an all-out trade war - in which all countries hiked tariffs - would be \"extremely serious\", costing Australia A$500 billion over a decade as well as 60,000 jobs. But it found that even a limited trade war, restricted to currently announced tariffs, would cause Australia's gross domestic product to decrease by 0.3 per cent after five years. Total losses over this period would be A$36 billion.\n\n\"Australia and other nations should resist pressure to impose or increase tariffs on goods imported from the US and China, since doing so would do much more harm than good to their own economies,\" the firm said in a report.\n\nAustralia's central bank, the Reserve Bank, has also expressed concern about the impact of a trade war. In the minutes from its latest board meeting this month, the RBA said it was worried about potential fallout from the ongoing tariff hikes.\n\n\"Members observed that there were still significant tensions around global trade policy and that this represented a material risk to the outlook,\" the minutes stated.\n\nChina's thirst for resources - along with booming numbers of Chinese tourists and international students - have helped Australia enjoy 27 years of continuous economic growth, more than any other developed nation.\n\nAustralia, whose closest ally is the United States, tends to avoid outright criticism of Washington but has vociferously condemned President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on China and other nations.\n\nThe Trade Minister, Mr Simon Birmingham, said he was worried about the tariffs and recent attempts by Washington to disrupt the traditional rules of global free trade.\n\n\"We urge all nations to continue to respect, abide by what are now-long established international rules in relation to the way trade occurs,\" he told ABC Radio on Wednesday.\n\n\"We're deeply disappointed by the fact that the US administration has applied unilaterally tariff measures that go against those established rules, just as we are concerned by actions of other countries in terms of industrial subsidies that they might apply in different ways.\"\n\nReacting to the developments, the Business Council of Australia, which represents business leaders, said Australia should find a more diverse range of trading partners and look to boost trade with India, Europe and Britain.\n\n\"(The Federal Government needs) to make our economy more resilient, and less vulnerable to global changes,\" the council's chief executive, Ms Jennifer Westacott, told ABC News.\n\n\"Obviously, business is anxious about where this might end up.\"\n\nBut some sectors in Australia could potentially benefit from a limited trade war.\n\nChina's Vice-Commerce Minister, Mr Wang Shouwen, said this week that China would consider reducing imports of liquefied natural gas from the United States and instead increase supply from Australia.\n\nThe United States, Australia and Qatar are the world's largest suppliers of LNG and together will account for 60 per cent of global supplies by 2023.\n\n\"The US is a major supplier of LNG to China, but because of its trade restriction measures, China is compelled to adopt counter-measures,\" Mr Wang was quoted as saying in The Australian daily.\n\n\"Australia is an important source of China's LNG. The trading between China and Australia in LNG is pretty sizeable and there is huge potential,\" he added.\n\nSome analysts have also suggested that China may proceed with plans to cut tariffs for other countries, which could deliver a significant boost to Australia's agriculture sector, particularly grain growers.\n\n\"Should China make good on this policy it would present opportunities for Australian agribusinesses,\" Mr Tobin Gorey, a Commonwealth Bank analyst, told the Farm Online website.\n\n\"Pricing advantages might open up, at least against US competitors for various grain crops\u2026 The game in this context is to take advantage of opportunities as they arise but not to get invested in an irreversible way,\" he added.\n\nSee more on\n\nAustralia\n\nTrade\n\nChina\n\nUS economy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/yq-austraded-27092018.jpg?VersionId=ldjP7gjdv6Tp7T8fiiIGkgBZLme.3Cnp", "alt_text": null}]}

When queried, Seelan replied: \"The publicised image is meant to be open to interpretation.\"\n\nSeelan, now 33, is on trial after he\n\nallegedly staged a public procession outside of Hong Lim Park without a permit\n\nbetween 2.23pm and 3.15pm on Oct 1.\n\nA permit he had received from the National Parks Board for his performance was restricted to the Speakers' Corner in the park.\n\nSeelan is said to have committed an offence when he allegedly stepped out of the park and walked to the National Gallery where he used a marker to draw on a mirror that he had been holding.\n\nHe then walked to the Parliament House and stood in the middle of an entrance to a driveway, with the mirror in front of him.

This Italian-American staple, with its lemony, buttery pan sauce.\n\nPHOTO: THE NEW YORK TIMES/LINDA XIAO\n\nJulia Moskin\n\nFollow topic:\n\nRecipes\n\nPublished\n\nSep 27, 2018, 07:50 PM\n\nNEW YORK (NYTIMES) - There are people who never get tired of breaded chicken cutlets. (I know, because some of them live in my house.)\n\nFor the rest of us, finding a higher purpose for boneless, skinless chicken breasts is a lifelong mission. Their virtues are well known: They are quick-cooking, high-protein, crowd-pleasing, low-fat. As are their drawbacks: They are dry, tough, tasteless. A really well-seasoned, crunchy chicken cutlet is a fine thing to eat, but many other cooking methods - marinating, grilling, searing, poaching - only take the cut from bad to worse.\n\nChicken francese, with its butter lemon sauce, is the single best thing you can make with chicken cutlets. Chicken and lemon are a classic combination that almost every meat-eater likes. And it is one of those rare restaurant dishes that is truly easy to make at home.\n\n\"It's one of our most popular dishes, but I have no idea where it came from,\" Lisa Bamonte said at her family's 118-year-old restaurant, Bamonte's in Brooklyn, where the chicken francese is considered one of the best in the city. Four generations of her family, including Bamonte, have worked in the kitchen, so she is more than familiar with the recipe's signature elements: a flour dredge, an egg wash and a bright, plentiful sauce.\n\nLike piccata, Marsala and saltimbocca, francese was originally made with veal cutlets. Those dishes are Italian classics, and they all work the same way: A thin cut of meat gets a light coating of flour, then just enough time to brown in oil, then a drizzle of instant pan sauce. It is a fast but challenging formula. The veal or chicken must cook through in a flash to avoid scorching the coating, and you must immediately make the sauce and serve the dish, or it will be cold and dry.\n\nFrancese is a more forgiving dish, and here's why: It has an egg coating to keep the meat moist, and a plentiful pan sauce to keep the whole dish comfortingly warm. A dip in beaten eggs is traditional for European fried chicken (yes, there is such a thing) and classic dishes like Wiener schnitzel and fritto misto. During cooking, egg proteins form a thin but critical coating that protects the meat or fish from drying out. An egg-batter crust is not as crunchy as an American-style one, which adds a thick layer of flour or breadcrumbs.\n\nBut that's OK, because you're going to tuck the cooked cutlets back into the pan anyway, to reheat them and to give them a nice coating of sauce. And that means the dish is not such a split-second operation; you can cook the cutlets and make the sauce a few hours ahead, then reheat them just before serving.\n\nChicken francese, with its confusing name - \"francese\" is Italian for \"French\" - is not native to either place, as far as food historians have determined. A dish by that name is unknown in Italy, and there is no corresponding French recipe (although the sauce is a little bit like a beurre blanc, with butter whisked into a syrupy reduction of white wine).\n\nAll of which suggests that, like baked ziti and garlic bread, chicken francese is an Italian-American invention that was probably called \"French\" because of its luxurious, buttery sauce.\n\nChicken Francese\n\nYield: 4 servings Total time: 35 minutes\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 eggs\n\n2 Tbs whole milk\n\n1 tsp salt, plus more for seasoning\n\n\u00bd tsp ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n\u2153 cup olive oil\n\n\u2153 cup vegetable oil\n\n4 to 6 large boneless, skinless chicken cutlets (buy the cutlets thinly sliced, or buy regular boneless breasts and slice them in half horizontally to make thin pieces)\n\n3 to 6 Tbs unsalted butter\n\n1 lemon, thinly sliced, seeds removed (optional)\n\n\u00bd cup dry white wine\n\nFreshly squeezed juice of 1 lemon, more to taste\n\n2 cups chicken stock\n\n3 to 4 Tbs freshly minced parsley\n\nMethod:\n\n1. In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk eggs, milk, salt and pepper until blended. Place the flour in a separate bowl. Line a baking sheet with paper towels.\n\n2. In a wide skillet, heat olive and vegetable oils over medium heat until shimmering.\n\n3. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, lightly dredge the chicken in flour and shake off any excess. Dip into egg batter, let excess batter drip back into the bowl and place in the skillet. Fry, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Adjust the heat as the cutlets cook so they brown slowly and evenly, with a steady bubbling. Transfer to the paper-towel-lined pan and repeat with remaining cutlets.\n\n4. When all cutlets are browned, remove the pan from the heat and pour off the oil. Wipe out the pan with paper towels. Return the pan to low heat.\n\n5. If making the lemon slices (if not, skip to Step 6 below): Melt 3 Tbs of the butter and then scatter the lemon slices over the bottom of the pan. Cook, stirring gently occasionally, until the lemon slices are golden and browning around the edges, about 3 minutes. Scoop out the lemon slices and set them aside.\n\n6. Add 3 Tbs of butter, the wine and lemon juice and bring to a boil. Boil until the liquid is syrupy, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in the stock, bring to a boil and cook until thickened into a sauce, about 5 minutes. (It will thicken more when you add the cutlets.) Taste and adjust the seasonings with lemon, salt and pepper; it should be quite lemony and not too salty.\n\n7. Reduce the heat, tuck the cutlets into the pan and simmer very gently until the sauce is velvety and the chicken pieces are heated through, about 4 minutes. Turn the cutlets over occasionally in the sauce. Place the browned lemon slices on top. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve, spooning some of the sauce over each serving.\n\nAnd to Drink ...\n\nWith this bright, lemony dish, you want an equally shimmery dry white wine. It could be the same white you use for the sauce, with flavours that are not too assertive and lively acidity that refreshes. You could start by considering an array of Italian whites, like a good Soave or a vermentino from Liguria. You could easily select a gr\u00fcner veltliner from Austria, which is often the preferred wine with schnitzel. From France, you could try a sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley, a Chablis or an aligot\u00e9.

The leaves add aromatic flavour to the simple dish.\n\n\"It's also very easy to clean up,\" says Lorenzo, who runs the family business La Huerta Estate, a popular events place in Antipolo City. \"We eat it with our bare hands. We have a lot of banana leaves around the house.\"\n\nLorenzo grew up in the family's ancestral house in Antipolo. Built in 1969, the 1.5 ha property was a venue for relatives and friends to get together and eat. It had lots of fruit-bearing trees, ornamental plants and vegetables. This was where Lorenzo learned to prepare adobo, one of the family's favourite dishes.\n\nHe recalls: \"This heirloom recipe was passed on by my lola (Luisa Buhay) to my mom (Luz Lorenzo), who in turn taught it to our family cook Manang Ann.\" It is the saucy kind of adobo, with a combination of chicken and pork meat. The family enjoys this adobo swimming in fatty oil.\n\nOrganic recipe\n\n\"My kids pour the sauce on their rice until it turns brown,\" Lorenzo says. \"Even their friends enjoy the adobo.\" Instead of liempo (pork belly), Lorenzo prefers using kasim (shoulder) because of its fat and tissue that make it ideal for slow cooking\n\nManang Ann's Chicken Pork Adobo\n\nIngredients\n\n1 kg pork kasim\n\n8 pieces of chicken thighs or drumsticks\n\n2 cups white vinegar\n\n\u00be cup light soya sauce\n\n5 cloves smashed garlic\n\nWhole peppercorns, to taste\n\nGround black pepper, to taste\n\n3 laurel leaves\n\nMethod\n\n1. In a heavy pot, place the pork and chicken, add vinegar and soya sauce, garlic, pepper and laurel leaves. Cook pork and chicken until tender (note that chicken cooks faster than pork).\n\n2. Remove meat from pot and set aside the liquid. In a separate pan, fry the pork and chicken until nicely toasted. Return the meat into the pot and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Serve with rice.\n\nPresentation suggestion: Put rice on a banana leaf, top with adobo and quartered tomatoes.\n\nFor chicken, he goes for the thigh and drumstick. \"I prefer the dark meat,\" he says.\n\nHe combines a kilogram of chicken and pork in a deep pot, covers them completely with white vinegar before tossing in the garlic, peppercorn, bayleaf and soy sauce. The mixture is left to boil until the meat gets tender.\n\n\"I once tried using Ilocos vinegar in my adobo. I like its tanginess and intense flavor, but my kids and their friends don't like it. They are my target market. That is basically why I cook,\" says Lorenzo, a single dad to Carlos, 21, Teresa, 18, and Manuel, 16.\n\nHe separates the meat from the sauce, fries and toasts them. Once the meat is nice and brown, he puts them back in the sauce and lets everything simmer for a little while. He does not add water because he feels it dilutes the overall taste and essence of the adobo.\n\n\"It's a very pure, organic recipe-not sophisticated at all,\" Lorenzo says. \"But it packs a lot of flavour and brings back good memories to our family.\"\n\nHe pairs the adobo with slices of tomatoes seasoned with patis (fish sauce) and pepper. His mother enjoys it with ripe mangoes and bananas.\n\n\"This is the same adobo recipe we ate whenever we had family picnics in Antipolo for 40 or more guests,\" he says. \"We still wrap them in banana leaves for gustatory impact.\"\n\nLate bloomer\n\nLorenzo-who now lives with his children in Makati, but regularly hies off to Antipolo whenever his family has guests or clients-admits enjoying cooking late in life.\n\n\"I just ate when I was younger,\" he recounts. \"In fact, my first venture in baking was a disaster. I forgot to put baking powder.\"\n\nYet he grew up around food, absorbing and seeing all the preparations and cooking from his mom, aunts and Manang Ann. He would hang around with his siblings and cousins in the kitchen and watch the cooking.\n\nHe never thought about cooking on his own, because \"almost everybody in our house cooked. I didn't have to.\"\n\nLorenzo started cooking out of necessity-there was no household help. The adobo has become a weekly staple in his house. When there are leftovers, they are made into crispy adobo flakes. He has also learnt from watching cooking shows on TV and YouTube.\n\n\"We also have a lot of recipe books at home,\" he says, \"but YouTube has made it easier for me. That's how I learn to cook most.\"\n\nAside from adobo, his children crave his Beef Pares, Beef Ribs Stew, Lechon Kawali, Sinigang and Hofan noodles.\n\nHis love for steaks has likewise driven him to look for the best way to cook it. \"It starts with the quality and cut of meat,\" says Lorenzo, who prefers rib-eye steak that he seasons with salt and pepper, thyme, garlic and butter.\n\nWhen he is in Makati, he pan-sears the meat in a cast iron pan. When he is in Antipolo, he cooks over an open flame.\n\nHis greatest satisfaction in cooking? \"When my children eat, smile and then say, hmmm. That's what drives me crazy about cooking.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nFood and drink\n\nRecipes\n\nFilipino food\n\nCooking and cookbooks", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/t0920reyes-anton3.jpg?VersionId=1rxxC1xuPZl_IdlTCFLkG0oPoHyC6joL", "alt_text": null}]}

These will be taught to investigators, similar to the process at other law enforcement agencies.\n\nThese two changes are in response to the MOF's public consultation exercise with individuals and organisations in June. There were 70 suggestions raised with 47 accepted.\n\nThe Ministry rejected several suggestions relating to the GST on imported services that kicks in on Jan 1, 2020.\n\nThe draft bill seeks to impose an Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) regime on business-to-consumer imported services, such as video and music streaming, apps, listing fees on electronic marketplaces, software and online subscription fees.\n\nA reverse charge system will be used for businesses-to-businesses imported services - including marketing, accounting, IT and management services.\n\nSome respondents wanted more flexibility for overseas GST-registered suppliers under the OVR regime on how to determine status of customers - such as whether they reside within or outside Singapore.\n\nThe MOF did not accept the suggestion, stating that the current approach in the draft bill will need these suppliers to obtain payment, residence and access details, a process consistent with how other countries carry out OVR systems.\n\nThis is done through the credit card used, the billing address submitted by the customer and his or her Internet Protocol address.\n\n\"The proposed approach is unlikely to impose significant compliance cost on businesses as the information prescribed is typically already gathered by the supplier in the normal course of business,\" said the MOF.\n\nSome people also wanted a similar concession for the reverse charge regime, to determine if suppliers are subject to the regime through its GST-registration status in Singapore.\n\nThe MOF said the GST-registration status may not accurately reflect whether services are imported from overseas.\n\nOther accepted suggestions include:\n\n- To simplify the administration requirements for overseas suppliers registered under the OVR regime, only records of digital services supplied to customers in Singapore will be required, not all customers in and outside Singapore.\n\n- The Bill had called for a custodial sentence against those who are unauthorised to collect GST without a reasonable excuse or who are negligent. The Iras will now provide more details on its website on when these penalties can be meted out if the offence is committed by GST-registered businesses.\n\n- The Iras will also provide more details on specific tax rules, such as the transitional arrangements for supplies that straddle the implementation date for GST on imported services in Jan 1, 2020. It will do so in revised e-Tax Guides for the reverse charge and OVR by Jan 2019.\n\nThe Bill is slated to be introduced in Parliament next month.\n\nSee more on\n\nGST\n\nMinistry of Finance", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/yq-iraslogo-270918.jpg?VersionId=tdPHNBliU4ELdkhgKVBlSmL0m.v.hpWc", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Users may also be susceptible to bone disorders and an increased risk of infections and muscle weakness.\n\nDiclofenac, a potent painkiller, was also found in the \"Gold\" variant of the product. It can cause serious gastric bleeding, heart attacks and stroke when used over a prolonged period, especially in patients with underlying heart conditions, the authority said.\n\nLast Saturday (Sept 22), Chinese evening daily Shin Min Daily News reported that a 28-year-old woman had died in hospital after consuming a juice drink that contained dexamethasone for about six months.\n\nIn response to queries, the Singapore Civil Defence Force said that it responded to a call for assistance at 428 Yishun Avenue 11 at around 1.30pm on Sept 21. A Malay woman in her 20s was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.\n\nThe Straits Times understands that her death has been classified as a coroner's case and her cause of death has yet to be determined by a coroner's inquiry.\n\nThe woman, Ms Titinlismawati Sajali, had been taking the drink for pain relief. Her family told Shin Min that she had bought the product in the Geylang Serai area.\n\nChecks by ST also found that Jus Al Sunnah products were available on online retail platform Carousell and were advertised as a treatment for various conditions, including body pain, tiredness and gout. The listings have since been removed.\n\nIn June, Brunei's Ministry of Health issued a statement banning the import and sale of Jus Al Sunnah products in the country after their tests detected dexamethasone.\n\nOn Tuesday, Malaysia's Health Ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah also issued a ban on the product. He said that the company listed as the product's producer, Sri Saga Marketing S/B, did not exist.\n\nHSA advised members of the public to consult a doctor if they are taking the products as sudden discontinuation of steroids without medical supervision can cause withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue, confusion and low blood pressure.\n\nThe authority also said that sellers must stop selling the products immediately.\n\nSee more on\n\nHealth Sciences Authority\n\nFood hygiene/safety", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/yq-c2-27092018.jpg?VersionId=j0GjexjyQ1QNsrUMIjFrhXkJJI0u0hTT", "alt_text": null}]}

It achieves these speeds by using both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless bands, unlike existing 802.11ac routers that only use the 5GHz band.\n\nThe new 802.11ax standard also introduces a number of features to improve network efficiency and capacity. As a result, the RT-AX88U is said to offer up to 80 per cent greater Wi-Fi coverage than previous-generation models.\n\nClient devices such as smartphones and laptops that support the 802.11ax standard, are expected to be available next year, though the new standard is backward compatible with older Wi-Fi standards and will work with existing devices.\n\nIn addition to its new Wi-Fi features, the RT-AX88U comes with eight Gigabit LAN ports and is powered by a fast quad-core processor for smooth performance.

It is our national broadcaster. Australians love their ABC.

They didn't just walk over and try to pull the photographs off the wall or chew on them or anything like that,\" Dr McElligott told Reuters.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

We hope our research can now go forward using species such as sheep or cattle, or indeed, pigs.\"\n\nDr McElligott also hopes the study might help change our understanding of the humble goat.\n\n\"There's a public perception of goats being stupid. So, for the public to realise that goats can actually tell the difference between an angry and a happy face, we hope (this) will promote good animal welfare for this species.\"\n\nThe study found that the goats were more inclined to approach a happy face if it was positioned on the right of their enclosure, suggesting that goats, like humans, use the left hemisphere of their brains to process positive emotions.\n\nDr McElligott is already planning the next step in his research.\n\n\"What we would like to do is determine if goats can tell the difference between various human voices. For example, if they can tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar people. I'm pretty sure they can, but we need to study that,\" he said. \"Also, if they can tell the difference between an angry versus a happy human voice, because that has important implications on how farmers interact with their livestock.\"\n\nThe study, which Dr McElligott co-authored with Dr Christian Nawroth of Queen Mary University, Dr Natalia Albuquerque and Dr Carine Savalli from Brazil's University of Sao Paulo, and Dr Marie-Sophie Single from the Technical University of Munich, was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.\n\nSee more on\n\nScientific research\n\nAnimals", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/yq-goat-270918.jpg?VersionId=BMC6f4ulTOXXxfSn5BfYgJz2II_26HND", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

But the group failed after Malaysian forces sped to the scene when they were alerted by the crew, who hid in the tugboat.\n\nThe source said Suraka was backed by another group of seven under Salip Murah, who was waiting at the sea border.\n\nAfter the failed attempt, Philippine authorities tracked down Suraka to the Tawi-Tawi chain of islands in the southern Philippines and killed him a few days later, while several members of his eight-man gang were caught, the source added.\n\nSubsequently, Salip and his group fled towards the Philippines' Palawan island (north of Kudat), where they picked up two Filipino hostages and returned to Jolo.\n\nThe source said Indang paid two other groups one million pesos to seek high-value targets in Sabah waters.\n\nOn Sept 11, a group led by an Abu Sayyaf gunman named Titing used pump boats to sneak from Siluag island in the southern Philippines into Sabah waters by navigating through shallow shoals.\n\nPump boats, often likened to sea scooters, are powered by water pumps and used as a cheaper mode of transport to move around shallow waters without any hassle, rather than using outboard engines.\n\nThe source said for kidnap-for-ransom groups, travelling on a pump boat was much cheaper as it cost them about RM200 in fuel for a round trip from Jolo to Semporna. With speedboat engines, the fuel could cost over RM1,000.\n\n\"These pump boats are very agile, they can move through shallow waters and also seaweed farms without getting stuck like those with outboard engines,\" he said.\n\nIn the latest case, the abductors snatched two Indonesian fishermen at gunpoint from a trawler anchored near Pulau Gaya, which is about a 30- to 40-minute boat ride from Semporna town.\n\nMr Samsul Sagunim, 40, and Mr Usman Yunus, 35, were taken on a pump boat to Jolo, where they are said to be held by Indang in Patikul.\n\n\"The kidnappers thought that the hostages were Malaysians as the fishing trawler flew the Malaysian flag,\" said the source, adding that a Malaysian hostage could be worth a ransom of about RM1 million (S$329,893.87), whereas it was only about RM50,000 for an Indonesian boatman.\n\nSabah Police Commissioner Datuk Omar Mammah told reporters on Tuesday that the captors were demanding RM4 million for the release of the fishermen.\n\n\"That's not surprising, because usually the initial ransom demand is outrageous as it is part of such groups' bargaining process,\" said the source.\n\nBefore this, the last abduction in Sabah waters was on Dec 8, 2016, when the notorious Abraham @ Ibrahim went on a kidnapping spree.\n\nIn his third bid that night, Abraham and two accomplices were killed by police in a gunfight off Pulau Gaya, in Semporna.\n\nPolice rescued a victim, but two other kidnappers and a second victim are still missing at sea.\n\nAccording to the source, the second kidnap-for-ransom group, led by one self-styled \"Commander Black\", is lurking in the waters between eastern Sabah and the Tawi-Tawi chain of islands.\n\n\"Commander Black is an emerging kidnapper.

Fee income via transactions on the app has also jumped by 46 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, retail time deposits opened through digital channels grew eight times faster than that of traditional banking channels.\n\nGoing forward, OCBC NISP is targeting to make up to 90 per cent of its existing branch functionalities available on ONe Mobile.\n\nThe bank is keen on creating digital products and services beyond traditional banking. It will do so by working with non-bank partners and fintech firms.\n\n\"The presence of start-ups that work quickly in creating innovations and creative thinking are the drivers of business transformation in the Indonesian banking sector,\" said Altona Widjaja, OCBC NISP Bank's head of new digital ventures.\n\n\"Therefore, collaborations with startups are expected to support OCBC NISP Bank's efforts to be a part of our customers' daily lives.\"\n\nThe bank is exploring partnerships in vertical start-up industries such as education, housing, health and B2B (business-to-business) services.\n\nAs OCBC forges ahead with digitalisation, it has set targets beyond Indonesia.\n\nAs a whole, the group is aiming to reach a steady state cost-to-income ratio of about 40 per cent, up from the current ratio of 43 per cent, said Mr Tsien. He believes that such a steady state will emerge within the next five years, as investments into digital transformation continue to yield cost savings and incremental earnings.\n\nThe group's digitalisation efforts to date have seen a tripling in sales leads conversion from 2012 to 2017. As at the first half of 2018, 87 per cent of financial transactions and 70 per cent of remittances are done digitally.\n\nDigital customers, defined by OCBC as those who have used Internet or mobile banking at least once in three months, now rake in higher revenues compared to non-digital ones - two times more for the consumer segment, and three times more for the SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) segment.\n\nToday, 48 per cent and 60 per cent of OCBC's consumer and SME customers respectively are digital customers.\n\nThe group is targeting to push this proportion up to 60 per cent and 70 per cent respectively at steady state, across all core markets.\n\nKey strategies include leveraging artificial intelligence and data analytics to strengthen customer relationships and drive scalability. OCBC also aims to have 85 per cent of applications on the cloud by 2023, up from 35 per cent in 2018.\n\nSee more on\n\nOCBC\n\nIndonesia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/akocbc2709.jpg?VersionId=.t0.jONPxyezjRMkSaIM6jAQdlpOV7DW", "alt_text": null}]}

They (the army) didn't commit any wrongdoing,\" he told reporters.\n\nHe added that tests on the devices \"worked\" at the time they were purchased without elaborating on how the military had reached that conclusion.\n\nThe GT200s creators falsely claimed that the handheld device was powered by the user's static electricity rather than a battery.\n\nIt also had a substance-detecting \"sensor card\" inside a plastic handle, they said, which could sniff out tiny amounts of explosives or drugs from hundreds of metres away, even through walls and underground bunkers.\n\nThe claims were rubbished by scientists.\n\nThe kingdom's defence budget has nearly tripled over the last decade, a period where the military has seized power twice.\n\nExpensive purchases or military upgrades - such as US$1 billion (S$1.4 billion) set aside for Chinese submarines - have frequently been met with public criticism for a lack of transparency.\n\nIn the 1990s, Thailand's military also bought an aircraft carrier but it soon became a notorious white elephant after its ageing Harrier jets were withdrawn from service and never replaced.\n\nSee more on\n\nThailand\n\nDefence and military", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/yq-bomd-270918.jpg?VersionId=ngPgK2xEX4spT10O5KRoYKEVLDB_e53L", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

In an interview this summer, Mr Akira Chen, the director of the Changhua county cultural affairs bureau, said the huge temple addition had been slated for demolition because of concerns about its structural safety, but that the government did not have the funds at the time to take action.\n\nBut circumstances appear to have changed. Speaking on Wednesday by telephone from the demolition site, Mr Chen said it would take at least a week to tear down the entire temple addition, which will leave only the original, smaller temple structure on the property. According to Mr Chen, Mr Wei, the contractor, will be forced to pay the cost of demolition.\n\nIt remains unclear what will happen next.\n\nIn the decades since the Chinese Nationalists were defeated by the Chinese Communist Party and set up a government in exile in Taiwan, the island has evolved from a harsh, authoritarian system into a flourishing democracy with freedom of speech and expression.\n\nBecause of those protections, Mr Chen said, the government would not be able to stop Mr Wei from setting up a similar shrine to the Chinese Communist Party in the original, smaller part of Biyun Temple despite concerns about his stated goals in setting up what he called his \"patriotic education base\".\n\n\"I declare to the whole world and all of China that I am determined to lead the people of Taiwan province to reunify with our motherland,\" Mr Wei once said.\n\nThough Mr Wei insists that creating the Communist Party shrine was his own idea, locals have expressed concerns - with no direct evidence - that Mr Wei is acting as a proxy for the Beijing government, a suspicion that has been amplified by recent revelations about China's efforts to influence the domestic affairs of countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThat possibility, Mr Chen said, was alarming.\n\n\"While freedom of speech is important, this is also about the national security of Taiwan,\" he said. \"The government and people in Taiwan should consider this more seriously.\"\n\nThe demolition comes as Beijing has been ramping up pressure on Taiwan, which China's communist government sees as part of its rightful territory but has never ruled.\n\nUnder President Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic Progressive Party is sceptical of closer relations with China, cross-strait relations have worsened. Earlier this month, Beijing and Taipei exchanged new accusations of espionage.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday morning, Mr An Fengshan, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said the demolition of the temple addition showed that \"some people in the Democratic Progressive Party not only tolerate and ignore separatist behaviour promoting 'Taiwan independence', they also attack and persecute Taiwanese who favour unification\".\n\n\"Such an action must be subject to strong opposition and condemnation from people on both sides of the strait.\"\n\nReached by telephone on Wednesday morning, Ms Lee Pai-jan, Mr Wei's wife, said it was \"not convenient\" for her husband to talk.\n\nFor now, though, there is relief in the village. Since 2012, after Mr Wei took over the temple and evicted the nuns of Biyun Temple, the nuns have been living in a makeshift encampment adjacent to the temple property and making their case to move back to the temple, to no avail.\n\nShi Fa-ming, one of the nuns, said on Wednesday morning that in the light of the demolition, they could be a step closer to reclaiming the temple.\n\n\"I'm happy and I'm hopeful,\" she said.\n\nSee more on\n\nTaiwan\n\nChina\n\nCross-strait ties", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/bp_biyun_270918_63.jpg?VersionId=ONap85OYQ7RxHNl4f096uHQoxlRK3BUo", "alt_text": null}]}

This has continued to put upward pressure on rents.\"\n\nRent growth in the quarter was broad-based across all sub-markets, said JLL. But the pace of CBD Grade A rent growth has also been decelerating for three consecutive quarters, from a recent high of 4.2 per cent quarter on quarter in Q4 2017, to 2.3 per cent quarter on quarter in Q3 2018.\n\nThis was cheered by Tay Huey Ying, head of research and consultancy for JLL Singapore, as a positive, \"as it makes for a more sustainable growth trajectory\", she said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The demand and supply dynamics of Grade A office space in the CBD is supportive of continued rent growth, but the availability of good grade office space outside the CBD during this period should keep growth in check and sustainable.\"\n\nJLL said that new completions in the CBD will taper down sharply to circa 0.8 million sq ft in 2018, coming from Frasers Tower and 18 Robinson which are about 70 per cent committed or pre-committed as at Q3 2018, following the addition of more than two million sq ft net lettable area of office space in 2017 arising from the completion of Marina One and UIC Building.\n\nNext year could also see what JLL called a peak in the squeeze for space as the withdrawal of Chevron House for refurbishment will shrink the leasing stock at a time when the market is void of new completions, though the completion of the redevelopment of Park Mall and Funan located outside the CBD in 2019 could relieve some upward pressure on Grade A CBD rents.\n\nMore supply will come from 2020 onwards. ASB Tower and Afro-Asia I-Mark are due to complete in 2020, and this will be followed by the scheduled completion of CapitaSpring and the redevelopment of Hub Synergy Point in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, IOI Properties' development in Marina Bay and GuocoLand's development on Beach Road should complete, JLL added.\n\nHence, over the next four years (2019-2022), the CBD will see an average annual new supply of 0.8 million sq ft, slightly under the 10-year historical average net take-up of 0.9 million sq ft.\n\n\"The potential withdrawal of ageing assets for redevelopment will further tip the balance in favour of demand, and support rents,\" JLL said.\n\nAccording to URA Space, the written permission for the redevelopment of Keppel Towers on Hoe Chiang Road was renewed in April 2018.\n\nJLL said that several other owners are understood to be mulling over redevelopment plans for their ageing assets.\n\nMs Tay said: \"A government land sales programme that places greater emphasis on office land supply outside the CBD will complement today's demand and supply dynamics to bring about steady and sustainable CBD office rent growth, encourage a market-led urban rejuvenation and drive decentralisation.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nProperty market/sector\n\nRental", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/colin-so2-27.jpg?VersionId=dutAGSdGqBCCIEXhMHzkdd4Y9rfFuwiW", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

But these factors have also led to the rise of a multi-polar world, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in New York on Wednesday (Sept 26).\n\nThe question is whether the transition to a multi-polar world can be managed peacefully, Dr Balakrishnan told an audience at the Asia Society Policy Institute, in a discussion with the institute's president and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, on the theme \"New realities for South-east Asia\".\n\nDr Balakrishnan identified three new realities: the digital revolution, protectionism, and major power competition.\n\nStressing the levels of US and Chinese investment in South-east Asia, Dr Balakrishnan said the hope in the region is that \"cool heads prevail\" between the two countries.\n\n\"We hope there will be enlightened self-interest and a long-term perspective,\" he said.\n\n\"If there is, we can move into another phase characterised by new technologies, new world orders, new architectures which hopefully will still be open, fair (and) transparent, (and) will give opportunities to people all over the world who are willing to learn new things, work very hard and create a sustainable world along the way.\"\n\nAmerica had been part of South-east Asia's success story for 70 years, he emphasised, because in its own enlightened self-interest, it had underwritten that order.\n\nAnd Americans are welcome in South-east Asia, he told the audience. \"They are liked, they are popular,\" he said. \"Don't take your eye off the ball, don't retreat, don't give up.\"\n\nSouth-east Asia hopes America and China have an \"adult relationship\", he said - competing but also acting in enlightened long-term self-interest, while accepting Asean unity and centrality.\n\nRather than the alternative of Asean becoming a \"bunch of proxy states\", the hope is that a united Asean would be seen as valuable and a major trading partner for both the US and China.\n\n\"We hope all powers in our area will also operate by multilateral rules and we will continue to have access to multilateral institutions and ways of resolving disputes,\" he added.\n\nQuoting a speech by President Donald Trump the previous day at the United Nations General Assembly, Dr Balakrishnan said: \"Everyone is a patriot; everyone has to look to their own self-interest.\n\n\"But we believe in long-term enlightened self-interest.\"\n\nHe said this meant both competing and cooperating with neighbours, particularly on existential challenges including climate change, the digital revolution and the next pandemic.\n\n\"All these big challenges require multilateralism, cross-border cooperation, a set of rules by which we can all operate,\" he said.\n\nCiting loss of public support for free trade between 2015 and late 2016 in America, and the apparent erosion of global consensus, Dr Balakrishnan said: \"The real issue is technology, but it is very easy, it is very Twitter-worthy, to blame foreigners, to blame competition (and) free trade, for stagnation of wages and potential loss of jobs.\"\n\nOn the digital revolution, he said: \"South-east Asia can't assume that we can just stay on the old path.\n\n\"We need to train our people for new jobs rather than trying to compete for old jobs, because if you compete for old jobs, that's the route to middle class stagnation, middle class angst, and increasing unemployment, especially when people lose their jobs in their 40s and 50s.\"\n\nHe added that there was a larger political message: \"Whenever the middle class feels stressed and people feel unable to cope with change, you always see reactionary right or left wing extremes, whether it is fascism or communism.\"\n\nDr Balakrishnan also noted the necessity of understanding the age and preparing people and societies to get ahead of this change, rather than pander to fears and pretend that erecting walls and insulating people from competition will be the answer.\n\n\"We need to focus on research and development and collaboration, and creating new ways of value extraction from data, and to use the new tools - and artificial intelligence is an example. That's where the future is, that's where the future wealth is.

But she has also said it will only happen when the time is right, implicitly acknowledging the backlash it may provoke.\n\nPro-Beijing lawmaker Felix Chung argues that it is better for Hong Kong to enact the legislation itself, rather than the Chinese government imposing its own national law onto the city.\n\nPro-China moderates have proposed combining the legislation with promised political reform to appease the pro-democracy camp.\n\nBut Mr Chung believes Beijing is unlikely to go for that.\n\n\"From the perspective of the central government, national security cannot be compromised,\" he said.\n\nMr Martin Lee, a veteran pro-democracy lawyer and former member of the Basic Law drafting committee, said he believed from the outset that Hong Kong should only activate Article 23 if it did not water down existing human rights and went alongside the granting of universal suffrage, also promised in the mini-constitution.\n\nNow he regrets the article's inclusion in the Basic Law.\n\n\"After all these years, people are no longer confident in the central government,\" Mr Lee told AFP, saying he feared Article 23 could be used to \"throw people into prison\" in the future.\n\nBusiness leaders are also concerned that the rule of law that has been the bedrock of Hong Kong's status as the region's leading financial hub could be dented if the clause is implemented.\n\nMr Jack Lange, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said any new national security legislation would need to be \"very narrowly tailored\" to reassure foreign companies.\n\nThe primary concern would be \"the degree to which they can use that law as basis for investigating you, intruding into what you're doing, requiring you to hand over data and other information\", he told AFP.\n\nJournalists fear the implementation of Article 23 would foster the self-censorship that is already on the rise in Hong Kong and restrict reporting on topics deemed sensitive by Beijing.\n\nHong Kong Journalists Association chairman Chris Yeung said he was concerned the legislation would be \"deliberately vague and ambivalent\" to make it easier to prosecute political targets.\n\nMr Yeung believes the more insecure the Chinese government feels, the harder they will tighten their grip.\n\nA \"paper tiger\" is no longer enough for authorities, said Mr Yeung. \"Now they want a real tiger that bites.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nHong Kong\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/akhkchflags2709.jpg?VersionId=uP6ccrO1ILsZVKfJGs9vFFYv7fjs9uZj", "alt_text": null}]}

They also discussed land reclamation works at the Strait of Johor and their potential adverse impact on the environment.\n\nThe meetings also saw deep discussion in moving towards \"zero-waste\", with Malaysia studying whether it can apply some of Singapore's ideas.\n\nMs Yeo said the challenge was to implement a \"circular economy\" where products can be repeatedly reused so \"the net production of waste that we eventually have can be reduced as we cope with an increasing population\".\n\nMr Masagos said that Singapore has pursued a strategy of \"co-creating solutions\" with the public, such as using technology to make it simple for them to separate waste.\n\nIn an informal meeting with Malaysia's Water, Land and Natural Resources Minister Xavier Jayakumar, Mr Masagos also discussed the joint hydrometric modelling study of Johor River, which was first announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and then Malaysian PM Najib Razak at the eighth Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat in Singapore in January.\n\nThe study is intended to help increase the water yield and conserve supply at the Linggiu Reservoir, which discharges water into the Johor River.

Of the 10, half were fake.\n\nIn fact, 91 per cent had incorrectly chosen at least one of the five fake headlines as being real.\n\nIn response to media queries, an Ipsos spokesman said the fake headlines were sourced from newnation.sg, a satirical news site.\n\nExamples of the fake headlines include \"Orchard Road smoking ban to improve suburban malls' attractiveness\" and \"Increasing food costs will deter eating, help Singaporeans fight obesity\".\n\nIpsos said that the survey showed there was no correlation between people's confidence in their ability to detect fake news and their actual ability.\n\nMeanwhile, almost half of the Singaporeans surveyed said they had been previously duped by a news story they first believed to be real.\n\nYounger Singaporeans between 15 and 24 years old were particularly susceptible, with more than half of them (55 per cent) admitting that this has happened to them.\n\nAlso, more than a quarter of Singaporeans say that if they disagree with a news story, it is likely fake.\n\nOn the other hand, about two in five Singaporeans - mostly men - say they trust news that they agree with.\n\nOnline sites, including social media platforms, have become the primary sources of information for many Singaporeans, instead of traditional media, according to Ipsos.\n\nAbout 60 per cent access news via Facebook, 53 per cent on other social media platforms and 52 per cent read news websites.\n\nIn addition, 44 per cent of them say that they have consumed news shared via messaging platform WhatsApp in the month preceding the survey.\n\nOnly 38 per cent get their news from broadcast/cable television, 30 per cent tune in to news radio and 14 per cent listen to talk radio.\n\nDespite the fact that Singaporeans enjoy getting their news from digital media, participants still rely on traditional news platforms for accurate news, with 60 per cent saying they trust these platforms \"a fair amount\" and about 20 per cent saying that they have \"a great deal\" of trust.\n\nThe survey found that men are significantly more likely to trust digital channels, including online-only news publications and social media (34 per cent); Twitter (30 per cent); and WhatsApp (29 per cent).\n\nOn the other hand, older Singaporeans - those aged 45 to 65 - trust traditional sources more, including print and news radio.\n\nWhile they may be reliant on social media as a news source, Singaporeans are discerning about who is sharing the information online.\n\nTraditional Singapore news media companies, as well as government ministries and statutory boards are the most trusted sources on social media, the survey found.\n\nMeanwhile, sponsored posts have the least credibility in the eyes of Singaporeans.\n\nWhile the majority of Singaporeans value veracity of the news above all else (77 per cent), 14 per cent place greater weight on the ability of the news story to evoke certain emotions in them, while a smaller group (9 per cent) appreciate if the content aligns with their personal opinions.\n\nWomen (81 per cent), and those aged between 55 and 65 (86 per cent), are significantly more likely to value the veracity of news above other factors.\n\nAssociate research director of Ipsos in Singapore Robert McPhedran said the research corroborates the Government's strong concern about fake news.\n\n\"Despite their high levels of confidence, all Singaporeans - irrespective of educational attainment and media consumption habits - find it difficult to discern between real and fake news,\" he said.\n\nHe added that \"this is indeed a serious social issue\", with the proliferation of digital media here and the dire consequences of fake news seen globally.\n\nMr Benjamin Ang, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the survey's results reflected a trend that was not unique to Singapore.\n\n\"By definition, news is something we haven't heard before - so if we don't have a reason or opportunity to search for verification, it's really very hard to decide on one's own whether news is true, especially if it's something we want to believe.\"\n\nHe said that the problem is usually exacerbated when news appears online, as it is easier to make something false look authentic on the Web. He added that people typically read online news when they are on the go, and are usually in a rush and not in the mood to verify whether what they read is true.\n\nMr Ang said the survey results are a good reminder for Singaporeans not to be overconfident, and to treat what they read with healthy scepticism.\n\nHe added that taking time to verify news that resonates with what people believe \"goes against our nature, but if we want to avoid spreading misinformation, it's something we should do\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Timothy Goh\n\nSee more on\n\nFake news\n\nSurveys", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/akpeopleusingphones2709.jpg?VersionId=EhS2IjGi3FaNIsTn.a1NYZIvdco8uTF2", "alt_text": null}]}

Bush who's now a professor at Princeton.\n\n\"US policy always has engendered opposition from allies - Germany and France during the 2003 invasion of Iraq - but what's new is the derision.\"\n\nNo one was in a bridge-building mood. With\n\nUS-China trade tensions\n\nonly getting worse, Mr Trump suggested his\n\nmuch-touted friendship with President Xi Jinping\n\nwas coming to an end and accused Beijing of interfering in the upcoming US mid-term elections.\n\nAlmost as glaring was the mini-drama that unfurled at a luncheon for leaders on Tuesday, when cameras caught the President ignoring Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's attempt to say hello. Mr Trump then curtly shook his hand but would not get up from his seat as he did for other leaders.\n\nMr Trump later said at a free-wheeling press conference on Wednesday evening that he\n\nrejected Mr Trudeau's request for a one-on-one meeting\n\n, saying, \"Canada has treated us very badly.\"\n\nMr Trudeau later said he had never sought a meeting.\n\n\"Lashing out at the Canadians in highly personal terms was diplomatic carnage,\" said Mr Richard Gowan, a senior fellow at the United Nations University's Centre for Policy Research.\n\nMr Gowan called Mr Trump's more than hour-long press conference \"a steaming hot mess\".\n\nMr Trump and his team believe they can afford to be dismissive. Iran's economy has been pinched by US sanctions that he vows will only get tougher.\n\nMr Trump said his\n\noutreach to North Korea\n\nhelped stave off a nuclear war that looked imminent when he came to office. If Canada doesn't back down on dairy tariffs, Mr Trump argued, he'll just tax cars imported from the north.\n\n\"The world loathes what Trump says, but they pay deep attention to the new credible threats of economic and military coercion,\" said Dr Charles Lipson, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Chicago.\n\n\"Trump sees the old international order as fundamentally unsustainable.\"\n\nAs the week went on, domestic politics proved to be increasingly distracting, with stories about his\n\nembattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\n\ncrowding Mr Trump's foreign policy agenda out of the headlines.\n\nThat led to some awkward moments. Most glaring was during the opening of his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, when he accused Democrats of \"bringing people out of the woods\" to smear Judge Kavanaugh, who will confront allegations of sexual assault at a Senate hearing on Thursday.\n\n\"They can do that to anybody, they can do it to anybody,\" Mr Trump said as he sat next to Mr Abe. \"Other than perhaps Prime Minister Abe because he's so pure.\"\n\nAs his UN trip wound down, Mr Trump declined to acknowledge the distress he appeared to have left in his wake.\n\nAsked about the laughter that greeted the opening of his General Assembly speech, the US President said the\n\naudience was laughing with him\n\n, not at him.\n\n\"We had fun,\" Mr Trump said. \"People had a good time with me.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS foreign policy\n\nUN\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/bp_trump_270918_68.jpg?VersionId=fvugiZQ0duMTAbLFmM9TLAVVjGtAjQmf", "alt_text": null}]}

When I decided to speak out on TV - which amounts to social suicide - I was ready to resign and become a recluse for the rest of my life.\"\n\nMs Seo's story exemplifies the plight of many South Korean women - well-educated and hard-working, yet discriminated against and mistreated by their employers - as well as their frustration at the slow pace of social change.\n\nEven though South Korean women generally outscore men at school and in the entry-level job market, the country consistently ranks at the bottom of OECD surveys on gender pay gaps or female presence in senior positions.\n\nMany women have experienced workplace sexual harassment, but those who speak out are often castigated for \"causing a stir\", marginalised, and sometimes fired.\n\nMs Seo's case showed that even an elite prosecutor was no exception.\n\nShe regularly faced verbal or physical harassment by bosses or male colleagues after joining the prosecution agency in 2004, she said.\n\nAfter the groping at the funeral, Ms Seo consulted senior prosecutors who promised to persuade the man she accused, Mr Ahn Tae-geun, to apologise personally.\n\nThe apology never came. Instead, Ms Seo was reprimanded and reassigned to a relatively junior position in distant Tongyeong, a small town on the country's south coast, despite having previously received ministerial awards for her performance.\n\nSuspecting Mr Ahn might be behind the move, she lodged a series of formal complaints, only to be scolded for rattling the agency, a deeply hierarchical organisation where loyalty is highly valued.\n\nWomen account for 30 per cent of prosecutors, but occupy only eight per cent of senior positions at the agency, and a government survey this year showed 70 per cent of female prosecutors had reported experiencing sexual harassment or abuse.\n\nMost stayed silent because they feared professional setbacks.\n\nMore widely, a survey by the Korea Women Workers' Association showed nearly 65 per cent of women who complained about workplace harassment suffered damage to their careers.\n\nIt took Ms Seo - who is married with one son - eight years to muster the bravery to go public.\n\nAfterwards, she said, \"many women thanked me, saying they took courage from my move because my case made them realise that it was not their fault that they could not dare to speak out after being abused - it was society's fault.\"\n\nMs Seo's television interview triggered an outpouring of support for her as well as a deluge of accusations by other women.\n\nMr Ahn - who was separately fired for corruption last year - could not be charged with sex abuse because the one-year statute of limitations had expired.\n\nHowever, he was indicted for abuse of power, accused of using his position to pressure senior prosecutors to reassign Ms Seo to a junior position in revenge.\n\nHe denies the sexual abuse accusations, maintaining he was too drunk to remember what happened at the 2010 funeral, and a verdict in his closely watched trial is expected later this year.\n\nBut some of those who followed in Ms Seo's wake have faced a legal backlash, their alleged abusers countering with lawsuits in a country where libel is a criminal offence and the truth not necessarily a defence.\n\nIn other cases, victims have been shamed for coming forward and subjected to vicious personal attacks.\n\nFormer presidential contender\n\nAhn Hee-jung was acquitted last month of repeatedly raping a female aide\n\nwith the court saying she had not shown \"victim-like\" behaviour because she had not quit the job.\n\nOne of the politician's male aides was recently caught posting more than 1,000 anonymous online diatribes against the woman.\n\nMs Seo has not been exempt from paying what she describes as \"a hefty price for speaking out\".\n\nShe has been on sick leave since the television interview and does not expect ever to return to the prosecutor's office.\n\n\"But I don't regret what I did,\" she said. \"The long history of blaming, shaming and muzzling victims of sex abuse - instead of perpetrators - should stop here, now.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSex offences", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/akseojh2709_0.jpg?VersionId=L1vYKnwpuUqG58H6ujrMYxuhwLyKX.Av", "alt_text": null}]}

Skipping OMO today per se does not have an implication on future rates move,\" said Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy for Asia at Westpac.\n\n\"That said, this time round, there is minimal pressure for the PBOC to hike OMO rates given the narrow spreads with market rates.\"\n\nThe interest rate for seven-day reverse repurchase agreements stood at 2.55 per cent in the last cash injection on Sept.20, while market rates largely swung in a range of 2.55 to 2.7 per cent in recent months.\n\nReverse repos are one of its most commonly used tools to control liquidity in the financial system.\n\nThe PBOC has not changed benchmark one-year lending or deposit rate since October 2015.\n\nWith 60 billion yuan (S$11.93 billion) worth of reverse repos maturing on Thursday, the PBOC drained the same amount of funds from the money market for the day.\n\nThe yuan was little changed after the Fed and PBOC decision.\n\nChinese authorities took several steps last month to stabilise the currency after largely standing aside and letting it fall for 10 straight weeks over the summer. But analysts expect it will come under renewed pressure in coming months if the US dollar remains buoyant and as US tariffs start to bite on China's exporters.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina economy\n\nInterest rates\n\nUS economy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/akbankofchina2709.jpg?VersionId=SjkqatzgvNPUxorjyrYEfu0Li4UiJJ1j", "alt_text": null}]}

Formed in 2008, IHiS is an agency which runs the IT systems of all public healthcare institutions here.\n\nMr Tan, whose main task is planning business continuation programmes, said he was not trained in cyber security or server administration, and had not been given any standard operating procedures for managing security incidents.\n\nThe last time the exploited server received the necessary security software updates was in May last year, following the spread of the WannaCry ransomware that disrupted healthcare, manufacturing, transport and government operations around the world. IHiS had circulated instructions to update all Windows servers.\n\nMr Tan learnt that the exploited server became infected with a virus sometime in July this year - 14 months after the last security software update. An IHiS staff member could not update the anti-virus software within this server, as it was too old and had to be reinstalled. The IHiS staff member told Mr Tan to disconnect the server from the SingHealth network to perform manual anti-virus software installation and virus signature updates.\n\nOn July 10, when Mr Tan scanned the server, he detected three security threats, two of which had been cleaned up, but one had been \"quarantined\".\n\nThe intrusions on SingHealth's electronic medical records system began undetected on June 27 before being discovered on July 4 and terminated by an IHiS staff member.\n\nThe Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and upper management at IHiS and SingHealth were informed of the attack on July 10.\n\nOn Thursday, Ms Serena Yong, director of IHiS infrastructure services division, said that she was not aware that the server in question was not being managed by IHiS in practice.\n\nShe had given a directive in 2014 that IHiS would not manage eight research servers, which then came under the care of Mr Tan.\n\nBefore 2008, he was managing a mixture of application, database and research servers under the NCCS. But after IHiS was set up in 2008, it took over the management of everything except research servers.\n\nThe inquiry continues.\n\nSee more on\n\nCyber security\n\nSingapore health\n\nSingHealth COI", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/aksgh2709.jpg?VersionId=Phpi94lYQ2bquj65HkP1brmkUP2eRH6v", "alt_text": null}]}

But in Australia's east, where the bulk of the country's wool is produced, a drought is cutting supplies even as demand increases.\n\nFollow topic:\n\nAustralia\n\nPublished\u00a0Sep 27, 2018, 01:09 PM\n\nYENNORA, AUSTRALIA (REUTERS) - Auctioneer Ian Sharp has been selling Australian agricultural products to the highest bidder since 1968, and he has never seen demand like this before.\n\nEarlier this year, the benchmark price for fine Australian merino wool gained a foothold above the once mythic A$20-per-kilogramme (S$19.80) price, as one of Australia's worst-ever droughts leaves farmers struggling to keep flocks fed.\n\nThe surge, up 20 per cent in a year, has confounded buyers who have waited in vain for prices to fall, as they have done previously.\n\n\"This is very exciting for an old auctioneer like me in the fact that we are selling at these prices and we are clearing a lot of wool,\" Mr Sharp told Reuters, shortly before an auction at one of the country's biggest wool-selling sites, in Sydney's western suburb of Yennora.\n\n\"There's very little wool on hold anywhere on farms or woolbrokers' stores.\"\n\nAustralia controls 90 per cent of global fine-wool exports, where demand is being driven by Chinese wool mills and Italian garment makers, according to wool brokers at the Yennora auction.\n\nWhile wool has long been used by suit-makers, the surge in popularity is being driven by fitness and leisure clothing manufacturers looking for soft, durable and natural fibres.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The threat of a fairly dramatic reduction in supply next year is really underpinning this market and I think the Chinese in particular now appreciate that.\"\n\nMany Australian farmers, meanwhile, are selling their older sheep to reduce their exposure to rocketing feed costs as the drought lingers, and to take advantage of high mutton prices.\n\nLamb and sheep sales are running at around 15 per cent more than this time last year at the large sale yards in the New South Wales regional city of Wagga Wagga, according to livestock agent Isaac Hill.\n\nAustralia's chief commodity forecaster ABARES anticipates wool production will drop 4 per cent this financial year to 404,000 tonnes, the first annual decline in four years.\n\nSheep numbers are also expected to fall this year, down 3 per cent to 69.1 million, according to ABARES.\n\nThe supply imbalance is hard to correct. While New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina also export merino wool, it takes years to build flocks, making it difficult for other countries to quickly respond to demand.\n\nThe question of what happens next in the wool market is complicated by its opaque nature, according to analysts.\n\nUnlike more transparent markets such as cotton, analysts have a much harder time looking through the wool supply chain to measure global stock levels and anticipated demand.\n\nAustralia's weather will also play a part.\n\nWool traders at the Yennora auction told Reuters more dust was turning up in the wool as a result of the drought, although the overall quality was still sound.\n\nIf rural conditions deteriorate, dirt and other impurities will start to reduce the quality of the fleeces. Under-fed sheep could also be a problem, given they produce weaker fibres.\n\nMr David Hart, wool manager at broker Landmark, said high prices were posing some problems for supply chains that ultimately produce a woollen garment.\n\n\"There is difficulty passing on these prices down the pipeline - so far the shortage of supply has ensured the wool has kept flowing because there is demand for the final product and so that pulls the wool through system.\"\n\nManufacturers may start decreasing the wool content, substituting in lower-cost fibres such as cotton and polyester, when they renegotiate new season production contracts, according to a September note by forecaster ABARES.\n\nAny substitution is expected to occur with lower-margin, mass-produced garments, as opposed to tailored suits, for example.\n\nJapanese casual wear retailer Uniqlo, which sells merino jumpers, said in a statement it minimised the risk of market fluctuations by establishing stable supply sources.\n\n\"Additionally, we reduce our exposure to fluctuations by purchasing at favourable times,\" said Uniqlo, which is owned by Fast Retailing.\n\nOn the Yennora sale-room floor, buyers are showing no sign of holding back.\n\n\"You'll see strong bidding today from a number of countries, people representing all parts of the world, trying to secure wool that's difficult to come by at the moment,\" said Mr Andrew Blanch, managing director of Italian textile maker-owned New England Wool.\n\nMr Sharp, the chief auctioneer at Macdonald & Co Woolbrokers, uses an abbreviated swing of his gavel to swiftly work through the day's offerings.\n\nIn short order, he has sold 75 lots of wool, representing 316 bales of high quality fleece.\n\n\"The culmination of my job is that moment when I stand in the auctioneer's blocks and I knock the hammer down,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether it's good or bad, you need to do your best to get as much money out of the room you can.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nAustralia\n\nDroughts\n\nAuctions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/akwoolauction2709.jpg?VersionId=LsUEqPEKaC2wH8HWhhCdWouX6noHWl13", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

That sum, to be paid in cash, is $60 million higher than the book value of the six-storey property at 9, Tai Seng Drive, based on an independent property valuation report commissioned by the manager.\n\nAusGroup Limited: AusGroup has called an Oct 19 meeting for holders of its $110 million medium term notes, which were originally due 2016. Noteholders have been asked to consider and potentially pass an extraordinary resolution to further extend the maturity date of the notes from Oct 20.\n\nNam Cheong: Offshore support firm Nam Cheong has raised $22 million from its proposed one-for-one renounceable rights issue, it said on Wednesday, with the total valid acceptances for the rights issue at 75.04 per cent. The firm had expected to raise up to $29 million, with the one-for-one renounceable rights issue at a price of $0.014 for each new share. The issue price represented a 30 per cent discount to the counter's last traded share price of $0.02 per share for trades done on July 20, 2017.\n\nCreative Technology: Punters who have been trying to gauge the sales uptake for Creative Technology's newly-launched Super X-Fi amp headphone amplifier will probably have to keep guessing. The company has remained secretive about orders so far, saying only that it sold 600 units in the first 20 minutes that its sxfi.com online store went live at 6.34pm on Monday. CEO Sim Wong Hoo noted that an element of \"pent-up demand\" was behind the initial launch numbers for the Super X-Fi amp.\n\nBRC Asia: BRC Asia, which sells reinforcing steel used in construction projects, on Wednesday announced a new management team following its recent purchase of Lee Metal. Former executive director Seah Kiin Peng was appointed chief executive officer. Mr Seah joined the group in 2010, and was last the general manager of the group.\n\nSingapore Press Holdings and Keppel Corp have requested a trading halt in their shares on Thursday, pending release of an announcement.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore stocks\n\nSGX", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/ak_sgx2709.jpg?VersionId=OsIqKW7uu439Y_M.IMvEqLVzYnyzi4Ng", "alt_text": null}]}

The hostel said they could not stay overnight in the lobby and called the police when they refused to leave.\n\nVideo of police forcibly removing the family, who were protesting their treatment, was posted online. At one point the son, surnamed Zeng, shouted: \"This is killing!\"\n\nThe incident has been given extensive coverage by Chinese media outlets. The ire from the Chinese side increased after the skit was aired last week by the Swedish national broadcaster SVT.\n\nThe satirical skit was billed as a guide for Chinese tourists to avoid causing problems while abroad. It said that pet dogs should not be seen as potential meals and warned against defecating outside historical monuments. The show uploaded a portion of the skit on Youku, a Chinese online video service.\n\nMr Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, called the programme \"a gross insult to and vicious attack on China and the Chinese people\" in a statement on Monday (Sept 24). He said the host's comments were \"full of prejudices, biases and provocations against China and some other ethnic groups\".\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

He said that the intention of the skit was to mock racism and highlight how \"sinophobia\" was not considered as much of a concern as other forms of discrimination in Sweden.\n\nSVT's programme director Jan Helin said the network would not apologise for the satire, the network's news division reported.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Stockholm on Tuesday called for the programme to engage in \"profound reflection and immediately issue a sincere apology\".\n\nThe Swedish Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday: \"We have no comment. Freedom of expression applies.\"\n\nBut on Wednesday evening, Mr Hall apologised on his blog \"to those individuals who were offended by our programme\".\n\nHe wrote: \"Our intention with last week's much-discussed programme was anti-racist. It was poking at a blind spot in Sweden where racist expressions about Chinese are often for some reason allowed to go unnoticed.\"\n\nThe show, he added, had been insensitive to how the skit could be perceived.\n\nThe tension over the tourist incident and the skit follows a visit to Sweden this month by the Dalai Lama, over the objections of China.\n\nIt also came amid long-running concerns about the fate of a\n\nChinese-born Swedish publisher who was imprisoned in China\n\n. The publisher, Gui Minhai, had published books from Hong Kong filled with speculative gossip about the Chinese leadership.\n\nHe was secretly taken from Thailand to China in 2015 and was later shown on Chinese television admitting to violating publishing rules. Such televised confessions by subjects who have been incommunicado with no legal protections are often used by Chinese authorities to respond to outside criticism over politically sensitive cases.\n\nChinese authorities said he had been released last year, but his whereabouts were unclear.\n\nThen in January he was\n\nsnatched from a Chinese train\n\nwhile travelling with Swedish diplomats. Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom called it a \"brutal intervention\" that contravened \"basic international rules on consular support\".\n\nThe diplomatic strains over the tourist incident have reverberated on Chinese social media. While some people said the family travelling in Sweden acted inappropriately, the strongest sentiment seemed to be anger at the programme's depiction of Chinese tourists.\n\nIt is unclear whether calls to punish Sweden economically will have any lasting effect. Chinese nationals are a small but rapidly growing part of tourism to Sweden.\n\nIkea, the Swedish furniture giant, has eight outlets in mainland China, and they are often packed with shoppers.\n\nPrevious boycott efforts have had mixed results. While Norway's salmon exports to China plunged after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2010, bilateral trade hit a peak in 2015. The two countries normalised relations in 2016.\n\nThe controversial television skit is likely to fuel lingering resentment in China over the treatment of the family of tourists in Stockholm.\n\nThe video of the tourists being removed from the hotel did not show the police using violence against the family. Some aspects of Chinese state media reports on the incident were contested by Swedish journalists. The family was not taken to a cemetery, as the Communist Party-owned Global Times reported, but to a metro station called Woodland Cemetery.\n\nChinese diplomats, nevertheless, complained about the family's treatment. The Chinese Embassy in Sweden said they had been \"brutally abused by the Swedish police\".\n\nThe Swedish Prosecution Authority said the Public Prosecution Office determined that the police had not committed a criminal offence and would not open an investigation.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nSweden\n\nDiplomacy\n\nTourism", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/bp_stockholm_270918_65.jpg?VersionId=NgaMZjJoP0usWpamoDw5uxXqaD.hIgCR", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

with some areas more affected, the reef is also grappling with the impacts of farming run-off, development and severe tropical cyclones.\n\nEven within government there are conflicting interests at play, as well as rolling debates about how best to respond.\n\nCanberra has - so far successfully - urged Unesco to hold off listing the reef as an endangered World Heritage site, fearing it would have an adverse economic impact and lead to tougher restrictions on local industry.\n\nIt has allocated some US$1.4 billion to protect the site, but at the same time backed a huge coal project nearby by Indian mining giant Adani and moved away from legislating climate targets under the Paris Accord.\n\nA parliamentary inquiry was recently set up to investigate why former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull gave nearly half a billion dollars to a small business-backed reef charity without a competitive tender process.\n\nAustralians also appear divided on damage done to the reef.\n\nOnly half of the country thinks that climate change is already causing the destruction of reef, according to an annual Ipsos poll on environmental issues.\n\nWhichever way the political winds blow, scientists like Dr Hughes are determined to document changes to one of the world's most biodiverse regions.\n\nBut that remains a moving target. \"It's a critical recovery period,\" Dr Hughes said.\n\n\"The unknown, of course, is whether we'll get another bleaching event, which potentially could come as soon as early next year if we get a heatwave.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nAustralia\n\nMarine life", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/akgbreef2709.jpg?VersionId=iFrshYhjiqXZclgAovlaHoBMH_CC2wPM", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

If it wasn't drinking, it was gambling,\" she said.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh has denied accusations that he sexually assaulted or abused women in some of those parties.\n\n'100 KEGS OR BUST'\n\nBut student yearbooks from Prep and other schools, including Holton-Arms academy, where one of his accusers went, testify to the rowdy party culture they lived at the time.\n\nThe teens of the time clearly had money to burn and their own cars to get to weekly parties students held in massive suburban Washington homes, usually when parents were out of town.\n\nThe Holton-Arms yearbooks note that invitations to Georgetown Prep parties were highly coveted, where the things of importance were \"boys and beers\" and the main activity all-night drinking games.\n\n\"Striving to extend our educational experience beyond the confines of the classroom, we played such intellectually stimulating games as Quarters, Mexican Dice, and everyone's favourite, Pass-Out, which usually resulted from the aforementioned two,\" one student Holton-Arms student wrote.\n\nIn his yearbook, Judge Kavanaugh described himself as \"treasurer\" of the \"Keg City Club\", adding \"100 kegs or bust\" - a reference to a pledge by a group of classmates to drink 100 kegs of beer before they graduate.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh's close friend Mark Judge later wrote a book about the roots of his alcoholism at Georgetown Prep - Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk.\n\nAfter the first beer, he recalled of an early party, \"I found it impossible to stop until I was completely annihilated.\"\n\nHe also referred to his pseudonymous friend \"Bart O'Kavanaugh\" vomiting and passing out in a car after one late-night party.\n\nTOP NOTCH EDUCATION\n\nUntil his nomination, Judge Kavanaugh's life at Georgetown Prep was something he would joke about.\n\n\"What happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep,\" Judge Kavanaugh said in a 2015 speech.\n\nBut the stories have hit a raw nerve at the 229-year-old school. While it advertises its dedication to a well-rounded education underpinned by morality and humility, its verdant 38-hectare campus in the expensive Bethesda, Maryland, suburb speaks mainly of wealth and comfort.\n\nStudents have their own golf course, multiple ball-sports fields, indoor and outdoor tennis courts and an Olympic-sized pool.\n\nA Washington woman who sent her son to the school acknowledged the reputation, but said Prep does deliver a top-notch education.\n\n\"It is expensive. But it was worth the opportunity to get that experience,\" she said.\n\nPrep does send marginally more graduates to top universities like Harvard and Stanford compared to public schools. Alumni include congressmen and senators, members of the Kennedy family, a governor of the Federal Reserve, a former Nato supreme commander, and the last judge to be named to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch.\n\nBut the partying may have toned down since the 1980s. For one, the drinking age has risen from 18 years old to 21, setting a higher hurdle for teens in search of alcohol.\n\nSecondly, unlike in the 1980s, parents can now be held legally accountable if an underage drinker in their charge or in their home is injured or injures someone else.\n\n\"Yes, there are parties. There is drinking, and some drugs,\" said a 2008 Prep graduate now in advertising technology.\n\n\"But not everyone participates in these activities, and there is not an undue pressure to participate in anything illegal or rowdy.\"\n\nAnd parents and students in the region say there's no real difference today between public and private schools, partying-wise.\n\n\"The only difference might be that Prep indiscretions took place in pool houses rather than basements,\" said the former student.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nEducation and schools\n\nSex offences", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/bp_kavanaugh_270918_50.jpg?VersionId=zgfeBNcNSNG1sWkG.r9ygXYiFczt8sjy", "alt_text": null}]}

Since 2006, he has served on the influential US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nHe previously worked as a White House lawyer and adviser under former president George W. Bush and in the 1990s worked for Mr Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated then president Bill Clinton and helped draft the report calling for his impeachment.\n\nAs an ideological conservative, he would be expected to push the court to the right on a number of issues.\n\nWHAT ARE THE ACCUSATIONS?\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

When she tried to scream, he allegedly covered her mouth with his hand. Judge Kavanaugh has denied the accusation.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nMs Deborah Ramirez\n\n, a former classmate of Judge Kavanaugh in Yale, told the New Yorker that Judge Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her at a college party.\n\nMs Ramirez said Judge Kavanaugh had thrust his penis in her face and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away.\n\nOn Wednesday, a third woman, Ms Julie Swetnick, came forward to state she had witnessed sexually abusive behaviour by Judge Kavanaugh and also claimed that she was gang-raped at a party he attended in the early 1980s.\n\nShe has alleged that she saw Judge Kavanaugh behave as a \"mean drunk\" at the parties and witnessed the \"fondling and grabbing of girls without their consent\".\n\nShe said she was drugged and gang-raped at a party in approximately 1982 at which Judge Kavanaugh was present. She did not claim that Judge Kavanaugh took part or was aware of her rape, but said that he and other boys in his circle engaged in similar behaviour.\n\nReports have also emerged of at least one additional allegation of misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh, with an anonymous letter accusing him of physically assaulting a woman he socialised with in the Washington area in 1998 while he was inebriated.\n\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT?\n\nSupreme Court judges are appointed for life. Given that Judge Kavanaugh is relatively young at just 53, he could serve for decades.\n\nThe nine-member Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter on contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government. Some of its landmark judgements have been centred on issues such as abortion, the death penalty, voter rights and immigration policy.\n\nThe court currently has a 5-4 conservative majority and if Judge Kavanaugh is appointed, it would take the court further to the right.\n\nWHAT HAS MR TRUMP SAID?\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Trump said he was\n\nopen to pulling his nomination for Judge Kavanaugh\n\nif he found the evidence against him convincing.\n\n\"I can always be convinced,\" Mr Trump said at a press conference on the eve of a Senate hearing of the claims made by Dr Blasey Ford. \"If I thought he was guilty of something like this, yes, sure. I want to watch. I want to see.\"\n\nBut he also described Judge Kavanaugh as a \"great gentleman\" and said he was sceptical of the claims against him, based on his personal experience of being the target of \"false statements\" made by various women in the past.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUS politics\n\nSex offences", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/ak_kavanaugh2709.jpg?VersionId=4wYHekhIWYG_0RnfsWRmq53_Mc5gPPlF", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

It also reminded the fair operator that all food stalls must be licensed.\n\nAfter conducting inspections from last Thursday to Sunday, the NEA said it took enforcement action against the fair operator for permitting unlicensed food stalls to operate.\n\nTwenty-four enforcement actions were also taken against food stall operators for operating without a valid licence.\n\nAn NEA spokesman said that offenders are liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000 if convicted.\n\nCMYK's website lists the event organiser as Hundred Plus Organizer, a Singapore-incorporated company from Thailand.\n\nTNP understands that a local partner was hired to manage the event and had a hand in the submission of licence applications to NEA.\n\nThe various problems at the event resulted in several vendors venting their anger and frustrations at the organiser, TNP understands.\n\nWhen approached at the company's registered address yesterday, the organiser, who declined to be named, said it accepted full responsibility for the issues that arose but needed time to resolve them. It declined to comment further.\n\nTNP spoke to four vendors who did not get an NEA licence, and three said they had received full refunds, which included booth rental fees, additional fees for electrical points and the NEA fines.\n\nAll three said they lost thousands of dollars as a result of the licence mix-up, as they had paid for transport, manpower and raw ingredients only to find out they could not open for business.\n\nBut those who secured licences were happy with the turnout at the fair.\n\nThe owner of The Swag Social, who wanted to be known only as Ms Tay, 30, said there were some hiccups on the first couple of days, but sales over the weekend was brisk.\n\nShe added: \"Actually, it was quite a well-marketed event.

This itself, with alterations allegedly requested by Rosmah, costs US$2.248 million.\n\nThe necklace and earrings set were also fitted with yellow diamonds where the necklace consisted of a string of cushion cut diamonds weighing 112.94 carats and the earrings, also consisting of the cushion cut stones, weighed 17.84 carats. This set is worth US$3 million.\n\nMr Ashok also told The Star that the law firm was in the process of taking out its client's instructions on further action or legal proceedings against Ms Rosmah.\n\nHe also said that while the CCID had sent a response, it failed to address the concerns raised.\n\nOn its website, Adi Hasan AlFardan Jewellery said Adi AlFardan is a private jeweller who designs exquisite masterpieces and caters to the most exclusive, noble and royal clients in the Middle East.\n\nIt is the second firm known to be seeking the return of high-end jewellery from Ms Rosmah.\n\nOn June 26, Lebanese-based jeweller Global Royalty Trading SAL filed a suit against Ms Rosmah at the Kuala Lumpur High Court seeking a mandatory order for 44 pieces of jewellery amounting to US$14,787,770 to be returned.\n\nSee more on\n\nNajib Razak\n\nMalaysia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/bp_rosmah_270918_49.jpg?VersionId=hydfNdagK20tdZWhjzzJz5RwsWeDQ.Ni", "alt_text": null}]}

Three helicopters from the Japanese carrier hovered above, monitoring the drill.\n\nThe Argyll's arrival in the region comes after Britain's amphibious assault ship HMS Albion, last month challenged Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea on its way to Vietnam from Japan by sailing close to Chinese bases in the Paracel islands in a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP).\n\nChina dispatched a warship and helicopters to counter the British presence and warned London that similar actions in the future could endanger talks for a possible trade deal that Britain is seeking as it prepares to leave the European Union.\n\nGLOBAL HOTSPOT\n\nChina, which says its intentions are peaceful, claims most of the South China, through which some US$3 trillion (S$4.1 trillion) of seaborne trade passes every year. Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei also claim parts of the sea, which has oil and gas deposits as well as rich fishing grounds.\n\nJapan, which is embroiled in separate territorial dispute with China in the neighbouring East China Sea, has yet to conduct a FONOP in the south China Sea.\n\nHowever, in a rare public announcement this month, Japan's Ministry of Defence said one of its submarines had carried out a naval exercise in the disputed waterway with two Japanese destroyers and the Kaga, which is on a two-month deployment in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nAfter crossing the South China Sea, the Argyll will operate in waters around Japan, including a stint monitoring sanctions imposed on North Korea by the United Nations to force it to abandon nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, said a British government source, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorised to talk to the media.\n\nThe Argyll is the third Royal Navy ship in Asia's waters this year following the tour of the Albion and another frigate.\n\n\"Normally we hold discussion with other countries before joint drills, but with the British there is no need to, so they are easy to work with,\" said Tatsuhiko Mizuno, an operation planning officer for the Kaga group.\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nSouth China Sea\n\nAsia's territorial disputes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/bp_drills_270918_47.jpg?VersionId=J2nj.RdSdoQ28smsyfjbgFeeo1k9UvfG", "alt_text": null}]}

The duties, which have not been implemented, would stop short of impacting the US company's upgraded 737 Max series.\n\nAn order for Airbus would not by itself indicate that China was intent on excluding Boeing. The A320 deal has already twice failed to materialise during visits to Beijing by French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, and with the planemaker operating the assembly line for the model in Tianjin, east of Beijing, China already has sufficient incentive to buy more of the aircraft.\n\nThe Airbus visit also presents an opportunity for new sales chief Christian Scherer to meet with key Chinese figures after his appointment less than two weeks ago, the people said.\n\nAirbus already holds a strong sales position in China backed by its local production of the A320, said Mr John Strickland, a director of JLS Consulting in London.\n\n\"Securing a substantial large order in this fast growing domestic market would be a real plus for Airbus, and for the Chinese would send a clear signal to the US over the escalating trade war,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nTrade\n\nAviation/Aerospace sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/akairbus2709.jpg?VersionId=0Ui.GhAgRn205VCvpPa1zizZ4fKb73kQ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The current gradual tightening path is set to continue into 2019.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the most striking change was that the Fed no longer describes policy as 'accommodative', Mr Jerram added. \"But that just seems to tell us that interest rates are not too far from neutral, at which rates neither stimulate nor restrict the economy, he said.\n\nFed Chair Powell has emphasised that it does not suggest tightening is near an end.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Ascendas-Singbridge, which is jointly owned by state entities Temasek Holdings and JTC Corp, identified itself as the buyer on Thursday.\n\nThe purchase price, to be paid in cash, is $60 million higher than the book value of the six-storey property at 9, Tai Seng Drive as at June 30, based on an independent property valuation report commissioned by Sabana Reit's manager.\n\nAscendas-Singbridge said that the acquisition is part of its efforts to grow its data centre portfolio. It plans to carry out enhancement works on the property, to be done early 2020.\n\nKelvin Fong, managing director of the group's data centre business, said in a statement that the property is \"an attractive asset with a strategic location\", with the group \"looking at opportunities to ride on this trend\" of demand for data centres in Singapore.\n\nMeanwhile, proceeds from the sale will go to the repayment of Sabana Reit's outstanding borrowings, and could also be redeployed for projects such as redevelopments or acquisitions, said the manager in its announcement.\n\nThe deal is in line with a strategy to recycle Sabana Reit's capital and optimise portfolio returns for unit holders, the manager added, noting that the property's plot ratio of 2.5 has been fully utilised. Geo-Tele Centre has a gross floor area of 218,905 square feet, with 37 years left on the tenure of the land.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

And it's had absolutely no impact on our economy.\"\n\nChina has vowed to retaliate with duties on US$60 billion in US goods, but since the country only imports a total of US$130 billion, its ability to hit back with matching tariffs is limited.\n\nThe accusation of electoral interference first came during a meeting of the UN Security Council that Mr Trump chaired earlier in the day.\n\n\"Regrettably, we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election coming up in November against my administration,\" Mr Trump told the chamber.\n\n\"They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade,\" he added.\n\nMr Trump later said there was clear evidence to back up his claim.\n\n\"We have evidence. It will come out. Yeah, I can't tell you now, but it came - it didn't come out of nowhere, that I can tell you,\" he told a press conference.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters in Washington, a senior White House official said that China was deploying economic, military and informational tools to spread influence and to undermine the US government.\n\n\"The activities have reached an unacceptable level,\" the official said.\n\nThe official said the policy of \"actively interfering in our political system includes hurting farmers in districts and states that voted for the president\".\n\nThe official was referring to China's imposition of tariffs on soybeans - a hugely important trade in the electorally crucial state of Iowa - as retaliation for Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi rejected what he termed \"unwarranted accusations\".\n\n\"China has all along followed the principle of non-interference,\" Mr Wang said in the same session that was chaired by the US President.\n\n\"We did not and will not interfere in any country's domestic affairs. We refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China.\"\n\nBut Mr Trump followed up his accusations with a series of tweets accusing China's government of paying for newspaper space in the US state of Iowa to push its message.\n\nThese \"propaganda ads\" are being placed \"because we are beating them on Trade, opening markets\", he tweeted.\n\nThe US also irked China earlier this week by going ahead with plans to sell a batch of military parts to the self-governing island of Taiwan.\n\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting unification, and is deeply suspicious of the island's relations with the US.\n\nA special prosecutor, Mr Robert Mueller, is investigating allegations that members of Mr Trump's inner circle colluded with Russia to secure his victory in the 2016 presidential election after US security agencies determined that Moscow had sought to influence the outcome.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nXi Jinping", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/bp_xitrump_270918_32.jpg?VersionId=D0KTV72OtTj6qW_8AKOkUf9v4QA1Bjuk", "alt_text": null}]}

This is a disappointment.\n\nCurrently, the fees for a certificate issuer to certify that the donor knows the implications of making a Lasting Power of Attorney vary from below $100 to as high as a few hundred dollars.\n\nMSF should release a recommended fee guideline for such professionals.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It is envisaged that the media and property group will invest up to $51.3 million in cash to partially fund the offer.\n\nDepending on the level of acceptance, SPH's eventual shareholding in Konnectivity will range from a minimum of 20 per cent to a maximum of 43.84 per cent. Its effective interest in M1 will range from 13.45 per cent and 16.13 per cent.\n\nOCBC Investment Research analyst Joseph Ng said in an e-mail that the offer price for M1 presents value to shareholders, on the 24.8 per cent premium to the house's fair-value estimate of $1.65 a share for the telco.\n\n\"We believe that it would have been challenging for M1's share price to see a meaningful appreciation in the near term in the absence of the offer,\" he said, citing the challenging telco industry landscape and the impending market entry of Australia's TPG Telecom.\n\nOn the purchase rationale, SPH's chief executive officer, Mr Ng Yat Chung said: \"We are supporting KCL in this offer, as we see the potential for long-term value creation in M1 from the growth and business transformation initiatives to be undertaken post-close of the offer. The transaction is earnings accretive for SPH shareholders, and is part of SPH's ongoing strategy to enhance value for its shareholders.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

We look forward to working together to utilise our resources and expertise to best develop M1.\"\n\nApproval from the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) is a pre-condition to making the offer. Upon obtaining the IMDA's approval, the offer will be formally made and will become unconditional when Konnectivity and its concert parties obtain more than 50 per cent of the issued share capital of M1 by the close of the offer.\n\nMeanwhile, KCL, which owns 19.3 per cent of M1 through 80 per cent stake in Keppel Telecommunications and Transportation (Keppel T&T), said it would be making a general offer for Keppel T&T at $1.91 in cash, with plans to delist.\n\n\"The proposed scheme is consistent with Keppel Corporation's strategy to simplify the Keppel group's corporate structure, with a view to improving capital allocation and better aligning Keppel T&T's interests with the rest of the Keppel group's,\" it said in a release.\n\nAt $1.91 a share, the offer is 40 per cent over Keppel T&T's last traded price, and one-month volume weighted average price of $1.365. It is also at a 24 per cent premium over its net asset value per share of $1.54 as at June 30.\n\nKCL said that as Keppel T&T would remain a shareholder of M1, the scheme gives Keppel T&T's minority shareholders an opportunity to realise their investment in Keppel T&T for cash at a compelling premium.\n\nMr Loh Chin Hua, Keppel Corp's CEO, said: \"The scheme will similarly allow Keppel T&T's minority shareholders, who may be concerned about the prospects of M1 in the face of heightened competition, to make a clean cash exit from Keppel T&T at a substantial premium.\"\n\nMs Low Pei Han, investment analyst at OCBC Investment Research, called the privatisation \"not much of a surprise\" in the wake of both Keppel T&T's declining share price and the bright prospects of its data centre and logistics business.\n\n\"This is probably a 'low-hanging fruit' for the group, and brings to mind Keppel Land's privatisation in 2015 after Mr Loh was appointed CEO of Keppel Corp in 2014,\" she said.\n\nMr Loh added that KCL's offer for M1 is in line with KCL's mission as a solutions provider for sustainable urbanisation.\n\nHe said: \"Keppel Corporation has increasingly been transforming its traditional B-to-B business to include retail customers in gas, electricity and urban logistics. Incorporating M1's capabilities and two million customers in a combined digital platform would provide opportunities for synergies and cross selling of services.\"\n\nMr Loh also noted that KCL and SPH have been long-term shareholders of M1 since the 1990s.\n\n\"Notwithstanding the challenges currently facing the industry, we see considerable potential in M1 and have developed a transformation plan to sharpen M1's competitiveness. Through majority control, we would, together with SPH, be better able to support M1's management to drive changes and create greater value in the company.\"\n\nFitch Solutions analyst Kenny Liew said in an e-mail that M1 will become more competitive and benefit from a clearer strategy, with fewer shareholders, adding that the deal will offer Keppel synergies in its goal of becoming an integrated communications player.\n\n\"M1's access to last-mile infrastructure can be used to provide connectivity for properties and infrastructure under Keppel's management, while Keppel T&T's data centre services can support M1's weak presence in the enterprise segment,\" he said.\n\n\"In other business areas, for instance, Keppel can better integrate its electricity distribution business with M1's home services, and there are also media distribution opportunities that SPH can provide and better realise through M1.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Loh said the transformation of M1 was a complex undertaking that would take several years.

We think their negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nCanada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has spent much of the last month in Washington for talks with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and repeatedly commented on the progress being made and the goodwill in the negotiations.\n\nMr Trump once again complained about Canada's controlled dairy market, although his comments referred to tariffs that do not apply to US products.\n\n\"They have treated our farmers in Wisconsin and New York state and a lot of other states very badly,\" he said. \"How do you sell a dairy product at 300 per cent (tariff)?\"\n\nUS producers actually sell more dairy product to Canada than they import, and the 300 per cent tariff only applies to goods above the quota, which the US does not meet, according to trade experts.\n\nThe two sides also are at odds over the dispute resolution provisions in Nafta.\n\nThe White House reached a deal last month with Mexico and informed Congress of the intention to sign a new agreement by the end of November, before the new President takes office in Mexico.\n\nBut Mr Lighthizer on Tuesday said time was running out for Canada to be included, and Mexico's trade negotiator Kenneth Smith Ramos said the two countries are ready to proceed.\n\n\"Now, if Canada doesn't make a deal with us, we're going to make a much better deal. We're going to tax the cars that come in,\" he said. \"We will put billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury. And frankly, we'll be very happy.\"\n\n\"I don't like Nafta. I never liked it. It's been very bad for the United States. It's been great for Canada. It's been great for Mexico.

Success for SLT could bring the first approved medicine to treat the vascular causes of dementia, a form of age-related deterioration that resembles Alzheimer's disease.\n\nBut its backers' hopes extend beyond dementia: they seek to validate a new approach to pharmaceutical innovation combining the ancient wisdom of traditional medicines with the scientific rigour of modern drug development.\n\n\"If we're successful in treating vascular dementia, it will be a good example of how other traditional Chinese medicines could potentially be developed,\" said Beijing-based director of clinical research Zhang Huajian at China Shineway Pharmaceutical Group.\n\nDementia, afflicting about 50 million people worldwide, is a compelling target.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The five medications sold for Alzheimer's, the most common cause of dementia, provide only modest relief of symptoms. None can slow the disease's progression.\n\nThere are no specific drugs for vascular dementia, which SLT targets.\n\nChinese herbal ingredients are already used in some important medicines, including the main treatment for malaria, thanks to a tradition preserved in texts such as Huangdi Neijing, the most important book of ancient Chinese medicine.\n\nThe group that invented SLT is also working along a similar route to develop treatments for diabetes and related ailments.\n\nWhile modern pharmaceuticals tend to work on single targets, herbal extracts used in traditional Chinese medicine can interact with the body along multiple pathways, according to China Shineway Pharmaceutical Group's Zhang.\n\nFor SLT, researchers isolated the chemical components from each ingredient, identified and characterised their biological activity, and then studied multiple combinations to determine the optimal formulation.\n\nEach capsule contains 10 active components, according to the drug's inventor, Mr Liu Jianxun, director of the research centre at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences' Xiyuan Hospital in Beijing. Mr Liu and his colleagues documented how and where each component is taken up in the body, as well as the effects and mechanisms of action.\n\nIt is a level of analysis that has tended to elude traditional Chinese medicines, but which is needed for quality control and standardisation, said Mr Liu, who began working on the project in 1999, a decade before SLT was licensed to Shineway.\n\n\"Traditional Chinese medicine has advantages in treating geriatric and chronic diseases,\" Mr Liu said over the phone from Beijing, where he is also director of the standardised Chinese medicine pharmacology laboratory with China's Ministry of Science and Technology.\n\n\"We want to develop better medicines for dementia, regardless of the cause.\"\n\nEach of SLT's ingredients has been used individually in traditional medicine, said Mr Dennis Chang, a clinical pharmacologist at the University of Western Sydney's NICM Health Research Institute. Mr Chang is chief investigator of the final phase study in Australia.\n\nGinkgo biloba is taken to improve neurocognition and Panax ginseng is used as a \"wonder herb\" whose benefits include boosting memory and response. Saffron, a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus and used to flavour chicken soup in China, has a reputation for aiding blood circulation and offering antidepressant effects, he said.\n\nIn SLT, the combination is designed to work to improve blood circulation and perfusion in the brain, reduce inflammation and enhance communication between brain cells, according to Mr Chang.\n\nIn vascular dementia, brain cells are killed by small strokes and other injuries that impede oxygen supply, causing changes in memory, thinking and behaviour. While dead neurons cannot be recovered, the aim is to preserve and possibly increase brain function by improving the networks linking healthy cells, Mr Chang said. The same benefits may apply across other forms of dementia, since vascular changes are found in the brains of a large proportion of deceased sufferers on autopsy.\n\n\"We never say we will try to find a cure, but that there will be a significant slowdown of disease progression - that's the hope,\" he said.\n\nA 16-week pilot study of SLT in 17 vascular dementia patients used single-photon emission computerised tomography scans to look for changes in blood circulation in the brain and found improvements in areas that control cognition, language comprehension, and working memory, he said. That supported a mid-stage study in China, where SLT was found to improve cognition and daily functioning in patients with mild-to-moderate vascular dementia.\n\nThe randomised, controlled study in Australia will enrol 230 patients, each of whom will take two capsules containing either SLT or a placebo twice a day for a year.\n\nThe China one aims to recruit about 500 patients, according to Shineway's Zhang. Studies in both countries are expected to be completed in 2020 with a possible market launch in 2021, Shineway said in May. SLT would probably cost about 5,000 yuan (S$993) for one year of treatment, Zhang said.\n\n\"This is a hopeful study,\" said cognitive neurologist Amy Brodtmann, who heads the vascular neurodegeneration research laboratory at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne.\n\nShe plans to enrol patients in the SLT trial. One advantage, she said, is that the active ingredients are \"used and taken in everyday life all the time. The chances of an adverse outcome are incredibly low\".\n\nSee more on\n\nDementia\n\nScientific research\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/11/06/genericpaper_edit.jpg?VersionId=rCGYfQ86.NAE2in0KbLNjRnqaYyz5zm5", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Incorporating M1's capabilities and two million customers in a combined digital platform would provide opportunities for synergies and cross selling of services.\"\n\nMr Loh noted that Keppel and SPH have been long-term shareholders of M1 since the 1990s. \"Notwithstanding the challenges currently facing the industry, we see considerable potential in M1 and have developed a transformation plan to sharpen M1's competitiveness. Through majority control, we would, together with SPH, be better able to support M1's management to drive changes and create greater value in the company.\"\n\nHowever, he said the transformation of M1 was a complex undertaking that would take several years. Hence, the offer allows M1 shareholders who are not prepared to wait and bear the related risks to realise their investment in M1 upfront.\n\nThe scheme to privatise Keppel T&T will require, among others, the approval by more than 50 per cent of the number of independent Keppel T&T shareholders representing at least 75 per cent in value of the Keppel T&T shares held by Keppel T&T shareholders present and voting in person or by proxy at the scheme meeting.\n\nThe meeting is expected to be convened in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nThe scheme will also require the approval of the High Court of Singapore. Keppel Corp will be required to abstain from voting.\n\nAt $1.91 a share, the offer is 40 per cent over Keppel T&T's last traded price, and one-month volume weighted average price of $1.365. It is also at a 24 per cent premium over its net asset value per share of $1.54 as at June 30, 2018.\n\nSee more on\n\nKeppel Corp\n\nTakeover/Buyout", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/ak_keppellogo2710.jpg?VersionId=R3zyv3J5u.1EowUwJqldAvbTriqkOKy_", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The Sanur police later took him to the Penebel police station, and he was asked to perform a cleansing ritual at the temple.\n\nHe has since deleted his photo on Instagram and apologised to Balinese residents. He also posted a video compilation of him performing the cleansing ritual at the temple.\n\nMr Jarvi's case was not the only one that has offended Balinese Hindus. In April, a European tourist posted a photo on his Instagram account of him sitting on top of a shrine in the Besakih temple. In July, two foreign tourists posted a similar photo of a temple in Nusa Lembongan.\n\nThe head of the Bali chapter of the Indonesian Hindu Religious Council, I Gusti Ngurah Sudiana, told The Jakarta Post that he was very offended by the tourists' actions, because the temples were sacred places for Hindus.\n\n\"I'm very angry about what they did.

However, some temples still allow tourists to enter the sacred areas.\n\n\"Thus, we're in a dire need of a regulation that bans tourists from entering the sacred areas,\" he said, adding that a by-law would be drafted immediately.\n\nThe administration, he said, would also install signs informing tourists of the temples' rules and regulate visiting hours.\n\nMr Yuniartha suspected that most cases of disrespect by foreign tourists happened because they did not receive enough information about the temples' rules, as well as the lack of staff at the temples.\n\nBali Deputy Governor Tjokorda Oka \"Cok Ace\" Artha Ardhana Sukawati said at a hearing with the local council last week that tourism in Bali should be evaluated.\n\n\"Too many tourists are coming and most of them are not accompanied by tour guides,\" he said. \"There are also too many illegal tour guides operating in Bali, so we really need to evaluate it.\"\n\nOut of the 14 million tourists that visited Indonesia last year, 5.6 million visited Bali, while the administration is aiming for 6.5 million tourist arrivals.\n\nThe government also expressed hope that the island could attract more tourists in the years to come, as it targets 20 million tourist arrivals in 2019 to boost the country's revenue and strengthen its foreign exchange reserves.\n\nSee more on\n\nIndonesia\n\nTourist attractions\n\nTourism\n\nTemples", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/bp_tourist_270918_59.jpg?VersionId=_ANq7g03Lb_wC7a9mks1AH.KcliTdo0d", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

His performance art piece, titled 32 Years: The Interrogation of A Mirror, was meant as a tribute to the 32 years that Dr Chia had spent living in detention and under restriction.\n\nOn the first day of the trial, the court heard that Seelan, 33, was\n\naccused of taking part in the alleged procession without a permit between 2.23pm and 3.15pm on Oct 1 last year.\n\nAccording to court papers, the procession had aimed to ''demonstrate opposition'' in two areas: The actions of the Government in relation to Dr Chia's detention and its requirement of a licence for public entertainment in the form of performances outside the Speakers' Corner.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Dwayne Lum told District Judge Salina Ishak that Seelan arrived at the Speakers' Corner at around 2pm on Oct 1 to begin the event attended by about 30 people.\n\nHe later walked out of Hong Lim Park and made his way to the National Gallery, where he used a marker to draw on a mirror that he had been holding. He then walked to the Parliament House and stood in the middle of an entrance to a driveway, with the mirror in front of him.\n\nDPP Lum said: ''The accused was engaged by auxiliary police officers who were on duty at the Parliament House. The accused did not leave the location despite being told to do so and police assistance was called.''\n\nThe\n\npolice arrested Seelan at 3.15pm.\n\nAssistant Superintendent (ASP) Lionel Lee, who was part of the team that arrested Seelan, testified. He said that according to an auxiliary police officer, a crowd that had followed Seelan from Hong Lim Park stood behind him at the Parliament House.\n\nSeelan, who was not represented by a lawyer, cross-examined ASP Lee and asked if his performance was a threat to national security.\n\nThe officer replied it was not, but added: ''At the very least, it caused disturbance to the staff at the Parliament House, which was why police were called in.'' He also said the Parliament House is a restricted area and no permit will be issued for any assemblies or processions at restricted places.\n\nSeelan is expected to give his testimony today.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/st_20180927_sqseelan27_4306705.jpg?VersionId=LDWKro2OGX0776xI96bgJdzrySVCwSyv", "alt_text": null}]}

This is higher than the national average of 35 per cent.\n\nPersonal financing has been one of the major contributors to debt accumulation by civil servants, amounting to 34 per cent of their total debt compared to the national level of 15 per cent.\n\nHousing debts account for 49 per cent of civil servants' debts.\n\n\"Based on anecdotal evidence, personal financing is commonly used to sustain the standard of living and lifestyle choices of borrowers and for small business use,\" the central bank article said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

This is higher than levels observed in 2012 at 18 per cent of total household debt or 15 per cent of the GDP.\n\nThe study, which covered 1.26 million out of 1.6 million civil servants, comprising permanent federal government employees and police, showed that 97 per cent of them had some form of borrowings.\n\nCredit obtained from Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) amounted to 62 per cent, significantly higher than the national average of 18 per cent.\n\n\"By geographical location, close to half of those indebted live in four key urbanised states, where costs of living are relatively higher. About two-thirds of civil servants earn less than RM5,000 per month,\" it said.\n\nThe central bank also urged the government to accelerate its efforts to increase the supply of affordable homes and improve the rental market as a viable alternative to home ownership, as houses are \"seriously unaffordable\" in the current environment.\n\n\"Given that income is one of the main determinants of financial buffers and debt servicing capacity, relevant reforms to strengthen links between civil servants' pay and rewards to productivity would have an important impact on improving the financial resilience of civil servants.\n\n\"This would also improve the delivery of public services as well as enhance the efficiency of the broader economy,\" the report said.\n\nIt said policy priorities, including measures to improve financial literacy and strengthen NBFI lending practices and oversights, were vital to achieving a more sustainable level of civil servant debt accumulation and averting the build-up of risks in the future.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nDebt restructuring/Insolvency\n\nSalaries", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/akklpic2709.jpg?VersionId=PugnAjI0pCG3hGDIfqaR0OsuCyItUKcS", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

She later fled the country.\n\nStill, to win over the poor, the junta has adopted a similar set of policies, including significant cash handouts, loans and subsidies to farmers to help stabilise rice prices.\n\nIt has also been pro-investment, helping to strengthen the baht and lift the benchmark SET Index.\n\nThe junta's approach was more market-friendly and didn't lead to large stockpiles of rice, according to Major General Sansern Kaewkamnerd, a government spokesman.\n\n\"We have programmes to help farmers and help encourage them to diversify their crops and not put their whole lives into just one thing or oversupply the market during harvest seasons,'' he said.\n\n\"We just don't blindly pay them large sums of money without taking into account the market situation or what kinds of crop they're growing.\"\n\nWhile Gen Prayut can't run directly in the next election, the former army chief this week said he's still interested in taking part in politics, but needs more time to study which party he would join.\n\nUnder the new Constitution, which favours smaller parties, he can stay on as Prime Minister if enough elected politicians back him along with the military-appointed Senate.\n\nAt least two political parties have openly expressed support for the junta and have sought to recruit former lawmakers aligned with Thaksin: Phalang Pracharat led by the developer of a floating market and Action Coalition for Thailand Party, backed by Mr Suthep Thaugsuban, a former secretary-general of the Democrat Party.\n\nThey are seeking to win over voters in the north-east, along with the Democrat Party - which has consistently retained seats in Ubon Ratchathani.\n\n\"This is the one province where we have been able to retain some seats, even in years where we have suffered big defeats nationally,\" said Mr Abhisit Vejjajiva, the Democrat party leader who became prime minister from 2008 to 2011 after a court disbanded the ruling pro-Thaksin party. \"It will be a heavily contested area.\"\n\nAlso in the mix is the upstart Future Forward party led by former business executive Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, whose strong statements opposing military rule are starting to resonate in the North-east.\n\n\"Thanathorn is the new generation,\" said Mr Khamphong Thephakham, 57, who holds a senior administrative position in the Ubon Ratchathani provincial government. \"He's a fast thinker, he has experience in managing a large business, and he wants equality and justice in Thai society. He is the future of Thailand in the new era.\"\n\nMr Khamphong plans to vote for Future Forward this time even after supporting the Thaksin-backed Pheu Thai for many years.\n\nStill, he expects Pheu Thai to win the most seats in the election because Thaksin retains the loyalty of most voters in Isan.\n\nPheu Thai is confident of its grip on the North-east due to its track record of implementing policies that meet the needs of voters and pushing for democracy, according to Chaturon Chaisang, one of its most prominent members.\n\n\"We consider the North-east to be our stronghold,\" Mr Chaturon said.\n\nThat confidence comes from voters like Ms Thithinan Jariwatkongkit, who owns a guest house in Ubon Ratchathani that provides accommodation for as many as 50 students.\n\nRattling off a list of Thaksin-era programmes, she said the former leader narrowed the vast gap between Thailand's rich and poor. Under the military, she said, feelings of class separation have grown stronger.\n\n\"Thaksin instilled confidence in my heart,\" said Ms Thithinan, 56. \"Me and my friends are all loyal to Pheu Thai.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nThailand\n\nElections\n\nPolitics and government\n\nPrayut Chan-o-cha", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/akprayut2709.jpg?VersionId=fhMJBnqX3l8xt4FLMZGG6j8Yqb93UNAZ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

It was also the only one from Asia in the world's top 25 universities list.\n\nTsinghua University beat Beijing's Peking University to also become China's top university. Peking University was down four places to 31st.\n\nNanyang Technological University (NTU) moved from the 52nd position to 51st this year.\n\nTimes Higher Education magazine, which unveiled its latest rankings last night at the World Academic Summit in Singapore, said Tsinghua's rise is driven largely by improvements in its teaching environment, while Peking's decline is largely due to increasing competition and a drop in research income.\n\nMr Phil Baty, editorial director of the Times ranking, said that NUS remains \"one of the most innovative and dynamic universities in the world\".\n\nHe added: \"NUS has outstanding scores across all of Times Higher Education's core metrics, but it has one of the highest scores of all universities in the elite world top 30 for international outlook, demonstrating that NUS is a magnet for global talent, and a highly sought-after research partner for universities across the world.\"\n\nBut he noted that the new rankings show strong competition from China.\n\nSeven Chinese universities feature in the top 200 this year, with several moving up in the rankings.\n\nHe said China has positioned its universities at the heart of its national economic growth strategy.\n\nIn contrast, traditional power regions such as America, Europe and Australia are experiencing the effects of deepening cuts and creeping isolationism.\n\nNUS president Tan Eng Chye said he was pleased that NUS continues to be recognised among leading universities in the world and in Asia.\n\n\"The nature of work is changing rapidly, and universities will need to innovate and evolve to effectively respond to the Fourth Industrial Revolution,\" he said.\n\nAn NTU spokesman said the university was making steady progress. It has improved on the overall score from last year and ranks as the top university in Singapore for citations and industry income.\n\nThe Times ranking - now in its 15th year - lists more than 1,250 higher education institutions from 86 countries this year.\n\nIt uses 13 indicators - including research, knowledge transfer to industry and international outlook - to assess a university.\n\nOxford University claimed the first position for the third consecutive year, while Cambridge retained its second position, and Stanford in the United States held steady in third place.\n\nSee more on\n\nNUS\n\nNTU\n\nUniversities - Singapore", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/ST_20180927_SDRANKING_4306500.jpg?VersionId=bT.HNPfOTjo5Vg.5ol863aMO0SkGwNHK", "alt_text": "NUS, ranked 23rd in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, lost the title of Asia's top university to China's Tsinghua University, which came in 22nd."}]}

He spent 14 hours operating on that man, putting his skull back together ''as if it were a jigsaw (puzzle)''.\n\nDr Wu, 58, dished out the details from his memoir Life In Plastic to Straits Times head of training and talent development Lydia Lim at the seventh edition of The Straits Times Book Club yesterday.\n\nOver 300 people attended the session at the National Library headquarters' programme zone. Many were curious about his trade, like how to tell if somebody has had work done. ''The most obvious way is to press it,'' he quipped, for if one could tell, it would not be good surgery.\n\nHe expands in his book about his childhood, in which he accompanied his divorcee mother to London at the age of four so she could study law, and\n\nthe ups and downs of his career and personal life.\n\nQualified as a craniofacial plastic reconstructive surgeon, he spent 12 years at Singapore General Hospital, then went into private practice in 2000. He pioneered techniques such as The Woffles Lift, which incorporates the use of special threads to suspend sagging facial tissue.\n\nIt is a huge responsibility, he said, to take on the risks that come with each operation. A slip of the hand could mean irreparable damage. ''It is a very heavy burden to bear, but that's what we're trained for and part of the excitement and adrenaline of the profession.''\n\nTeacher Frances Chan, 54, found the talk ''very humorous''. Also, ''it gave a good insight about things we wouldn't normally know, like how plastic surgery is done.''\n\nThe book club runs every last Wednesday of the month. The next session on Oct 31 will feature clinical psychologist Carol Balhetchet, author of Dr Delinquent, and Institute of Mental Health senior consultant psychiatrist Chong Siow Ann, author of Fieldnotes Of A Psychiatrist.\n\nThey will discuss teenage behaviour, psychiatry and mental health with ST journalist Denise Chong.

Now, a research scientist who recently resigned from the company in protest is urging them on.\n\nIn a harshly worded letter sent this week, the former employee, Jack Poulson, criticised Google's handling of a project to build a version of its search engine that would be acceptable to the government of China.\n\nHe said the project was a \"catastrophic failure of the internal privacy review process\". He said lawmakers should increase transparency and oversight of the company and technology industry, saying there is a \"broad pattern of unaccountable decision making\".\n\nPoulson left the company after news articles revealed the existence of the project last month. It was first reported on by The Intercept news site.\n\nGoogle's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, testified Wednesday (Sept 26) before a congressional committee about the company's approach to data protection. Executives from Apple, AT&T, Amazon, Twitter and Charter Communications also appeared at the hearing.\n\nPoulson said the Chinese project, called Dragonfly, had several \"disturbing components\". A prototype, he said, would allow a partner company in China to view a person's search history based on his or her phone number. He said the project also censored an extensive list of subjects that included information about air quality and China's president, Xi Jinping.\n\nHe also pointed lawmakers to commitments Google made as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. Google, among other requirements, must submit to regular privacy audits and follow a comprehensive privacy programme under the settlement. The privacy programme includes reviews of all Google products for privacy issues before they are released.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

But after Dragonfly became public, several reviewers said they had signed off on sections of code for Dragonfly without fully understanding the project or its privacy implications, according to two people familiar with the process. The people would speak only on the condition of anonymity to protect their relationships at the company.\n\nThe reviewers, they said, felt that pertinent information about Dragonfly's code had been withheld from them and raised questions about the review process that went unanswered.\n\nIn his testimony Wednesday, Enright said Google was not close to releasing a search product in China.\n\n\"If we were, in fact, to finalise a plan to launch a search product in China, my team would be actively engaged,\" he said. \"Our privacy and security controls would be followed, and any such project or product would follow and be consistent with our values in privacy and data protection.\"\n\nGoogle on Monday released a framework for privacy legislation that describes to lawmakers how the company views its role in data protection.\n\n\"Innovative uses of data shouldn't be presumptively unlawful just because they are unprecedented, but organisations must account for and mitigate potential harms,\" the framework says. \"This includes taking particular care with sensitive information that can pose a significant risk. To enable organisations to develop effective mitigations, regulators should be clear about what constitutes a harm.\"\n\nIn a blog post, Enright said the company supported comprehensive regulation on privacy. Google has also recently increased its privacy efforts, forming a team dedicated to privacy and data protection.\n\nGoogle left China in 2010, denouncing government censorship. That year, the company also said it had discovered that Chinese hackers had attacked the company's corporate infrastructure.\n\n\"It should be pretty obvious that they should be asked what changed between 2010 and today,\" said Cynthia Wong, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nSee more on\n\nGoogle\n\nTechnology sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/ak_google2709.jpg?VersionId=OEZfiqrHv.cGqy.fLMTYGJTiRqVCicFT", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

He said he never said it,\" Mr Trump said. \"He said he has a lot of respect for me.\"\n\nQuite apart from the lurid claims of backroom plotting, Mr Rosenstein matters because he plays a key role in overseeing the Russia investigation.\n\nMr Trump is infuriated by what he says is Special Counsel Robert Mueller's \"witch hunt\" into whether Russia conspired with Mr Trump's campaign during his shock 2016 election win.\n\nThe President has frequently criticised Mr Rosenstein, who has been steadfast in trying to protect Mr Mueller as the probe digs ever deeper into Mr Trump's inner circle.\n\nSo Mr Rosenstein's departure - possibly putting someone more pliable in his place - would set off alarm bells over the future independence of a probe which has the potential to rock the entire Trump presidency.\n\nMr Trump has made no secret of his readiness to take on what he sees as a politicised, hostile Justice Department and FBI.\n\nJust last Friday, Mr Trump referred in a speech to supporters to a \"lingering stench\" at the Justice Department that he would soon eradicate.\n\nBut if events would seem to point to Mr Rosenstein being pushed out, both Democrats and Mr Trump's Republicans have urged caution.\n\nEven allies say that nothing should be done before the November mid-term congressional elections in six weeks, arguing that the ensuing row would fuel expected Democratic momentum for making gains in the legislature.\n\nIf the Democrats overturn the current Republican majorities in the Lower House and even Senate, then aggressive committee investigations and even calls for impeachment might follow.\n\nSome speculate the Rosenstein story was planted to undermine both the deputy attorney-general and Mr Mueller, giving Mr Trump a legitimate excuse to do what he'd wanted to do all along.\n\nBut amid ever deepening paranoia and partisan division in Washington, others ask if the story wasn't leaked to trap Mr Trump, trying to bait him into ousting the official - thereby plunging his administration into new controversy.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUS politics\n\nPolitics and government", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/bp_rod_rosenstein_270918_34.jpg?VersionId=W27c6M.IZFYLA30Rng_4VbD4X3k961dl", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The eateries join Indonesian restaurant Rumah Makan Minang, which was the first nasi padang eatery here to sign up for the programme in July.\n\nWhile wholegrain rice contains more nutrients and minerals than white rice, some restaurants said the take-up rate for wholegrain rice has been low though this is sold at the same price as white rice.\n\nHjh Maimunah has not seen many customers asking for brown rice since this was made available this month. On a weekday, an average of 30 of its 1,000 customers order brown rice at each of its two outlets, said the restaurant's general manager Mastura Didih.\n\nWhile brown rice costs more than white rice, it sells both types of rice at 80 cents per serving to encourage people to try the healthier option. \"We want to introduce brown rice to the community because people always think that brown rice is not nice,\" said Ms Mastura.\n\nOne look at the colour and they do not even want try it, she added.\n\nWhen the restaurant offered brown rice for free during a trial last month, only around 40 customers a day opted for it.\n\nTo cut wastage, the restaurant sometimes mixes brown rice with white rice to serve to customers at the end of the day, said Ms Mastura.\n\nBesides the brown rice option, the restaurant has also introduced five dishes that either do not use oil or use a healthier oil.\n\nAt Rumah Makan Minang in Kampong Glam, chef Mohamad Ariff Mohamad Zin, 29, said fewer than 20 customers a day choose red rice.\n\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Amrin Amin, who attended yesterday's media event, said changing people's mindsets about eating healthier food remains a work in progress.\n\nThe Healthier Dining Programme was started in 2014 and now has more than 1,140 food and beverage operators with 8,700 outlets. Of this, 680 outlets offer halal food.\n\nYesterday, five nasi padang eateries - Hjh Maimunah, Pu3, Sinar Pagi, Pariaman and Sabar Menanti - served a mix of 80 per cent white rice and 20 per cent brown rice to 1,200 lunch-time customers, to test if they could tell that brown rice had been added. Many customers did not notice the difference.\n\nA customer at Hjh Maimunah, Ms Hani Sar, 44, said that cost and taste are two key factors when it comes to choosing between the two types of rice. \"Brown rice is more expensive but I wouldn't mind paying more once in a while to eat healthier,\" said the administrative executive.\n\nSee more on\n\nHealth Promotion Board\n\nFood and beverage sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/ST_20180927_FCRICE27_4306526.jpg?VersionId=HSZWSk4VaOCYJFD_6tWoA5WvQa89Kqbu", "alt_text": "Restaurants Hjh Maimunah (above), Mamanda and Pu3, along with hawker stall Dapur Bonda Khadijah at Berseh Food Centre, have joined the programme in which HPB works with the food and beverage industry to offer more healthy lower-calorie meals and redu"}]}

For berthing training, for instance, the exercise had to be conducted out at sea for four hours and needed a crew of 23. At the new centre, berthing training can be done by four people in one hour.\n\nThe centre also allows for combined training between different teams on the LMV.\n\nSenior programme manager for the simulation centre Jason Khong, 36, who is from DSTA, said: ''Any scenario you can experience out at sea, it can be simulated at the centre. With artificial intelligence, the simulated enemy forces can also be configured to react differently.''\n\nMilitary Expert 1 Sachael Teo, 24, a marine systems operator on RSS Justice, said that as a junior operator, training at the centre allowed her to gain confidence in overcoming various malfunctions on the LMVs which may occur while out at sea.\n\n''The training at the centre has also allowed me and my shipmates to build our team synergy while responding to different kinds of scenarios,'' she added.\n\nNavy's latest warships ready for action\n\nTwo of the Republic of Singapore Navy's (RSN) latest locally built, high-tech warships turned operational yesterday. Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah officiated at the commissioning ceremony of the RSS Justice (above) and RSS Indomitable - the navy's fourth and fifth Littoral Mission Vessels (LMVs) to turn operational. In a speech at Tuas Naval Base, Ms Indranee said justice and indomitability are two attributes that drive the RSN in its mission to secure Singapore's sea lanes of communication. \"Both also guide the RSN as it strives to ensure that Singapore continues to enjoy fair economic relations with our international trading partners, and that the RSN will always rise to the occasion with an indomitable spirit, ready to respond to potential seaborne threats when called upon,\" she added. Yesterday, a training facility that reduces the time needed to train sailors to operate on board the LMVs was also opened at the base.\n\nSee more on\n\nSAF\n\nDefence and military", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/st_20180927_milmv273uo6_4306934.jpg?VersionId=H.6MFxLTNCjwouTgknbCtfExPqD4.gfd", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/st_20180927_milmv27_4306931.jpg?VersionId=prAkPiyxW8j2jVcW9vj5zwa2s1vCO0TS", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

He was paid a monthly salary of about $10,000 by 19-ANC and $5,000 by 19-NS2.\n\nIn his statement recorded by Mr Peh, Chia also said he was approached by Wong to find a job for his daughter-in-law Le Thi Hien. He did so, with a subcontractor of 19-ANC and 19-NS2. Ms Le's salary, however, was paid by Chia and his business associate Tay Eng Chuan, a director of 19-NS2.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Wong's lawyer Melanie Ho, of WongPartnership, told the State Court that Wong had forked out more than $10,000 from his own pocket to pay the bills when he went drinking with Chia. Ms Ho disclosed this while cross-examining CPIB's chief special investigator Tan Jun Kiat.\n\nShe said Wong had told the CPIB he had attempted to pay for the entertainment sessions with Chia and his associates, and did so on a few occasions.\n\nShe then asked Mr Tan why he did not verify this further when taking Wong's statement in 2016.\n\nMr Tan said he did not do it as Wong was unable to show proof that he had paid for the expenses, adding that he was unaware if this was later verified by other CPIB colleagues.

But it took another six days for them to confirm that personal data and prescription records were stolen.\n\nA reason for the time taken: An employee of Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS), the agency that runs the IT systems of all public healthcare institutions here, had mistakenly told his colleagues that no data was stolen.\n\nIt was not until his superior ran some tests at a July 10 meeting that IHiS found that hackers had stolen the data of 1.5 million people and prescription records of 160,000 people,\n\nincluding Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and several ministers\n\n.\n\nThese details emerged during the testimony of Mr Henry Arianto, IHiS deputy director of product management and delivery in the clinical care department, before a four-member Committee of Inquiry (COI) yesterday.\n\nMr Arianto said one of his employees told him on July 9 that the query made by the hackers to SingHealth's database on July 4 - which IHiS discovered and stopped - did not return any results. Mr Arianto shared this information at a July 9 meeting with several senior IHiS staff.\n\nDuring the hearing, he said he was shown at the meeting that some queries had been made since June 27 - the day the data started being stolen from the database.\n\nDuring another meeting on July 10, Mr Arianto decided to \"double-check\" by running one of these queries.

Singaporeans were told on July 20.\n\nBased on testimony from the witnesses before the COI since last Friday, IHiS cyber-security staff held two meetings on July 5 and July 9 after discovering the cyber attack on July 4.

This is for verification purposes and they can do it at the Traffic Police service counters at the driving centres.\n\nMotorcyclists applying for a Class 2B licence online will first have to complete the Expressway Familiarisation Ride training programme. The licence allows the use of a motorbike not exceeding 200cc.\n\nThe programme helps riders become familiar with expressway traffic conditions.\n\nTo apply online, motorists should go to the Singapore Police Force e-service portal at\n\nwww.police.gov.sg/e-services\n\nor the Police\n\n@\n\nSG mobile application using a SingPass account.\n\nDerek Wong\n\nSee more on\n\nTraffic/Road rules\n\nPolice", "images": []}

He also revealed that there was no process to appoint covering officers for when staff go on leave.\n\nHe was questioned by COI chairman and former chief district judge Richard Magnus on the fourth day of the public hearing into the incident, which compromised the\n\npersonal data of 1.5 million patients\n\nand outpatient prescription records of 160,000 people, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and several ministers.\n\nMr Wee said he relies on IHiS' security management department - led by Mr Ernest Tan Choon Kiat, senior manager (Infra Services-Security Management) - to initiate any alerts on cyberthreats. Mr Tan was examined by the COI on Tuesday over similar failings.\n\nThe intrusions into SingHealth's electronic medical records (EMR) system began undetected on June 27, before being discovered and terminated on July 4.\n\nMr Wee said he was \"copied\" in e-mails sent by a system engineer reporting a malware infection in workstations as early as June, but only \"glanced through\" them.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He added: \"I do not have my own system for keeping track of investigations being carried out... I would wait for them (Mr Tan's team) to inform me when necessary.\"\n\nBy July 4, Mr Wee had still not reported the incident to upper management even though he knew that there were attempts to access 100,000 EMR records, as he viewed it only as \"a potential breach\".\n\nMr Han Hann Kwang, assistant director (Infra Services-Security Management) at IHiS, clarified yesterday at the public hearing: \"(It) does not mean that data has to be exfiltrated before an incident is considered a security incident.

In June, China's foreign ministry said no military ship or aircraft could scare China away from its resolve to protect its territory after US B-52 bombers flew near disputed islands in the South China Sea.\n\nThe United States and China have frequently sparred about the militarization of the South China Sea, where China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines all have competing claims.\n\n\"If that was 20 years ago and (China) had not militarized those features there, it would have just been another bomber on its way to Diego Garcia or whatever,\" US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters.\n\nEastburn said separately the United States also flew B-52 bombers over the East China Sea on Tuesday as part of a\"regularly scheduled, combined operation.\"\n\nChina recently denied a request for a US warship to visit Hong Kong amid rising tension between Beijing and Washington.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

This will go way beyond publications and citations, which are the easiest to measure today and we may have relied on quite a lot.\"\n\nHe explained this was also the view of the International Academic Advisory Panel (IAAP), comprising university leaders and chief executives of global companies, that met in Singapore in June to discuss higher education. The panel agreed that current rankings rely too much on research indicators and overlook other areas such as experiential learning and entrepreneurship.\n\nHe said \"the IAAP was quite unanimous in expressing that today's methodology needs to be enhanced to take into account the varied and profound roles of universities today\".\n\nMr Ong also highlighted two aspects of university collaboration with the outside world.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

So, it is not just a flipped classroom, but also flipped campuses and flipped faculties. Not just asking students to contribute in class, but industries contributing to education.\"\n\nHe gave the example of the National Institute of Education, which not only trains teachers here, but also conducts research and spearheads innovation in schools.\n\nAnother aspect of collaboration is for universities to recognise the work of academia in industries and government, and encourage a flow of talent between the sectors.\n\nAn example of this was how Nanyang Technological University's Mely Caballero Anthony was recently promoted to a full professor for her work outside of the university, in chairing the United Nations Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters in 2016, and having served as the director of external relations at the Asean Secretariat.\n\nMr Ong also said there is a \"clear imperative\" for more collaboration in social sciences and the humanities, between researchers, the social sector, communities and governments.\n\n\"Globalisation has put much stress on societies. Far-right parties are gaining ground in many countries... Inequality and social stratification are an issue across all mature societies,\" he said. These issues need to be examined \"in a robust, evidence-based, scientifically rigorous, outcome-focused way\".\n\nHe said such work can help the world draw lessons from Singapore. \"We should allay the worries that a social scientist has no future doing local research. Singapore is a multicultural, urban and international city... Many countries are curious about our social and governance solutions and our experiments.\"\n\nTimes Higher Education is planning to pilot a new university ranking next April which takes into account factors such as the quality of jobs their graduates land, their contributions to economic growth and innovation, and the global partnerships they forge.\n\nCalled the University Impact Rankings, it aims to provide a broader assessment of a university's impact on society.\n\nMr Phil Baty, editorial director of global rankings at Times Higher Education, had said earlier this month: \"(New metrics on impact) is an area we have been exploring and consulting on for many years and takes us well beyond traditional rankings parameters of research and reputation.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUniversities - Singapore\n\nOng Ye Kung", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/ST_20180927_AMTIMES_4306501.jpg?VersionId=3yaI25CCxlx9Py6ZCMGpkkwLOzbEaJj9", "alt_text": "Global rankings need to go beyond just publications and citations, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, seen here with Professor Ho Teck Hua, who chaired a dialogue session at an education summit at NUS yesterday."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

US stocks initially extended gains but fell later in the trading session, with bank and financial stocks getting hit hard.\n\nThe Fed sees the economy growing at a faster-than-expected 3.1 per cent this year and continuing to expand moderately for at least three more years, amid sustained low unemployment and stable inflation near its 2 per cent target.\n\n\"The labour market has continued to strengthen... economic activity has been rising at a strong rate,\" it said in its statement.\n\nThe Fed inserted no substitute language for the dropped \"accommodative\" wording in its statement. That wording had become less and less accurate since the central bank began increasing rates in late 2015 from a near-zero level, and its removal means the Fed now considers rates near neutral.\n\nNEW PROJECTIONS\n\nWednesday's rate increase once again drew criticism from US President Donald Trump, who has complained that the Fed's actions are countering his efforts to boost the economy.\n\n\"We're doing great as a country. Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates because we are doing so well. I'm not happy about that,\" Mr Trump told a press conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\n\"I'd rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs. So I'm worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates.\"\n\nMr Powell, at his press conference, declined to say whether Fed policymakers had discussed Mr Trump's previous criticism of the central bank. Last month, Mr Trump expressed his displeasure about rising rates and said the Fed should do more to boost the economy.\n\nMr Powell, who was appointed by Mr Trump and took over as Fed chairman earlier this year, said the central bank would remain independent.\n\n\"We don't consider political factors or things like that,\" the Fed chief said.\n\nWednesday's rate hike was the third this year and its eighth since it began raising rates in 2015. Ahead of Wednesday's statement, traders put the chance of a rate increase at 95 per cent, according to CME Group.\n\nThe Fed's latest projections show the economy continuing at a steady pace through 2019, with gross domestic product growth seen at 2.5 per cent next year before slowing to 2.0 per cent in 2020 and to 1.8 per cent in 2021, as the impact of recent tax cuts and government spending fade.\n\nInflation was forecast to hover near 2 per cent over the next three years, while the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 3.5 per cent next year and remain there through 2020 before rising slightly in 2021.\n\nThe jobless rate is currently 3.9 per cent.\n\nWith risks described as roughly balanced, the statement left the Fed on a steady course for the next year.\n\nRisks to the current run of economic growth, such as the threat of a damaging round of global tariff increases, were largely set aside.\n\nThere were no dissents in the Fed's policy statement.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS Federal Reserve\n\nInterest rates", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/07049183.jpg?VersionId=4FIX.ENWiwhdch1RoGHSYSLHojoRO7ys", "alt_text": null}]}

He said any future summit could happen in October, but more likely after that.\n\nTrump, asked as he entered the United Nations what North Korea had to do before a second summit, said there had been \"a tremendous amount of progress\" since last year, and added: \"They're denuclearising North Korea.\"\n\nHis remarks on North Korea this year have been dramatically different from those in his speech last year at the UN assembly, when he threatened to \"totally destroy\" the country and mocked Kim as \"Rocket Man\" on a \"suicide mission\".\n\nIn his address to the General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place on North Korea until it denuclearises.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump told the UN Security Council that many positive things were happening behind the scenes on North Korea, \"away from the media.\"\n\n\"So I think you will have some very good news coming from North Korea in the coming months and years.\"\n\nTrump said Kim had reaffirmed his commitment to complete denuclearisation to him directly in a \"very strong letter form.\"\n\n\"I think we will make a deal,\" he said.\n\n\"But, unfortunately, to ensure this progress continues, we must enforce existing UN Security Council resolutions until denuclearisation occurs,\" Trump said, while complaining that some nations were violating UN sanctions.\n\n'EXTRAORDINARY LETTER'\n\nDuring a subsequent meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper that he said was an \"extraordinary letter\" from Kim and said North Korea had \"a great future.\"\n\n\"If you go back a year, if you go back certainly to the time I took office, it looked like we were going to war with North Korea. It doesn't look like that any more. It looks like just the opposite. So we're very happy about that,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked by CBS if Kim had agreed to allow international inspectors into nuclear sites, Pompeo said, \"Yes,\" while adding that verification was important in any nuclear agreement.\n\n\"We've talked about this verification from the beginning,\"he said. \"We're not going to buy a pig in a poke. We're going to get this right. We're going to deliver on this commitment (to denuclearise) that Chairman Kim has made to the world.\"\n\nPompeo said after his last visit to Pyongyang in July that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making \"gangster-like demands.\"\n\nNorth Korea had made international inspection of its main nuclear site conditional on \"corresponding measures.\"\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has led efforts to encourage US-North Korean talks, said on Tuesday Kim told him last week the measures he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalisation of relations with Washington.\n\nMoon said declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War would encourage North Korea to move further with denuclearisation and a timetable for such steps would be a task for a second Trump-Kim summit.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nNorth Korea\n\nNuclear weapons", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/pompeoandkimaide27.jpg?VersionId=vZp5H9BKWrdc0bt5hSDsrcecbf4UmVPV", "alt_text": null}]}

A USTR spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment on the report.\n\n\"Actually I think we will probably come to a conclusion and I think it'll be something very exciting,\" Trump said.\n\n\"And Japan is very smart - great negotiators - and up until now they've done very well, and they'll continue to do very well.

In the past 10 years, only three people have received such sentences.\n\nA life sentence in Denmark averages around 16 years. Twenty-five inmates are currently serving life behind bars in the country.\n\nThe court, which was unanimous in its decision, said the life sentence, handed down in April, was justified because of the \"unusual brutality\" and the \"aggravating circumstances\", noting the crime was \"meticulously planned\".\n\n\"There is no punishment that is too harsh for this man,\" prosecutor Kristian Kirk told reporters after the ruling.\n\nOn Aug 10, 2017, Wall, an award-winning reporter, boarded the submarine with Madsen, an eccentric, self-taught engineer and a minor celebrity in Denmark, to interview him for an article she was writing.\n\nWall's boyfriend reported her missing when she failed to return home that night.\n\nHer dismembered body parts were later found on the seabed, weighted down in plastic bags.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he had any final remarks, Madsen reiterated what he told the lower court: \"Nothing. Except that I am terribly sorry for Kim's loved ones for what happened.\"\n\nHis lawyer has previously said the remark should not be interpreted as an admission of guilt.\n\n'DANGER TO OTHERS'\n\nMadsen changed his version of events several times since his arrest in August 2017, but ultimately testified that Wall died when the air pressure suddenly dropped and toxic fumes filled his vessel while he was up on deck.\n\nAn autopsy report concluded that she probably died as a result of suffocation or having her throat slit, but the decomposed state of her body meant examiners could not determine an exact cause of death.\n\nFourteen stab wounds and piercings were also found in and around her genital area.\n\nMadsen said he stabbed her because he wanted to prevent gases from building up inside her torso that would prevent it from sinking to the seabed.\n\nThe prosecution said Madsen killed Wall as part of a macabre sexual fantasy, showing the lower court videos found on his computer of women being tortured, beheaded, impaled, and hanged.\n\nAnd on the night before Wall boarded his vessel, Madsen googled \"beheaded girl agony\", which Madsen tried to claim was \"pure coincidence\".\n\nPsychiatric experts who evaluated Madsen - who described himself to friends as \"a psychopath, but a loving one\" - found him to be \"a pathological liar\" who poses \"a danger to others\" and who was likely to be a repeat offender.\n\nInmates with life sentences in Denmark can ask to be paroled after 12 years, but the justice system can decide to keep him or her behind bars as long as he or she is considered a danger to society.\n\nSee more on\n\nDenmark\n\nMurder/Manslaughter", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/07048571.jpg?VersionId=SW.ebz4z.TIE7VOPeciBdt8KsJHtqPRm", "alt_text": null}]}

The new global scale is meant to help it fend off fast-growing streaming rival Netflix.\n\nSky shareholders have until Oct 11 to tender their shares.\n\nBetween selling the Sky stake and a separate plan to unload Fox's regional sports networks, Disney is expected to cut about US$30 billion from its acquisition costs.\n\nComcast's Sky bid ended Murdoch's second effort to take full control of the satellite television company he started in 1989. The first was scuttled by a phone-hacking scandal at his British newspapers, and it took him half a decade to try again.\n\nWhen he did in December 2016, Fox was the only apparent suitor. But then Comcast entered the fray in February this year, sending shares of Sky soaring. Fox's Sky stake is now worth more than double what it was before Murdoch's latest takeover effort.\n\nSky got its start when Murdoch set up Sky Television, initially a four-channel offering that included sports and movies delivered via satellite. In a speech in Edinburgh that year, Murdoch took on the British television industry, describing the output of the incumbents as a \"parading of the prejudices and interests of the like-minded people\" who made up Britain's elite.\n\nIt was a risky venture that generated heavy losses in its first year and was forced to merge with rival British Satellite Broadcasting in 1990, taking the name BSkyB. It listed in 1994, with Murdoch's company - then News Corp - reducing its stake to 39 per cent.\n\nSee more on\n\nAcquisitions\n\nMedia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/us-allen-_-company-sun-valley-conference-234911.jpg?VersionId=n.RhPstGmgKBhbRHXlnA4eZ_TrNS3sU7", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Mrs Laura Bush made programmes promoting health in Africa a major part of her tenure, particularly in her husband's second term, when she made seven trips to countries there.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Mr Tillerson missed a day of planned meetings, citing ill health, and ultimately cut the trip short.\n\nAnd the most recent perceived insult came earlier this month when Spain's foreign minister said that Mr Trump had suggested to him building a wall across the Sahara as a way of dealing with Europe's migration crisis.\n\nThose comments were taken to mean that Africans should be contained, said Mr Judd Devermont, director of the Africa Programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. The Trump administration has yet to articulate a comprehensive policy towards Africa, he said, and in the absence of such substance, Mr Trump's disparaging offhand remarks and tweets have filled the void.\n\nPresident Trump, in formal remarks to the General Assembly on Tuesday, did not mention Africa, though on Wednesday morning, he addressed his wife's upcoming trip.\n\n\"We love Africa,\" he told reporters outside the UN headquarters, and called the continent \"beautiful - the most beautiful part of the world in many ways\".\n\nAgainst the backdrop of such accumulated slights, the trip could put Mrs Trump in an awkward spot.\n\n\"People will be looking to her to understand the Trump Africa policy, and the burden is on her to counter the narrative,\" Mr Devermont said. \"That's a difficult position to be in.\"\n\nMrs Trump, though, may be well positioned smooth things over, said Ms Anita McBride, who was Mrs Bush's chief of staff in the East Wing.\n\nAt the reception on Wednesday, the first lady said that at each stop on the African continent, she would focus on programmes overseen by the USAID. Hinting at her agenda during the trip, Mrs Trump mentioned the agency's work in Ghana to improve healthcare and nutrition.\n\nIn Malawi, she noted, USAID has promoted education as a means of combating poverty, and in Kenya, it has projects on early education, wildlife conservation and HIV prevention.\n\n\"Her presence could help soften hard feelings,\" Ms McBride said. \"Generally, first ladies can represent the American people in a gentler way than a president can, because of the tougher things presidents have to do.\"\n\nMs Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a former assistant secretary of state who is now a senior counsellor at Albright Stonebridge Group, says she thinks African people, particularly the leaders of the countries the first lady visits, are eager to hear from her.\n\n\"It will offer her an opportunity to establish her own interests and activities - and her own message that hopefully will play differently from the message that Africans have heard so far from the President,\" she said. \"I think she will be greeted with respect.\"\n\nThe trip could be a significant moment for Mrs Trump, who has taken a lower profile than many other first ladies, and whose Be Best initiative has been relatively modest.\n\nOn her visits to Africa, Mrs Obama highlighted her Let Girls Learn initiative at visits to schools and events with young women leaders. Mrs Bush focused on efforts to combat Aids, in line with her husband's brand of \"compassionate conservatism\" and the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief programme her husband helped establish in 2002.\n\nA first lady's presence abroad is never just about policy, though, Ms McBride notes.\n\n\"It's not like a secretary of state going in, where there are bilateral meetings and treaty signings and that sort of thing,\" she said. \"That's where a first-lady trip is so valuable. It's a sign of respect that invariably includes substantive work - shining light on programmes - but it also offers the chance to absorb the culture of the country and meet people outside of the official bubble, and that is an important diplomatic move.\"\n\nAlso arguing for her success? Mrs Trump is better liked than her polarising husband: The first lady had a 51 per cent approval rating versus President Trump's 40 per cent in a June CNN poll - and 26 per cent of those who did not approve of the President still had a favourable impression of her.\n\nMr Devermont agreed that a first lady bringing attention to programmes and initiatives that uplift Africans could help affirm the US commitment to the continent - but he said such soft diplomacy has its limits.\n\n\"There is an opportunity to change the narrative, but it's a particularly deep hole that's been dug, and that's why it's unfair to rest all of that job on her shoulders.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nDonald Trump\n\nMelania Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/firstlady-1f349ddc-c1ae-11e8-97a5-ab1e46bb3bc7.jpg?VersionId=qm_bzJc0cgd03rx1FpS2.36ThwZ1QbY2", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The practice of foreign governments buying space in US papers to promote trade is common and differs from a clandestine operation run by a national intelligence agency.\n\n\"China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news,\" Trump said in a Twitter post.\n\nThen a senior Trump administration official said China uses political, economic, commercial, military and information tools to influence US public opinion and promote the interests of the Chinese government and Communist Party.\n\nUS Vice-President Mike Pence plans to make a speech next week detailing the allegations, said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, adding that the US government was working to declassify further information on the matter.\n\nIRAN: US 'ABUSED' COUNCIL SESSION\n\nTrump also used the Security Council session to defend the\n\nUS withdrawal in May from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran\n\n,\n\nhint at progress in US efforts\n\nto curb North Korea's nuclear programme, and to\n\ncriticise Iran and Russia\n\nfor supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country's war, now in its eighth year.\n\n\"The Syrian regime's butchery is enabled by Russia and Iran,\" Trump said.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded in a Twitter post, saying the United States had \"abused\" the Council and is \"further isolated\". Trump's focus on China and his allegation of election meddling came as a surprise during a formal meeting around the Security Council's horseshoe table that was expected to concentrate on the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.\n\n\"They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade and we are winning on trade, we are winning at every level. We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election,\" said Trump, who is attending the UN's annual gathering of world leaders.\n\nTrump himself is not up for re-election until 2020 but November's voting will decide whether his Republican Party can keep control of the US House of Representatives and the Senate. Some opinion polls show that the Democratic Party could make a strong showing, notably in the House.\n\nIn the latest salvo in the trade dispute,\n\nUS tariffs on US$200 billion (S$270 billion) worth of Chinese goods\n\nand retaliatory taxes by Beijing on US$60 billion worth of US products kicked in on Monday, unnerving global financial markets.\n\nDuring his roughly 10-minute speech, Trump made no reference to US allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 US election that brought him to power. The allegations have dogged his presidency and have given rise to an investigation by US Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign, which Trump rejects.\n\nIn July at a\n\nsummit in Helsinki\n\n, Trump accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials his government ran an operation to hack Democratic Party computers and spread disinformation on social media. Trump frequently describes investigations into the interference as a political witch hunt.\n\nTrump also used the session to defend his May 8 decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal under which Teheran limited its nuclear programme in return for the easing of US, European and international economic sanctions.\n\nThe core US sanctions that seek to choke off Iran's oil exports, the life blood of its economy, will resume in early November and Trump promised that \"after that the United States will pursue additional sanctions, tougher than ever before, to counter the entire range of Iran's malign behaviour\".\n\nThe United States accuses Iran of supporting destabilising proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq.\n\nTrump asked the Security Council to work with the United States to \"ensure the Iranian regime changes its behaviour and never acquires a nuclear bomb\".\n\nChina's Wang encouraged Iran to keep its commitments under the nuclear deal and, in an apparent riposte to Trump, said \"at the same time, the legitimate right of all countries to normal economic relations and trade with Iran should be respected\".\n\nWhile Iran has made clear that it has little interest in talks with the United States following Washington's abrogation of the accord, North Korean leader\n\nKim Jong Un met with Trump in June\n\nabout his country's nuclear programme.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\n\nwill visit Pyongyang next month\n\nto discuss North Korean denuclearisation efforts ahead of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, the US State Department said on Wednesday.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUN\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/07048525.jpg?VersionId=9M6D_kvCSYIlsLaR0ZgOAjEBbAANznmQ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Among them, the feared disorder on Seoul\u2019s streets and establishing peace in domestic politics.\n\nFind out what\u2019s new on\n\nST website and app.\n\nKim Jong Un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, mentioned their desire to visit Seoul in conversations with Moon and the other visitors.\n\nPHOTO: AFP/PYEONGYANG PRESS CROPS\n\nKim Myong-sik\n\nFollow topic:\n\nThe Asian Voice\n\nPublished\n\nSep 26, 2018, 05:44 PM\n\nUpdated\n\nSep 26, 2018, 06:25 PM\n\nSEOUL (THE KOREA HERALD/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - People often say that President Moon Jae-in is a good man, but instantly add that he is \"not necessarily a strong or capable leader, though.\" The constantly smiling president demonstrated his affable character on his two-night, three-day visit to North Korea last week, during which he signed a broadly worded peace communique with North Korean chief Kim Jong Un and produced a fairly detailed agreement on reducing military tension in the Demilitarised Zone.\n\nDoubtless, Moon was immersed in the warmest amity the North Koreans have ever shown to a visiting South Korean head of state. He achieved the top item on his bucket list by climbing Paektusan, the revered birthplace of the Korean nation, after addressing a crowd of 150,000 Pyongyang citizens in a packed stadium in the capital city, and mingling with them with endless handshakes and deep bows.\n\nThe 65-year-old president spent 17 hours with his host, Kim, 35, out of the 56 hours he stayed in the North, and pulled off something truly unprecedented: Kim's surprise announcement that he would visit Seoul \"in the near future.\" Blue House officials interpreted this to mean before the end of the year.\n\nMoon must already have the Nobel Peace Prize in his sights for this year or next, possibly hoping to share it with Kim Jong Un in the fashion of Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho in 1973 and Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin in 1978. Or he may be hoping to follow in the footsteps of Kim Dae Jung, who attained the honour in 2000 a few months after he visited Pyongyang.\n\nKim Jong Un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, mentioned their desire to visit Seoul in conversations with Moon and the other visitors. When the South's first lady, Kim Jung Sook -- who is, like Ri, a trained vocalist -- suggested that the two sing a song together during a banquet, the hostess declined but said, \"I'll sing when I go to Seoul.\"\n\nMoon's aides reported that Kim Jong Un privately asked them how the \"Taegeukgi groups\" would react if he were to appear on the streets of Seoul, referring to radical conservative organisations here whose members wave the national flag at their rallies. It is not just the North Korean leader, but many South Koreans too, who would like to know the answer.\n\nNo one can confidently predict what will happen here when the young North Korean leader sets foot on Southern soil -- the same land that his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, invaded with superior forces 68 years ago. Many people believe Kim Jong Un was behind the 2010 sinking of the Cheonan warship and the 2011 bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island when he was preparing to take over power from his dying father, Kim Jong Il.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Somehow, Kim has shed the image of a devilish character who may have murdered his uncle and his half-brother and built a new one -- that of a man capable of dealing flexibly with opponents through candid conversations and goodwill gestures.\n\nIf North Korean leaders and President Moon's aides are concerned about the Taegeukgi-waving demonstrators in the South, there will also be a sizeable number of welcoming crowds here -- notably members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, who have long hoped to see warmer relations with the North. Kim Jong Un will either be embarrassed or encouraged to see the Korean National Police take pains to keep the factions on the left and right away from each other as he moves about in the Southern capital city.\n\nThe feared disorder on Seoul's streets is an important matter that authorities both in Seoul and Pyongyang need to consider when deciding the details of Kim's visit. Yet there is an even more important variable to consider -- one that will make or break the ultimate event in inter-Korean diplomacy. That is the progress of denuclearisation negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang.\n\nOptimists foresee a second summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un, the results of which may even go beyond the North's commitments in the latest inter-Korean summit talks -- that is, the dismantling of the old nuclear arms development facilities in Yongbyon and of the long-range missile testing site in Tongchang-ri. However, Kim will also be calculating the effects of a fast thaw with the South, including the effects of his Seoul visit, at the nuclear bargaining table with Washington.\n\nOne parallel line of diplomacy calls for the declaration of an end to the Korean War, involving the two Koreas and the United States. Kim's visit to Seoul will establish favourable conditions for the international manifesto, which will naturally lead to negotiations for a peace treaty between the three states.\n\nPresident Moon and his aides must now carefully review the meaning of Kim Jong Un's friendliness in Pyongyang last week. The North Korean leader plainly told Moon that his country needs help from the South as it shifts its national orientation from nuclear development to economic advancement. When we saw the president after his arrival back in Seoul, we saw that he was making an effort to trust his hosts in Pyongyang and believe what they wanted him to believe.\n\nMoon has a task that is of paramount importance with regard to our internal situation. Before he plays host to Kim Jong Un, the president needs to establish peace in domestic politics. An end to the political war should be declared before the president and Kim discuss an end to hostilities between the two Koreas. That declaration should be a real, sincere and faithful deed ending all measures that are part of political vendettas.\n\nKeeping two former presidents in jail and prosecuting three immediate former heads of the state intelligence apparatus for an assortment of offences other than treason suggests that we do not have a stable government that can confidently take on a most dangerous regime, one that happens to be the latest claimant of nuclear power.\n\nIf the nation is to steer through the current hardships facing the economy and the security environment, something like a grand amnesty for all political cases is recommended. Moon's legal officers, who have shown such fervour and perseverance in punishing the old powers, must conclude all the retaliatory cases expeditiously once the president decides to make a fresh start with internal peace and reconciliation. Here is the chance for President Moon to prove that he truly is a good, capable and strong statesman.\n\nKim Myong-sik is a former editorial writer for The Korea Herald.\n\nThe Korea Herald is a member of The Straits Times media partner Asia News Network, an alliance of 23 news media organisations.\n\nSee more on\n\nThe Asian Voice\n\nSouth Korea\n\nNorth Korea", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/yq-kimmoon-26092018.jpg?VersionId=QaD.HofV_hBtI1tz8Zme78NdfQF1LXhz", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious - that will block a vote on my nomination.\n\n\"These are last minute smears, pure and simple,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process,\" he said. \"This effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out.\"\n\nKavanaugh was handpicked by Donald Trump for the lifelong post on the Supreme Court, and has continued to enjoy the president's steadfast backing despite the allegations against him.\n\nAs Trump repeated his support for Kavanaugh on Wednesday, calling him \"outstanding\" and an \"absolute gem,\" four people released affidavits claiming that Blasey Ford had told them about the alleged sexual assault prior to his nomination for the Supreme Court.\n\nAvenatti, Swetnick's lawyer, is the attorney for Stormy Daniels, the porn star who claimed to have had a sexual encounter with Trump more than a decade ago.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nPolitics and government", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/hulse_column.jpg?VersionId=M9yjMc2tWNfhyn6KKe.oGv0JwlfTb4Ug", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/2018-09-25t163014z_148736924_rc1b72dc5ea0_rtrmadp_3_usa-court-kavanaugh.jpg?VersionId=lTQhssv_RdxfvqR.t6Q6Gqu3Xc4af9eG", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

We could just do more harm than good,\" said Cable.\n\nFEEDING AROUND BARGES\n\nThe beluga was first sighted on Tuesday near the southern, Kent side of the river, downstream of Gravesend.\n\nIt was feeding around moored barges and did not move more than 200m during the day.\n\nAn AFP photographer saw the whale surfacing in the same area on Wednesday.\n\nBelugas typically live for 40 to 60 years. Highly sociable, they typically form pods and are often seen in river estuaries in the summer.\n\nThe beluga's appearance brings back memories of the famous 2006 Thames whale.\n\nA female northern bottlenose whale was discovered swimming in the river in central London, going past the Houses of Parliament.\n\nOn its second day in the city, as it lost strength, rescuers intervened and lifted it onto a barge by crane. It died, after suffering from convulsions, near Gravesend as the barge rushed towards the open sea.\n\nSee more on\n\nBritain\n\nOceans", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/topshots-topshot-britain-animal-whale-oceans-141439.jpg?VersionId=nwiEYKrnK9C0ytVp7Ri7erede.0XspC1", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/2018-09-26t143611z_690219018_rc13a10ad0d0_rtrmadp_3_britain-whale.jpg?VersionId=nizmDTxREiKN4WBr9durU6KkOk0Ns3MM", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Such provocations, however, conform to the 2018 US National Security Strategy report that identified China as a strategic competitor that must be confronted.\n\nThat explains why the Trump administration has been recklessly trampling on the one-China principle, the political foundation of Sino-US relations. Since taking office, Trump has played the Taiwan card many a time, for example, by signing the Taiwan Travel Act and the National Defence Authorisation Act to encourage visits between high-level US and Taiwan officials and pave the way for regular ports of call by US warships in Taiwan.\n\nNearly four decades ago, Beijing and Washington normalised diplomatic relations on the basic premise that they both respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and that the United States \"does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan\" and will gradually \"reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution\", according to Sino-US Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of Aug 17, 1982.\n\nHistory is witness to how the US has repeatedly contravened its own promises, and has always been ready to trade principles for expediency. Now that the Trump administration is aggressively seeking to challenge China's interests on both the economic and military fronts, one wonders whether Washington wants to permanently damage Sino-US relations.\n\nAnd since the Trump administration is trying to jettison all principles that govern bilateral relations in a desperate bid to suit its own purpose, China should not only prepare for the worst but also be ready to appropriately respond to the US' provocations, because when it comes to national sovereignty and territorial integrity, there is absolutely no room for compromise.\n\nChina Daily is a member of The Straits Times media partner Asia News Network, an alliance of 23 news media organisations.\n\nSee more on\n\nEditorial Notes\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/yq-twdefenceed-26092018.jpg?VersionId=YbWTD.2FyNqlj156.EsND3H0JaatQpa7", "alt_text": null}]}

I cannot recall exactly what the returned result was, but I was shocked, as I had previously been informed... that the query returned no data results,\" Mr Arianto said.\n\nLater that day, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore was informed. The Ministry of Health and SingHealth were also told about the attack on that day too. Singaporeans were told about the attack on July 20.\n\nBased on testimony from the witnesses before the COI since last Friday, IHiS cyber security staff held two meetings on July 5 and July 9 after discovering the cyber attack on July 4.\n\nAfter confirming that data was stolen, IHiS set up a \"war room\" on July 10 itself to trawl the patient database and to investigate the matter.\n\nShedding more light on what went on in the war room, Mr Arianto said that on July 11, he tasked the same staff member who had misinformed him earlier to recreate the queries from June 27 to July 4.\n\nIt was on this day that IHiS discovered that PM Lee's data had been directly accessed using his NRIC, along with two other people. The COI earlier heard that the other two are not known to be VIPs.\n\nThe inquiry continues on Thursday (Sept 27).\n\nSee more on\n\nCyber security\n\nSingapore health\n\nLee Hsien Loong\n\nSingHealth\n\nSingHealth COI", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/27/hzsinghealth0925c.jpg?VersionId=vIvmd9POZtjMzesoSz1.JMODwB3ZpCs.", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The producer of Taiwan's multi-role Indigenous Defence Fighter jet faces a new sense of urgency as China ramps up \"encirclement patrols\" around the democratically run island, which it considers a province.\n\n\"We're aiming to be as self-sufficient as we can in our defence capability,\" Mr Liao said last month at his office in Taichung city, on the western coast opposite China, as air force jets flew noisily overhead practising for an airshow.\n\n\"Self-reliance shows we're determined to defend ourselves. It helps keep the region stable and it's in line with the interests of the US.\"\n\nChina cut off formal communication with Taiwan and stepped up military exercises in the area after the island elected President Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence party in 2016. While the US government has recently moved to bolster the island's defences amid its trade war with China, conflicting signals from Mr Trump have given Taiwan pause about being too dependent on foreign support.\n\nAfter initially angering Beijing by taking a congratulatory phone call from Ms Tsai after his election, Mr Trump later recanted, saying he would have to consult Chinese President Xi Jinping before a second exchange.\n\nJournalist Bob Woodward's newly released book, Fear: Trump In The White House, cites an exchange in January this year with national security advisers in which the President asked: \"What do we get out of protecting Taiwan?\"\n\nMs Tsai has increased Taiwanese military drills since taking office and in August she proposed raising the 2019 defence budget to NT$346 billion (S$15 billion), or about 2.16 per cent of gross domestic product.\n\nBesides the fighter jets, the government has contracted Taiwan's CSBC Corporation to deliver its first indigenous diesel-electric submarine by 2024, after more than a decade of fruitless talks with the United States.\n\nStill, the task Ms Tsai faces is daunting. China spends more than 20 times on defence than Taiwan and commands one of the world's largest navies. Ms Tsai has well fallen short of calls to expand the defence budget to 3 per cent of GDP, which would require a roughly 50 per cent increase in spending.\n\nTaiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told Bloomberg News last month that US support was \"very strong\". He dismissed concerns that Mr Trump might use ties with the island as leverage in the trade war, saying: \"I just don't worry that Taiwan is going to become a chip to be negotiated with by the US.\"\n\nMs Tsai's focus on building a stronger defence industry follows decades of frustration with the scale and drawn-out process of American arms sales, which the US has continued under the Taiwan Relations Act despite severing formal ties with Taipei in 1979.\n\nTaiwan's requests for a wide range of American hardware and electronics - from smart mines and armed drones to longer-range cruise missiles, and Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets - have not been met.\n\nBut there have been recent signs of progress. Mr Trump in July signed the 2019 National Defence Authorisation Act, which orders the Department of Defence to assess Taiwan's military forces and provide recommendations. The administration let US companies share some submarine technology with the island and approved legislation that would allow high-level visits by US officials.\n\nThe US State Department on Monday approved a US$330 million (S$451 million) sale of spare parts for several of Taiwan's military aircraft, drawing a rebuke from China. The package - Taiwan's smallest standalone purchase in 11 years - signalled a shift from complex multi-billion-dollar deals every few years to smaller, more regular sales.\n\n\"Unbundling arms sales to Taiwan may seem like a mere technical issue, but it is actually big deal,\" said research fellow Ian Easton at the Washington D.C.-based Project 2049 Institute.\n\n\"For the past 11 years, the timing of arms sales notifications has been held hostage by the US-PRC diplomatic calendar and fears of Beijing's potential reaction, resulting in freezes and delays of sales that lasted for years.\"\n\nAn annual Pentagon report released in July said that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had already \"eroded or negated many of\" the island's traditional advantages, including technological superiority and the challenges of projecting force across the 145km Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe PLA has demonstrated its growing reach by sending military planes and its first aircraft carrier on excursions around the island. Chinese fighter jets, bombers and surveillance planes flew around Taiwan's east coast more than 20 times last year, up from four trips in in 2016, according to defence ministry statements and local media reports.\n\n\"The eastern part of Taiwan could become a potential military target,\" said Mr Lin Cheng-yi, president of Taipei's Institute for National Defence and Security Research. \"Beijing is trying to send a political signal. It's psychological pressure.\"\n\nAlthough China has never disavowed the use of force against the island, the ruling Communist Party says it is committed to \"peaceful reunification\" and most defence analysts believe it would only take military action in response to some shift within Taiwan.\n\nThe Chinese government has offset its military signalling with economic incentives to underscore the benefits of closer ties.\n\nMs Tsai's response has been two-fold: Quietly build the capability to make any attack too costly for China without provoking direct action by Mr Xi. And take advantage of US gestures of support for the island - for as long as they last.\n\n\"Our self-defence doesn't depend on a US response,\" said former defence minister Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies in Taipei. \"We have to make sure we can hold on to our position and also deter or even defeat any use of force.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nTaiwan\n\nDefence and military\n\nChina\n\nUnited States", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/placeholdernewspapers.jpg?VersionId=PisFK7pGEuf0sXdZC2yonQE._g.ok.Bl", "alt_text": null}]}

It has to be approved in a key second and third reading before being signed into law by Putin.\n\nThe reform - that would see Russian men retire at 65 instead 60 - has sparked a rare outburst of public anger, with tens of thousands rallying across Russia in recent months.\n\nPutin's announcement of the concessions has done little to pacify ordinary Russians.\n\nMost are opposed to the hike in retirement age and critics said the reform would essentially rob ordinary people of their earnings.\n\nStreet protests have continued and the Kremlin faced a rare electoral crisis after candidates of the ruling party failed to win governorship polls in four regions this month.\n\nSome 3,000 people demonstrated in Moscow last week against the reform in a protest organised by the Communist Party.\n\nHeeding a call by protest leader Alexei Navalny, thousands of Russians took to the streets across the country to protest against the reform earlier this month.\n\nThe pension reform, which was announced the day the World Cup started in Russia in June, will be the first retirement age increase in the country in nearly 90 years.\n\nGiven the low life expectancy of Russian men - 65 years - many would not live long enough under the reform to receive a state pension.\n\nSee more on\n\nRussia\n\nParliament\n\nVladimir Putin", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/colin-su-26.jpg?VersionId=EqSnQS7GCHJjMxlsYBgmbkrsvupTIv7b", "alt_text": null}]}

These include providing quality education, achieving gender equality and encouraging innovation.\n\nMr Phil Baty, editorial director of global rankings at Times Higher Education, said in a statement earlier this month: \"Universities contribute a huge amount to society, and this data can help capture unique new insights on how they're addressing some of the most pressing global issues.\n\n\"(New metrics on impact) is an area we've been exploring and consulting on for many years and takes us well beyond traditional rankings parameters of research and reputation.\"\n\nThe latest Times Higher Education World University Rankings will be released on Wednesday night.\n\nMr Ong noted at Wednesday's summit that Singapore has built a good foundation in research and development, drawing from the European traditions in industry-based crafts and guilds and the American research universities.\n\n\"Yet all of us should constantly question how the current research model, and system of ranking and evaluation, need to evolve with the times,\" he said, adding that the definition of a university education and degree is going through a major rethink.\n\n\"There is a realisation that lifelong learning will change the rhythm and mix of education. There is less pressure for universities to front load knowledge during formal years of undergraduate studies, and more effort is required to make university education experiential.\"\n\nUniversities also need to join hands with the outside world by working with industry and recognising how academia can contribute to industry and the government, said Mr Ong.\n\nThe three-day summit, which ends on Thursday, is being hosted by the National University of Singapore.\n\nSee more on\n\nUniversities - Singapore\n\nOng Ye Kung", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/colin-was-26.jpg?VersionId=0gFEWm_bXVSmysbK3yR9jrualoAFoDXT", "alt_text": null}]}

I still thought it was this team event that really doesn't matter in the big scheme of things,\" the 29-year-old told a news conference at Le Golf National on Wednesday (Sept 26).\n\n\"I was more concerned about individual titles and all that. Once I got on to that first tee on Friday morning, I thought, 'oh, this is a little different than I expected'.\n\n\"It doesn't seem that it's been that long and now this is going to be my fifth Ryder Cup,\" added the Northern Irishman, who last week said that winning Majors had provided his proudest moments but Ryder Cups had been his best golfing experiences.\n\n\"But they have all been wonderful experiences for different reasons, and I'm sure this time will be no different.\n\n\"I've been excited for this for basically since the last day in Hazeltine, whenever we weren't the ones spraying champagne for a change,\" the world No. 6 said.\n\nThat contest two years ago featured one of the all-time great singles matches as McIlory took on this year's US Masters champion Patrick Reed in a high-octane, high-volume Sunday showdown.\n\nSent out first by their captains, the talismen traded shots and celebrations through a terrific match in front of baying galleries, before Reed eventually triumphed on the final hole.\n\nBoth have since spoken about how much they enjoyed that battle but McIlroy said on Wednesday that having looked back on how high he was on adrenalin, he had learned an important lesson.\n\n\"I could play it for nine holes, and then it suddenly hit me,\" he said. \"The level sort of declined after that and reached its crescendo on the eighth green, and the last 10 holes weren't quite as good. I hit a wall on that back nine and it cost me.\n\n\"I look back as those videos, it wasn't just Sunday. It was Friday and Saturday. I'm surprised I had a voice left at the end of the week. It looked tiring to have to play golf like that for three days.\n\n\"I learnt a lot from that and learnt that it's good to get excited and to have that, but at the same time, if I need to play a late match on Sunday or whatever it is, I want to have all my energy in reserve so I can give everything for 18 holes.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nGolf tournaments\n\nRory McIlroy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/colin-rc-26.jpg?VersionId=CGYrzwEoBo1Qqu0TLCLh5DimhZMMMWEK", "alt_text": null}]}

This means companies can make better products, have faster innovation cycles, and reduce production costs,\" he added.\n\nMr Heng called on top management to actively seek opportunities, overcome obstacles and bring their teams together and the workforce to similarly \"be ready to adapt to these changes, acquire new skills, and be redeployed to higher-value tasks\".\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

A yellow umbrella, symbolic of the protest, printed with the lyrics of John Lennon's \"Imagine\", is also on display at the current show from an anonymous donor.\n\nThe movement earned its name after protesters used umbrellas to defend against police tear gas on Sept 28, 2014.\n\n\"I consider the collection of sketches a documentation of a piece of contemporary history. So, it's good to see it enter a museum\", Mr Fong told AFP.\n\nHe describes the political situation in Hong Kong as \"more and more suffocating\" and says he plans to send away other politically sensitive works.\n\nMr Alvin Wong, founder of Hong Kong's Urban Sketchers group, brought together hundreds of sketches by 31 artists in a book entitled \"Sketches under the Umbrella\", published in 2015.\n\n\"All these sketches belong to Hong Kong people. We shouldn't keep them in our own sketchbooks. We have to tell everybody what we saw,\" Mr Wong told AFP.\n\nHe has sent copies to libraries around the world, mainly in the United States, and says only a few bookstores in Hong Kong would stock it.\n\nPolitically sensitive titles have been steadily removed from many city bookshops, particularly since the disappearance in 2015 of five booksellers - known for publishing gossipy accounts of China's political leaders - who resurfaced in custody on the mainland.\n\nAlthough Umbrella art and memorabilia were part of local exhibitions soon after the movement, the largest trove is now in storage at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's (CUHK) library, where the public can only view it as a digital catalogue.\n\nThe majority of works were donated by artists and activists who rescued them from the protest camps to create the Umbrella Movement Visual Archive.\n\nThe library collection ranges from scrawled slogans on placards to bags, jewellery, kites and sculptures, reflecting the fact that the public, not just accomplished artists, created the ad hoc landscape that became a hallmark of the movement.\n\nBut the whereabouts of some major pieces, including the famous 12-foot-high (3.6m) wooden \"Umbrella Man\" statue, remain a mystery.\n\nArtist Sampson Wong, co-founder of the visual archive group, said they handed over the collection because they lacked the funds and manpower to preserve it.\n\nThe library is a \"reliable institution\", Mr Wong told AFP, adding: \"It preserves a part of the movement that in some years could be overlooked.\"\n\nWith the democracy camp still on the back foot after the protests failed to win political reform, there is little appetite among activists to mount a public exhibition of the works.\n\nAnd with concerns over the erosion of freedoms, some who created or collected pieces may prefer to keep them to themselves, said Ms Clarisse Yeung, co-founder of the visual archive, and now a district councillor.\n\nOnline photo collections like the wide-ranging Umbrella Movement Art Preservation Facebook page, put together by Hong Kong artist Kacey Wong, also provide a shareable digital resource.\n\nBut some feel that the physical works should go on show once more.\n\nAcademic Oscar Ho, an associate professor of Practice in Cultural Management at CUHK, said Hong Kong's new government-funded art museum M+ should devote a gallery to the artworks.\n\n\"It's like the whole world is interested except the institutions of Hong Kong,\" said Prof Ho, who has delivered lectures globally about Umbrella art.\n\nM+ told AFP that it is still \"carefully evaluating this recent past\" and would not currently consider Umbrella Movement works for its collection.\n\nHong Kong-born academic Dan Tsang, a former visiting Fulbright scholar at CUHK researching how to archive protest culture, said he is concerned that works not yet gathered from the public may be thrown away or sent out of the city.\n\n\"I think people like to touch and see the real thing, the actual artwork - it's different from just looking at a digital image on a computer screen or phone,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nHong Kong\n\nArtists", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/yq-umbrellaact-26092018.jpg?VersionId=eIJq7XARNX41fSQwgvSge9sOFlxnp4T2", "alt_text": null}]}

The better-than-expected economic performance, coupled with a low unemployment rate of 2.2 per cent, contributed to higher tax collections this year, she said.\n\nIras' collections accounted for 66.2 per cent of government operating revenue and 11.1 per cent of GDP, or economic output.\n\nOCBC Bank economist Selena Ling said GDP growth \"picked up significantly in 2017 and growth in the first half this year was even stronger, so the healthy corporate income tax collections are likely a reflection of real economic activities\".\n\nIncome tax comprising corporate income tax, individual income tax and withholding tax made up 54 per cent of Iras' collection for the 12 months ended March 31.\n\nThe total collected was $27.2 billion, 6.3 per cent higher than the previous year's, due largely to higher corporate income tax collections. Healthy earnings helped lift those receipts by about 10 per cent to $15 billion.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Property tax collection was consistent with the previous year's at $4.4 billion.\n\n\"The property market was really buoyant, likely driven by en-bloc fever. This probably partially contributed to why the policymakers felt compelled to implement cooling measures in July this year,\" said Ms Ling.\n\nThe amount of additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) assessed in the last calendar year jumped 66 per cent to $1.57 billion from 2016, according to Iras data. In comparison, it rose by 20 per cent between 2015 and 2016.\n\nBut economists warned that the latest round of cooling measures starting July 6, which raised ABSD rates on the second and subsequent purchases of residential property, has slowed transactions, and could affect stamp duty collections for the next fiscal year.\n\nThe cost of collection stayed low at 0.84 cent per dollar collected. In financial year 2017/2018, Iras uncovered 10,726 non-compliant cases and recovered about $384 million in taxes and penalties through audits and investigations.\n\nGoods and services tax collection was flat at around $11 billion, while betting taxes, which comprise betting duty, casino tax and private lotteries duty, totalled $2.7 billion, also unchanged from a year ago.\n\nTax collection for the next fiscal year may grow more slowly as \"there are already signs that growth is starting to slow this third quarter, as the tech cycle fades and supply chains face disruption from the escalating US-China trade war\", Maybank Kim Eng economist Chua Hak Bin said.\n\nSee more on\n\nTaxation\n\nIras", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/yq-iras-26092018.jpg?VersionId=Uvz6JDqX.JEmdV1ebvTk_amXwln6ueyK", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

I can't take it. My country cannot bear.\"\n\nMs Hasina was speaking to Reuters in New York, where she is attending the annual United Nations meeting of world leaders.\n\nThe prime minister, who faces a national election in December, said she does not want to pick a fight with Myanmar over the refugees.\n\nBut she suggested patience is growing thin with Myanmar's leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, and its military that she said wields the \"main power\" there.\n\nMs Hasina has previously called on the international community to pressure Myanmar to implement the deal.\n\nCalls to Myanmar's government spokesman Zaw Htay went unanswered. He said recently that he will no longer answer media questions by phone, but will answer questions at a biweekly press conference.\n\nRohingya fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh after a bloody military campaign against the Muslim minority in Myanmar's Rakhine State. The two countries reached a deal in November to begin repatriation within two months, but it has not started, with stateless Rohingya still crossing the border into Bangladesh and the refugee camps at Cox's Bazar.\n\n\"They agree to everything, but unfortunately they don't act, that is the problem,\" Ms Hasina said of Myanmar.\n\n\"Everything is set but...every time they try to find some new excuse,\" she told Reuters.\n\nMyanmar has said it is ready to take back the refugees and has built transit centres to house them initially on their return.\n\nBut it has complained that Bangladesh has not provided its officials with the correct forms. Bangladesh has rejected those claims and UN aid agencies say it is not yet safe for the refugees to return.\n\nGiven the delays, Bangladesh has been preparing new homes on a remote island called Bhasan Char, which rights groups have said could be subject to flooding. Cox's Bazar is also vulnerable to flooding but this year's monsoon season was light.\n\nMs Hasina said building permanent structures for refugees on the mainland \"is not at all a possibility (and) not acceptable\"since they are Myanmar citizens and must return.\n\nRohingya regard themselves as native to Myanmar's Rakhine state, but are widely considered interlopers by the country's Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.\n\nHuman rights groups and Rohingya activists have estimated thousands died in last year's security crackdown, which was sparked by attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security forces in Rakhine in August 2017.\n\nThis week, a\n\nUS government investigation reported\n\nthat Myanmar's military waged a planned, coordinated campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities against the Rohingya.\n\nMyanmar has rejected similar findings as \"one-sided\" and said it had conducted a legitimate counterinsurgency operation.\n\nAhead of December's election, Ms Hasina and her ruling Awami League have been on the defensive following student protests over an unregulated transport industry. The protest was triggered after a speeding bus killed two students in Dhaka.\n\nHowever, the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, has been in disarray after its leader and former prime minister, Khaleda Zia, was jailed for corruption in February - charges she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.\n\nSee more on\n\nMyanmar\n\nBangladesh\n\nRohingya", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/colin-mpm-26.jpg?VersionId=gNtaJ5eiGClfV41Wj5zM6z.0H7fLyqtH", "alt_text": null}]}

Today is a national holiday and almost everyone has the day off. But almost no one has come to Ozdilek.\n\n\"It's generally just empty. There's too many malls,\" says Altin, 34, sporting a close-cropped beard along with a dark tie and white shirt.\n\n\"Because there's three malls right next to each other, none of them make any money.\"\n\nNext door, a pair of empty storefronts frame the entrance to the Metro City mall. The stale air inside bears the scent of retail death. Only the Kanyon mall, where leafy green vines line an open-air courtyard and affluent shoppers throng upscale cafes, seems alive.\n\nThe redundant shopping centres, on a main street in the Levent business district, symbolise Turkey's deeply unbalanced economy.\n\nUnder President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, this country embarked on a building spree that remade its urban skylines and public infrastructure, often making life easier for average Turks.\n\nThe booming economy, which relied heavily on borrowing from foreign banks, grew last year by a robust 7 per cent, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nNow the frenzy is crashing to a halt as Turkish companies' heavy foreign debts come due and the boom's excesses surface. Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian turn, which has led him to consolidate power on a nationalist platform and left him slow to take the measures needed to rein in a runaway economy, has investors on edge.\n\nAfter months of delay and a\n\n40-per-cent drop in the value of the Turkish lira\n\n, Erdogan two weeks ago finally permitted the central bank to raise interest rates. But he did so only after giving a public speech castigating the move, enveloping Turkey's path out of the crisis in a fog of contradiction.\n\nThe belated rate increase virtually guarantees a recession - with unpredictable political fallout, economists say.\n\nIn the months ahead, the president will face more tough decisions, including over a potential IMF bailout, that will test his ability to balance crowd-pleasing rhetoric and the economy's need for bitter medicine.\n\nThe danger is that Erdogan's slow-motion pragmatism may not move fast enough to prevent a Turkish meltdown.\n\n\"Authoritarian regimes run into trouble when the economy runs into trouble,\" said Harvard University government professor Jeffry Frieden, author of \"Global Capitalism\".\n\nLike the Ottoman sultans he admires, Erdogan has made building on a grandiose scale a signature trait. Istanbul's airport eventually will be the world's largest, and the city's gargantuan new mosque will hold more than 37,000 worshippers.\n\nIn recent years, US$1 million condos sprouted in 19th-century buildings along the cobblestone streets of the Galata neighbourhood, famed for its medieval tower.\n\nA new bridge spanned the Bosporus. And just down the road from Levent's trio of shopping malls, a luxury skyscraper called Sapphire became until recently the country's tallest building.\n\nIn a waterside park in the working-class neighbourhood of Eyup, Saban Denizhan, 40, an interior designer, marvelled at the transformation.\n\n\"Living standards have greatly improved. Used to be a time, we couldn't even sit here because of the smell from the water,\" he said, gesturing toward pleasure boats bobbing along the embankment.\n\n\"Now, look, people are fishing.\" Nearby, a construction crew was laying the groundwork for a new metro stop that will allow residents to reach the state hospital without enduring the city's notorious traffic.\n\nHealth-care services\n\nare another area where Erdogan has left his mark.\n\nBefore he took office, Turks could fill prescriptions only at hospitals. Now, they take their state medical cards to any pharmacy.\n\nNo longer must they line up at medical centres at 4 or 5 am in hopes of eventually receiving care several hours later.\n\nInstead, they schedule appointments online or by phone.\n\n\"I'm pleased with the service they give me,\" said Ahmet Colak, 69, taking a break from physical therapy for a bad shoulder.\n\n\"It's 100 per cent better than it used to be.\"\n\nIn the Erdogan era, millions of people have escaped poverty and economic output per person has nearly doubled, according to the IMF. But as the quality of life improved, Erdogan also planted the seeds of the current crisis.\n\nRather than invest in factories - the conventional way for an emerging economy to prosper - Turkey emphasised construction.\n\nSince the late 1990s, manufacturing has shrunk from more than 22 per cent of the economy to about 16 per cent, according to government statistics.\n\nConstruction and real estate over the same period have grown swiftly and now account for about as large a share of national output as manufacturing.\n\nAll that building required a steady flow of foreign borrowing. Major contractors owe about US$56 billion in foreign currency loans. Much of that money is tied up in Erdogan's megaprojects, which enjoy government financial guarantees.\n\nAnalysts say Erdogan and builders - one prominent contractor is a friend from high school - developed a dangerous symbiosis.\n\n\"Property developers and construction companies have been with him since day one. His inner circle largely consists of large contractors. Whatever he does, he has to keep them happy,\" said one financial analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering the government.\n\nThe problem now is that Turkish companies have a mismatch between their debts and their revenue, having borrowed in dollars while their customers pay them in lira. To obtain the dollars needed to repay their lenders, they must earn ever greater amounts of lira.\n\nAbout US$25 billion of debt will soon require refinancing - a huge amount given the industry's thin financial reserves, said economist Atilla Yesilada of Global Source Partners.\n\n\"This is the root of the problem we're going through now,\" said Durmus Yilmaz, the former central bank chief.\n\n\"The situation is degenerating day by day.\"\n\nOn the streets of Istanbul, the industry's excesses are evident.\n\nOffice rents in Istanbul are in free fall, yet three Pentagons' worth of new commercial space is under construction, according to Jones Lang Lasalle, a real estate services firm.\n\nEven as cranes loom above streets lining both shores of the Bosporus, the number of new building permits is collapsing.\n\nMany Turkish construction companies are headed for bankruptcy, Yesilada said.\n\n\"The political economy of the regime relies heavily on patronage and cronyism,\" said Soli Ozel, an international relations professor at Kadir Has University.\n\n\"To save (the contractors) is important both politically and economically. The construction industry has been the true engine of growth and employment.\"\n\nOn downtown buildings, campaign posters featuring Erdogan's unsmiling visage proclaim: \"A large Turkey deserves a strong leader.\"\n\nSince the outbreak in 2013 of large-scale anti-government protests, Erdogan has moved to gather more power into his own hands through constitutional changes that created a powerful presidency.\n\nHe also replaced independent economic officials with loyalists such as his son-in-law Berat Albayrak, the finance minister.\n\nErdogan won election in June to a five-year term as Turkey's first executive president, replacing a nearly century-old parliamentary system with the firm hand of an empowered decision-maker.\n\nThe president's strongman style has crippled the political opposition, undermined independent institutions and chilled public dissent. For the past two years, Turkey has been the world's leading jailer of journalists.\n\nAuthoritarianism is also hamstringing the response to the financial crisis, experts said.\n\nIndependent power centers, including financial regulatory agencies, have been neutered. Last month, the deputy governor of the Central Bank, a frequent target of presidential bullying, unexpectedly resigned.\n\nErdogan in recent days named himself chairman of Turkey's sovereign wealth fund and dismissed the entire management board.\n\nSome experts say government economic statistics, such as data on the percentage of bank loans that have soured, no longer can be trusted. \"We don't know what the real situation is,\" Yilmaz said.\n\nErdogan has managed the economy in defiance of traditional economic thinking, blaming foreign aggression for Turkey's woes and insisting, contrary to all evidence, that high interest rates cause rather than cure inflation - akin to asserting that antibiotics cause infections. He often accuses a shadowy \"interest rate lobby\" of seeking to undermine the Turkish economy.\n\nAs foreign investors fled the sinking lira, Erdogan for months resisted calls to raise interest rates or seek help from the IMF as Turkey did in a 2001 crisis.\n\nIn August, the authorities tried to keep the boom going by adopting short-term palliatives while encouraging businesses and consumers to keep spending.\n\nTo prop up the property market, the government ran full-page newspaper ads touting half-price home mortgages in state-backed developments. They read: \"Time for Turkey to Win.\"\n\nTurkish authorities also have called in major contractors for pep talks, urging them to put a brave face on public comments about the sinking market, said one economist who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of incurring the government's wrath.\n\nSuch measures are not unique to Erdogan, experts say, but part of the playbook for authoritarian leaders confronting troubled economies.\n\n\"I don't think it is a one-off,\" said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\"Turkey is emblematic of things - not just that we're seeing elsewhere in the world but that we've seen in the past.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, Latin American countries such as Brazil and Argentina experienced spurts of rapid growth followed by sudden reversals, a common feature of populist or authoritarian governments. Today, the right-wing nationalist governments of Hungary and Poland may be poised to weather the same violent roller coaster, she said.\n\nStill, there is no iron link between authoritarianism and poor economic outcomes, according to economist Uri Dadush of the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel.\n\nThe lira's deterioration began this spring but was exacerbated in August when President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on US imports of Turkish steel and aluminium.\n\nThat move came after talks broke down to secure the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson, jailed by Turkish authorities.\n\n\"Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe American president's intervention has played into Erdogan's claim that foreign powers are engineering Turkey's financial ills. Erdogan's appeals to nationalism and warnings that the United States wants Turkey \"to kneel\" find a receptive audience among many of Turkey's 81 million people.\n\nThough Erdogan's conspiracy assertions are unproved, outside powers did inadvertently set the stage for Turkey's political and economic deterioration.\n\nBy keeping interest rates near zero for almost a decade after the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve made it easy for companies all over the world to incur enormous debts.\n\nAs of May, Turkish non-financial companies owed US$336 billion in foreign currency debts, most of it in dollars, according to the Central Bank.\n\n\"Investors became completely numb to excesses,\" said Yesilada, the economist. \"We've gotten away with a lot.\"\n\nThe European Union also played a part, by turning its back on Turkey's aspirations to become a member, removing a prod for democratic restructuring.\n\n\"Without the EU, the country started to slide - first politically, now economically,\" said one management consultant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid provoking the government.\n\n\"It's a system with no checks and balances now. At some point, it will hit its head against the wall.\"\n\nAs Erdogan plows ahead, signs of economic damage are mounting. Store rents in Istanbul's malls have jumped 31 percent since the start of last year, according to BMD, the retailers' association. Retailers in three malls opened two hours late on Sept. 10 to protest the soaring costs.\n\nMeanwhile, consumer confidence has dropped, and Amazon.com is delaying its long-expected entry into the Turkish market, according to local press reports. Some Turkish corporations are paying 39 per cent interest on short-term loans.\n\nSeveral factors in August - including government bonuses to 12 million retirees and veterans, more than one in every five Turkish adults - shielded citizens from the most punishing blows.\n\nNow those temporary stimulants have lapsed, meaning life will probably become more difficult.\n\nInflation is at 18 per cent and headed higher, according to government statistics.\n\nThe BIM discount supermarket chain last month raised prices by an average of about 25 per cent on 350 items, including bottled water, cheese and chocolate.\n\nUlker Saklikoy, the maker of a popular vanilla sandwich cookie, raised the price and shrank its size, resulting in an effective cost increase of 65 per cent.\n\n\"I've noticed an increase everywhere, not just at BIM,\" said Gunaydin Yarimla, 54, a retiree.\n\n\"I used to take 50 lira with me when I went shopping. Now, I have to take 80 or 90 lira with me. I expect it to increase even more. Of course, it's difficult.\"\n\nSome Turks are looking past the current peril.\n\nAhmet Asci, 38, who started a jewellery design business three years ago, said he's been able to upgrade from his small Spanish sedan to a US$30,000 BMW 320 thanks to Turkey's recent boom.\n\n\"I think the government has made some correct decisions,\" he said.\n\n\"Foreign powers are creating obstacles for us. But I think the government will take the correct decisions from now on. I'm absolutely not worried.\" Mustafa Unlu isn't as sanguine.\n\nIt's the middle of a workday, but the real estate developer has plenty of time to chat. His phone, which once rang with customers shopping for apartments or offices, is silent. Business is so bad that his two partners quit three months ago.\n\n\"It's not good at all,\" he said. \"It's getting worse and worse.\"\n\nSeated behind a black desk, Unlu, 40, said his income has fallen by half. With his wife, a former health-care executive who stays home with the couple's 6-year-old son, he's reined in family spending and fears more belt-tightening lies ahead.\n\nTurks joke that they are good at surviving crises because they've had so many of them. Unlu's father was a contractor who lost \"half of everything\" in the 2001 crisis, and the younger Unlu several years later saw the global financial crisis coming and shut his motorcycle shop in time to cash out his profits.\n\nToday, he anticipates a tough year or two before the situation improves. He is clear about who is to blame for Turkey's misfortune.\n\n\"Since 2002, this country has been managed by the same political party and the same people,\" Unlu said. \"The country is being run in a very amateur way. You don't know what will happen from one day to another.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nTurkey\n\nEconomic slowdown", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/ak_iira2609.jpg?VersionId=YYALOos8utSxZJy73.lTWeehIksdDg.X", "alt_text": null}]}

As aid workers rushed to vaccinate Rohingya refugees against measles earlier this year, rumours swirled through the overcrowded camps in Bangladesh - that the injections would make women sterile and convert children into Christians.\n\nThe anecdote, included in an August report from the United Nations children's agency, Unicef, illustrates how the refugees, who have fled Myanmar, are vulnerable to misinformation, \"with little or no access to television, radio, or other media\".\n\nIn response, humanitarians are trying innovative projects to counter rumours - translated as \"flying news\" in the Rohingya language - and to let refugees know how to access healthcare and bolster their shelters against storms, among other advice.\n\nMore than 900,000 Rohingya, an ethnic and religious Muslim minority in Myanmar, live in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, the vast majority in camps, according to Unicef.\n\nAbout 700,000 of them arrived in the four months after deadly attacks by Rohingya insurgents on Myanmar security forces in August 2017, which were followed by military operations that the UN and rights groups said targeted civilians.\n\nMyanmar has denied most of the allegations.\n\nAid agencies struggled to accommodate the influx of people, and a year on, the densely populated camps remain vulnerable to storms that could strike during the cyclone season in October and November, bringing floods and disease.\n\n\"Life in the camps is hard and full of hazards,\" Ms Fiona MacGregor, a spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in Cox's Bazar, said by e-mail.\n\n\"In such circumstances, it is very easy for rumours and misinformation to spread - and it is vitally important people get timely, accurate information about everything from health issues to weather dangers.\"\n\nRadio is a key tool for giving out that information, said Ms MacGregor, especially as there is no formal written version of the Rohingya language.\n\nBut there are challenges, she added, as very few Rohingya used radios in their homeland across the border in Myanmar's Rakhine state.\n\nThe IOM is distributing 60,000 radios that can be powered with a hand crank, and is setting up \"listening groups\" in partnership with organisations including BBC Media Action.\n\n'TENSION IS HIGH'\n\nIn the 300 or so groups of about 25 people each, one person leads discussions after listening to programmes that are usually stored on a memory stick, said Mr Richard Lace, Bangladesh director for BBC Media Action.\n\nThe UK-based development charity coordinates with the Bangladesh state broadcaster to produce three shows a week, mostly offering practical information on issues like accessing services and preventing violence against women, said Mr Lace.\n\nBBC Media Action also works with a local station, Radio Naf, to produce two programmes a week, as well as a panel discussion each month with a live audience of about 75 people that focuses on topics affecting both refugees and local residents.\n\nPast panels have tackled the perception that refugees are taking jobs and undercutting wages for day labour, and the mistaken impression that their arrival has been accompanied by a big jump in drug smuggling and other crimes, Mr Lace said.\n\n\"Tension is relatively high right now, so it's an interesting way to blow off steam,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by Skype from Cox's Bazar.\n\nINFORMATION EXCHANGE\n\nInformation flows both ways, as aid agencies also receive feedback from refugees about their concerns via listening group sessions and surveys.\n\nThe international media development agency Internews produces the written \"Flying News\" bulletin, which helps alert aid workers to rumours in the camps as well as dispelling them.\n\nA July bulletin, for example, tackled inaccurate information going around that rice and oil distributed to refugees had expired and was making them sick.\n\nHow to prevent human trafficking and extortion also featured, alongside contact details for trafficking hotlines run by the IOM and the UN refugee agency.\n\n\"You do not have to give money, sex or other favours in exchange for land, goods, food or services,\" the bulletin advised.\n\n\"Refugees have the right to complain about this, and should report incidents to the agency directly or to another agency they trust.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMyanmar\n\nRohingya", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/yq-rohingyarefugee-250918.jpg?VersionId=sklxbTGeVGSgLOwr83C_.dtezUDPbW3t", "alt_text": null}]}

Without biomedical manufacturing, production fell 3.4 per cent.\n\nThe key electronics sector continued to lose steam, growing 3.6 per cent mainly due to the other electronic modules and components, as well as semiconductors segments. This compares with growth of 8.0 per cent in June and 5.1 per cent in July.\n\nGrowth in the sector has been at its slowest pace since February 2016, said OCBC Bank's head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling.\n\nShe added that \"the electronics underperformance may not have ended yet\", in part due to the strong manufacturing performance last year.\n\nFor the whole of 2017, electronics grew 33.5 per cent compared with the year before.\n\nNomura research analyst Euben Paracuelles said that the tech cycle appears to be on a downturn, with growth slipping after a strong run since 2016. He said output growth in the sector \"appears to be converging with the weakness in electronics exports\".\n\nThe biomedical manufacturing cluster grew 4.2 per cent in August, a sharp slowdown from growth of 10.4 per cent in July. Pharmaceutical output expanded 8.7 per cent but dropped 8.2 per cent for the medical technology segment.\n\nPrecision engineering was the only cluster to see faster growth in August. Its output rose 5.6 per cent compared to a year ago, up from 2.4 per cent in July, with the precision modules and components segment growing 16.5 per cent on account of higher production in optical instruments. By contrast, the machinery and systems segment fell 1.4 per cent due to lower export demand for semiconductor related equipment.\n\nThe chemicals cluster expanded by 5.7 per cent, with a higher output in fragrances. The specialties segment, in particular, rose 14.2 per cent as well compared to last year when it saw plant maintenance shutdown.\n\nTransport engineering grew 4.7 per cent, with the marine and offshore engineering segment expanding by 15.4 per cent, given a higher level of work done in offshore projects. Other segments in transport such as aerospace rose 1.3 per cent, while the land transport fell 19.5 per cent.\n\nAll segments in general manufacturing saw declines, with output for the cluster falling 6 per cent compared to last year.\n\nOCBC Bank's Ms Ling said there are probably still \"downside risks\" in the next two months, although economists are watching out for any short-term realignment of production chains to mitigate the US-China tariffs.\n\nMr Song from CIMB Private Banking added that it is likely Singapore will continue to see low single digit growth in coming months, with businesses and consumers resigned to the expectation that escalations in trade tensions may persisit for longer than expected.\n\nOne effect is that businesses may continue to \"frontload orders\", buying more ahead of expected tariff increases and supporting the manufacturing sector.\n\nBut even as growth for the rest of the year may still be positive, it is harder to predict if this will carry on in 2019 and beyond, he said: \"What we may see today - growth - might be all given back next year.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore economic data\n\nManufacturing", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/ak_manufacture_2409.jpg?VersionId=pLz4mjc4V3SbRYRqbFz1igcrJHWJ8BX.", "alt_text": null}]}

Germany and a few US states are taking its example.\n\nDrug War\n\nIn South-east Asia, drug trafficking is often punishable by death, with little distinction made between marijuana and hard drugs like cocaine.\n\nIndonesia has faced global censure for executing drug traffickers, while Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war has left at least 4,000 dead since he took office.\n\nStill, Malaysia isn't alone in looking into the medical marijuana industry. Thailand's Government Pharmaceutical Organisation, a unit of its Ministry of Public Health, is trying to persuade its military government to approve a study of the drug so it can market it for medical use.\n\nThe challenge for Malaysia, which still imposes capital punishment for some drug trafficking offences, is how to draft new laws that are specific enough to differentiate marijuana for medical as opposed to recreational and other uses.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, which has the final say, remains sceptical about the medicinal value of marijuana due to lack of proof, Dr Xavier said.\n\nHe would have to lobby for more support among the ministers, consider public opinion on the matter, and hold formal discussions with the ministries overseeing health, environment, and trade.\n\n\"It's already been done in certain countries,\" Dr Xavier said.\n\n\"If it's going to be used for medicinal purposes, it can be used.

At a recent Senate hearing, lawmakers chastised the social media company and other Silicon Valley giants, including Alphabet's Google, for their willingness to collaborate with China.\n\nFacebook may be keen to avoid inflaming tensions in China. Earlier this year, its attempt to open an\n\n\"innovation hub\" in the country\n\nwas blocked.\n\nIn China, the ruling Communist Party views any comments on Hong Kong's affairs by foreign governments as an infringement of its own sovereignty.\n\n\"Certain countries and institutions have made irresponsible remarks on the Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region) government's ban on the operation of the Hong Kong National Party,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday. \"We express strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to this.\"\n\nHong Kong's push to ban the National Party immediately drew criticism from US officials, amid an escalating trade dispute between the two countries. State Department spokesman Heather Nauert responded to Mr Geng with a tweet on behalf of Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.\n\n\"We are concerned by the #HongKong Government's decision to ban the Hong Kong National Party,\" the tweet said. \"The US supports the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association. These are core values we share with Hong Kong, and that must be vigorously protected.\"\n\nFacebook has removed pages and posts that violate its policies on hate speech. In March, it blacklisted UK's political party Britain First for \"repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups\".\n\nThe company does not list a clear policy for how to treat banned political parties.

Mr Tan took the witness stand on Tuesday (Sept 25) and was examined by the COI for similar failings.\n\nThe intrusions on SingHealth's electronic medical records (EMR) system began undetected on June 27 before being discovered on July 4 and terminated by Ms Katherine Tan, a database administrator at IHiS.\n\nMr Wee told the hearing he was \"copied\" in e-mails sent by a system engineer reporting a malware infection in workstations as early as June. \"The next morning, I glanced through the e-mails. I do not recall looking in detail at the logs and the screenshots in the first e-mail,\" he said.\n\nMr Wee noted that he was included in a chat group titled \"Citrix-SCM Incident\" set up by the system engineer on June 13, which also looped in Mr Tan who was on leave at the time.\n\nThe chat contained findings on attempts to access the EMR system.\n\nMr Wee said he did not contact Mr Tan, or follow up on the reported matter. \"I do not have my own system for keeping track of investigations being carried out... I would wait for them (Mr Tan's team) to inform me when necessary,\" he said.\n\nBy July 4, Mr Wee had still not reported the incident to upper management, as he viewed it only as \"a potential breach\" based on information gathered at that time.\n\nInvestigations were going on to determine whether EMR records had been leaked, although he knew that there were attempts to access 100,000 records.\n\nThe COI also heard that Mr Wee failed to link two key events: The attempts to seek 100,000 EMR records and earlier failed attempts in May and June to exploit inactive administrator accounts to remotely log into a server linked to the EMR database.\n\nThe Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and upper management at IHiS and SingHealth were informed of the attack on July 10.\n\nLater in the day, Mr Han Hann Kwang, assistant director (infra services - security management) at IHiS, took the witness stand and provided clarification on the criteria for escalation. He drafted the standard operating procedure for incident response, which was approved and circulated to the cyber-security team and higher-ups in March this year.\n\n\"(It) does not mean that data has to be exfiltrated before an incident is considered a security incident. If there is unauthorised access or queries to a database, even if no records are returned or exfiltrated, it would still be a security incident,\" he said. \"Also, unauthorised access would be considered to violate IT security policies.\"\n\nMs Kristy Tan, senior director at the Attorney-General's Chambers, said that such an important document should not only be circulated to the cyber-security team, but also to the network and database teams in IHiS so that they know what to do when they encounter incidents on critical systems.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mr Magnus asked if Mr Wee had spelt out how fast risks should be reported and contained, to which he replied \"no\".\n\nHe also asked why Mr Wee only glanced at the content of the email copied to him in June.\n\nMr Wee replied: \"Investigation was being done. The result was not conclusive.\"\n\nCOI member Lee Fook Sun, executive chairman of security firm Ensign InfoSecurity, asked what the consequences would be if Mr Wee were to report a false alarm to upper management. Mr Wee answered: \"There would be no consequence.\"\n\nMr Lee also asked how often chat groups such as the one titled \"Citrix-SCM Incident\" were set up. Mr Wee replied: \"Not very often.\"\n\nThe inquiry continues.\n\nSee more on\n\nCyber security\n\nLee Hsien Loong\n\nSingapore health\n\nSingHealth COI", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/ak_sghealth_2609.jpg?VersionId=7Wuik5VE4EwLRMSJsyoa3Tr7JDkWLzuS", "alt_text": null}]}

It will serve as 'policy watch' and formulate alternative policies to compete with Pakatan Harapan,\" he said, as quoted by the Malaysian media.\n\nTan Sri Annuar invited opposition parties from Sarawak and Sabah, which have formed their own alliances, to also join in.\n\nIn previous years when BN was in power, then opposition parties such as the Democratic Action Party and Parti Keadilan Rakyat had scoffed at the idea of a shadow Cabinet, as practised in countries following the Westminster style of Parliament.

We want to make sure we get the space right,\" he said, adding that the new property collection will focus on details such as high ceilings, ample sunlight and customisability.\n\nHe said buyers usually judge their property purchases with psf, but \"if you have an apartment with a low ceiling, you're done\".\n\n\"People don't talk about it (but these) things really will affect you when you move into an apartment,\" he said.\n\nFor Petit Collectibles, \"no major obstructions will prevent (owners) from opening up or closing a space\", he said.\n\n\"The fun part about having a nice home is being able to create your own space,\" Mr Cheong said.\n\nDaylight will be a common denominator in Petit Collectibles projects. \"There will be no corners that will be dark.\"\n\nSC Global Developments' previous projects include The Marq, Sculptura Ardmore and Thr3e Thre3 Robin.\n\nLast year, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin bought a 10,300 sq ft super penthouse with a cantilevered private pool at Sculptura Aardmore for close to $60 million, or around $5,650 psf.\n\nSee more on\n\nPRIVATE PROPERTY\n\nCondominiums", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/yq-petitcollectibles-26092018.jpg?VersionId=QcZ4jpfRnwtLY4ydeYvbTfb7HCoVoAS2", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Of three once bustling Thomasville furniture factories in the city limits, one is being demolished and cleared for parkland, another may become the site of a new police station, and a third is being converted into apartments.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is threatening to levy tariffs of up to 25 per cent on US$500 billion (S$683 billion) of goods imported from China each year, including roughly US$20 billion of furniture, as a way to bring back hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs lost to China and other low-cost competitors.\n\nYet, the transformation of US industries since China's emergence as the world's low-cost producer almost two decades ago means many no longer directly compete with Chinese imports, so tariffs may not translate so easily into more US jobs.\n\nAt family-owned Bernhardt Furniture, executives say it would take about US$30 million in capital investment - some 10 per cent of annual sales - to resurrect standard wood furniture lines now mainly made in countries such as China and Vietnam.\n\nThat is too much to commit based on a policy that a future administration could reverse.\n\n\"The theory is you turn (imports) off, the jobs come back. That's not really true... The buildings don't exist. The people don't exist. The machinery does not exist\", to make the sort of furniture that now gets imported, said Mr Alex Bernhardt Jr, chief executive and the company founder's great-grandson.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

In expanding, the 129-year-old company has been hiring not only factory workers, but also designers, marketing experts and other professionals. In all, it is a different firm from what it was three decades ago when it first began dividing product lines between the United States and Asia.\n\nEconomists say the same is true across much of US manufacturing. To invest and hire more workers, executives would need certainty, for example, that consumers would prefer US-made products at a potentially higher price. They would need confidence that tariffs would last beyond the Trump administration and that production could not be moved to other more cost-competitive countries.\n\nEven then, there may be little incentive to go back to old product lines for industries that have changed dramatically because of globalisation.\n\nAcross the Rust Belt and the former factory towns of the south, the transformation is apparent. In Buffalo, an old steel mill is now a solar panel factory, and a retail goods manufacturer now houses an office and restaurant park. In Cleveland, a shuttered GM plant has reopened as a Chinese-owned auto glass company. Abandoned factories throughout North Carolina have landed on the Environmental Protection Agency's list of \"brownfield\" sites that need cleanup.\n\nSome companies are considering moving production from China as a result of the tariffs, but the jobs are unlikely to head home.\n\nIllinois-based CCTY Bearing, for example, said it planned to move US-bound production from Zhenjiang, China, to a new factory near Mumbai in India to keep labour costs down.\n\nJLab Audio's China-made Bluetooth products are not being taxed yet, but its chief executive Win Cramer had been scouting for suppliers in Vietnam and Mexico.\n\n\"I would love to build products onshore, but consumers have proven time and time again that 'Made in America' isn't as valuable a statement as it once was,\" Mr Cramer said. \"They make decisions based on the cost.\"\n\nThe price of, say, its Bluetooth earbud would jump from US$20 to as much as US$50 if it was made in the US, Mr Cramer said, far more than what tariffs would add to the cost of imports.\n\nTo be sure, early reactions suggest that foreign companies that make US-bound goods in China may move some of that production to the United States. Still, countries such as Vietnam may ultimately benefit the most from Mr Trump's tariffs.\n\nJapanese construction and mining equipment maker Komatsu has said it has already shifted some of its production of parts for US-built excavators from China. Part of that production moved to the US, but some also went to Mexico and Japan.\n\nIn South Korea, LG Electronics and its rival Samsung Electronics are considering moving parts of US-bound refrigerator and air conditioner production to Mexico, Vietnam or back home, but not to the United States, according to company sources and local media.\n\nThe responses to Mr Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium show how such steps create both winners and losers.\n\nProducers such as US Steel and Century Aluminium have said they will add at least several hundred jobs as a result of the higher prices they can charge. Mid-Continental Nail, however, laid off 130 workers because of those higher steel prices, and furniture parts maker Leggett & Platt has warned that rising metal prices would prompt it to move production abroad.\n\nSo far, Washington has imposed duties on US$250 billion of Chinese imports and Mr Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on all Chinese goods.\n\nMany economists project new tariffs would on balance either slow down hiring or cause job losses in a manufacturing sector where employment has grown by 10 per cent over the past eight years without special protection.\n\nThe furniture industry, among the hardest hit by Chinese imports, has added 43,000 jobs since its employment hit a low of 350,000 in 2011, helped by the recovering housing market and strong consumer demand.\n\nIndustry officials say skilled upholsterers and other workers are hard to find, echoing the Federal Reserve's concern about the impact of worker shortages on the US economy.\n\nIn Thomasville, few expect that tariffs will bring furniture manufacturing back to its heyday, nor does the community need it, said city manager Kelly Craver, whose parents worked in the furniture and textile industries.\n\nSince the recession, Thomasville has become a residential hub for growing nearby cities such as Greensboro and Charlotte. It also has its own mix of manufacturing and white collar jobs. Mohawk Industries recently expanded its Thomasville laminate flooring facility while the Old Dominion Freight Line transportation firm and the fast-growing Cook Out burger chain have corporate headquarters there.\n\n\"We, for the very first time in this city's existence, are going to have a diversified economy,\" said city manager Ms Craver.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS economy\n\nChina\n\nTrade war", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/yq-thomasville-250918.jpg?VersionId=5F7NjwT2WOwmkaaGfBrJDreMX.hnlV.l", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The catch? In order to inherit, he has to spend 1 billion yuan in a month on himself and not own any assets at the end of it. And he cannot tell anyone what he is doing. His good friend Zhuang Qiang (Zhang Yiming) gets roped into the spending spree while Xia Zhu (Vivian Sung) is the accountant keeping tabs on his expenses.\n\nIf the plot sounds familiar, that is because the movie is a remake of the 1985 comedy Brewster's Millions - itself supposedly the seventh film based on the 1902 novel of the same name.\n\nThe enduring popularity of the premise could have something to do with the seductive fantasy of getting-rich-quick and the corollary thought: People definitely would not have a problem spending all that money.\n\nDuoyu gives the challenge his best shot. He sponsors cockamamie schemes in a sequence that parodies the popular reality television programme Chinese Dream Show (2011 to present), as everyone around him claims to have a dream that needs funding.\n\nOf course, things do not go smoothly for him. Even the most outlandish ideas end up generating more money and, suddenly, spending 1 billion yuan does not seem like such an easy task.\n\nThis loose China remake reunites writer-directors Fei Yan and Peng Damo and actor Shen of the hit comedy Goodbye Mr Loser (2015), which earned 1.44 billion yuan. Hello, Mr Billionaire has been even more successful, with box-office takings of 2.54 billion yuan.\n\nIt looks like Shen's lovable loser persona has struck a chord with audiences in China, to the point where they can accept a jarring romance between Duoyu and Xia Zhu (played by Taiwan's Sung, best known for the 2015 youth romance Our Times).\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

And it's a sorry situation that he sings about: \"Gradually, the people around you stop joking/ Choose cunning or kindness/The future's bright, just need a thorough plan/Adults slowly being broken have no sadness.\"\n\nThe track is given a contemporary pop gloss with a touch of high-pitched vocal effects, and its sleekness is a contrast to the stark cry for help. The lyrics go: \"Who will care about me, care about me.\"\n\nOn the ballad Ke Xiao (What A Fool), he is the aggrieved party in a love triangle, where he sings: \"My pain is like the crashing waves/But still have to pretend to wish you well, not want anything in return.\"\n\nNot all is lost in this fraught state of affairs.

Cars choke the paved city streets and the downtown area is brimming with cafes, restaurants and bars catering to the small but growing middle class.\n\nIn recent years, Chinese investment in resource-rich Laos has strengthened the country's economy, which is projected to grow by 7 per cent this year. Vientiane's hot property market reflects this trend. Hoping that China's\n\nBelt and Road Initiative\n\nwill improve connectivity with its neighbour, Laos is preparing for a new wave of Chinese investment in its property sector.\n\nCrucial to these hopes is a 418km, US$5 billion (S$6.8 billion) rail line that Beijing seeks to extend through Laos to Thailand, a much larger market.\n\nThe completion of the rail line will bring a major change to the city, connecting landlocked Laos to China's extensive rail network, which will bring tourism and property investment, said Mr Tony Saiyalath, managing director at RentsBuy, a property company based in Vientiane.\n\n\"That will bring the property market alive,\" he said. \"Even right now, people are starting to buy - they already know the locations of where the stations are.\"\n\nThe increase in Chinese investment is due in part to a new policy of \"transforming assets into capital\", which Laos' communist government introduced five years ago. Under the policy, state-owned property can be privatised to attract foreign investment.\n\nThe plan was especially appealing to Chinese investors, who acquired most of the high-end property in Vientiane. Prices went up sharply in 2014, but have stabilised, while rents have dropped by 20 to 30 per cent since 2016, partly because Chinese mining companies have reduced their Laos operations after concessions expired.\n\nChinese businessmen are the dominant property investors in Vientiane, along with a mix of Laotian, Vietnamese and Thai investors, Mr Saiyalath said.\n\nChinese companies are also players in the largest property developments in the city. This is apparent on the east end of downtown Vientiane's riverside, where the Laotian and French colonial architecture yields to a mile-long stretch of prime real estate developed by the Camce Investment (Lao) Co, a joint venture between China CAMC Engineering and the Laotian construction company Krittaphong Group. With its investment, Camce is aiming to draw wealthy locals and foreigners.\n\nThe Landmark compound on the east end of the Camce development combines high-end residential, hotel, restaurant and event spaces to create an exclusive, gated community. Landmark Diplomatic Residence offers luxury apartments for rent only, from US$1,000 to US$2,200 a month, said Mr Neo Liang, a Chinese manager at Camce's marketing office. Next door, offering unobstructed views of the Mekong River and Thailand on the other side, is the five-star Landmark Mekong Riverside Hotel, where President Barack Obama stayed in the presidential suite during his visit to Laos in 2016.\n\nFarther upstream, ASEM Villa features 50 fully furnished and decorated \"mansion villas\" for rent, starting at US$4,500 a month. Mr Liang said the gated community was more than 90 per cent occupied, with a variety of tenants.\n\n\"They're from all over - Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, Singaporeans,\" he said.\n\nA visit to ASEM Villa showed a strong presence by Chinese state-owned companies, including China Railway Group, which is building the rail line to Vientiane, and PowerChina, which has numerous projects of its own and via subsidiaries throughout Laos. Other offices with Chinese tenants included a Belt and Road information centre and a Chinese culture centre. The Singaporean ambassador's residence and the European Union's office for Laos are also there.\n\nThe area includes another five-star hotel, the Don Chan Palace. At 14 floors, it is the country's tallest. Like the Landmark compound, Don Chan Palace also has a large banquet hall and convention centre. On a recent visit, the lobbies of both hotels were primarily populated by Chinese businessmen.\n\nVientiane New World, an outdoor mall on the development's west end, is Camce's most public-facing development. It features a small office building for the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei - whose advertisements flutter on lamp posts downtown - and a \"walking street\" with restaurants, cafes, shops and a beer garden.\n\nChinese businesses are featured prominently at Vientiane New World, with regional Chinese restaurants offering cuisine from Liaoning and Shandong provinces, as well as Old Chengdu, a high-end Sichuanese restaurant where several dishes cost upward of US$100 - a month's rent for the average Vientiane resident.\n\nChinese expatriates and tourists are not the only diners to be found at these restaurants, however. For middle-class and wealthier Laotians, dining at a Chinese restaurant is a sign of sophistication and worldliness.\n\nOn weekend nights, Vientiane New World's beer garden is filled with young Laotians eating and drinking at dozens of tiny open-air bars and restaurants, typically constructed with corrugated metal. Offering a relatively upscale alternative to the night markets farther down the riverside, each establishment's music competes with that of the neighbours.\n\nCamce's riverside investment is but one Chinese project transforming the city. Shanghai Wanfeng has invested US$300 million of a projected US$5 billion total in That Luang Lake, which has just begun its second of four phases that are scheduled for completion in 2032.\n\nOf the 11 buildings already built, four condominiums are selling units, Mr Saiyalath said. Two more buildings - a hotel and serviced apartments - are also preparing to open.\n\nThe project is in an economic zone, where foreign investors can buy condominiums.\n\nMr Saiyalath said he hoped the government would adopt a new law to allow foreigners to own condominiums outside of economic zones. In Cambodia, which has such a law, foreign money, especially Chinese, has flooded the property market.\n\n\"Once this law is in place, foreigners will be more confident to invest here,\" he said.\n\n\"Look at Cambodia. Our country needs to be developed quickly.\"\n\nChina is prioritising Laos in its Belt and Road investment push. Last November, President Xi Jinping of China and his Laotian counterpart Bounnhang Vorachith oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding to deepen cooperation through a new Laos-China economic corridor.\n\n\"China sees Laos as providing a pathway for rail and road connectivity into Thailand and the rest of South-east Asia,\" said Mr Brian Eyler, director of the South-east Asia programme at the Stimson Centre, a non-partisan policy research centre in Washington.\n\nThailand's military leaders have dragged their feet on the rail line between Bangkok and Vientiane that they originally said would be completed in March. Thailand's transport ministry now projects the line to be completed by 2023, at the earliest.\n\n\"The fate of the rail connection from Vientiane to Bangkok is uncertain,\" Mr Eyler said, \"which means China's big Belt and Rail push into South-east Asia could end inside of landlocked Laos.\"\n\nThailand is wary of getting too close to China, while the Laotian government has been keen to tap easy Chinese money, said Mr George McLeod, a consultant based in Bangkok.\n\n\"Thailand's low-end manufacturing sector has already been gutted by Chinese competition, and the leadership is acutely aware that closer ties would take a further toll on their economy,\" Mr McLeod said.\n\n\"Laos is even more susceptible to becoming an unequal partner - it has a tiny population of under seven million and lies directly on China's southern border with no buffer in between.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nLaos\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-laos-260918.jpg?VersionId=WzeN.VptPaPkCw83TL23qxCvb0p_fYTW", "alt_text": null}]}

The Manila-based institution kept its 2018 economic growth estimate for the region at 6.0 per cent in an update of its Asian Development Outlook. But it trimmed next year's forecast to 5.8 per cent from 5.9 per cent.\n\n\"Downside risks to the outlook are intensifying\", said ADB chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada, pointing to the potential impact of US-Sino trade tensions on regional supply chains and the risk of sudden capital outflows if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates even more quickly.\n\nThe ADB's 5.8 per cent growth estimate for 2019 would be the slowest for the region - made up of 45 countries in the Asia-Pacific region - since it clocked a 4.9 per cent growth in 2001. The United States and China imposed fresh tariffs on each other's goods on Monday as the world's biggest economies showed no signs of backing down from an increasingly bitter trade dispute that is expected to hit global economic growth.\n\nChina's economy is expected to grow 6.3 per cent in 2019, the ADB said, slower than its 6.4 per cent forecast in July and weaker than its 6.6 per cent growth estimate for 2018, which was unchanged from its previous projection. Beijing has set a growth target of around 6.5 per cent this year, the same as last year, which it handily beat with an expansion of 6.9 per cent.\n\nSouth Asia is poised to remain as the fastest growing in the region as the ADB maintained its growth estimates of 7.0 per cent for this year and 7.2 per cent for next year.\n\nHowever, moderating export growth, quickening inflation, net capital outflows and a worsening balance of payments dimmed the growth outlook for South-east Asia, with growth this year projected to slow to 5.1 per cent from the July forecast of 5.2 per cent.\n\n\"Policy makers have at their disposal an array of policy tools with which to manage pockets of vulnerability and maintain stability, but they must be applied carefully,\" Sawada said.\n\nInflation across the region is expected to remain under control, helped by country-specific factors like moderate food price inflation in India and China and fuel subsidies in Indonesia and Malaysia, the ADB said. It maintained this year's inflation projection at 2.8 per cent but raised the forecast for next year to 2.8 per cent from 2.7 per cent in July.\n\nSee more on\n\nEconomic growth\n\nTrade\n\nADB/Asian Development Bank", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/2018-09-14t014142z_1642235486_rc1c0fe97a40_rtrmadp_3_usa-trade-china.jpg?VersionId=28LYNH5KrYpv2BBHXJ0aDHpQ9KpZBQ.H", "alt_text": null}]}

They should keep it forever,\" Dave Iarocci, @larocciDave, tweeted last month.\n\nThe shorter brand names might appeal to a younger generation that has brought texting abbreviations like \"LOL\" (laugh out loud) and \"OMG\" (oh my God) into the mainstream, but many longtime brand loyalists opposed the identity shifts.\n\n\"Just a tragic, heartbreaking sign of the times,\" wrote doughnut aficionado Billy Glidden, @BillyGlidden, his tongue apparently planted firmly in cheek. \"Our civilisation is inexorably in decline.\"\n\nThe 68-year-old company, based in Canton, Massachusetts, started rolling out the new identity over the last few months, opening 30 \"Dunkin'\" locations around Boston. That triggered a backlash even ahead of Tuesday's announcement.\n\nThe brand's launch in 1950 coincided with the popularisation of the alternative spelling of \"doughnut\" as \"donut\", according to Google Books data.\n\nSee more on\n\nAdvertising and marketing\n\nFood and beverage sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-donut-260918_0.jpg?VersionId=HYAYrmIUxD8G5I3w0Z9d8JVCGH90Mwz0", "alt_text": null}]}

They have approached M1's biggest shareholder, Malaysian carrier Axiata Group, about the potential transaction, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.\n\nA deal for M1 could be announced as soon as the next few days, the people said. Keppel Telecommunications & Transportation, a listed subsidiary of Keppel Corp, owns about 19.3 per cent of M1, while SPH holds nearly 13.5 per cent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. SPH also owns The Straits Times.\n\nShares of M1 and Keppel T&T have been halted since Monday, pending announcements. Keppel has approached Singapore Press Holdings to take part in a possible transaction regarding M1 shares, the newspaper publisher said in an exchange filing on Monday, without providing more details of the deal.\n\nAxiata may decide to make its own offer for M1 if the price announced by SPH and Keppel is too low, two of the people said. In July last year, SPH and Keppel - together with Axiata - ended a strategic review of their stakes in the operator after potential suitors to buy the city-state's smallest cellular services provider dropped out.\n\nRepresentatives for SPH, Keppel and M1 didn't immediately respond to requests for comment outside regular Asian business hours.\n\n\"Axiata is consistent in our publicly stated position that we will consider all viable and appropriate options that will enhance our own shareholders' value,\" the Malaysian carrier said in a statement, declining to comment further.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

For example, gross domestic product growth is healthy, but reached higher points as recently as 2014. The unemployment rate is at an 18-year low, but is higher than several months during the 1940s and 1960s. And wage growth is still slow: after adjusting for inflation, average hourly earnings increased just 0.2 per cent in August.\n\nMr Trump's claim of signing the \"biggest\" tax cut in American history is false; by various metrics, several rank higher.\n\nHe misleadingly said construction on the border wall with Mexico had begun; projects to replace fencing and barriers are underway, but the administration has not begun to build a 1,609km-long wall.\n\nHe was also wrong in characterising recent military spending Bills as \"record funding\". Even without adjusting for inflation, President Barack Obama signed legislation in 2010 that provided more money for the military.\n\nAdditionally, Mr Trump has signed a relatively low number of Bills when compared to other presidents, even at similar points in their terms.\n\nWhile he can claim major legislative victories - on tax cuts and veterans' benefits - he has also been unable to deliver on other key campaign promises, like the border wall and repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat Trump said:\n\n\"Thanks to the United States military and our partnership with many of your nations, I am pleased to report that the bloodthirsty killers known as ISIS have been driven out from the territory they once held in Iraq and Syria.\"\n\nThe facts:\n\nThis is exaggerated.\n\nMr Trump's declaration of victory is slightly premature. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is down to its last 518 sq km, about 1 per cent of the territory it previously held in Iraq and Syria, The New York Times recently reported. Pentagon officials have stressed that their job is not done.\n\nThere are still \"remaining pockets\" of ISIS fighters in Syria and Iraq, and they continue to threaten the two countries' peace and security, Colonel Sean Ryan, a Defence Department spokesman, told reporters on Sept 18.\n\nDefence Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Monday that US troops will continue to train and advise local security forces to make certain the Islamic State does not resurface. He said \"fighting is ongoing\" in Syria's Euphrates River Valley, where troops have battled the ISIS.\n\n\"I think that getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say 'OK, we got rid of it', march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back,' Mr Mattis said.\n\n\"And how many times have we seen - look at even Iraq where they're still on the hunt for them. And they're still trying to come back.\"\n\nWhat Trump said:\n\n\"The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have pledged billions of dollars to aid the people of Syria and Yemen, and they are pursuing multiple avenues to ending Yemen's horrible, horrific civil war.\"\n\nThe facts:\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nMr Trump is right that the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have contributed funds to ease humanitarian crises in Syria and Yemen. But his comment glosses over the three countries' roles in Yemen's civil war.\n\nThe governments of Saudi Arabia and the UAE are the top two donors to the United Nations' humanitarian response plan in Yemen, contributing nearly US$1 billion (S$1.36 billion) combined. Additionally, the two countries donated another US$375 million through other programmes, the data show.\n\nQatar also contributed US$500,000 to the UN response plan.\n\nIn Syria, Saudi Arabia donated US$18.6 million this year to the world body's humanitarian response plan and US$24.3 million in 2017. Qatar contributed US$2.2 million in 2018 and US$29.5 million last year, the same reports show.\n\nDollars aside, it's worth noting that the UN and human rights groups have said that the humanitarian crisis in Yemen has been exacerbated by the country's ongoing civil war.\n\nA Saudi-led coalition - including the UAE and the US - has since 2015 fought Iranian-linked Houthi rebels who ousted the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi of Yemen.\n\nQatar initially was part of the international coalition fighting the Houthi rebels, but was expelled last year after Riyadh accused the tiny nation of funding terrorism, cosying up to Iran and welcoming dissidents.\n\nA report by UN investigators in August accused the Saudi-led coalition of potential war crimes, including charges of killing thousands of civilians in airstrikes, torturing detainees and conscripting child soldiers.\n\nThe same report also accused the Houthi rebels of possible war crimes.\n\nSee more on\n\nUN\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-trump01-260918.jpg?VersionId=ss5ku9E2rqvPZ_RMlSRCbSCsQ1CjC8vb", "alt_text": null}]}

Although the economic impact of the US action on the Chinese remains unclear, the vehemence of Beijing's response suggested that the move stung.\n\nThe mounting military tensions came only three months after Defence Secretary Jim Mattis visited Beijing pledging \"to keep our relationship on the right trajectory\".\n\nInstead, the relationship appears to be veering wildly off track as an escalating trade war becomes conflated with broader concerns in Washington about China's policies.\n\nThe administration's actions have coincided with aggressive steps by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on Chinese products. That has fuelled the sentiment in Beijing that the deterioration of relations was not about trade policy as much as blunting China's emergence as a world power.\n\nEven as news of the cancelled port call became public, China's foreign ministry strongly denounced the Trump administration's announcement of a new sale of US$330 million (S$450 million) in military equipment to Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as part of a united China.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The US no longer formally recognises Taiwan but has maintained close relations and is committed by law to help the island defend itself - much to the anger of China.\n\nChina appeared even more stunned by the decision to punish the state military company. The Trump administration announced last week that it would impose sanctions on the Chinese military's Equipment Development Department and its director, Mr Li Shangfu, for purchases of Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 surface-to-air missiles from Russia.\n\nHe and the company were among 33 entities targeted under a law enacted by the US government last year to punish Iran, North Korea and Russia for behaviour hostile to the US.\n\nIn the case of Russia, the act is intended to punish its military actions in Ukraine and Syria and interference in the 2016 US election.\n\nIn response, Beijing summoned US ambassador Terry Branstad over the weekend and has since continued a steady drum beat of criticism in the state news media.\n\nChinese officials have repeatedly said that military cooperation with Russia - including the purchase of sophisticated weaponry - is in compliance with international law, which is true. The collateral damage appears to be the Pentagon's hopes for sustaining contacts with the Chinese military.\n\nThe US consulate in Hong Kong confirmed China's refusal to allow the Wasp to visit but did not elaborate on the reasons behind it.\n\n\"We have a long track record of successful port visits to Hong Kong, and we expect that will continue,\" a spokesman said in a statement, declining to be identified in keeping with State Department policy.\n\nMr Geng, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, deflected a question about the cancelled port visit but said China considered requests case by case, in keeping with the country's sovereignty.\n\nAlthough the Chinese and US militaries have long been rivals, exchanges and port visits - which combine diplomacy and public relations with much needed shore leaves for sailors and Marines - have been common over the years.\n\nLast year, the USS Sterett, a guided-missile destroyer, visited one of China's most sensitive naval bases, in Zhanjiang in southern China.\n\nSuch visits have, nonetheless, been subject to the ups and downs in the countries' relations.\n\nIn 2016, a planned visit to Hong Kong by a US aircraft carrier, the USS John C. Stennis, was rebuffed at a time when the Obama administration was becoming increasingly frustrated with China's expansion of artificial islands in disputed territory in the South China Sea.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/ak_warship2_2609_0.jpg?VersionId=ZNj4zxMStUxKtp2M2DK1Rfb3G1GDBme8", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Mr Trump called Mr Kim a \"rocket man on a suicide mission\".\n\nThis year, Mr Trump thanked Mr Kim for \"his courage and the steps he has taken\" in a\n\nmuch more subdued speech\n\n.\n\nWhile North Korea's foreign minister is set to address the UN on Saturday, Mr Moon was already busy making the case for the country.\n\n\"Kim Jong Un said that he is well aware that a lot of people in the world still cannot trust North Korea or think North Korea is deceiving or trying to buy time, even after it took several steps to denuclearise,\" Mr Moon said.\n\n\"But what can North Korea gain from deceiving or buying time?\" he said quoting Mr Kim.\n\nThe South Korean President is, more than likely, also targeting a more narrow audience, as Mr Stephen Noerper, senior director for policy at Korea Society, sees it, as Mr Moon's agenda involves another significant player on the world stage.\n\n\"I don't think of Moon as Kim's spokesperson, but rather a leader who realises he needs both Kim and Trump amenable to agreement,\" said Mr Noerper.\n\nMr Moon's approach \"risks accusations of compromise, but in reality is geared towards effectively managing two outsized egos\".\n\nIn Pyongyang last week, North Korea said it would dismantle its missile-test site and a launching pad in the presence of international experts. It added that it would be willing to take further steps to end its nuclear programmes such as closing its nuclear test site, if the US takes unspecified corresponding measures and honours the agreement signed in June at the first-ever summit between leaders of North Korea and the US.\n\nCritics panned the latest agreement between the Koreas, saying it lacked any specifics and raised a host of questions.\n\nWhile Mr Moon said it's \"natural\" to be suspicious of Mr Kim's motivation given the North's past failures to live up to its denuclearisation agreements, he added that this time it was \"completely different\".\n\n\"This time, please trust North Korea's sincerity, Kim said,\" Mr Moon said, adding that the North Korean leader agreed to live broadcasting at the summits.\n\n\"By live broadcasting all the process of the summit, I tried to have people around the world see Chairman Kim Jong Un and what kind of person he is with their eyes.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSouth Korea\n\nNorth Korea\n\nLimited-time offer\n\nGet a FREE Xiaomi vacuum cleaner (worth $109) with your subscription!\n\nBilled at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

In the wake of President Donald Trump's decision in May to withdraw from the accord, European leaders have been trying to come up with ways to salvage the deal in hopes that Iran will continue to abide by the restrictions on its nuclear programme.\n\nThe only way to do that, they have concluded, is to give Iran some economic benefits, and that means defying US sanctions.\n\nSo far, Iran is abiding by the agreement, according to nuclear inspectors.\n\nUntil Tuesday, Trump administration officials had largely played down their differences with Europe over the accord, describing the disagreement as little more than a family squabble. Such soothing talk now appears to be over.\n\nBolton and Pompeo spoke at the annual meeting of United Against Nuclear Iran, a group deeply critical of the nuclear deal. Bolton, who once served on the group's board, was cheered repeatedly as he delivered one blistering attack after another against Iran and Europe.\n\n\"You know the European Union is strong on rhetoric and weak on follow through,\" he said at one point.\n\nBolton took particular note of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a financial messaging service based in Belgium that is widely known as Swift. The service connects banks with each other and provides a secure way for financial institutions to wire money around the world.\n\nThe Trump administration wants Swift to remove Iran's banks, including its central bank, from the system. Europeans have responded that doing so would undermine the global financial system and make it more vulnerable to cyberattacks and alternative messaging services created by China and Russia.\n\n\"How can this enterprise justify facilitating the evil escapades of the world's leading state sponsor of terror?\" Bolton asked of Swift.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and Iran issued a joint statement on Monday night endorsing the creation of the \"special purpose vehicle,\" something European leaders have been talking about for months.\n\nFederica Mogherini, the EU's foreign minister, who is loathed by top Trump administration officials, described the financial entity as something that would allow European companies to continue doing business with Iran.\n\nMany large European businesses, including Total and Volkswagen, are already pulling out of Iran as a result of pending US sanctions.\n\nAnd even before the final sanctions go into effect, Iran's crude oil exports are plummeting as international oil companies bail out of deals with Tehran.\n\nAlso on Tuesday,\n\nTrump and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran dismissed\n\neach other in withering speeches to the UN General Assembly.\n\n\"Iran's leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,\" Trump said.\n\nRouhani responded by suggesting indirectly that Trump suffered a \"weakness of the intellect\" and \"inability in understanding a complex and interconnected world.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUS foreign policy\n\nIran", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-bolton-260918.jpg?VersionId=yclWIGHnUSiIXIas7fq3w8s4_N97gEtj", "alt_text": null}]}

Wells novella involving murder most fowl, scientists said on Wednesday (Sept 26) they have finally solved the riddle of the world's largest bird.\n\nFor 60 million years the colossal, flightless elephant bird - Aepyornis maximus - stalked the savannah and rainforests of Madagascar until it was hunted to extinction around 1,000 years ago.\n\nIn the 19th century, a new breed of buccaneering European zoologists obsessed over the creature, pillaging skeletons and fossilised eggs to prove they had discovered the biggest bird on Earth.\n\nBut a study released on Wednesday by British scientists suggests that one species of elephant bird was even larger than previously thought, with a specimen weighing an estimated 860kg - about the same as a fully grown giraffe.\n\n\"They would have towered over people,\" James Hansford, lead author at the Zoological Society of London, told AFP.\n\n\"They definitely couldn't fly as they couldn't have supported anywhere near their weight.\"\n\nIn the study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, Mr Hansford examined elephant bird bones found around the world, feeding their dimensions into a machine-learned algorithm to create a spread of expected animal sizes.\n\nUntil now, the largest-ever elephant bird was described in 1894 by the British scientist C.W. Andrews as Aepyornis titan - a larger species of Aepyornis maximus.\n\nBut a French rival of Andrews dismissed the discovery of titan as just an outsized maximus specimen and for decades the debate remained deadlocked.\n\nMr Hansford said his research proved titan was indeed a different species. But he also found that its bones were so distinct from other elephant bird specimens that titan was in fact an entirely separate genus.\n\nNamed Vorombe titan - Malagasy for \"big bird\" - the creature would have stood at least 3m tall and had an average weight of 650kg, making it the largest bird genus yet uncovered.\n\n\"At the extreme extent, we found one bone that really pushed the limits of what we now understand about bird size,\" said Mr Hansford, referring to the 860kg specimen.\n\n\"And there were some that led up to that too, so it's not an outlier - there was a range of masses that were extraordinarily large.\" .\n\nExtinct, but not forgotten\n\nA close cousin of the now-extinct moa in New Zealand, the elephant bird belonged to the same family of flightless animals that today includes the kiwi, emu and ostrich.\n\nIts petrified eggs still fetch large sums at auction and it stars in Wells' 1895 work Aepyornis Island alongside a pugnacious mercenary named Butcher who improbably ends up living with - and eventually killing - one of the creatures.\n\nDespite having one of the longest existences of any animal in Madagascar - whose isolation from the rest of Africa led to the development of several entirely unique species - the elephant bird died out after a new wave of human settlers arrived around a millenia ago.\n\n\"You start to see large amounts of agricultural settlements and habitat change with burning of forests... that seems to have driven all the megafauna in Madagascar, including the elephant bird, to extinction,\" said Mr Hansford.\n\nFar from being an ancient curiosity, he believes the elephant bird could hold vital clues in how to manage Madagascar's future ecosystem, despite being extinct for 1,000 years.\n\nElephant birds \"probably played the most significant roles in maintaining and developing the landscapes that were natural to Madagascar before humans got there\", he said.\n\n\"We need to understand the role of these animals within these landscapes in order to start regenerating and conserving what we have left.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nScience\n\nArchaeology and anthropology\n\nAnimals", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-elephant-260918.jpg?VersionId=0Xs9Q_aDmZ0ixR3mYMKXwhe63KhgZeBt", "alt_text": null}]}

Three more government services will be moved to the new platform in the coming months.\n\nThe new service will eventually replace the Government's existing TradeXchange and TradeNet platforms. It aims to raise productivity by digitalising the paper trail, boost competitiveness by giving more accurate data analysis and create opportunities for the third-party service providers.\n\nFinance Minister Heng Swee Keat, who launched the NTP at the Orchard Hotel on Wednesday, said the Government had sensed that more needed to be done with previous efforts in TradeNet and TradeXchange.\n\nHe noted that a single trade today can involve numerous parties and documents.\n\n\"Numerous digital solutions have sprung up around the world to address this. But, many of these function as either a purely regulatory or purely commercial platform,\" he said.\n\n\"If we can stitch the disparate standalone systems or digital islands together, and bridge the government agencies and business community, the potential value to the economy is significant and transformational.\"\n\nFirst mentioned in Mr Heng's 2016 Budget speech, the platform went live in December last year, with around 800 companies from various industries joining it to date.\n\nOriginally known as the National Trade Platform, it was renamed at the launch event attended by close to 700 industry representatives from the trade, logistics and the public sector.\n\nThe NTP was developed by the Singapore Customs and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) over four years, and supported by more than 20 ministries, government agencies and working groups.\n\nFirms have to pay a monthly $40 fee to use the platform.\n\nThe Government had conducted discussions and workshops with more than 400 industry experts and 200 organisations, said Dr Tan Kim Siew, co-chair of the National Trade and Logistics Inter-Agency Steering Committee (NTLSC).\n\nMany participants highlighted the industry's paper-based processes, which require time-consuming manual data entry. Coordination with multiple business partners, including banking, insurance and logistics services, also led some traders to develop expensive proprietary digital systems.\n\n\"The NTP must help to achieve paperless trade and greater operational efficiency for our traders. Traders must be able to transact digitally with all their partners,\" said Dr Tan.\n\nThe digital platform can also enable cross-border trade linkages through technology.\n\nMr Heng said the Singapore Customs is currently in discussion with China on linking the trading systems of both nations, and the Netherlands on trade regulatory processes.\n\nAsean member states are also looking into extending its Asean Single Window initiative to transmit more trade documents, achieving greater economic integration and expand intra-Asean and intra-Asia trade, said Mr Heng.\n\nBuilding on the NTP's capabilities, one workgroup is also developing a digital information exchange project to speed up agricultural trade by removing the requirement for traders to print hardcopy certificates, he added.\n\nThe NTP can be found at\n\nwww.ntp.gov.sg\n\n.\n\nSee more on\n\nTrade\n\nHeng Swee Keat", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nm-ntp-2609.jpg?VersionId=3awnhhCUfqTiVMWDdvcrQzxWYSOdYFJC", "alt_text": null}]}

It's done through dialogue,\" Pope Francis told journalists aboard his plane. \"But Rome names (the bishops). The pope names them. That's clear.\"\n\nBeijing and the Vatican last Saturday announced a provisional deal on who appoints bishops in the world's most populous country.\n\nShortly afterwards Pope Francis recognised seven clergy appointed by Beijing, which has not had ties with the Vatican since 1951.\n\nThere are an estimated 12 million Catholics in China, divided between a government-run association whose clergy are chosen by the Communist Party and an unofficial church which swears allegiance to the Vatican.\n\nThe Vatican had not yet released details of the accord and had avoided mentioning the process through which future bishops would be nominated.\n\n'THEY WILL SUFFER'\n\n\"My thoughts are with the resistance, the Catholics who have suffered, it's true,\" the pope said of the Chinese underground church.\n\n\"And they will suffer. There's always suffering in an accord.\"\n\nPope Francis has sought to improve relations with China since he took office in 2013, but previous attempts foundered over Beijing's insistence that the Vatican give up recognition of Taiwan and promise not to interfere in domestic religious issues.\n\nThe Holy See is one of only 17 countries that recognise Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, instead of diplomatic ties with Beijing.\n\nThe breakthrough came as churches were destroyed in some Chinese regions in recent months, and there has been a clampdown on Bible sales. Crosses have been removed from church tops, printed religious materials and holy items confiscated, and church-run kindergartens closed.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the pontiff recognised seven bishops who had been ordained in China without the approval of the Holy See.\n\nThe pope also posthumously recognised an eighth bishop who \"had expressed the desire to be reconciled with the Apostolic See\" before he died last year, it said.\n\nThe Vatican cut ties with Beijing two years after the founding of the communist People's Republic.\n\nSome have warned that Beijing could use the accord to further crack down on Catholic faithful.\n\n\"We pray for the suffering of the few who don't understand or who have behind them so many years of living in secret,\" the pope said.\n\n\"When there is a peace agreement or negotiation, the two sides lose something. That's the rule.\"\n\nThe pope hailed the historic deal that was reached after years of negotiations, despite repeated setbacks.\n\n\"Two steps forward, one back, two steps forward, one back, then months without speaking to each other.

It said escalating claims on the back of fewer accidents could mean only one thing: The accidents were on average more severe, possibly involving more serious injuries.\n\nThe Straits Times understands that more claimants engaging lawyers could be a secondary contributing factor, as claims through legal means were usually bigger.\n\n$291.3m\n\nAmount in incurred motor insurance claims, resulting in an underwriting loss of $12.6 million for the six months to June 30.\n\nAn increased number of in-flated and fraudulent claims could be another contributing factor, sources said.\n\nA bigger pool of private-hire cars - a fairly new phenomenon - had been cited as well.\n\nEarlier this year, statistics from motor insurers showed that private-hire cars - which make up 4.9 per cent of the total vehicle population - accounted for 9.4 per cent of 82,800 accidents reported in the second half of last year.\n\nPassenger cars, which make up 59 per cent of vehicles, accounted for 49.5 per cent of accidents. Taxis, which make up just 2.4 per cent of vehicles, accounted for 13 per cent of accidents.\n\nOn the whole, the general insurance industry saw a marginal 1.1 per cent increase in total gross premiums to $2.07 billion in the first half of this year, GIA said.\n\nUnderwriting profit plunged by 94.5 per cent to $3.14 million \"as claims costs increased significantly across key segments such as motor insurance and work injury compensation insurance\", it said.\n\nWork injury compensation posted an underwriting loss of $6 million - down from a profit of $1.4 million in the first half of 2017.\n\nGIA president Karl Hamann said: \"Our top priorities include working with key stakeholders to reduce the severity and frequency of motor accidents, and leveraging digital technologies... to lower and mitigate claims-costs inflation.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCars\n\nInsurance\n\nAccidents", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/bp_accidents_250918_52.jpg?VersionId=GoF2STJl7TFHGKNNVlR9goYNnlAiv05M", "alt_text": null}]}

They work together on a murder case, where a person of interest was the prime suspect in a prior murder for which the statute of limitations has lapsed. Mogami is deeply invested in the current investigation because of his personal history, setting mentor and mentee on a collision course. Adapted from Shusuke Shizukui's 2013 novel of the same name.\n\nOne of Japanese actor-singer Kimura's best-known roles is as a maverick public prosecutor Kuryu Kohei in Hero. The 2001 television series was the top-rated Japanese show in 25 years and spun off a 2006 miniseries, a second season in 2014 and a movie in 2015.\n\nThe evergreen idol subverts that with a morally greyer role here.

The 4.1m tall wraparound screen encircles the mock-up of the LMV's Integrated Command Centre, providing the 360-degree view.\n\nA variety of simulations can be generated - including harsh weather conditions, system malfunction, high traffic density in congested waters, and the presence of enemy ships - to support training in areas such as berthing, navigation and watch-keeping, and weapon-firing.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Ang Goon Hwee, commanding officer of the simulation centre, said: \"With the high-fidelity projection, training can be conducted in harsh and demanding conditions in a risk-free and controlled setting, so that the trainees can focus on honing their skills to achieve higher competency, resulting in more effective training.\"\n\nIn the past, trainees needed to use different simulators. For berthing training, for instance, the exercise had to be conducted out at sea for four hours and needed a crew of 23. At the new centre, berthing training can be done by four people in one hour.\n\nThe centre also allows for combined training between different teams on the LMV. This could involve teams responsible for the navigation, combat and engineering functions of the ship.\n\nMr Jason Khong, 36, who is from the DSTA, said: \"Any scenarios you can experience out at sea, it can be simulated at the centre. With artificial intelligence, the simulated enemy forces can also be configured to react differently.\"\n\nMr Khong is senior programme manager for the simulation centre.\n\nMilitary Expert 1 Sachael Teo, 24, a marine systems operator on RSS Justice, said that as a junior operator, training at the centre allowed her to gain confidence in overcoming various malfunctions on the LMVs which may occur while out at sea, such as power and propulsion failure.\n\n\"The training at the centre has also allowed me and my shipmates to build our team synergy while responding to different kinds of scenarios,\" she added.\n\nSee more on\n\nSAF\n\nDefence and military", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nm-vessel2-2609.jpg?VersionId=3v9hup..62XCYG4u.szSwKxDCSgMeQH2", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-naval-260918.jpg?VersionId=kxK3sK5LH75Td4..Fh94xhRoXRW_THcW", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-naval01-260918.jpg?VersionId=7iHOU3eoTohUblMWNfprhwFVEbAXwsC3", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-naval03-260918.jpg?VersionId=cPxnbhGWhQT.H8pzJW2Z6V7MPNzNkYPw", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-naval04-260918.jpg?VersionId=9Lu1T8pbyI9tCR.JdgYECCS00u_eR.ql", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The third is the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative.\n\nThe project is meant to be a model of sustainable development for China.\n\nWhen the Eco-city began in 2008, it was a\n\nheavily polluted plot of land\n\nwith severe water shortage problems.\n\nNow, it has transformed into a leafy 30 sq km township with 100,000 residents and more than 7,000 registered companies and institutions.\n\nBut development of the city is not finished, and both sides are now focusing on the city centre and developing a new central business district there.\n\nIn its entirety, the Tianjin Eco-city is also part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region that is being transformed into China's new growth engine, and Chinese leaders have said the Eco-city's experiences will be crucial in creating a more environmentally friendly development model.\n\nLast week, Singapore and China inked a deal during a Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) meeting in Singapore, where they agreed to work together to replicate the Tianjin Eco-city's development experience in both Chinese cities and other Belt and Road regions.\n\nAs part of the anniversary celebrations, a Sino-Singapore Friendship Library will also be launched during Mr Wong's visit.\n\nWith Mr Wong is a delegation comprising Singapore businessmen across various sectors including logistics, innovation and professional services.\n\nHe is also accompanied by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for National Development Sun Xueling, as well as officials from MND, Enterprise Singapore and other agencies involved in the Eco-city project.\n\nSee more on\n\nLawrence Wong\n\nSingapore-China ties\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-eco-260918.jpg?VersionId=Y7q0Rd1JMeoDlTMMEfc3MIMlB8eGkq9I", "alt_text": null}]}

Chaos ensues, and there is a heightened level of suspicion.\n\nWould Singaporeans whose religion is implicated in the attack worry about a backlash against them by people of other religions?\n\nThe Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) report showed that four in five Muslims and non-Muslims feel there would be either no abuse, or very few and isolated incidents of verbal abuse.\n\nOne-third of Singaporeans would even be proactive in expressing solidarity with those whose religion was implicated.\n\nReleased yesterday, the study also found that after an attack, younger respondents were less likely to be suspicious of strangers of the same religion as the over-seas extremist organisation that carried out the terror attack.\n\nThe IPS report follows a survey of just over 2,000 Singaporean respondents conducted last year.\n\nThe study aims to understand how Singaporeans would react following a terror attack in the country perpetrated by organisations that use religious labels, namely Christian, Muslim, Buddhist or Hindu groups.\n\nRespondents were told to imagine that news reports had emerged of a bomb explosion at an MRT station platform, with four hypothetical scenarios - that it was carried out by either an extremist Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or Muslim overseas organisation.\n\nThe study found that Singaporeans would display stronger negative reactions if it had been carried out by a foreign Muslim group than if a Buddhist, Christian or Hindu group had been behind it.\n\nThe study found that most Singaporeans feel it would take two to three years for the country to recover from an attack.\n\nAsked how long it would take for most Singaporeans to feel united as one people, Muslim respondents indicated 3.62 years on average, the longest among the four religions.\n\n\"The findings suggest that Muslims may be more conscious of the potential backlash and suspicions that would inevitably arise within Singapore as a result of a terror attack,\" the researchers said.\n\nHowever, they added it was noteworthy that a third of non-Muslims would be proactive in expressing solidarity in such circumstances, and they would even let others know they do not associate Muslims with such terror attacks.\n\nBut few would join a campaign or event that recognises that people of a particular religion are not the cause of the terror attack.\n\nAbout a quarter of non-Muslims surveyed would do so, in the case of an attack by foreign Muslim groups.\n\n\"Still, it is encouraging that a quarter of non-Muslims would go out of their way to join such activities to show their support for Muslim Singaporeans,\" the researchers said.\n\nLim Min Zhang\n\nSee more on\n\nTerrorism", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/colin-ga2-25.jpg?VersionId=f4.eFilgQDAHnTp75Af6t2xD0nCWi2aQ", "alt_text": null}]}

Did she run away from home? Was she abducted? As he desperately digs into her online life for clues, he discovers things about her that he didn't know and realises they have drifted apart after the death of his wife from cancer. Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing) is the detective on the case.\n\nOn paper, Searching doesn't sound like a very promising proposition. How exciting can it be to view an entire movie unfold on the screens of computers and mobile devices?\n\nBut actually, a 2015 episode had already put the \"modern\" in the sitcom Modern Family by taking place entirely on a character's laptop screen as she switched among video calls, web browsers and social media applications.\n\nImpressive as that was, it was a 22-minute episode.

Yes. But does it work? Absolutely.\n\nIn the first place, director and co-writer Aneesh Chaganty's story is solid, with twists and turns nicely paced out to keep one hooked.\n\nHe then elevates it with an audacious storytelling style, one that makes perfect sense for the plot. It is worth pointing out that the concept is plausibly sustained throughout. Even a key confrontation that might not be normally caught on tape was reasonably captured on hidden cameras.\n\nCho, from the Harold & Kumar comedies (2004, 2008 and 2011), is billed as the first Asian-American actor to headline a mainstream Hollywood thriller. He does a fine job as he goes from being mildly annoyed at his daughter for not taking out the trash to frenzied frustration when she disappears. An uncharacteristically plain-looking Debra Messing from the sitcom Will & Grace (1998 to 2006, 2017 to present) also leaves an impression as a no-nonsense cop.\n\nImpressively, this is Indian-American film-maker Aneesh Chaganty's directorial debut, which won the Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film Prize and NEXT Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in January.\n\nAs David examines the digital footprint of Margot, he is forced to confront an uncomfortable question: How well do I know my child? It's a question that's more resonant than ever when kids have their own social accounts and one has no idea whom they might be interacting with. The scarier thought is, maybe they don't know either.\n\nIn tapping into anxieties about parenting and technology, Searching is very much a movie of our time.\n\nSee more on\n\nMovie review\n\nReviews", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/ak_johncho_2609.jpg?VersionId=YJuEz1gm91HKeCw3OW.2kQS5_orMTNdE", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

It is led by the IMDA.\n\nThere are 31 tech companies accredited under the programme today, including local data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and cyber-security firms.\n\nPrudential's senior vice-president and head of its strategic engagements transformation Kalai Natarajan said customers who seek insurance already expect insurers to provide digital services, but the industry is generally slow on the uptake.\n\n\"Customers want their lounge room experience - watching Netflix and ordering food online. They want that exact same experience when buying insurance. I've got 50-year-old friends who say, if you can't sell it to me on a mobile app, don't even bother,\" said Ms Kalai.\n\nInsurance technologies include AI-powered insurance assistants, phone apps that can streamline the insurance buying process, and the use of blockchain technology to carry out transactions.\n\nA global trend study on AI by Tata Consultancy Services last year found that the insurance industry outspent all other industries on AI, investing on average US$124 million (S$169 million) in AI systems, compared with a cross-industry average of US$70 million. The data is gathered from 835 executives across 13 industries.\n\nIMDA's chief industry development officer Howie Lau said: \"Some solutions can be found only by doing, because (many companies) are at a stage where they cannot simply cut and paste solutions from somewhere else.\n\n\"These solutions may not be so obvious now, but partnerships can result in people finding a new path, adapting technology in an interesting way.\"\n\nA pipeline of more than 1,500 public and private-sector projects, worth around $260 million, has been created since the programme started four years ago.

It is alleged that hundreds of millions of dollars ended up in his personal bank accounts. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges\n\ndenies any wrongdoing\n\n.\n\nMadam Rosmah's love of costly overseas shopping trips, designer handbags and jewellery made her a lightning rod for public anger, and fuelled suspicions that she benefited from the plundering of 1MDB.\n\nAfter the election loss, a stash of cash, jewellery and hundreds of designer handbags worth as much as US$273 million was seized from properties linked to Najib in raids around Kuala Lumpur.\n\nNajib had said most of the items seized from his houses were gifts to his wife and daughter and had nothing to do with 1MDB.\n\nNajib and his wife have both been barred from leaving the country and their home and other properties linked to them have been searched by the police as part of the 1MDB investigations.\n\nMadam Rosmah is often compared to Imelda Marcos, who left behind more than a thousand pairs of shoes after her husband, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, was ousted in 1986.

It's good for peace and it's good for the shape of the international price of oil,\" said Mr Macron.\n\nFrance and other European powers are setting up a way to allow businesses to keep doing business in Iran in hopes of avoiding sanctions by the US.\n\nThe French President was due to hold talks later in the day with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, who has refused to meet Mr Trump.\n\nDespite their vastly differing world views, Mr Macron and Mr Trump - both political outsiders who defied the odds in winning power - have forged an unlikely relationship.\n\nAfter meeting Mr Macron on Monday, Mr Trump said the two men have had \"some very good experiences\" but acknowledged, \"on occasion not so good, but 99 per cent very good\".\n\nAnd after Mr Trump's latest espousal of his \"America First\" foreign policy, Mr Macron again painted himself as an upholder of a more internationalist approach to diplomacy.\n\n\"Do not accept the erosion of multilateralism,\" Mr Macron told the gathering on Tuesday. \"Don't accept our history unravelling. I'm not getting used to it and I'm not turning my head,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nFrance\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUN", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/nz-macron-260918.jpg?VersionId=K5FoGXnr3flGDQmdtpGAPmF_YaYiEx7V", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

In all, he is accused of receiving more than $107,000. The charges include:\n\n\u2022 Remittances to his mistress Xu Hongmei in China totalling $30,600;\n\n\u2022 Getting a discount of about $13,500 for a Toyota Corolla Altis he bought via an arrangement involving a 19-NS2 director;\n\n\u2022 Entertainment expenses of close to $53,000 at various KTV lounges and massage parlours which Wong frequented with a 19-ANC director; and\n\n\u2022 Getting a subcontractor of the two companies to employ his daughter-in-law Le Thi Hien. 19-ANC paid more than $8,200 towards her salary between March and August 2016.\n\nCourt documents show 11 tenders and quotations were awarded to 19-ANC and 19-NS2 between September 2014 and July 2016. These were for:\n\n\u2022 Removal of a clock tower, trees and reinstatement works at Cheng San-Seletar Division(September 2014);\n\n\u2022 Repair and redecoration (R&R) works for 17 blocks of Housing Board flats in Ang Mo Kio (October 2014);\n\n\u2022 Construction of a community garden near Block 533 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 (June 2015);\n\n\u2022 Construction of a community garden between Block 570 and Block 572 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 (June 2015);\n\n\u2022 R&R works for seven carpark blocks in Sengkang West Division (August 2015);\n\n\u2022 R&R works for 25 blocks of flats and two market and hawker centres in Cheng San-Seletar Division (August 2015);\n\n\u2022 R&R works for 11 blocks of flats in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 (December 2015);\n\n\u2022 Supply of eco-incense burner in Ang Mo Kio Town Council (December 2015);\n\n\u2022 Supply of eco-incense burner (May 2016);\n\n\u2022 Construction of a community garden near Block 307D Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 (July 2016); and\n\n\u2022 Supply and replacement of seating facilities at the void decks of Block 426 to 429 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 (July 2016).\n\nIn a statement to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), Wong, who became general manager of the town council in 2013, said Chia and his associate would often offer to pick up the tab when they went drinking as they wanted to cultivate good relations.\n\n\"I know that I should not have let them pay or even gone drinking with them, but I was very troubled at the point in time as I was facing problems in my marriage,\" Wong added in his statement to CPIB chief special investigator Jeffrey Tan, the first witness to take the stand yesterday.\n\nWong said he would try to pay the bills as well and did so several times. He added that he did not go drinking with other contractors.\n\nOther alleged benefits he received included a $13,500 discount on a car he bought via an arrangement involving Ms Yip Fong Yin, another 19-NS2 Enterprise director.\n\nWhile he told CPIB the discount was due to the high mileage the car had clocked, Wong conceded this typically knocked $1,000 or so off the price, rather than over $10,000.\n\nWong is also said to have taken bribes in the form of remittances totalling $30,600 that was sent to his mistress in China,\n\namong other charges.\n\nHe met his mistress Xu Hongmei in 2015 when she was working in Singapore. When she travelled back to China, the single mother asked him for financial help, like paying renovation bills.\n\nWhen Wong told Chia about these issues, Chia said he would help to settle them. The court also heard that Wong was in China with Chia on two occasions in 2016, during which he visited Ms Xu and got to know Chia's supplier for eco-friendly incense paper burners. Wong told CPIB he did not declare the visits, which were made in his personal capacity.\n\nIn another statement in October 2016, Wong said he felt obligated to Chia's firms, and wanted to help them using his authority at work.\n\nIn a town council tender for incense burners, for example, he told a colleague to focus on the environmental aspects, knowing that although 19-ANC was the fourth-lowest bidder, it would get a high-quality rating for environment factors and be likely to win the tender.\n\nBut the next month, Wong told CPIB his earlier statement was incorrect and he had not been in the right state of mind because of his daughter's impending wedding.\n\nHis lawyer Melanie Ho of WongPartnership asked Mr Tan, who took Wong's statement, if he may have decided not to fight the allegations earlier owing to \"family pressures\". Mr Tan disagreed.\n\nChia's lawyer Michael Loh of Clifford Law suggested Wong could have made the statements to CPIB out of fear.

We are here to attack,\" Pogba told the media after the match.\n\n\"I think teams are scared when they see Manchester United attacking and attacking. That was our mistake.\"\n\nPogba has already been linked with a move away from Old Trafford with Barcelona interested before the close of the summer transfer window.\n\nThat speculation is unlikely to die down as long as Mourinho, who signed a extended contract until 2020 earlier this year, remains in charge.\n\nSee more on\n\nEPL\n\nManchester United\n\nJose Mourinho", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/26/2018-09-22t160241z_901814065_rc1923973600_rtrmadp_3_soccer-england-mun-wlv.jpg?VersionId=hPALOGyfkAsCa7Y8YiLOlEOf0zHWgUrm", "alt_text": null}]}

This empowers them to grow and succeed holistically.\n\nLearning by doing\n\nFor instance, JCU's Tropical Marine Ecology and Coastal Impacts module in Bachelor of Business and Environmental Science involves a 10-day field trip in Phuket, Thailand.\n\nDr Neil Hutchinson, a senior lecturer in environmental science, explains: \"As the subject focuses on the ecology of marine organisms and impacts on marine coastal assemblages in the Andaman Sea, the students need to see this first-hand by physically interacting with the environment.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

These allow the students to assess the impact of formal protection on these ecosystems.\n\nIn the evenings, there are lectures, presentations and group research projects to work on.\n\nStudents are required to write a project report after the field trip, which carries more weightage than the exam. This allows them to develop a deeper appreciation for the subject matter, and better contextualise their knowledge and experience in the real world.\n\nDr Hutchinson says: \"The field trip provides real-world learning that enables students to develop the skills and confidence necessary to quickly synthesise ideas, critically evaluate information from a range of sources and apply their learning in a flexible, holistic manner to solve real-life situations.\"\n\nReal-life impact\n\nDesigned for students who have previously taken at least one cultural anthropology subject in Bachelor of Arts (Majoring in Psychology Studies), JCU's Tropical Philanthropy project led by associate professor Anita Lundberg engages students and alumni in international field practice during short voluntary trips in Southeast Asia.\n\nProf Lundberg says: \"Anthropology is important as it helps students to be aware of ethnocentrism, or the mindset that one's own culture is normal or better, and get past it.\n\n\"This relates directly to volunteering on projects, as we need to move away from any notion that we are somehow superior.\"\n\nAs such, the Tropical Philanthropy module offers insights into local sustainable fair-practice projects for each trip. Such projects put the needs identified by locals first, for enterprises run by locals - for local people.\n\nSome of the partners include the Big Brother Mouse literacy programme in Laos; the Tanoti heritage craft centre in Sarawak; and the Bali Mountain Retreat, a sustainable culture and nature retreat.\n\nThe module gives students the opportunity to interact with local people, and learn about their culture, heritage, architecture, cuisine, arts and environment practices.\n\nIt also provides a good gauge of a student's endurance, technical skills, knowledge and intercultural understanding.\n\nAfter the field trips, students are required to share their experiences through social media, a photographic exhibition and public lecture- all of which involve teamwork and bonding over shared experiences.\n\nCome see for yourself\n\nThe Singapore campus of James Cook University (149 Sims Drive, Singapore 387380) will be holding an Admissions Day on Oct 6 from 10am to 4pm.\n\nFor more information, visit\n\nhttp://jcu.sg/adday10\n\nProf Lundberg says the Tropical Philanthropy field trips prepare students for life and a world of work. No matter what career path they choose, they will learn about \"teamwork, self-motivation, responsibility and intercultural awareness\".\n\nShe adds: \"During the field trips, students gain a sense of the importance of reciprocity - that is, giving, receiving and giving back.

Preparing for longevity in Singapore, polled 1,214 residents in March this year. It is commissioned by insurer Prudential.\n\n\"People are just not saving enough for retirement,\" said Mr Laurence Lien, chairman of the Lien Foundation, whose expert opinion was sought for the report. \"If they are planning for 84 or 88, rather than 90 or 94, they are in for a shock.\"\n\nIn fact, about three in four respondents in EIU's survey said they are not financially ready or they do not know if they are financially ready for life until 100.\n\nSurvey results showed that 8 per cent of the respondents expect to rely entirely on their salaries after they turn 62 while 44 per cent expect to rely significantly on their salaries. Some 33 per cent said they would rely somewhat on their salaries, and the remaining 15 per cent said they will not rely on their salaries at all.\n\nWhen asked to what extent do they expect to rely on wages for their lives after 62, respondents ranked salaries 4th, after cash savings, the CPF and national medical insurance schemes.\n\nChief executive of Prudential Singapore Wilf Blackburn said on Tuesday (Sept 25) that the research findings come as Singaporeans are living longer, underscoring the importance of financial planning.\n\n\"Our intent with (the report) is to get people to reimagine life... and how do we plan to spend it,\" Mr Blackburn said.\n\nFor example, \"forming the ability to keep reskilling and learning new things and staying relevant is going to be the most important way that people are going to insure themselves\", he added.\n\nAccording to Population.sg, an online initiative by the National Population and Talent Division, 1,100 Singaporeans lived to at least 100 in 2015, a rise from the 50 in 1950.\n\nA World Health Organisation report last year stated that the average life expectancy at birth for Singaporeans is 83.1 years, third longest in the world, after the Japanese and the Swiss.\n\nBesides financial well-being, the report covered factors such as health, relationships and work, as these are areas that \"are known to contribute to the length and quality of (people's) years\".\n\n\"Living to 100 presents both opportunities and issues to be overcome,\" said Mr Blackburn.\n\n\"It offers us the promise of being with our loved ones, pursuing work and enjoying lifestyle activities for much longer... at the same time, it requires us to be more self-aware and proactive,\" he added.\n\nSee more on\n\nInsurance\n\nFinancial planning", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/colin-rp-25.jpg?VersionId=5iMFMQyiQhh0XXNdWSG4AV4fimp9ohC_", "alt_text": null}]}

Otherwise, there will be a price to pay.\n\nFrom January next year, errant users will be charged $5 by licensed operators each time they park these bicycles indiscriminately. Those who offend at least three times in a calendar year can be banned from using shared bicycle services for as long as 12 months.\n\nThe moves are part of a framework, announced in March, to tackle the problem of indiscriminate parking in which industry players as well as users will have to play their part.\n\nTo make sure that users park their shared bicycles properly, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said yesterday that it will start installing Quick Response (QR) codes at public bicycle parking places from the end of this month.\n\nAt the end of their trip, users will have to scan the QR code, before leaving the bike there, to show it has been parked properly. They will fall foul of the new regulations if they do not.\n\nWhile this regime will kick in from January, the LTA will launch a public education campaign from next month to teach shared-bike users about ending their trip by using the QR codes.\n\nMeanwhile, the authority is ramping up bicycle parking capacity islandwide, and has added 7,000 bicycle parking spaces since the start of the year to the 207,000 existing ones. It aims to have 267,000 parking spaces by 2020.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Several of those women spoke to reporters in the rain outside the courtroom.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

There was no visible reaction from the disgraced entertainer as he learnt his fate.\n\n\"Equal justice under the law does not allow different treatment because of who he is or who he was,\" Judge O'Neill said.\n\nCosby cemented his family-friendly reputation playing the affable Dr Cliff Huxtable in the 1980s television comedy The Cosby Show.\n\n\"He hid behind Dr Cliff Huxtable,\" Mr Kevin Steele, the county district attorney who led the prosecution, told reporters afterwards. \"Before he was taken away in handcuffs, a lot of people believed this was who he was. We know otherwise.\"\n\nAfter the sentencing, Mr Andrew Wyatt, Cosby's spokesman, read a lengthy statement in which he decried what he called \"the most racist and sexist trial in the history of the United States\".\n\nSEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR\n\nJudge O'Neill also decided to designate Cosby a \"sexually violent predator\" under Pennsylvania law.\n\nUnder that designation, Cosby will have to undergo monthly counselling and register as a sex offender with police for the rest of his life. Neighbours and schools will be notified of his address, certain movements and crimes, as will Ms Constand.\n\nWhen prosecutors told Cosby in court he would not have to inform Ms Constand of his movements himself but that a proxy would do so, he replied: \"Good!\"\n\nCosby has denied any wrongdoing. Asked if he wanted to address the court with a statement before sentencing, Cosby declined through his lawyers. His lawyers had asked that Cosby be placed under house arrest, citing his age and frailty.\n\nMore than 50 women have accused Cosby of sexual abuse going back decades, with most complaints too old to prosecute. The Constand case was the only allegation that led to criminal charges.\n\nMs Constand said in a written statement submitted to the court on Monday that the attack had turned her into a woman who was \"stuck in a holding pattern for most of her adult life, unable to heal fully or to move forward\".\n\n\"Bill Cosby took my beautiful, healthy young spirit and crushed it,\" she wrote.\n\nCosby's first trial in 2017 ended in a mistrial when jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict.\n\nPrison officials will process Cosby at the nearby state prison in Schwenksville before determining in which of Pennsylvania's 22 male prisons he will serve his sentence, prison spokesman Amy Worden wrote in an e-mail.\n\nHe will be one of 86 inmates over age 80 held by Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections, where the two oldest inmates are both 91, Ms Worden said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSex offences\n\nUS crime\n\nBill Cosby", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Harsher sanctions on Iran's oil and banking sector are expected in November.\n\n\"The economic war that the United States has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions not only targets the Iranian people but also entails harmful repercussions for the people of other countries, and that war has caused a disruption in the state of global trade,\" Rouhani said.\n\n\"What Iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfillment of obligations.\"\n\nMounting pressure from the Trump administration combined with discontent among many Iranians at the state of the economy are rattling the Islamic Republic, with little sign that its leaders have the answers, officials and analysts say.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Iran has blamed US sanctions for the currency's fall, saying the measures amount to a \"political, psychological and economic\" war on Teheran.\n\n'THREAT FOR THREAT'\n\nTo pile on the pain, Washington says all countries must end crude imports from Iran by Nov 4, hitting the oil sales that generate 60 per cent of the country's income. Iran says this level of cuts will never happen.\n\nTehran has suggested it could take military action in the Gulf to block other countries' oil exports in retaliation for US sanctions intended to halt its sales of crude. Washington maintains a fleet in the Gulf that protects oil shipping routes.\n\n\"The security of the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz has always been important for us... we will confront any and all disruptive efforts in this critical waterway in the future,\" said Rouhani.\n\nThe Strait of Hormuz is a strategic artery linking Middle East crude producers to key markets in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and beyond. A third of the world's seaborne oil passes through the strait in southern Iran.\n\nTrump, in his annual UN speech, said he would keep up economic pressure on Teheran to try to force a change in its behaviour. But Rouhani said Iran had no intention of succumbing to the US pressure.\n\n\"The United States' understanding of international relations is authoritarian... Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition,\" Rouhani said.\n\n\"No state and nation can be brought to the negotiating table by force,\" said the pragmatist president, adding that Iran did not want any war.\n\n\"Our proposal is clear: commitment for commitment; violation for violation; threat for threat; and step for step, instead of talk for talk,\" he said.\n\nRouhani expressed Iran's willingness to improve ties with the regional countries.

Rather, the R stands for rangefinder.\n\nThe GFX 50R sports a more traditional rangefinder design that is 25mm thinner and 145g lighter than the GFX 50S. But it uses the same 51.4-megapixel medium-format (43.8mm x 32.9mm) image sensor and X-Processor Pro image processor as the GFX 50S.\n\nIn addition, the GFX 50R retains the same solid build and weather-sealing as well as features a 3.69-million-dot electronic viewfinder, 3.2-inch touchscreen display and dual SD card slots with support for UHS-II cards. The GFX 50R will be available in Singapore in Nov for $6,999 (body only).\n\nAt the same time, Fujifilm also announced the development of a mouth-watering 100-megapixel medium-format mirrorless camera - GFX 100. It will be equipped with a whopping 102-megapixel medium-format image sensor and Fujifilm's fourth-generation X-Processor 4.\n\nFujifilm claims that GFX 100 will be the world's first medium-format mirrorless camera to feature an image sensor with phase detection pixels across the entire sensor, in-body image stabilisation system and 4K video recording.\n\nPreviously, Fujifilm is famed for its X-series APS-C mirrorless cameras. But it looks like Fujifilm is giving full-frame the miss and moving towards medium-format instead.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

One Israeli soldier has been killed in that time.\n\nIsrael says its actions are necessary to defend the border and accuses Hamas of using the protests as cover to attempt infiltrations and attacks.\n\nPalestinians and human rights groups say protesters have been shot while posing no real threat.\n\nEnvoy Mladenov and Egyptian officials have been seeking to broker a long-term truce between Israel and Hamas, but those efforts have stalled in recent weeks.\n\nSee more on\n\nPalestine\n\nEconomic growth", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/colin-gaza-25.jpg?VersionId=rXMD68_PWBgtLu2gdJt93V0jfHHWFnrF", "alt_text": null}]}

I've always treated women with dignity and respect,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process.\"\n\nHis reputation took another blow, however, when his former Yale roommate James Roche said he believed Ramirez.\n\nKavanaugh was a \"notably heavy drinker\" in school who \"became aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk,\" Roche said.\n\nWhile he did not witness the incident alleged by Ramirez, Roche said Kavanaugh and his social circle \"were capable\" of such actions.\n\n\"I believe her to be unusually honest and straightforward and I cannot imagine her making this up.\"\n\nELECTION LOOMING\n\nWith the election looming and their control of Congress at stake, Republicans have been mindful of the pitfalls of alienating women voters by their handling of the accusations against Kavanaugh.\n\nBut Republican committee members and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell also have made clear that they will question the women's memories and lack of witnesses or evidence.\n\n\"The American people know that sexual misconduct is gravely serious,\" McConnell said Tuesday.\n\n\"But the American people also insist that vague, unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations of 30-plus-year-old misconduct, where all of the supposed witnesses either totally deny it or can't confirm it, is nowhere near grounds to nullify someone's career or destroy their good name.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders echoed Trump's claim that the Democrats are playing games with Kavanaugh.\n\n\"The process that the Democrats have played is absolutely disgusting.

Mr Leonard Lim, research associate at IPS, and Ms Shanthini Selvarajan, research assistant at IPS, are co-authors.\n\nSingaporeans were asked to respond to a scenario in which news reports of a bomb exploding on an MRT station platform had emerged, with the incident killing 15 people and wounding 40.\n\nThey were further told that authorities had confirmed the identity of those behind the terror attack, with four scenarios: that it was either an extremist Buddhist; Muslim; Christian; or Hindu overseas organisation that was responsible.\n\nIf the attack was by a Muslim group, 48 per cent of respondents were quite or very likely to be suspicious of a Muslim stranger walking around in their neighbourhood.\n\nThis compared to 40 per cent for Buddhists and Hindus, and 35 per cent for Christians.\n\nLess-educated respondents, or those less well-off as measured by housing types, were also more likely to show less trust and openness after an attack.\n\nAcross most of the survey findings, those residing in one- and two-room Housing Board flats fared differently from those residing in three- to five-room flats, executive apartments and private housing.\n\n\"This is indicative of the exclusion those at the extreme end of the socio-economic status may be experiencing, which fuels their prejudices and biases,\" said the report.\n\nIt added that this minority group may not be receiving full access to programmes that promote multiculturalism and interracial interaction.\n\nThe study also found \"substantial levels of mistrust\" between races in Singapore, especially by the majority Chinese community of the minority Malays and Indians.\n\nThis was measured by asking respondents what proportion of people of each race they thought would return their wallet if they had dropped it in a shopping mall.\n\nA majority of Chinese respondents said they could not trust Indian and Malay people to hand it back; they were more likely to trust a fellow Chinese person to return it.\n\nHowever, non-Muslims who had more interracial interaction in the previous two years - such as friendships or shared cultural experiences with Malays - were less likely to display Islamophobic tendencies after an attack by a foreign Muslim group.\n\nThey were also more likely to express solidarity with Muslims after such an incident.\n\nThe researchers added: \"This suggests that efforts to deepen understanding and integration among different communities in Singapore, through events in the grassroots, schools and other such organisations, should continue as the country seeks to build up social ballast before any terror attack.\"\n\nDr Mathews said: \"The survey is of course limited in that we cannot predict with certainty how any of us will actually feel if such a terror incident occurred, and our level of anger and anxiety.\n\n\"However, this study at least gives us an indication, at a time when everything is peaceful, about whether there are already some gaps in our social cohesion.\"\n\nThe survey of Singapore citizens, conducted by consumer research firm Media Research Consultants and funded by Mediacorp, questioned 1,016 Chinese people, 504 Malays, and 511 whose ethnicity was classified as Indian or others.\n\nThe youngest participant was 21, with 15 per cent of respondents aged over 65.\n\nData was collected from surveys carried out between April 21 and May 24 last year.\n\nSee more on\n\nTerrorism", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/colin-gi2-25.jpg?VersionId=bJ3xai1CbvLXDHp2JZKxWjlWqYZIzGx4", "alt_text": null}]}

Hindu; Buddhist; or Muslim overseas organisation.\n\nThe study found that Singaporeans would display stronger negative reactions if it had been carried out by a foreign Muslim group than if a Buddhist, Christian or Hindu group had been behind it.\n\nEven so, less than half believe members of their own racial community would be suspicious or angry at people of a particular religion associated with an overseas extremist organisation of the same religion in the aftermath of a terror attack.\n\n\"This is indicative of some level of inter-religious solidarity in Singapore,\" said the team of researchers led by Dr Mathew Mathews, senior research fellow at the IPS.\n\nThe study found most Singaporeans feel it would take two to three years for the country to recover from an attack.\n\nAnd this, in part, could be due to concerns that there may be lingering doubt.\n\nAsked how long it would take for most Singaporeans to feel united as one people, Muslim respondents indicated 3.62 years on average, the longest of the four religions.\n\n\"The findings suggest that Muslims may be more conscious of the potential backlash and suspicions that would inevitably arise within Singapore, as a result of a terror attack,\" the researchers said.\n\nHowever, they added it was noteworthy that a third of non-Muslims would be pro-active in expressing solidarity in such circumstances, and they would even let others know they do not associate Muslims with such terror attacks.\n\nBut few would join a campaign or event that recognises that people of a particular religion are not the cause of the terror attack.\n\nAbout a quarter of non-Muslims surveyed would do so, in the case of an attack by overseas Muslims.\n\n\"Still, it is encouraging that a quarter of non-Muslims would go out of their way to join such activities, to show their support for Muslim Singaporeans,\" the researchers said.\n\nSee more on\n\nTerrorism", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/colin-ga2-25.jpg?VersionId=f4.eFilgQDAHnTp75Af6t2xD0nCWi2aQ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

To date, the total amount of Chinese goods subject to additional tariffs has reached US$250 billion (S$341.3 billion)\uff0daccounting for 49.4 per cent of China's total exports to the United States in 2017.\n\nAt this critical moment of intensifying trade tensions between China and the United States, I, as chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce (CGCC)\uff0dUSA, the largest non-profit organisation representing more than 1,500 Chinese enterprises with established presence and investments in the US, strongly urge the US administration to be prudent and practical in its decisions on trade and cherish the hard-won gains made since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US.\n\nTrump should look to the future and make responsible decisions that benefit the people of both countries and stabilise the world economy. The CGCC strongly urges the Trump administration to de-escalate the trade conflict and return to a principled policy of cooperation and development.\n\nBETTER CHERISH THE GAINS OF PAST FOUR DECADES\n\nNext year marks the 40th anniversary of the normalisation of diplomatic relations between the US and China. The past almost 40 years have been, on the whole, a period of constructive progress. Back in the 1970s, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, and former US presidents Richard Nixon and Gerard Ford visited China. Together with then Chinese leaders Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, the leaders of the two countries laid a solid foundation for the normalisation of China-US relations, which has yielded enormous benefits to the world.\n\nThe \"ping pong diplomacy\" had then become a global story. In 1979, late leader Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's economic reform, visited the US and met with former US president Jimmy Carter, which helped develop a blueprint for bilateral relations. Inspired by the advanced productivity of the US, Deng was determined to push forward economic reform and opening-up in China.\n\nAs a result, large numbers of Chinese students were sent to the US for higher education. This opening-up was the prelude to more intimate exchanges between the Chinese and American peoples. After China officially joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001, both countries have made significant progress in exchanges and cooperation in trade and investment, science and technology, culture and education, and joint military exercises.\n\nToday, the Sino-US relationship has become one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world. Peaceful cooperation between the two countries plays a vital role in the prosperity of the global economy. The combined GDP of China and the US represents close to 40 per cent of the world economy. The bilateral trade volume has grown from less than US$100 million in 1972 to US$674.5 billion in 2017, with each side being the largest trading partner to the other.\n\nHowever, Trump has been dissatisfied with the US' trade deficit with China since the beginning of his presidential campaign, and has adopted various anti-free market policies and taken a more confrontational approach toward China after taking office. In fact, in terms of service trade with China, the US has always had a trade surplus. In addition, most of China's exports to the US are relatively low-end products, such as the products assembled from the parts procured in the global market. These cost-effective processes and products have benefited American consumers and businesses alike, and saved substantial sums in cost expenditures.\n\nPUNITIVE TARIFFS WILL HURT US CONSUMERS\n\nIf the US wishes to narrow the trade gap, it should try to achieve this goal by taking advantage of China's deepening reform to further expand US exports of goods and services to China, instead of imposing unnecessary and punitive tariffs on Chinese products, which most experts and business leaders agree will only bring harm to the interests of US consumers and businesses.\n\nAs a matter of fact, before the tariff war began early this year, the US-China Business Council expected US exports of goods and services to China to double by 2026, reaching a total of US$369 billion, and further expand to US$520 billion by 2050. Conversely, after years of rapid growth, China is now more of a \"consumption-driven\" than an \"investment-driven\" economy. Indeed, China has become the largest consumer market in the world this year. And given its current course, it is expected to catch up with or surpass the US in terms of total retail sales.\n\nChinese consumers have demonstrated strong purchasing power in both domestic and overseas markets, as the country's consumer power upgrades and expands on the world stage, creating unprecedented opportunities to companies in the US and other countries around the world. Also, prior to this year, bilateral direct investment between China and the US had been booming. Certain cost advantages and production factors in the US, such as land, electricity, raw materials, and transportation and logistics, have attracted an increasing number of Chinese enterprises to invest in greenfield projects in the US, creating considerable employment opportunities for the US market. By the end of 2017, China's direct investment in the US totalled US$140 billion, creating more than 200,000 direct employment opportunities and indirectly supporting over 1 million jobs.\n\nChina's largest meat processor, Shuanghui Group, has acquired Smithfield Foods, the largest US pork producer. With significant investments in Smithfield Foods to boost the production and exports of meat products\uff0dto China to meet the needs of Chinese consumers\uff0dthis investment has contributed to US economic growth and job creation. Other Chinese manufacturers, including Chinese conglomerates such as Shandong Yuhuang Chemical, Wanxiang Group, Keer Group, Jushi Group, BYD, Tianjin Pipe, and Fuyao Glass, have successively extended their businesses to the US, building factories and hiring local workers to better serve the local markets.\n\nCHINESE FIRMS WELCOMED BY US COMMUNITIES\n\nSuch initiatives by Chinese companies have been warmly welcomed and embraced by the local governments, communities, employees and their families in the US, creating a win-win situation for all stakeholders, which is in stark contrast to Trump's strident rhetoric against China.\n\nAt the Boao Forum for Asia in April, President Xi Jinping said that China will further open up its economy to foreign companies. In terms of the service industry, especially with respect to the finance industry, China pledged to ease foreign investment curbs on sectors such as banking, securities, and insurance.\n\nMore specifically, China will accelerate the opening-up of its insurance industry, as well as ease the requirements of foreign financial institutions to set up operations and expand their business scope in China, encouraging greater cooperation between Chinese and foreign financial markets. The opening-up of China's financial market would certainly provide excellent opportunities for US financial companies to further participate in the Chinese market, especially because the US enjoys many competitive advantages in financial services.\n\nIt is my belief and that of many others that the decision by the US government to impose tariffs on another US$200 billion of Chinese goods will do serious damage to Sino-US economic and trade relations, quite possibly irreparably harming the close and complementary trade partnership between the two countriesthat was formed and has been maintained by generations of leaders of both countries with great care, profound vision, and mutual trust.\n\nUS ACTION WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE DAMAGE\n\nA more likely outcome is not what minor or even temporary benefits the trade war initiated by the US will bring, but at what cost and what major losses to the overall economic development of both China and the US, as well as the world at large.\n\nThroughout history, economic and social crises caused by bias and impulsiveness of key policymakers are not a rare occurrence. China has traditionally been an advocate of the golden mean and a believer in harmony in diversity. The US had been advocating free trade and a market-driven economy rather than trade protectionism for many years.\n\nPractice over the past 40 years has proved that Chinese and American cultures can coexist, and economic and trade cooperation between China and the US is not only a natural outgrowth of the comparative advantages of the two countries, but also the optimal choice of international industrial specialisation and global resource allocation.\n\nWhile maintaining healthy levels of competition is necessary, cooperation and trust should be the main theme between China and the US. History has proven that only a healthy and stable Sino-US economic and trade relationship can benefit both countries and the rest of the world.\n\nThe author is chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce\uff0dUSA, and president and CEO of Bank of China USA.\n\nChina Daily is a member of The Straits Times media partner Asia News Network, an alliance of 23 news media organisations.\n\nSee more on\n\nThe Asian Voice\n\nChina\n\nUS-China ties", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/colin-usf-25.jpg?VersionId=9NOcjaPHMK0CM31WfXmW3rP33f6g.mnz", "alt_text": null}]}

Since Sept 19, exporters are required to provide assurance that their exports are free from metal contaminants in order for export permits to be approved.\"\n\nExamples of measures to ensure this are metal detection and X-ray screening, she added.\n\nFairPrice said its move to halt the imports is a precautionary measure as the authorities here have not issued any recall for strawberries from Australia.\n\n\"Australian strawberries from previous batches of imports remain available on our shelves but will not be replenished when they are sold out,\" said a FairPrice spokesman. \"We (will) continue to monitor the situation closely, and our food safety protocols and procedures are also in place should we need to recall any products, in compliance with the authorities' advisories.\"\n\nThe spokesman added that strawberry sales have slowed by about 10 per cent since reports of the sabotaged strawberries surfaced.

His trainer, Immanuel Paulus, said: \"The guy with the pillow, we love you. We might need it for the other corner on fight night.\n\n\"But it's a good place to put the belt once we win it, so there'll be no scratches when we bring it back to Namibia.\"\n\nThe pillow stunt was the highlight of an otherwise respectful press conference.\n\nRidhwan noted the credentials of his opponent - Ambunda is a former IBO and World Boxing Organisation (WBO) world champion - and said he expected a tough test on Saturday.\n\nThe IBO is considered the biggest organisation in boxing outside the traditional big four of the WBO, World Boxing Association, International Boxing Federation, World Boxing Council.\n\nWinning the world title would rank Ridhwan's next to the likes of current IBO heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua of Britain.

So far the suspects have not issued any threats,\" he added.\n\nOmar said police were studying the feasibility of lifting the ban on pump boats as suggested by the new Parti Warisan Sabah-led state government a few months ago.\n\nHe said fishermen still used the pump boats along the coastline, but not in the open seas.\n\n\"We are still waiting for the decision from the government. We will see what justifications are given for the use of pump boats. If the government continues banning the use of these vehicles, we will follow their decision and enforce the law,\" he said.\n\nPump boats are small craft with converted or recycled motorbike or car engines that are much cheaper than \"proper\" outboard boat motors.\n\nThey are popular in the seas between Sabah and southern Philippines and are normally used by small-scale fishermen and by shady characters.\n\nPump boats were banned several years ago following a series of cross-border crimes on the east coast of Sabah, especially kidnappings. This part of the maritime border with the Philippines is only an hour away by boat from the mainland.\n\nThe town of Semporna in eastern Sabah is seen as the gateway for cross-border travel, especially to the troubled chain of Sulu islands in the Philippines.\n\nA few months ago, the state government announced that it might lift the ban to help poor fishermen.\n\nIn the latest kidnapping incident, Indonesian fishermen were abducted by armed kidnappers off the coast of Semporna during curfew hours at about 1am on Sept 11.\n\nThey were on a fishing vessel and had just docked at the Pulau Gaya when one of the crewmen heard the engine of an approaching pump boat.

Not only do they provide a seamless retail experience for consumers, they also lower transaction costs and improve productivity for businesses.\n\nSpearheading the future of banking through digital technology, DBS launched DBS PayLah!, a mobile application that lets the user transfer funds using the recipient's mobile number. PayLah! has since expanded to involve businesses, with customers paying via QR code. More than 50,000 transactions are recorded daily.\n\nWith more consumers using their mobile phone as a form of payment, Grab introduced GrabPay, a mobile wallet solution, in 2016.\n\nWith this cashless system, users transact across various Grab platforms and participating merchants.

The earthquake dealt a major blow to the agriculture, forestry and fisheries industries in Hokkaido.\n\nPHOTO: AFP\n\nFollow topic:\n\nEditorial Notes\n\nPublished\n\nSep 25, 2018, 02:29 PM\n\nTOKYO (THE YOMIURI SHIMBUN/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - A half month has passed since the Hokkaido earthquake, which registered the highest level on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7. To realise Hokkaido's post-quake rehabilitation, it is indispensable to rebuild its industries.\n\nA power blackout that spread to all parts of the prefecture has been resolved. The No. 1 unit at the Tomato-Atsuma thermal power plant - a facility that plays a central role in the supply of electricity there - has been brought back on line. The government has withdrawn its request for power-saving, and neon lighting has returned to flourishing areas in Sapporo.\n\nHowever, scars from the earthquake have not yet healed. Even if the amount of direct damage, including that caused to roads, rivers and forest land, is calculated alone, the figure exceeds 150 billion yen (S$1.8 billion). There are still many disaster victims in evacuation centres.\n\nThe central and pertinent local governments should bolster their assistance measures so Hokkaido residents can promptly return to their lives before the earthquake.\n\nFirst of all, it is essential to establish a system for a stable power supply. As it becomes more and more chilly from now on, electric power demand for heating and other activities will increase. Hokkaido Electric Power should make quick efforts to resume operations at two suspended units at the Tomato-Atsuma power station.\n\nThe impact of the large-scale power failure extended even to areas distant from the quake's focus. As electric milking machines could not be powered to use, a large number of cows developed mastitis. Unable to keep raw milk in cold storage, one dairy-farming household after another discarded the milk.\n\nThe earthquake dealt a major blow to the agriculture, forestry and fisheries industries in Hokkaido - the mainstay of the area's industrial structure - including damage caused to agricultural facilities, irrigation and drainage canals. The amount of losses totals no less than 42 billion yen.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

They include cancellations of reserved accommodations for 940,000 people and reservations for 4,000 sightseeing buses. Among other things, cancellations of large-scale school excursions may have been a heavy blow. The loss of profits tied to accommodations, as well as at eating and drinking establishments, reaches a total of 29.2 billion yen.\n\nIn recent years, non-Japanese have accounted for 25 per cent of the amount of money spent for tourism-related consumption in Hokkaido. Travellers from China, Taiwan and South Korea, who constitute a main portion of the total, are said to be sensitive to earthquakes. To prevent a reduction in the number of foreign tourists to Hokkaido, the Japan Tourism Agency and the prefectural government should increase efforts to dispatch information conducive to shaking off their anxiety.\n\nThe number of tourists dropped in the wake of the Hokkaido Nanseioki Earthquake in 1993 and the Mt. Usu eruption in 2000.\n\nThe hesitation felt about enjoying trips to Hokkaido in consideration of disaster victims' feelings, as well as anxiety about an aftershock, is understandable. Nonetheless, tourism is an important industry for Hokkaido. If Hokkaido attracts fewer tourists, it will come as a dual blow to the prefecture.

The move is also aimed at reviving Versace, which returned to a net profit last year.\n\nIt is the latest in a string of foreign takeovers of Italian luxury brands in recent years.\n\nMilan-based Versace, known for its bold designs and its Medusa head logo, was one of a clutch of family-owned Italian brands cited as attractive targets at a time when the luxury industry is riding high on strong demand from China.\n\n\"With the acquisition of Versace we have created one of the world's leading fashion and luxury groups,\" said John Idol, chairman and chief executive officer of Michael Kors Holdings.\n\nMichael Kors has agreed to buy all of Versace's outstanding shares for a total enterprise value of 1.83 billion euros to be funded in cash, debt and shares in Michael Kors Holding, which will be renamed Capri Holdings.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

My passion has never been stronger,\" said Donatella Versace, the sister of its late founder who is its artistic director and vice-president.\n\nVersace CEO Jonathan Akeroyd will remain at the helm of the company, while Donatella Versace will \"continue to lead the company's creative vision\", Idol added.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the fourth fiscal quarter, subject to regulatory approvals. JPMorgan and Barclays were among the advisers.\n\nBIG FASHION\n\nBudding conglomerates like Michael Kors have been trying to make inroads into an industry dominated by European players such as Louis Vuitton-owner LVMH and Kering.\n\n\"The Versace brand has strong global growth potential which is untapped across all regions, particularly Asia and North America,\" Cowen analysts said in a note.\n\nIdol said his group plans to grow Versace's global sales to US$2 billion globally, reach profit margins in the \"high teens range\" and open about 100 new stores as well as bolstering online sales. It also plans to raise the share of higher-margin accessories and footwear to 60 per cent of sales from 35 per cent.\n\n\" Versace is terribly under-developed. That is going to change with the resources of Capri behind them,\" Idol added, in a call with analysts, explaining that the group's runway line would remain the main \"focus\".\n\nHe admitted that the brand's reach was bigger than its customer base and that \"we need to convert those metrics\".\n\nVersace does not disclose financial details, but filed documents showing 2017 sales were 668 million euros and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 45 million euros.\n\n\"(In luxury) Americans are the opposite of Italians: Though not excellent in products, they are (excellent) in their approach to the market. The only risk is that they don't give the product their due value,\" said Giuliano Noci, professor at Milan's Politecnico School of Management.\n\nMichael Kors shares were trading 1.4 per cent higher at 1655 GMT, after falling more than 8 per cent on Monday when news of the deal emerged.\n\nVersace is the latest Made-in-Italy name to be snapped up by a foreign company. Rome-based Fendi, celebrity jeweller Bulgari and cashmere maker Loro Piana were all bought by LVMH. Gucci is the biggest brand in Kering, which also Bottega Veneta and menswear brand Brioni.\n\nFans fretted on social media about the red carpet favourite losing its appeal, while Italian politicians mourned the loss of another of the country's cherished brands.\n\n\"I am a liberal but I'm tired of seeing the best Italian brands in fashion, food and technology being bought by foreigners,\" Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said.\n\nSee more on\n\nLuxury brands\n\nAcquisitions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/file721c32dswc4zc42d55g_0.jpg?VersionId=EBhjXAstS0ssbRDdYrps.Mo1rBRrcg2E", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

There have been calls for him to be hanged and his genitals cut off.\n\nBut the scandal has also inspired a spoof on a popular television comedy show in which a character portraying Rasool fondles a male actor dressed up as a woman.\n\nTraditional healers are much-revered in the ultra conservative countryside, where illiteracy remains rampant.\n\nA lack of conventional health services forces many to rely on healers for a variety of problems - from debilitating maladies and infertility to finding stolen items and reuniting lost lovers.\n\nTo help police track down Rasool, provincial governor Naqibullah Faiq is offering his own car as a reward to anyone with information leading to his arrest.\n\n\"He will be arrested.

We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.\"\n\nBesides calling out Iran, Mr Trump also\n\ncriticised China for its trade practices\n\nbut made no mention of Russia's interference in Syria's war or its suspected meddling in US elections.\n\nMr Rouhani was defiant in his speech to the world body.\n\n\"What Iran says is clear: No war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfilment of obligations,\" Mr Rouhani said.\n\nMACRON'S ALTERNATIVE VIEW\n\nOffering an alternative view when it was his turn at the podium, French President Emmanuel Macron told the delegates that the law of the survival of the fittest, protectionism and isolationism would lead only to heightened tensions.\n\nDefending multilateralism and collective action, he said nationalism would lead to failure, and if countries stopped defending basic principles, global wars would return.\n\n\"I do not accept the erosion of multilateralism and don't accept our history unravelling,\" Mr Macron told the assembly, at times raising his voice. \"Our children are watching.\"\n\nMr Macron, citing the example of Iran, said that this unilateralism push would lead directly to conflicts.\n\nMr Trump, who begins his political rallies with boasts about his economic record in less than two years in office, used the same rhetoric before the crowd of world leaders and diplomats, telling them he had accomplished more than almost any previous US president.\n\nThe remark led to some murmuring and laughter in the crowd, taking the President slightly aback.\n\n\"I didn't expect that reaction, but that's OK,\" he said.\n\nMr Trump attempted to drive a wedge between Iran's leadership and its people, days after an attack in south-western Iran on a military parade killed 25 people and unsettled the country.\n\nIn remarks to reporters on his way to his speech, Mr Trump said he would not meet the Iranians until they \"change their tune\".\n\nThough he held out the possibility of a better relationship in the future, he made clear economic pressure on Iran would not abate.\n\nMr Trump's national security adviser, Mr John Bolton, addressing a group called United Against a Nuclear Iran, called the 2015 accord \"the worst diplomatic debacle in American history\" and had a warning for \"the mullahs in Teheran\".\n\n\"If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay,\" he said.\n\nIn May, Republican Trump withdrew the US from the deal to put curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for easing sanctions. France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union were part of the accord with Iran.\n\nFoes for decades, Washington and Teheran have been increasingly at odds since May. The accord with Opec member Iran was negotiated under Democratic US president Barack Obama.\n\n\"Additional sanctions will resume Nov 5 and more will follow, and we are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nHe said the US would help create a regional strategic alliance between Gulf nations and Jordan and Egypt, a move the US sees as a bulwark against Iran.\n\nMr Trump compared US relations with Iran to what he called improved ties with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who Mr Trump had\n\nmet in Singapore in June as part of a still-unfulfilled drive to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.\n\nIn his address last year to the UN, Mr Trump insulted Mr Kim as a \"rocket man\" bent on nuclear destruction. On Tuesday, Mr Trump praised Mr Kim for halting nuclear and missile tests, releasing Americans held prisoner and returning some remains of US soldiers killed in the 1950s Korean War.\n\nThe two leaders are trying to arrange a second summit. Mr Trump has said sanctions on North Korea would remain for now.\n\nDelivering a harsh message to Opec members,\n\nMr Trump called on them to stop raising oil prices and to pay for their own military protection. He threatened to limit American aid only to countries that are friendly to the US.\n\nDr Anwar Gargash, United Arab Emirates' Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, said oil prices were driven only by markets, by supply and demand. \"These are not things that can be manipulated by a decision here or there,\" said Dr Gargash, whose country is an Opec member.\n\nCrude oil prices shot to a four-year high on Tuesday, catapulted by imminent US sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of Opec and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.\n\nSee more on\n\nUN\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/un-assembly-diplomacy-144811_0.jpg?VersionId=cyOfbbYFuPMQh2RtITWmvikakGLjfxNX", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

These 21 charges involved almost $770,000.\n\nAnother 126 charges for similar offences involving the remaining amount were taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nThe court heard that she was sentenced to\n\nfour months' jail in 2015 after admitting to cheating offences.\n\nFollowing her release in August that year, she misappropriated $68,260 from her employer, home renovation company Elegance Concept, between September and December 2015.\n\nShe left the firm in January 2016. After that, she cheated 89 home owners and sub-contractors out of nearly $1.8 million.\n\nIn early 2016, Husniyati asked her friend Christina Wong Hoi Khay, 22, to be the sole director and shareholder of a renovation firm called Carpentry Design Works. She promised to give Ms Wong $3,000 every month.\n\nHowever, the company and its bank accounts were at all times controlled by Husniyati and her husband Aszrul Yusoff, 37, the court heard.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Lee Ti-Ting told District Judge Edgar Foo that the couple promised home owners and prospective customers that the company was able to complete renovation works within specific deadlines.\n\nHowever, Husniyati never had the intention of ensuring that Carpentry Design Works would honour the agreements or complete the renovation works.\n\nHusniyati also duped sub-contractors into believing that she would pay them for work they had done. However, she had no intention of doing so.\n\nOne sub-contractor, engaged to carry out flooring work, alerted the police on April 13 last year, and she was arrested.\n\nWhile out on bail, Husniyati asked Mr Mohammad Khairuldin Abdullah, 32, to set up another renovation firm, Chanteq Flooring Specialist, through which she continued to commit cheating offences with a similar modus operandi.\n\nJudge Foo noted that large sums of money were involved in Husniyati's current cases and she had made no restitution.\n\nHe also highlighted that she had reoffended while out on bail.

But some experts say there are still vulnerabilities, and tighter controls may be needed to prevent deliberate acts of sabotage.\n\nFood safety expert Melissa Fitzgerald from the University of Queensland told The Straits Times that the fresh food sector should consider introducing preventive measures such as metal detectors and X-ray machines.\n\nThese are already in place for processed foods, she said, but they may need to be extended to foods such as strawberries which go directly from growers to markets or retailers.\n\nProfessor Fitzgerald said the industry may also need to consider tamper-proof packaging for some fresh foods. The process of recalling food also needs to be reviewed, she said, noting that the initial recall following the scare was issued to distributors, but not to consumers and retailers.\n\n\"We need to look at the implications for health and safety and for our reputation... We have seen what can happen and I suspect there will be other people copying that.\"\n\nIndeed, there have been copycat cases since the first needle was found in a punnet of strawberries in Queensland earlier this month. There have been more than 100 reports of needles found in fruits in Australia, including in bananas, mangoes and apples.\n\nThe crisis has even\n\nspread to New Zealand\n\n, where three needles were discovered in a punnet of strawberries imported from Western Australia.\n\nThe original sabotage was believed to have targeted three brands in Queensland. Some farmers believe it may have been a vendetta by a disgruntled person involved in the industry.\n\nThe Queensland Government has pledged A$1 million (S$991,840) to help struggling farmers and has offered a A$100,000 reward for any information that leads to a conviction. A team of 100 police officers are investigating the crime.\n\nSome farmers have blamed state police forces and segments of the media for overhyping the crisis and leaving consumers terrified.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that the rhetoric from some jurisdictions has actually exacerbated the problem and potentially led to copycat crimes,\" Ms Rachel McKenzie from Queensland horticultural body Growcom told ABC News last week.\n\n\"We have a situation where hysteria and hyperbole have outrun pragmatism.\"\n\nThe health authorities have urged consumers to cut strawberries before eating them.

Somebody else may be carrying the IC to vote for them, although I do not know how prevalent this problem is,\" said Azhar, who is better known as Art Harun.\n\nHe told The Star in an exclusive interview on Monday (Sept 24): \"With regard to those 104-year-olds or 94-year-olds or whatever, there is an explanation. I have seen the explanation before.\n\n\"The National Registration did not inform the EC on the death of these people or they may have been dead but there is no death certificate. That's the problem.\n\n\"The EC cannot just look at the electoral roll and find the 104-year-olds and strike them out. We can't.\"\n\nAzhar said with such problems, the EC was stuck as there were procedures that needed to be followed. He assured genuine voters that he would look into it and solve the problem.\n\nWith regard to the redelineation exercise that was done prior to the 14th general election, Azhar, 56, who is the first EC chairman from outside the civil service, said he would be consulting all stakeholders and would then decide on what to do with it.\n\nHe said he would be forming an engagement initiative within the EC where it would consult political parties - government or opposition - non-governmental organisations and civil society groups, among others.\n\n\"That is one of the initiatives that I am thinking of. We will then sit down with them, listen to whatever proposal they may have and we will then give due thought to consider them. And, if it is good for the country and for the democratic practices, then we will adopt and recommend to the government to do it,\" he said.\n\nAzhar also intends to see better enforcement of the Election Offences Act as allegations of wrongdoing and bribery had been prevalent in previous elections.\n\n\"There must be a clear line drawn to what a caretaker government may or may not do - from the onset of election until the election day,\" he said.\n\nHe also called the workforce of the EC the \"unsung heroes\" who have taken on the mammoth task of organising elections.\n\nHowever, he said it was due to the bad policies of the EC policymakers that had tarnished its reputation.\n\n\"I have to shield them... it is my responsibility to correct the policies. That's how I see it.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nElections", "images": []}

The ban period increases with every subsequent ban, up to one year.\n\nFurther details will be released later.\n\nThe QR codes will be installed progressively at public parking spaces from the end of this month.\n\nThe QR code system was initially announced by LTA in March. The authority also introduced then a licensing regime for shared-bicycle operators.\n\nThrough this regulatory framework, the bicycle fleet size each operator is allowed to have will be reviewed every six months, based on how well they can manage the illegal parking problem and how often their bikes are used.\n\nAs of July this year, four bicycle-sharing firms - ofo, Mobike, SG Bike and GBikes - have submitted their applications for a full licence to operate dockless bicycle rental services.\n\nAnother three - Anywheel, QiQi Zhixiang and GrabCycle - applied for a regulatory sandbox licence, which is for firms without a sufficiently long track record in operating a bike-sharing service in Singapore.\n\nThe results of the applications are expected at the end of this month.\n\nBut cyclists will also have an easier time finding spaces to park at, as the current 207,000 spaces will be increased to 267,000 by 2020, said LTA. It added that 7,000 spaces have been added since January this year.\n\n\"LTA will continue to work with our partner agencies, private developers and building owners to expand the bicycle parking capacity islandwide, especially at locations with higher demand for bicycle parking,\" said the authority.\n\nMore than 99 per cent of public housing residents\n\nare within a 5-minute walk\n\n- or about 400m - from bicycle parking, said LTA. It added that 97 per cent of key destinations - such as polyclinics, community centres, schools and town centres - are within a 5-minute walking distance as well.\n\nNee Soon GRC MP Lee Bee Wah, who has spoken about the issue of indiscriminate bicycle parking in Parliament, said of the extra charge for errant parking: \"I think $5 is quite a substantial sum and (provides) enough deterrence.\"\n\nShe added that while the severity of the issue has been reduced since more parking spaces were built, she still sees errant bike parking in her constituency.\n\nAnother suggestion, she said, is for the relevant authorities to also look out for those who do not park properly when they carry out enforcement action against errant cyclists and personal mobility device users.\n\nMs Lee added: \"There should be public education and more parking spaces. In my constituency, I have been looking into these areas and will continue to do so.\"\n\nNanyang Technological University student Jovi Ho, 23, said: \"I feel the $5 fine will really deter users from improper parking. The fine isn't that far off from (the cost of a) 30-day ofo pass, and I feel that it is a significant figure.\"\n\nBut he called the possible year-long ban for recalcitrant offenders \"harsh\".\n\n\"I believe bike-sharing is the future and we can't afford to lose such a convenience,\" said Mr Ho. \"While I understand the need for such regulations, I hope the users and the companies aren't too affected.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Gilaine Ng\n\nSee more on\n\nLTA\n\nCycling/Bicycles", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/2d9cd921-5bab-49d6-ac35-fb3d140eaea2.jpg?VersionId=DgUcmDcEl1.EYz3ajO3Lt6jUWcJ7p0Yc", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/76ca84b8-5fde-41b1-866e-5905c563f1c4.jpg?VersionId=dXDPuiRY_a2L3r4ZupYxolwsyJdbKGgM", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-litteindia0101-250918.jpg?VersionId=8I4_o9vkPnk6j7t.0VzPnE2jiC9ZqrDg", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-senoko01-250918.jpg?VersionId=e3U1VDijBd8VQFgd2N5Akcv.S3XR0W_.", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-senoko02-250918.jpg?VersionId=GcJMiT9lcM_XJgbi8KagGdwY3a35mNf0", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-senokoway01-250918.jpg?VersionId=zRJt3nx2CfLwkGiSkp05_ErlGKOinZ7u", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-senokoway02-250918.jpg?VersionId=GffSCjKbgUNQ0sT_bZDATtPP42BYXYeC", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-loyangway01-250918.jpg?VersionId=sY2MYDyeQ.E9jYkAvVjYn5scoY0X_GRW", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/bp_lta_250918_51.jpg?VersionId=ZxHRyyFL3M1DesnOJx1P7zGJGbFTHzN8", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-loyangcresent01-250918.jpg?VersionId=lOHCaJORl7TEDYsUz3M2ibPn8HPUiz18", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-loyangcresent02-250918.jpg?VersionId=9WcF9Vdd8kcLs9rxd_ssopJOF2lwl4gZ", "alt_text": null}]}

Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - announced Monday plans to keep business ties alive with Iran, staring down Washington's move to impose sanctions.\n\nEyeing his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump will also tout his diplomacy with Pyongyang as a win, even if the North has taken little concrete action to dismantle its missile and nuclear programmes.\n\nTrump withdrew from the nuclear deal in May, to the dismay of European allies, Russia and China which had invested years in negotiations to achieve a milestone agreement on keeping Iran's nuclear ambitions in check.\n\nIn his address, Rouhani will stress that Iran continues to stick to the 2015 deal and portray the United States as a pariah for breaking its international commitments.\n\nTrump used his UN address last year to bash the nuclear deal as \"an embarrassment\", signalling that the US was ready to walk away from the agreement.\n\nAfter its exit, the US maintains that it is seeking to ramp up pressure on Iran which it accuses of sowing chaos in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.\n\n\"As I have said repeatedly, regime change in Iran is not the administration's policy,\" Trump's national security adviser John Bolton told reporters.\n\n\"We've imposed very stringent sanctions on Iran, more are coming, and what we expect from Iran is massive changes in their behaviour,\" he said.\n\nAfter a late meeting on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini announced that a new legal entity would be set up to preserve oil and other business links with Iran.\n\n\"This will mean that EU member-states will set up a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions with Iran and this will allow European companies to continue to trade with Iran,\" Mogherini told reporters, flanked by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.\n\nNO TRUMP-ROUHANI MEETING\n\nRouhani has said he has no plans to meet Trump while in New York during the marathon of meetings and slammed the offer of talks as \"not genuine\".\n\nAs a precondition for any dialogue, Rouhani said Trump would need to repair the damage done by exiting the nuclear deal. \"That bridge must be rebuilt,\" he told NBC news.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump will for the first time chair a meeting of the Security Council on non-proliferation that will give him a fresh opportunity to make the case for a tougher international stance on Iran.\n\n\"The Trump administration's approach toward Iran seems to boil down to: squeeze and let's see what will come,\" said Robert Malley, president of International Crisis Group.\n\nMalley warns that \"rising tensions between the US and Iran in the absence of diplomatic channels is a recipe for an accidental, perilous clash.\"\n\nU-TURN ON NORTH KOREA\n\nWith only six weeks to go before key midterm US elections, Trump will be seeking to appeal to his hard-right voter base from the dais of the General Assembly.\n\nTrump used his debut address 12 months ago to threaten to \"totally destroy\" North Korea and belittled its leader as \"rocket man,\" prompting Kim to respond by calling the US president \"mentally deranged.\"\n\nBut returning to New York, Trump hailed \"tremendous progress\" to halt Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile tests and said that a year later it was a \"much different time.\" \"Chairman Kim has been really very open and terrific, frankly, and I think he wants to see something happen,\" Trump said after meeting South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nAlso making his second address at the General Assembly, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to take issue with Trump's America-First policy and make the case for strengthening the rules-based multilateral order.\n\nMacron is championing the Paris climate agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions that Trump ditched in June, arguing it would harm the US economy.\n\nSee more on\n\nUN\n\nIran\n\nDonald Trump\n\nIran nuclear deal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-trumphassan-250918.jpg?VersionId=KEiwKxMqrwSL5CzoI3_QDaQ1n9c_NtIU", "alt_text": null}]}

A second get-together could be announced shortly.\n\nAccording to one senior European diplomat, the Trump administration is convinced that its tough talk - allied with a massive programme of sanctions - forced the North Korean leadership to change course, even if doubts remain about how many concrete measures the North has actually taken towards ending its nuclear programme.\n\nThe Trump administration therefore plans to \"do the same thing with Iran: hit hard and then negotiate from a position of strength\", the diplomat added.\n\nMuch to the dismay of Washington's Western allies, Trump slammed the door in May on a deal that the US and European powers brokered with Iran back in 2015 that allowed for a lifting of sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Teheran's nuclear programme.\n\nWith the Iranian economy showing increasing signs of strain, the Trump administration is hoping that Teheran will have no option if it wants to survive and return to the negotiating table.\n\nBehnam Ben Taleblu of the Washington-based Foundation for Defence of Democracies, whose organisation is known for its hard-line stance towards the regimes in both Pyongyang and Teheran, said there were clear parallels.\n\n\"It's hard not to mention Iran and North Korea in the same breath when talking about rogue regimes and nuclear non-proliferation,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I believe that a 'maximum pressure' strategy towards both regimes is wise and warranted, but it will be challenging to conduct,\" added Ben Taleblu.\n\nWhile both regimes have been accused of trying to develop nuclear weapons, Washington's complaints against Iran are more extensive - encouraged by its Sunni Arab allies who have long been hostile towards the mainly Shi'ite regime in Teheran.\n\nCHANGING BEHAVIOUR\n\nVarious administration officials have accused Teheran of destabilising large parts of the Middle East by becoming directly or indirectly involved through proxy militias in the conflicts in countries such as Syria, Yemen and Iraq.\n\n\"What we expect from Iran is massive changes in their behaviour. And until that happens, we will continue to exert what the President has called 'maximum pressure,'\" Trump's national security adviser John Bolton told reporters in New York on Monday.\n\nWhile Trump has not totally ruled out meeting Rouhani on the sidelines of the General Assembly, the Iranian President appears in no mood to meet his US counterpart and rejects any comparison with the situation with North Korea.\n\n\"The North Korean model cannot be a correct model, because we cannot draw such comparisons,\" Rouhani, who is to make his own address to the General Assembly on Tuesday, told the NBC network.\n\nWhile US hardliners reject the President's reputation as a moderate, the Iranian government - with Rouhani resoundingly re-elected last year on a platform of better relations with the world - is far more multifaceted than North Korea where Kim's family has ruled with an iron fist for more than a half-century.\n\nThomas Countryman, who served in the State Department under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, said that one of the reasons why Trump's strategy appears doomed to fail with Iran is that he has failed to work with key allies such as fellow members of the Security Council and has been instead too heavily guided by Teheran's enemies.\n\n\"The campaign of pressure against Iran is driven in part by Middle Eastern friends of the Trump administration who wish to draw the US into an active confrontation with Iran,\" said Countryman, who now heads the Arms Control Association pressure group.\n\n\"The US is burning up its traditional credibility on the Security Council,\" he added.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUN\n\nIran\n\nIran nuclear deal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-donald-250918.jpg?VersionId=ZNy1bzPS422Ec7WVQEOd4ntlhtoZap_3", "alt_text": null}]}

Like I was being strangled,\" she said. \"People couldn't understand me when I spoke.\"\n\nHer world came crashing down.\n\nThough the National University of Singapore Arts and Social Sciences graduate worked as a writer at World Vision Singapore, a humanitarian group, her real passion was to sing, which she did at pubs, weddings and other venues during the nights and weekends.\n\nAs long as Ms Goh, 32, could remember, singing was an integral part of her life.\n\nIt was something she inherited from her father, an engineer, who loved to sing and was a fan of country music. In fact, he named the older of his two children after American country singer Crystal Gayle.\n\nFrom the age of five or six, Ms Goh knew she had a talent.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

I knew it was something people would applaud me for,\" she said. \"My plan was always to go into music full time some day.\"\n\nWhen she realised she had lost her gift, it was devastating.\n\nShe went to several family doctors, who all thought it was probably a sore throat from the flu.\n\nWhen it didn't get better, she went to three or four specialists until one finally put her name to her condition - a rare neurological disorder called spasmodic dysphonia, in which the muscles of the voice box go into spasms.\n\nThe doctor told her he did not know of anyone who had recovered from it and the only treatment was to have Botox injections through the neck into the vocal cords to stop the spasms temporarily.\n\nIt was a painful option and not a long-term solution to her problem.\n\n\"As someone who loves to communicate, that joy was gone. I not only found it hard to sing, I also had little reason to sing,\" she said. \"I would cry in my room, asking God why something so precious and so much a part of me had to be taken away.\"\n\nEveryday tasks like having a conversation with a friend or ordering food at a hawker centre became a hurdle to overcome. She shunned social gatherings.\n\nThis went on for close to half a year until she experienced a few breakthroughs.\n\nShe had written a song for the wedding of a good friend, who insisted Ms Goh perform it herself on the big day.\n\nMs Goh hesitated, afraid her voice, which was breaking every few seconds, would ruin her friend's wedding. In the end, she did sing, though not before explaining to the wedding guests why her voice was the way it was.\n\nTo her surprise, many in the audience were moved by her performance and told her.\n\nShe said: \"From then on, I realised it is not about how well I sing and if I impress others. By singing, I can share my story and to give hope to others.\"\n\nAt work, her boss was supportive and encouraged her to continue singing and writing songs. She also told her a story from the Bible of a woman who found the strength to sing, despite her despair at her circumstances.\n\nMiss Goh read that story almost daily for a year as it was \"a glimmer in the darkness\".\n\nInspired by it, she wrote a song, There Will Be Spring, to remind herself of the importance of hope.\n\nThe song also sparked the birth of Diamonds on the Street.\n\nOn Christmas Eve in 2012, Ms Goh visited a home for female delinquents with some friends.\n\nThough she found it still a struggle to speak, she wanted to share her experience and encourage the young women there.\n\nSoon, she started volunteering at the home, helping the girls turn their life experiences into songs.\n\nThus was born Diamonds on the Street, an initiative named for those precious stones that emerge after being tested by pressure and heat.\n\nThrough songwriting and storytelling programmes run by the group, young people explore their life experiences and relationships that shape them.\n\nThe process helps them to learn more about themselves, and begin to accept themselves and their loved ones, Ms Goh said. They also learn that they are not alone.\n\nFor example, one 15-year-old girl composed her first song and dedicated it to her estranged older sister, whom she yearned to reconnect with.\n\nTheir relationship improved after she shared her song with her sister and they began to speak more openly to each other.\n\nSo far, Diamonds on the Street, which she started with two friends and is now registered as a social enterprise, has reached out to about 200 vulnerable youths, such as those from troubled families.\n\nBy 2013, Ms Goh said, her voice had improved significantly.\n\nShe can now speak audibly, though she has bad days when her voice troubles her.\n\nShe is also taking a part-time master's degree in Music Education at the National Institute of Education to be able to better design and run music programmes, especially to reach out to vulnerable youths.\n\nMs Chua Jia Lin, a 33-year-old public servant and a good friend, said she was struck by Ms Goh's resilience.\n\nShe said: \"It's this hope that Crystal has that enabled her to start Diamonds on the Street and make the best out of her condition. The hope that she will recover and there's a reason for her condition.\"\n\nToday, Ms Goh makes her living as a freelance writer and music teacher.\n\nThough this is not the path she once envisaged for herself, she can say, with honesty, that she has no regrets about what happened to her.\n\nShe said: \"Though I lost my voice, I'm now part of a bigger collective of people helping others who are struggling to find their voices.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nGenGrit\n\nLimited-time offer\n\nGet a FREE Xiaomi vacuum cleaner (worth $109) with your subscription!\n\nBilled at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Over the next five years, 40,000 more pre-school places are expected to be added across Singapore, especially in estates with more young families.\n\nMr Lee said that while large childcare centres are added to places with significant demand for childcare, such as Punggol and Sengkang, \"we are not averse to building them in more mature estates where demand is strong, such as in Henderson, where we have new developments, new redevelopment sites and new families coming in\".\n\nPCF's Mr Bay said that having the childcare centre at the same site as the nursing home and dialysis centre allows for inter-generational activities.\n\n\"This will give the children a holistic education with the extension of the classroom. At the same time, it also cultivates certain useful life values in them, like resilience, care and respect for the elders and the communities and for nature.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nPre-schools\n\nTeachers\n\nNursing homes\n\nDesmond Lee", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/colin-dl3-25.jpg?VersionId=LWa9WhtdRaWwngYNBi.WEGztSvXyx_wn", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

It is the source of income for thousands of people (here),\" he added.\n\nVictims of big corporations\n\nEurope is one of the world's biggest palm oil consumers, along with India and China.\n\nAbout half of the palm oil used last year in Europe was for biofuels that ended up in gas tanks, according to environmentalists.\n\nIndonesia and Malaysia have threatened retaliatory sanctions on European products over the proposed palm oil ban, which calls for a complete phase-out from biofuels by 2030. The legislation is awaiting a final vote and member-state approval.\n\nAs the diplomatic row smoulders, Indonesian grower Selamet Ketaren says he and other small farmers - the backbone of the industry - are pawns at the mercy of land-clearing multinational firms that buy their crops.\n\n\"Smallholder farmers like us are just victims of the big corporations,\" said Mr Ketaren, who has been growing oil palm since the mid-80s.\n\nEnvironmentalists accuse the multibillion-dollar industry of destroying huge swathes of rainforest home to indigenous communities, orang utans and other threatened species.\n\nCritics say that oil palm development also contributes to climate change through deliberate forest-clearing fires, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and lung-clogging smog into the region's air.\n\nMany under-pressure firms made \"no deforestation\" pledges, but activists say they are tough to monitor and frequently broken in the vast jungles of Sumatra and Borneo island.\n\nThis week, Greenpeace said a group of Indonesian palm oil firms that supply major international brands including Unilever and Nestle have cleared an area of rainforest almost twice the size of Singapore in less than three years.\n\nBut Malaysian farmer Mansor rejects the depiction of growers as an environmental threat.\n\n\"(The EU) says we cut down the forest. But my land is on peat soil - there was rubber growing here before,\" he said.\n\n\"How can the EU claim that I'm killing the earth?\"\n\nNegative campaigns\n\nAn EU ban would threaten the livelihoods of 650,000 smallholders and over 3.2 million Malaysians who rely on the industry, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Council.\n\n\"The policies that the EU is proposing to introduce will harm Malaysia's rural communities and reduce incomes for Malaysian families,\" said Mr Douglas Uggah Embas, deputy chief minister of Sarawak state on Borneo island, home to many smallholders.\n\nSome three million people in Indonesia - the world's biggest palm oil exporter - are estimated to be working in the sector and many more depend on their income.\n\nWhile it hopes to tap other markets, the Indonesian Palm Oil Association said that a slowdown in China and \"negative campaigns\" against palm oil could hurt the bottom line.\n\nMalaysian grower Muhamad Ngisa Kusas fears that political decisions made in Europe will lead to poverty, crime and could push desperate people into the arms of religious extremists in the two Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\"If the EU bans comes into effect, the price of palm oil will surely plunge.

I've always treated women with dignity and respect.\"\n\n\"I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter,\" he told Fox News, appearing alongside his wife Ashley ahead of his own Senate testimony due after Ford's.\n\n\"I'm not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process,\" he added, repeatedly calling for a \"fair process\".\n\n\"I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter ... The girls from the schools I went to, and I, were friends.\"\n\n\"Through all these years that were in question, you were a virgin?\" Fox News host Martha MacCallum asked.\n\n\"That's correct,\" Kavanaugh replied, adding that he did not have sex until \"many years after\" college.\n\nSecond accuser\n\nAfter a dramatic week-long standoff, Kavanaugh's accuser Ford finally committed on Sunday to be questioned in a public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is weighing Kavanaugh's nomination.\n\nFord alleges that a drunken Kavanaugh and another boy shut her in a room and tried to tear her clothes off at a high school beer party in suburban Washington around 1982, when she was 15 and he 17.\n\nJust hours later, The New Yorker dropped a new bombshell, reporting that a second woman was accusing the Washington appeals court judge of sexual misconduct, while they were students at Yale University around 1983-84.\n\nDeborah Ramirez, 53, says Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a party, thrusting his genitals in her face and causing her to touch them without her consent, according to the magazine.\n\nThe allegations stand to derail a nomination that Republicans see as crucial to gaining conservative control of the high court for years.\n\nThey could also play decisively in the November midterm elections, where Republican control of both houses of Congress is under threat.\n\nWith emotions running high, dozens of protesters were removed from the US Capitol for unlawfully demonstrating against the judge's confirmation.\n\nTrump, speaking in New York where he was attending the United Nations General Assembly, threw his full weight behind Kavanaugh.\n\n\"There's a chance that this could be one of the single most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate, but I am with Judge Kavanaugh,\" Trump said.\n\n\"For people to come out of the woodwork from 36 years ago and 30 years ago and never mention it, all of a sudden it happens - in my opinion, it's totally political.\" .\n\nLack of witnesses\n\nKavanaugh's approval was only two weeks ago considered a done deal, with all Republicans in the narrowly divided Senate appearing set to back him.\n\nBut the allegations have left some Republican senators - especially two women who have spoken out in the past about sexual abuse of women - under pressure to weigh the accusers' stories.\n\nThe year-old #MeToo movement against sexual harassment also has politicians wary of angering women voters.\n\nYet Trump's defiant stance could also stir his Republican base to head to the polls in November, frustrated at what many see as a cynical attempt to sink a qualified nominee.\n\nKavanaugh argues that no witnesses have yet come forward to corroborate either woman's account. Both accusers have acknowledged memory lapses, which could weaken their claims.\n\nDemocrats say that is all the more reason to halt the nomination process and let the FBI, which carries out background investigations for candidates to high positions, investigate them.\n\n\"There is only one way to get to the bottom of these allegations against Judge Kavanaugh and prevent the nation from being thrown into further turmoil: an independent background check investigation by the FBI,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer, the senior Democrat in the Senate.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-us-250918.jpg?VersionId=wKQqewQ2DTJxyn2vJLBJVaC_hG.y3.cT", "alt_text": null}]}

The PKR is one of the component parties of the PH alliance.\n\nHe added that there was no need to have the by-election, as Datuk Seri Anwar was a already free man.

It said escalating claims on the back of fewer accidents can mean only one thing: the accidents were on average more severe, possibly involving more injuries.\n\nThe Straits Times understands that more claimants engaging lawyers could be a secondary contributing factor, as claims through legal means are usually bigger.

Chantal Liew turns pain into inspiration\n\nHe said confrontation between China and the United States means both sides lose, and talks with Washington cannot take place under threats and pressure.\n\nMeeting representatives of the US-China Business Council and National Committee on United States-China Relations in New York, Wang YI said certain US forces have been making groundless accusations against China on trade and security, China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nThese accusations against China have poisoned the atmosphere of Sino-US ties, Wang Yi added.\n\nUS tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory taxes by Beijing on US$60 billion worth of U.S. products including liquefied natural gas (LNG) kicked in on Monday (Sept 24) as the trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies escalated, unnerving global financial markets.\n\nChina also\n\naccused the United States of engaging in \"trade\n\nbullyism\n\n\"\n\n, and said Washington was intimidating other countries to submit to its will, according to a white paper on the dispute published by China's State Council, or Cabinet, on Monday.\n\n\"The sharp criticism (from Beijing on Monday) suggests that China might prefer to wait out the current US administration, rather than embarking on potentially futile negotiations,\" Mizuho Bank said in a note to clients.\n\n\"Given these developments, it is increasingly likely that both sides will not resume negotiations for some time, at least until there is a noticeable shift in the political mood on either side.\"\n\nSeveral rounds of Sino-US talks in recent months have appeared to produce no breakthroughs and fresh negotiations which had been expected in coming weeks have been cancelled after Beijing reportedly decided late last week not to send a delegation to Washington.\n\nOne cannot say that all previous trade discussions have been useless, but the United States has abandoned its mutual understanding with China, Wang Shouwen said.\n\nChina does not know why the United States has changed its mind after reaching an agreement with China on trade earlier, China's vice commerce minister said, apparently referring to talks in May when it appeared briefly that a framework was being sorted out.\n\nUS exporters including LNG suppliers would \"certainly\" be hurt, but Beijing's retaliation would provide opportunities to other LNG-exporting countries, Wang Shouwen said, adding that Australia is an important source of the fuel for China.\n\nThe state-backed Global Times wrote in an editorial on Tuesday: \"China is a big and powerful nation, so whether it is a confrontation with China economically or militarily, it would come at a huge price.\"\n\n\"As such, it is an attractive prospect for other countries including the United States to coexist with China peacefully,\"said the newspaper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nTrade", "images": [{"image_url":

The language is enjoying a surge in popularity among Kiwis - Maori or otherwise - embracing their South Pacific nation's indigenous culture.\n\nTe reo courses are booked out at community colleges, while bands, poets and rappers perform using the language.\n\nTe reo words such as 'kai' (food), 'ka pai' (congratulations), 'whanau' (family), and 'mana' (prestige) have entered everyday usage.\n\nEven the way Kiwis define themselves has taken on a te reo tone, with an increasing number preferring to use 'Aotearoa' rather than New Zealand.\n\n'More than a language'\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern is a passionate champion of the language, saying one of her great regrets is not being able to converse fluently in it.\n\n\"We have a guardianship role, a duty of care to te reo Maori,\" she said this month.\n\n\"It's our job to nurture it because it's about more than a language.\" Ardern chose to give her daughter Neve a Maori middle name 'Te Aroha' ('the love') when she was born in June.\n\nHer government has set a target of having one million fluent te reo speakers by 2040.\n\nWith the Maori comprising only about 15 percent of New Zealand's 4.5 million population, that would mean many non-Maori adopting the language.\n\nIt is a prospect that excites Charles Royal, a Maori academic and storyteller at the national museum Te Papa (Our Place).\n\n\"We've never had so many te reo speakers as we have now,\" he said.\n\n\"What te reo enables me to do is articulate who I am in a very particular way...as a New Zealander,\" he added.\n\n\"It's the vehicle by which humanity first gained a voice in this part of the world.\"\n\nRoyal said the earlier rejection of te reo stemmed from a sense of inferiority and a mistaken belief that European history was more important that that of New Zealand.\n\nBut he said Kiwis now felt more positive about their place in the world and the rising popularity of te reo was an expression of this confidence.\n\n'Flies off my tongue'\n\nAs an actor, Eramiha observes that te reo \"flies off my tongue a bit better (than English), the flow's different\".\n\nHead teacher Angela Fieldes has noticed a similar phenomenon among toddlers exposed to te reo at the Wellington child care centre she helps run.\n\n\"They pick it up really, really quickly, so it just becomes part of their day,\" she said after the children performed a 'waiata' (song), reciting Maori colours, numbers and vowels.\n\n\"They love the singing and I think a big part of learning te reo is that it's so rich in the way you can use song.\" Royal said there were still New Zealanders who maintained Maori culture was not valuable, but they were an ageing minority.\n\nHe said the fact that so many non-Maori, including 'pakeha' (New Zealanders of European descent) wanted to learn te reo was \"absolutely fantastic\".\n\n\"It makes me feel proud to be Maori, it's an act of generosity on both sides,\" he said.\n\nEramiha echoes the sentiment, saying the passion for the language has been evident as his Taki Rua theatre troupe performs in te reo across the country.\n\nHe expressed confidence in the language's future, saying: \"People from other cultures come up to me after our shows and say 'can you teach me how to say hello?'.\n\n\"It's a treasure for us to be able to pass it on and a great gift to see other people wanting to learn it.

They are not the only potential obstacles. At quitting time, factory workers heading home on foot and motorbikes clog the road.\n\nFor factory owners on deadline, those crowded roads can mean frustrating delays.\n\n\"Where Cambodia sits now is where China was 25 years ago,\" said Piet Holten, who makes the microfiber cloths and bags for sport and fashion sunglass brands like Oakley. To get his sportswear products from his Phnom Penh factory to market, he flies them using DHL.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese products, which expanded to an additional\n\nUS$200 billion (S$273 billion) worth of goods on\n\nMonday (Sept 24), are prompting many companies to rethink their supply chains. As tariffs begin to make China look more expensive, many companies are considering cheaper places to make their products, like Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Ethiopia. Already, companies with significant US business like Steve Madden, the fashion designer, and Puma, the German sports brand, have said they will look to shift production out of China.\n\nBut China will be hard to quit. From zippers and rivets on jackets and jeans to the minerals used in iPhones, China makes or processes many of the ingredients that go into today's consumer goods. It has a dependable source of workers who know how to hold down factory jobs. It has reliable roads and rail lines connecting suppliers to assembly plants to ports.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

More workers have to be trained. Many companies have to start from scratch.\n\n\"When I came here in the beginning, it was a nightmare,\" said Elli Bobrovizki, who runs a factory in Phnom Penh that makes Bloch ballet shoes.\n\nGetting the pink ballet slippers and black jazz shoes out to places like the United States takes at least a day or two longer than it would in China, he said. To reach his factory, a visitor has to travel down a bumpy dirt road.\n\nInside, hundreds of workers cut leather from Brazil, then glue and carefully pinch, gather and hammer it into soles. The work could be partly automated, but the labour is cheap.\n\nOne day a few years ago Bobrovizki arrived at his factory to find several unions had locked it. Negotiations took weeks. In Cambodia some unions are backed by the party of Hun Sen, the prime minister, adding to political risks for foreign companies.\n\n\"I lost half a million dollars in those two weeks that they blocked my gate,\" Bobrovizki said.\n\nCompanies are not looking to leave China just because of the trade war. Average wages have risen by about one-third in recent years, according to official data. The average Chinese factory worker makes roughly US$10,000 a year, the official data shows. By contrast, the minimum wage for Cambodian garment workers amounts to about one-fifth of that. But rising tariffs, and the prospect of more on the horizon, add to the urgency.\n\n\"People are desperate to get out of China,\" said Spencer Fung of Li & Fung, a go-between for Western companies and factories in developing countries.\n\nOne US company recently told a supplier with a factory in Phnom Penh that it wants to take its China production down to zero as soon as possible in order to avoid tariffs, said Bradley Gordon, a lawyer who advises multinational companies in Cambodia. That Phnom Penh factory plans to hire 1,000 more workers in the next month and employ nearly 10,000 workers by next year.\n\nStill, China remains an efficient place to do business. Its logistics network is vast and quick-moving. Over the past three decades, China has built 4.7 million kilometres, or about 2.9 million miles, of highways. It has 13 of the world's 50 largest ports, and three of the top five.\n\nChina's sheer manufacturing capabilities are unrivalled. One measure of its output, called manufacturing value added, shows that China makes roughly as much as the United States and Japan combined.\n\n\"The entire supply chain is based in China, so if we were to move, we would still have to procure components in China, and then export them somewhere else,\" said Aaron Emigh, co-founder of Brilliant, a US startup that makes smart-home devices. Brilliant is releasing its product just as the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.\n\n\"Moving out of China is not purely a matter of cost, but of possibility,\" he added.\n\nBrilliant's devices have more than 700 components, most of which are sourced in China. The country offers the best manufacturing options for some of Brilliant's most technical needs, like printing circuit boards, injection-moulded plastics, screens and modules.\n\nSome companies believe they have to look for alternatives no matter how appealing China can be.\n\nInventec, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer of laptops and devices for companies like HP, Toshiba and Acer, has drawn up contingency plans to move China production to Taiwan, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Houston, according to Ada Chang, a spokeswoman.\n\nMoving the entire supply chain out of China would be too complicated, she said. But Inventec could assemble the final product in other places so the \"country of origin\" certificate would not say China, she said.\n\nPeter Baum knows well the challenges of operating in a country like Cambodia. An owner of Baum-Essex, a company that makes umbrellas for Costco and cotton bags for Walmart in contracted factories in Vietnam and Cambodia, he gets frustrated when he has to turn to multiple countries for the parts and material he needs because it means more opportunity for delays.\n\n\"It is the worst nightmare known to man,\" Baum said. He recently finished an order for umbrellas for Costco. The wood handles from Italy were delayed. The polyester from Taiwan was the wrong pattern.\n\n\"I probably lost a couple of hundred thousand on the transaction,\" he said.\n\nCambodia's lack of development in many areas adds its own complications.\n\nHolten, the manufacturer whose company makes products for Oakley, decided to open a factory in Cambodia in 2010. His competitors thought he was crazy, he said, because China was still cheap. \"I saw the writing on the wall,\" said Holten, whose company, Pactics, still makes cloth bags for Burberry in China.\n\nStill, it was not easy, he said. There was no infrastructure, no power and no space appropriate to rent. Pactics had to build its own factory with a water purification system, solar panels and a separate power generator. The project took a year and cost $960,000.\n\nIt was worth it, Holten said. \"If we were still in China,\" he said, \"we'd be out of business.\"\n\nTransition in Cambodia has been slow. Paradoxically, one source of change may be China itself, as it looks to win political favour in Southeast Asia. During an official visit this year, Li Keqiang, China's premier, pledged to build a new expressway from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville to supplement the Khmer-American Friendship Highway.\n\nMore foreign companies have called or emailed Ken Loo, secretary-general at the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia, in recent months about doing business there. His advice: Be realistic.\n\n\"It's not like going into the shop to buy something and you just go to the next shop,\" Loo said. Starting a factory from scratch, he said, \"takes months, if not a year and a half.\" Alexandra Stevenson.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nCambodia\n\nTrade", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-cambodia-250918.jpg?VersionId=jQvKh3OWu3pQwP8SXbIrBbM_WAswzH4e", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Ms Tan informed colleagues of her findings since June 11, but did not report them to the security team or her department head. She assumed that colleagues in the applications team would look into the matter.\n\nJune 26 to 27:\n\nThe attacker successfully logged in to the database and began running numerous queries.\n\nJune 26 to July 8:\n\nThree specific NRIC numbers were targeted through queries. One of these belonged to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The attacker also ran more general queries, such as one which attempted to retrieve the first 20,000 records of patient demographic data from the Singapore General Hospital.\n\nJuly 4:\n\nMr Chai Sze Chun, an assistant lead analyst in IHiS' service delivery division, noticed an \"unusual query\". Ms Tan told him that she had seen similar queries. They realised that someone was trying to access the database through two workstations, and decided to stop the processes whenever they saw these workstations running such queries. No one called to complain that their queries had been terminated.\n\nSome time in July:\n\nMr Chai showed Mr Steven Kuah, his direct superior, an unusual query which was searching for the top 100,000 records from a part of the database. These records contained medical data. \"This query would not have been run by anyone in my team,\" said Mr Kuah in his statement yesterday.\n\nJuly 10: T\n\nhe Ministry of Health, SingHealth and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore were informed after investigations confirmed a cyber attack. A police report was made two days later.\n\nJuly 11:\n\nMr Chan Chee Choong, who works in IHiS' infrastructure services division, reset the passwords for all domain controllers, which handle security authentication for users. Two days later, his team also triggered a password reset for all SingHealth users.\n\nJuly 20:\n\nThe public was informed.\n\nThis started off as reconnaissance on the database, before the person made direct queries on three NRIC numbers. One of these belonged to PM Lee; the other two belonged to \"non-VIPs\".\n\nThe rest of the queries made were more general and related to patient demographic data, Mr Chai said.\n\nFor example, one query sought to retrieve the first 20,000 records of patient demographics from the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).\n\nGiving his testimony yesterday, Mr Chai said that on July 4 he received text messages alerting him to possible performance issues with the SCM database server.\n\nThis led him to notice a particular query that had been running for \"quite a while\" in the database.\n\nThe query stopped running, but Mr Chai decided to investigate further. He realised the combination of the program used to run the query, the account used to access the data, and the work station used for the program was \"unusual\". He said he had not seen queries similar to this one before.\n\nHe tried to trace the user who had run the query, but was unable to do so. That same day he sent e-mails to relevant parties about the query.\n\nMr Steven Kuah, an assistant director in the IHiS' Clinical Care Department and Mr Chai's superior, as well as Mr Chan Chee Choong, manager of the SingHealth Active Directories Team for users in SGH, also testified at the hearing yesterday.\n\nThe high-level COI had heard on the first day of the public hearing last Friday that part of the problem leading to the attack was a lack of situational awareness and a tardy response.\n\nYesterday, Solicitor-General Kwek Mean Luck who has been designated by the Attorney-General to lead evidence in the inquiry, said Mr Chai's statement was among the examples of initiative shown by IHiS staff members.\n\nHe said Mr Chai's actual job scope involved ensuring operational efficiency and not cyber security.\n\n\"Nevertheless when faced with (this matter) he was alert and showed initiative in investigating this security incident,\" said Mr Kwek, a Senior Counsel.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingHealth\n\nCourt trials\n\nAttorney-General\n\nSingHealth COI", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/ST_20180925_VNCHIA_4301968.jpg?VersionId=0akzNhnA9w8s4D_uNPtft5_.tQY18Om0", "alt_text": "Mr Chai Sze Chun, an assistant lead analyst in IHiS' service delivery division, took initiative to investigate the unusual activity even though his role was not in cyber security."}]}

His trial begins on Tuesday.\n\nHe faces 55 counts of corruptly accepting gratification from Chia Sin Lan, director of companies 19-ANC Enterprise and 19-NS2 Enterprise, and Ms Yip Fong Yin, director of 19-NS2.\n\nWong is represented by Mr Tang Shangwei and Ms Melanie Ho of WongPartnership.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Alan Loh told the court on Tuesday: \"As the general manager of AMKTC, (Wong) had the power and ability to influence the award of AMKTC projects. (He) was expected to act with absolute probity, particularly because his job involved the administration of public funds.\"\n\nMr Loh added, however, that instead of exercising his role impartially without favour, Wong \"fell far short of the high standards of integrity demanded of his office and allowed himself to be cultivated by (Chia) and had become beholden to him, 19-ANC, and 19-NS2\".\n\nThe lion's share of gratification which amounted to almost $53,000, said the prosecution, was in the form of entertainment expenses Wong and Chia incurred at KTV lounges and massage parlours, which they frequented often at night.\n\nAccording to the Building and Construction Authority's directory, both businesses are licensed builders and registered to carry out repair and redecoration works.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He also faces one count of abetment for allegedly conspiring with Ms Yip to bribe Wong by making arrangements for Wong to receive the $13,500 car purchase discount, and is represented by Mr Michael Loh of Clifford Law.\n\nChia's two companies face one charge each of corruption for conspiring to bribe Wong to advance their business interests with the town council.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau officer who took the stand read out statements given by Wong during investigations.\n\nWong had said he was aware that 19-ANC was trying to build good relations with him. He added that the discount on his car purchase from Ms Yip - supposedly for the high mileage it clocked - should have been only about $1,000 and not more than $10,000 that was given.\n\n\"I wish to say that it was bad judgment on my part,\" he told the officer.\n\nHe also said he should not have let Chia and his associate pay when they went out drinking together, that he had not gone for such sessions with other contractors. Wong said he had gone out with Chia as he was troubled due to problems in his marriage.\n\nWong, the most senior executive in the town council, was removed from duty after it received a complaint about him in September 2016 over the way he handled contracts and dealings in the town council.\n\nHe was later\n\ninvestigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau\n\nand was charged in March.\n\nThe town council\n\nappointed a new general manager, Mr Ang Boon Peng\n\n, in April 2017 - about five months after Wong was removed.\n\nThe trial this week is expected to take place over three days. If convicted, Wong and Chia could be fined up to $100,000 and jailed for a maximum of seven years on each charge.

This was in exchange for the American firm getting a 27.5 per cent stake in Grab, as well as a seat on the Singapore-based firm's board.\n\nThe CCCS noted that since the merger, effective fares had risen by about 10 to 15 per cent while drivers' commissions had shrunk.\n\nWhile it was too late to unwind the deal, the commission set out directions aimed at easing the impact on both riders and drivers and levelling the playing field for other competitors. Under these measures, Grab will have to remove its existing exclusivity arrangements with taxi fleets and drivers, as well as maintain pre-merger pricing algorithm and driver commission rates.\n\nUber will also be required to sell vehicles from its car rental arm Lion City Rentals - which was not included in the deal with Grab - to any potential competitor with a \"reasonable offer\", and will need the approval of CCCS to sell them to Grab.\n\nThese measures could be suspended if a competitor attains a 30 per cent share of the market for one month. Both Uber and Grab would have their penalties lifted if this competitor maintains a 30 per cent share for six consecutive months, the CCCS said.\n\nNoting the existing players each held less than 5 per cent of the market, Mr Toh said: \"We don't rule out joint ventures between the parties so that they can operate more like a single entity.\"\n\nUber and Grab will be given up to a month to appeal against the decision, said Mr Toh.\n\nResponding to the CCCS decision, Grab Singapore head Lim Kell Jay said the firm was glad the deal with Uber was not unwound, but insisted it was legal and that Grab did not \"intentionally or negligently\" breach competition laws.\n\nUber's chief international business officer Brooks Entwistle said the American firm was \"disappointed\" with the decision.\n\nBoth firms said they will review the CCCS ruling before deciding whether to appeal.\n\nThe Land Transport Authority said it supports the CCCS decision, adding it was in line with its own ongoing review of the sector.\n\nSEE\n\nTOP OF THE NEWS\n\nSee more on\n\nCompetition laws\n\nGrab\n\nUber\n\nCCCS/Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-grab-220918.jpg?VersionId=OewfRKAlxwiKN7R6LTZ.VrhZs5qPP29w", "alt_text": null}]}

They include selling off many of its remaining stores and asking lenders to exchange their loans for equity stakes in the beleaguered company.\n\nESL's proposal, outlined in a securities filing on Monday, amounts to a wholesale financial restructuring of Sears outside a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\nIf it is enacted, Sears' debt would fall to about US$1.2 billion, freeing up cash to be reinvested in its struggling retail operations.\n\nWhile Sears has been troubled for years, ESL's proposal signals an increased urgency from Lampert. His firm is warning that Sears now faces \"significant near-term liquidity constraints,\" with US$134 million in debt coming due in a few weeks.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Analysts say that is far from certain, as Sears keeps losing money and customers to more nimble and digitally adept competitors.\n\nThe latest rescue attempt is also complicated because ESL is controlled by Lampert, who has an unusual role at Sears. He is its chief executive and chairman, and in addition to being the largest shareholder, his hedge fund holds roughly 40 per cent of Sears's debt. This gives him claim on a great deal of the company's assets, particularly its real estate.\n\nA bankruptcy filing would probably reduce what Lampert could recover, as fees to lawyers and advisers eat into what is left over to pay him and other creditors. Toys R Us, which filed one of the largest retail bankruptcies in history in September 2017, paid hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees while being forced to liquidate all its US stores.\n\n\"Sears must act immediately to have sufficient runway to continue its transformation,\" ESL said in its filing on Monday.\n\nThis is not the first time Lampert has sought to do a deal with a company where he holds significant sway.\n\nLast month, ESL offered to buy Sears' Kenmore brand for US$400 million. A special committee of the retailer's board is still reviewing that offer.\n\nIn his biggest deal, three years ago, he and other investors formed a real estate company called Seritage and paid US$2.7 billion for about 235 Sears stores, including many in prime locations. Many of those are being turned into upscale offices, condominiums and restaurants, an investment that has been a boon for Lampert and other Seritage investors.\n\nReal estate is a key component of Lampert's latest idea. He proposes that Sears' lenders - whose loans are secured by the company's stores - stop collecting interest for a year while the company tries to sell those stores.\n\nAfter a year, if Sears fails to sell enough stores to pay off US$1.4 billion in debt, then it will sell the stores to the lenders for a price equal to the value of their debt.\n\nLampert has the most at stake. His hedge fund owns roughly US$1.1 billion of Sears debt secured by stores, according to the securities filing.\n\n\"We are ready and willing to move as quickly as possible to help the company transform into a business that is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century,\" ESL said in its proposal.\n\nSee more on\n\nBankruptcy/Liquidation\n\nRetail", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-sears-250918.jpg?VersionId=dGagatN8vkNmUEaH2GXlFheg72becDl.", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

The bulk of migrants stopped trying to cross the border are now from those three violent and impoverished Central American nations.\n\nSince Trump became president, Hernandez said the United States had shown great willingness to work on combating street gangs known as maras that have menaced Central America. But it was less ready to support the region financially, he noted.\n\nUnder a scheme to strengthen Central America launched in 2014 known as the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, the United States pledged to put forward a dollar for every four invested by Honduras, Hernandez said.\n\nBut that commitment has not materialised, he added.\n\n\"That will obviously have repercussions,\" he told Reuters.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Vijayan\n\nFollow topic:\n\nChief Justice\n\nPublished\n\nSep 25, 2018, 05:00 AM\n\nIn its 100-year history, law firm Shook Lin & Bok, which has produced two Chief Justices, has come to be a part of the Singapore story, having made many contributions in the past.\n\nMinister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah said at the celebration of its centenary that the firm has added something unique to the rich tapestry that is Singapore and this comes at a time when the Government is positioning the country for more growth opportunities.\n\n\"This is a firm with a sterling history,\" said Ms Indranee, who is also Second Minister for Finance and Education. \"The firm's founders set high standards of integrity, quality, commitment, professionalism, mutual respect and collaboration - guiding principles which Shook Lin & Bok's lawyers continue to hold themselves to today,\" she said at the reception last Friday to mark the milestone.\n\nCambridge-educated lawyer Yong Shook Lin set up Shook Lin in 1918 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya. He was later joined by Oxford-trained Queen's Scholar Tan Teow Bok and the firm became Shook Lin & Bok. Mr Yong's son Pung How returned from Cambridge to join the firm in 1952. Under the latter's management, it became one of the best known and largest law firms in Malaya.\n\nIn 1964, Mr Thean Lip Ping, a partner in the firm, came to Singapore to set up what was meant to be a \"Singapore branch office\".\n\nAfter the state's separation from Malaysia, Shook Lin & Bok, Singapore became an independent law firm.\n\nThe firm progressed rapidly along with Singapore's post-independence prosperity and became one of the country's largest law firms. Today, it is a leading full-service law firm with over 100 lawyers.\n\n\"Shook Lin & Bok has produced some prominent members of Singapore's legal fraternity including the former chief justices Yong Pung How and Chan Sek Keong, Justices L.P. Thean, Philip Pillai and Vinodh Coomaraswamy, and Senior Counsel Sarjit Singh Gill,\" said Ms Indranee.\n\nShe held out the firm's active and long-standing outreach abroad as a model, saying it was the first in Singapore to establish a dedicated China practice in 1988. \"Our professional services must grow exports of services to regional and global markets in order to enhance Singapore's global market position. Shook Lin & Bok's foray into the Chinese and Indian markets is a good example of how we hope companies can grow in the region.\"\n\nIts involvement in numerous landmark deals includes Singapore's first flagship project with China in the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park and most recently, Asia's largest private equity buyout ($16 billion) of Global Logistics Properties.\n\nLegal historian and National University of Singapore Law Adjunct Professor Kevin Tan said: \"Shook Lin & Bok acquired its awesome reputation and thus attracted many good lawyers primarily because of L.P. Thean and Chan Sek Keong in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\"\n\nSenior Counsel Sarjit Singh Gill added: \"Few firms have enjoyed such longevity and sustained prominence in Singapore.\"\n\nRetired CJ Chan, a former senior partner of Shook Lin & Bok, said of the firm: \"It has to this day maintained its reputation of providing sound legal advice, gaining the trust and support of clients. Added to that, the firm has a young and dynamic partnership to steer it ahead and forge new grounds. I am proud to say that the firm has come a long way.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nChief Justice\n\nLaw firms", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-bok-220918.jpg?VersionId=jDb_qQ09Ii5Fy7jLFhrLM4JGMjQXFY5l", "alt_text": null}]}

These consolidated shares will be traded on the Singapore Exchange's Catalist board in lots of 100 shares, Metech said.\n\nThe firm added that shareholders should note that the number of consolidated shares they will be entitled to \"will be rounded down to the nearest whole consolidated share, and any fractions of a consolidated share arising from the proposed share consolidation will bedisregarded\".\n\nIn an exchange filing to the Singapore bourse on Monday, Metech also noted that the proposed share consolidation will have no impact on the dollar value of the issued and paid-up share capital of the company and will not cause any material changes to the percentage shareholding of each shareholder, other than non-material changes due to the rounding and disregard of the fractional entitlement.\n\nFor the six-month period between March and August, and up to Sept 21, Metech's six-month volume weighted average price (VWAP) of each share stood at 0.3 cent. Following the completion of the proposed share consolidation, the theoretical adjusted six-month VWAP of each consolidated share will be 15 cents, the company said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Rising home prices and climbing sales were among signs the city-state's residential market was emerging from a deep freeze. That all changed on July 5, when the government shocked the industry by imposing a fresh set of curbs that came into effect at midnight the following day.\n\nNow, the trade has reversed. The FTSE Straits Times Reits Index is outperforming a benchmark that tracks developers. Property stocks, which had their best annual gain in five years in 2017, have declined 5.4 per cent since July 5, while Reits are up 0.7 per cent over the same period.\n\n\"There's been a lack of interest in developer stocks post the cooling measures and some of that capital has moved out to other sectors,\" Vijay Natarajan, an analyst at RHB Research Institute Singapore Pte, said in a phone interview. \"The market had not expected the severity of the measures announced.\"\n\nSingapore took renewed steps to cool home prices after they rose more than 7 per cent in the first six months.\n\nUnder the new rules, individuals taking out their first housing loan face stricter borrowing limits, meaning they have to stump up more cash upfront. For foreign purchasers of residential property, the additional buyer's stamp duty was increased to 20 per cent from 15 per cent.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Developers may lower asking prices by as much as 10 per cent following the cooling measures, according to Jefferies Singapore analyst Krishna Guha, who said he prefers Reitss post the curbs.\n\nMacroeconomic uncertainties have also kept sentiment subdued for developer stocks, and investors see Reitss as a safe haven, according to DBS Group Holdings analysts Mervin Song and Derek Tan. Among the property trusts, the office sector looks the most attractive, followed by industrial trusts, they said. CapitaLand Commercial Trust - Singapore's largest office landlord - and Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust are among their top picks.\n\nLow vacancy levels have encouraged office landlords to seek higher rents, with the cost for grade A space rising 4.1 per cent to $10.10 per square foot a month in the quarter ended June, the fastest pace since the March quarter of 2014, CBRE Group Inc. data show.\n\nHigher rents and low vacancy rates should work to cushion the impact from interest-rate increases, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Patrick Wong and Kristy Hung.\n\n\"Developer stocks are subject to high policy risk,\" Mr Wong said. \"Real estate investment demand will further concentrate on the commercial market and support the growth in capital value of commercial properties owned by major landlords.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nReits\n\nProperty market/sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-skyline-250918.jpg?VersionId=5inJvZSjmEdAvpkzZBX.gnBvlBehjEYF", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

He told her she could go for surgery and rely on Western medicine for recovery; go for surgery and rely on TCM; or postpone surgery for three months and undergo TCM treatment.\n\nThe patient paid more than $6,000 for Mr Chua's treatment programme and did not go for the scheduled operation.\n\nBut the patient's son confronted Mr Chua the next day, and the woman's operation was eventually carried out on Nov 8, 2014.\n\nSee more on\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine\n\nHealth and well-being", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/24/tw-tcm-2409_0.jpg?VersionId=DJU6ALKe.CSaGESjjEgejZDKwrGVPdBN", "alt_text": null}]}

The two sides had already slapped tariffs on US$50 billion worth of each other's goods.\n\nFor US consumers, the new duties could translate into higher prices for Chinese products ranging from vacuum cleaners to technology gear such as home modems and routers, while US goods targeted by Beijing include liquefied natural gas and certain types of aircraft.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is pressing China to reduce its huge bilateral trade surplus and make sweeping changes to its policies on trade, technology transfers and high-tech industrial subsidies.\n\nBeijing has denied that US companies are forced to transfer technology and sees Washington's demands on rolling back its industrial policies as an attempt to contain China's economic rise.\n\nThe US administration \"has brazenly preached unilateralism, protectionism and economic hegemony, making false accusations against many countries and regions, particularly China, intimidating other countries through economic measures such as imposing tariffs,\" Xinhua quoted the State Council's white paper as saying.\n\n'NO END IN SIGHT FOR TRADE WAR'\n\nSeveral rounds of Sino-US trade talks in recent months have yielded no major breakthroughs, and attempts at arranging another meeting in coming weeks have fallen through.\n\nA senior White House official said last week the United States will continue to engage China, but added there was no date for further talks. China, which has accused Washington of being insincere in the negotiations, has decided not to send Vice-Premier Liu He to Washington this week, the Wall Street Journal reported late last week.\n\nNews of Beijing's decision to skip the talks pushed China's yuan currency down 0.3 per cent on Monday in offshore trade, reinforcing investors' fears that both sides are digging in for a long fight. Mainland China markets were closed for a holiday.\n\nEconomists warn that a protracted dispute will eventually stunt growth across the globe. Companies on both sides of the Pacific are already reporting disruptions to their operations and are reviewing investment plans.\n\nThe trade tensions have also cast a pall over broader relations between Beijing and Washington, with the two sides butting heads on a growing number of issues.\n\nChina summoned the US ambassador in Beijing and postponed military talks in protest against a US decision to sanction a Chinese military agency and its director for buying Russian fighter jets and a missile system.\n\nRob Carnell, ING's chief Asia economist, said in a note to clients that in the absence of any incentives Beijing would likely hold off on any further negotiations for now.\n\n\"It would look weak both to the US and at home,\" he said, adding that there is \"sufficient stimulus in the pipeline\" to limit the damage of the latest tariffs on China's economy. \"The US-China trade war has no clear end in sight.\"\n\nChina may also be waiting for US midterm congressional elections early next month for any hints of changes in Washington's policy stance, Carnell added.\n\n\"With generic polls favouring the Democrats, they may feel that the trade environment will be less hostile after Nov 6.\"\n\nThe China Daily, Beijing's official English newspaper, paid for a four-page advertising supplement on Sunday in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the politically important state of Iowa.\n\nThe insert, which called the trade war the \"fruit of a president's folly\", highlighted the dispute's impact on a slew of US agricultural sectors, including soybean farmers, pecan nut growers and seafood exporters.\n\nIowa's corn, soybean and hog sectors will lose between US$1.68 billion and US$2.2 billion in revenues because of the trade fights, according to a recent study by Iowa State University.\n\nThe state is the top US producer of corn and pork, and a leading producer of soybeans, eggs and poultry. Trump earlier this month accused China of targeting rural voters who support his presidency by hitting agricultural goods. Beijing has repeatedly denied the charge.\n\nWASHINGTON READYING MORE MEASURES\n\nTrump on Saturday reiterated a threat to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods should Beijing retaliate, suggesting that Washington may slap tariffs on virtually all imported Chinese goods if the administration does not get its way.\n\nChina imports far less from the United States, making a dollar-for-dollar match on any new US tariffs impossible.\n\nInstead, it has warned of \"qualitative\" measures to retaliate. Though Beijing has not revealed what such steps might be, business executives and analysts say it could withhold exports of certain products to the United States or create more administrative red tape for American companies operating in China.\n\nSome analysts say there is also a risk that China could allow its currency to weaken again to cushion the blow to its exporters.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/file71yolrcvblv4tu1up73.jpg?VersionId=NzqROjEz4wx5JZ6jVXQpyVhBIcBYIpvH", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Few said they saw attacks against them by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the Islamic militant group whose assaults on military posts in October 2016 triggered the crackdown.\n\nThe violence in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was unleashed soon after the country transitioned to democracy, undermining what Western governments had hailed as a triumph of engagement.\n\nThe campaign against the Rohingya has especially tarnished the reputation of Aung San Suu Kyi, the long-detained democracy advocate and Nobel laureate who has been reticent in addressing the violence.\n\nHelp for refugees\n\nMore than 700,000 Rohingya took refuge in Bangladesh, fearful of returning to Myanmar despite a repatriation deal between the two countries.\n\nMeanwhile, Britain hosted a meeting of about a dozen foreign ministers that was also attended by Myanmar's state counsellor Kyaw Tint Swe and International Cooperation Minister Kyaw Tin, although Suu Kyi did not come to New York.\n\nFresh from a visit to Myanmar, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that military leaders must answer for any atrocities committed against the Rohingya, a foreign office spokesperson said.\n\n\"If, in a year's time, we have not made a meaningful difference to the lives of the million or more people affected, then we have failed as an international community,\" Hunt told the closed meeting, according to the spokesperson.\n\nUS Ambassador Nikki Haley announced the US$185 million for food, water, health care and other critical aid to the refugees, even as the United States dramatically scales back its admission of refugees.\n\nMyanmar's army chief Min Aung Hlaing was recently quoted in a newspaper as telling his troops that no country, organisation or group has the \"right to interfere in and make decision over sovereignty of a country.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMyanmar\n\nRohingya", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/25/nz-rohingya-250918.jpg?VersionId=tJfYThmyNQ005.Q3Mah85XtamgFpcYzH", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

Other media reports said that the deputy attorney general expected to be fired.\n\n\"At the request of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he and President Trump had an extended conversation to discuss the recent news stories,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. \"They will meet on Thursday when the president returns to Washington.\"\n\nThe disputed details of what Rosenstein discussed with his colleagues last year about covertly taping the president set off a firestorm in Washington.\n\nA person who was present at that meeting said he was joking, but the New York Times, which first reported the incident on Friday, cited secondhand accounts indicating Rosenstein was serious about the proposal.\n\nThe Times said Rosenstein also discussed identifying cabinet members willing to invoke the 25th Amendment, which provides for the removal of a president who's unfit for office.\n\nThe departure of Rosenstein, who named Mueller to be special counsel in May 2017, has enormous implications for the Russia investigation and for the president.\n\nA successor to Rosenstein would have the power to fire Mueller or rein in his investigation.\n\nRosenstein's resignation was reported earlier Monday by Axios.\n\nDemocratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said Mueller's probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 election - including whether anyone close to Trump colluded in it and whether Trump sought to obstruct the inquiry - needs additional protection in light of Rosenstein's expected departure.\n\nProtecting Mueller\n\n\"The Senate must step up to protect the Special Counsel immediately,\" she said in a tweet.\n\n\"We must pass the bipartisan bill to protect the Mueller investigation. The American people deserve answers about Russian interference in our democracy.\"\n\nCurrent and former government officials, including lawmakers, had long warned Trump against firing or pushing out Rosenstein. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned Trump against seizing on the report that Rosenstein suggested covertly taping him.\n\n\"This story must not be used as a pretext for the corrupt purpose of firing Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein in order to install an official who will allow the president to interfere with the Special Counsel's investigation,\" Schumer said.\n\nHe added that many \"White House and cabinet officials have been reported to say critical things of the president without being fired.\"\n\nMueller has charged 25 Russian people and companies for election interference. He also has won guilty pleas and cooperation agreements from people around Trump, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nMueller has dismissed as a \"witch hunt\" the inquiry into possible collusion with Russia and whether Trump conspired to obstruct justice.\n\nRosenstein made the decision to name a special counsel days after he took charge of the Russia probe, which he inherited when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the matter. Trump has mocked and criticised Sessions for doing so.\n\nNaming Replacement\n\nTrump can install a temporary replacement as deputy attorney general until he nominates a successor to Rosenstein who would have to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department has a line of succession that could let Solicitor General Noel Francisco assume control of the investigation.\n\nOne question is whether that would be considered inappropriate given that Francisco is a former partner of the Jones Day law firm, which has represented Trump for years.\n\nAs solicitor general, Francisco has staunchly defended Trump administration policies while pursuing long-held conservative legal goals.\n\nHe successfully defended Trump's travel ban, drawing criticism for saying at argument that the president had \"made crystal clear\" he wasn't trying to impose barring Muslims.\n\nFrancisco later sent the court a letter saying he had misstated the date on which Trump supposedly made those comments.\n\nHe reversed what had been the Obama administration's position on a number of high-profile issues in the court's last term. Earlier this year, Francisco was photographed having dinner in downtown Washington with Sessions and Rosenstein in what some viewed as a show of support for an attorney general who was being sharply criticised by the president.\n\nFrancisco has been studiously silent about the Mueller probe, at least in public.\n\nRosenstein, 53, was chosen by Trump to be the No. 2 official at the Justice Department last year. He previously served for 12 years as US attorney for the District of Maryland during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nRosenstein joined the Justice Department in 1990 and has been viewed as a respected public servant, credited with helping reshape the department's priorities.\n\nRepublican Critics In May, he stood up against Republican lawmakers who drafted articles of impeachment against him for refusing to turn over internal Justice Department documents that they said would reveal the questionable origins of the Russia probe.\n\n\"There are people who have been making threats, privately and publicly, against me for quite some time,\" Rosenstein said at a Law Day event in Washington. \"I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted. We're going to do what's required by the rule of law.\"\n\nRepublican Representative Jim Jordan, a House Judiciary member who has been among the lawmakers most critical of Rosenstein and the Russia probe, said on Twitter Monday that the deputy attorney general needs to appear before the panel regardless of whether he keeps his job.\n\n\"You can't have the head of the Justice Department (even if it's sarcasm) talking to subordinates about recording the Commander in Chief,\" Jordan said. \"He needs to answer our questions.\"\n\nBut Rosenstein also riled some of Trump's critics in 2017, when he wrote a controversial letter outlining the case for firing then-FBI Director James Comey, saying he made \"serious mistakes\" in his handling of the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server.\n\nTrump cited Rosenstein's letter in firing Comey, although he later said it was because of the Russia investigation. Trump grew increasingly angry at Mueller's investigation, and at\n\nRosenstein's supervision of it.\n\nHe discussed dismissing Rosenstein with aides at the White House in April, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nTrump and some Republican lawmakers have pressed the argument that Mueller's inquiry should be shut down because it was irreversibly tainted by improper actions early in the inquiry, well before Mueller was appointed.\n\nRosenstein named Mueller as special counsel after Trump fired Comey, who had been overseeing the investigation.\n\nRosenstein took control of the inquiry because Attorney General Sessions, an early Trump campaign supporter, recused himself from any matters related to the 2016 election, a move the president has openly derided.\n\n\"I don't have an attorney general. It's very sad,\" Trump said in an interview with Hill.TV, the Capitol Hill newspaper's online TV channel, that aired on Sept 19.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/24/yq-rosenstein-24092018.jpg?VersionId=zp4aKGbP_V15vAgpO34E6PPSBxMS_sSm", "alt_text": null}]}

They received their information from inmates at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) who suggested places for the team to spread the anti-drug message through decals and brochures.\n\nThe Dadah itu Haram campaign secretariat has been spearheading efforts to spread the anti-drug message in the Malay-Muslim community here since April last year.\n\nHome Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam on Monday (Sept 24) awarded the team, made up of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), the Singapore Prison Service and the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Minister for Home Affairs Home Team Achievement Award.\n\nThe award recognises teams which have contributed exceptionally to Singapore's safety and security through inter-agency collaborations.\n\nThe 132 awards, given out at the Minister's Awards Presentation Ceremony at the Home Team Academy, included the Minister for Home Affairs Operational Excellence Awards, Star Service Awards and Home Team Innovation Awards.\n\nSuperintendent Saherly Limat, 45, who has been in the CNB for 20 years, said the seven-person team works with Malay-Muslim organisations such as Muis and Mendaki to solve the drug issue.\n\n\"For a team that is doing something soft in the sense that it's not the usual high-risk operations, to be able to achieve this is a morale-booster for us,\" he said.\n\nDadah itu Haram is Malay for \"Drugs are forbidden\". There is an over-representation of Malays among those jailed for drugs, and something needs to be done about it, said Superintendent Saherly.\n\nThe team speaks to DRC inmates to find out their interests and where they spend their free time. From the information, they identify groups they can work with to reach out to the community. These groups include students from the institutes of higher learning and riders from motorcycle clubs.\n\nWhile there is no way to quantify the programme's tangible outcomes, surveys are being done to measure its effectiveness.\n\nMr Shanmugam said in his speech that the work of every single Home Team officer impacts how Singaporeans view the organisation, and how they feel about their own safety and security.\n\n\"Our people have confidence, and they must have confidence not just in the capabilities of the Home Team, but also in the professionalism and the fairness with which our officers discharge their duties,\" he said.\n\n\"That will then help to anchor the wider trust in the criminal justice system, in the Police force, our uniformed forces, SCDF, Prisons, CNB, the entire machinery, and ultimately Singapore itself.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nK Shanmugam\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/09/24/hzcnb9824.jpg?VersionId=84KxmrbTBVryLi5OasH4aBGdVySEnPet", "alt_text": null}]}
