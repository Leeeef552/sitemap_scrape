It's so much faster in the corners,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"The force you feel on your body and on your neck is much higher. I've got bruises and bumps where I've never really had them before.\n\n\"Physically I feel fine, though, as it's only half a day of testing. I've trained enough over the winter to be ready for more.\"\n\nBottas didn't trouble the top of the timesheets with only the seventh fastest lap, but did log an impressive 102 laps in just a few hours.\n\nThe former Williams driver even shrugged off a minor spin to complete a full race simulation.\n\n\"I had a small off but it wasn't anything serious,\" said Bottas.\n\n\"I lost the rear end with a gust of tail wind that was quite sudden. This is testing - you need to find the limits.\"\n\nThat sort of reliability is something the beleaguered McLaren-Honda team can only dream of as they suffered another day dogged by reliability problems.\n\nBelgian rookie Stoffel Vandoorne managed just 40 laps to add to the limited 29 former world champion Fernando Alonso completed on Monday.\n\nVandoorne also had to have the power unit completely replaced on his MCL32.\n\nOnly Williams suffered a more disappointing day as Canadian Lance Stroll registered just 12 laps before a spin into the gravel brought a premature end to his day before lunch.\n\nDutch wonder kid Max Verstappen had a quietly effective day for Red Bull with the third fastest time and 89 laps, albeit well over a second behind Raikkonen and Hamilton.\n\n\"For us it's not about showing how quick we can be at the moment,\" said Verstappen.\n\n\"It's the first test week and the second day, so it's much more important to get some mileage in and to check if all the parts are okay.\n\n\"The speed difference compared to the cars from last year is a good step; it's definitely more enjoyable through the faster corners.\"\n\nRed Bull were the only team to deny Mercedes a clean sweep of 21 race victories last season as Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo claimed one won apiece at the Spanish and Malaysian Grand Prixs respectively.\n\nAnd Ricciardo believes Mercedes can be beaten this season.\n\n\"We can beat them,\" the Australian told Sky Sports. \"We've got the same set of rules as everybody else so there's no reason why we can't across the course of the season.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMotor racing\n\nMercedes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/03/01/41718871_-_28_02_2017_-_auto-prix-f1-test-esp.jpg?VersionId=4EM5yXefKxwbY49xCQRLPcbekSG8USwG", "alt_text": null}]}

Kazakhstan, Ethiopia and Egypt abstained.\n\nUN resolutions require nine positive votes and no veto to be adopted.\n\nIt was the seventh time that Russia, Syria's top military ally, has used its veto power to shield the Damascus regime.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin had warned earlier that imposing sanctions on Syria was \"completely inappropriate\" while talks were ongoing in Geneva on ending the war.\n\nUS Ambassador Nikki Haley shot back: \"This resolution is very appropriate.\"\n\n\"It is a sad day on the Security Council when members start making excuses for other member states killing their own people,\" she said.\n\n\"The world is definitely a more dangerous place,\" she told the council after the measure was rejected.\n\nThe resolution would have put 11 Syrians, mainly military commanders, and 10 entities linked to chemical attacks in 2014 and 2015 on a UN sanctions blacklist.\n\nIt included a ban on the sale of helicopters and of chemical agents to the Syrian armed forces or the government.\n\nA UN-led investigation concluded in October that the Syrian air force had dropped chlorine barrel-bombs from helicopters on three opposition-held villages in 2014 and 2015.\n\nFrench Ambassador Francois Delattre said the vote was a \"moment of truth\" for the council, arguing that chemical weapons use was a \"negation of all civilisation.\"\n\nThe joint panel of the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) also found that Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants used mustard gas in an attack in 2015.\n\nThe vote marked the first major council action by the new US administration of President Donald Trump, who is seeking warmer ties with Russia.\n\nFrance and Britain had circulated the proposed measure in December and the new US administration joined as a co-sponsor of the draft resolution this month.\n\nRussian Deputy Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov echoed Putin's view that imposing sanctions would have undermined peace talks and described the draft resolution as a \"provocation\" by the Western \"troika\".\n\nThe Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons in the war that has killed 310,000 people since March 2011.\n\nChinese Ambassador Liu Jieyi argued that sanctions were premature and that the UN-OPCW panel should be allowed to complete its investigations.\n\n\"At present, investigations are still ongoing and therefore it is too early to reach a final conclusion,\" Liu told the council.\n\nChina has joined Russia in vetoing six resolutions on Syria.\n\nBritain, France and the United States are the other veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council.\n\nUN-brokered talks that opened on Thursday in Geneva ran into hurdles after Russia insisted that counter-terrorism be added to the agenda - putting pressure on opposition groups with ties to Islamist fighters.\n\nPutin - whose military intervention in Syria helped turn the tables in favor of Assad - lamented that the negotiations in Switzerland are \"not going as smoothly as hoped.\"\n\nRussia used its veto power twice to block demands for a ceasefire in Aleppo, the Syrian city that was seized by government forces in December.\n\nRussia and China also blocked in 2014 a request for the International Criminal Court to open up investigations of war crimes committed during the war in Syria.\n\nSee more on\n\nUN\n\nRussia\n\nChina\n\nSyria", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/03/01/41720138_-_01_03_2017_-_mideast-crisis_syria-chemicalweapons.jpg?VersionId=t9jmoLE8yt2NLjaTPpG7.Dngo_npvPVy", "alt_text": null}]}

Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, rose 3 per cent, more than projected, Commerce Department data showed Tuesday.\n\nThe results reinforce the leading role that consumers continue to play in the current expansion, helped by a tight job market, low borrowing costs and rising confidence. Optimism that President Donald Trump will lower taxes, reduce regulation and rebuild infrastructure may also encourage businesses to step up investment this year, contributing to growth.\n\nEconomists' growth estimates ranged from 1.7 per cent to 2.6 per cent. The GDP release is the second of three for the quarter, with the third scheduled for late March, when more information is available. The economy expanded at a 3.5 per cent pace in the third quarter.\n\nThe revision showed GDP grew 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the same as the initial estimate. That's about in line with the average 2 per cent pace of the current expansion which began in mid-2009.\n\nPresident Trump aims to double the pace of growth and may provide details in his address to Congress later Tuesday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said new policies will lead to expansion of 3 per cent or higher, while the White House website pledges a \"return to 4 per cent annual economic growth.\"\n\nAt the same time, Mr Mnuchin has played down expectations that Mr Trump will boost growth right away, saying last week that reaching 3 per cent expansion could come later in 2018 as policy changes take effect.\n\nThe fourth-quarter revisions to household spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the economy, compared with an initial estimate of 2.5 per cent and the median analyst projection of 2.6 per cent. Purchases added 2.05 percentage points to growth, more than the prior reading of 1.7 points.\n\nThe revision reflected greater spending on used automobiles and on health-care services, the Commerce Department said.\n\nIn a sign that households have the wherewithal to spend, the latest figures showed an upward revision to wages and salaries, which helped disposable income grow at a 2 per cent pace, faster than the 1.5 per cent initially reported.\n\nNonresidential fixed investment increased at a 1.3 per cent annualized pace, less than initially estimated. That added 0.17 percentage point to growth, down from a previous reading of a 0.3-point addition.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment rose 1.9 per cent, the first increase in five quarters, though below the prior estimate of 3.1 per cent. The change reflects an upward revision to aircraft exports, which subtract from the calculation of fixed investment, the Commerce Department said.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS economy\n\nGDP", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/41550826_-_17_02_2017_-_us-economy-market.jpg?VersionId=l41cir3LPdkU2H.QzDnCVzBS.livRXEX", "alt_text": null}]}

Its latest flagship, the LG G6, unveiled at the Mobile World Congress 2017, returns to the basics of what makes a premium, top-line phone.\n\nThe G6 meets all the basic requirements that flagships across the board have these days - a Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM and two rear cameras.\n\nWhat immediately stands out is the phone's screen, stretched out nearly edge-to-edge to give an almost bezel-less look. LG went with the bold decision to implement a 18:9 screen ratio, rather than the traditional 16:9, so that its 5.7-inch display feels and looks even bigger than it is.\n\nThe quad-HD display is bright and colourful from all angles, with every inch of screen estate used to the fullest.\n\nThe phone feels very premium, if a bit hefty and chunky in the hand. It is a bit thicker than its competitor's flagships, coming in at 7.9mm thick.\n\nThe glass and aluminium construction of the G6 lends it an air of class, and its size and material all help to give an impression of a firm, sturdy and well-built phone.\n\nThe two 13-megapixel rear cameras work fantastically, giving clear, sharp shots even in harsh indoor lighting. There are also modes to toggle between a regular lens and a wide-angle lens, which stretches to a 125-degree view for landscape shots.\n\nThe G6 also ported over a quad digital-to-analog converter, found in LG's V20 launched last year, which boosts the power of the phone to play high-resolution audio. Audiophiles have already flocked to the V20 as their phone of choice and now they have another one to choose from.\n\nG6 is, however, a step behind V20, because of its non-removable 3,300mAh battery.\n\nThere is no word yet on local pricing and availability, although it will go on sale in its native South Korea on March 9.\n\nSee more on\n\nSmartphones\n\nTech review", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/dw-mwc-lgg61-170228.png?VersionId=Ha61rAPWPetbCmNxEQ6OGr9SxwN3AkYV", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/dw-mwc-lgg62-170228.png?VersionId=SMYNI5EcDeane68lGyky2bnIM35hL_WD", "alt_text": null}]}

The people requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak about the private meeting.\n\nThe idea is a sharp break from the broad crackdown on undocumented immigrants that Trump has taken in his first weeks in office and the hard-line positions embraced by his core supporters that helped sweep him into the White House. The president hinted at the reversal just hours before he was to deliver his first address to Congress, although it was not clear whether he would mention it in his speech.\n\nA move toward a comprehensive immigration overhaul would be a dramatic turnaround for the president, whose campaign rallies rang with shouts of \"build the wall!\" on the Mexican border and who signed an executive order in January directing the deportation of any undocumented immigrant who has committed a crime - whether or not they have been charged - or falsified any document. The standard could apply to virtually any one of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally.\n\nThe White House did not dispute the report, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, said she had not witnessed the conversation so was unable to confirm it.\n\n\"The president has been very clear in his process that the immigration system is broken and needs massive reform, and he's made clear that he's open to having conversations about that moving forward,\" Sanders said. \"Right now, his primary focus, as he has made over and over again is border control and security at the border and deporting criminals from our country, and keeping our country safe, and those priorities have not changed.\" The president's remarks about immigration came the day before Trump was to issue a new version his executive order banning travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries and suspending the acceptance of refugees. The ban has been revised because of legal challenges.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nImmigration laws", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/03/01/trump_immig.jpg?VersionId=CZTAt4rRhfaOmqFMFpiG_A2fI8uxakqL", "alt_text": null}]}

But the scandal shows no sign of going away anytime soon.\n\n\"There are so many questions that need to be answered,\" said Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University and sharp critic of the Abe government.\n\n\"We don't know whether Abe was directly involved but even if he wasn't, this will still hurt him.\"\n\nIt all started with a local story about hate speech.\n\nTsukamoto kindergarten in Toyonaka, Osaka prefecture, sent a letter to parents in which it described Korean residents of Japan and Chinese people as having \"wicked ideas,\" using a derogatory term for Chinese.\n\nYasunori Kagoike, the chairman of the organisation that runs the private kindergarten, has admitted to sending the letter.\n\nA separate note said: \"The problem is that people who have inherited the spirit (of Koreans) exist in our country with the looks of Japanese people.\" Kyodo News reported the contents of the letter, citing a copy obtained from a parent.\n\nA video from a sports day in 2015, also obtained by Kyodo, shows a child at the school saying: \"We want China and South Korea, which portray Japan as a villain, to be repentant. We'll root for Prime Minister Abe.\"\n\nOsaka is home to a high proportion of Japan's ethnically Korean residents, a legacy of Japan's colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula in the early 20th century.\n\nChildren aged 3 to 5 who attend the private kindergarten sing the national anthem in front of the Japanese flag and recite the Imperial Rescript on Education, an 1890 tract that calls on Japanese to \"offer yourselves courageously to the state\" to \"guard and maintain the prosperity of our Imperial throne.\"\n\nThe rescript was abolished after Japan's defeat in World War II, when the emperor's role in Japan was reduced to that of a ceremonial figurehead.\n\nThe kindergarten, whose website says it will teach children to \"respect the courtesy of Japanese and foster patriotism,\" apologised for the \"misunderstanding\" about its statements.\n\nBut the scandal really erupted when it emerged that Moritomo Gakuen, the educational organisation that runs the kindergarten, had bought a plot of land for what it hoped would become the \"Shinzo Abe Memorial Elementary School\" at a vastly reduced price.\n\nThe new school, which is due to open in April, touts itself on its website as the \"first and only Shinto elementary school\" and says it will \"foster children who hold pride in being Japanese and have a solid backbone.\"\n\nShinto is the animist religion of Japan, and Abe is an adherent.\n\nMoritomo Gakuen paid US$1.2 million last year for a two-acre plot of land that was appraised at US$8.4 million. The discount was ostensibly because the land contained buried rubbish and some contamination, although the state reimbursed the organisation almost $1.2 million - the same as the sale price - for clean-up costs.\n\n\"Didn't the state give the land away for free?\" asked Takeshi Miyamoto, a lawmaker in Japan's Communist Party.\n\nA neighbouring, slightly larger plot of land was sold to the city of Toyonaka to build a park for US$12.5 million - 10 times the amount the school paid - in 2010.\n\nNow, the Finance Ministry is saying that it threw out the records on the land negotiation after the deal was concluded, leading opposition politicians to accuse the government of a coverup. The Board of Audit is investigating.\n\nAbe said that he asked Moritomo Gakuen not to use his name in connection with the school but that the organisation has ignored the request in its fundraising drive.\n\n\"It is extremely regrettable that my name was used in that manner despite my repeated requests to stop it,\" Abe told a parliamentary committee last week. He has said he will resign as both prime minister and as a member of parliament if he or his wife are found to have done anything wrong.\n\nAkie Abe, who had previously praised the principal's \"passion\", was to serve as honorary principal of the school. But she resigned from the post Friday, and all reference to her was scrubbed from the school's website.\n\nThe case has triggered allegations not just of bigotry but of political collusion.\n\nKagoike, the chairman of the educational organisation, is an executive member of the Osaka chapter of Nippon Kaigi, a nationalist group that has close ties to the prime minister and numerous members of his ruling party, including some in his Cabinet.\n\nNippon Kaigi has among its goals to \"nurture patriotism\" and to adopt a new constitution \"based on our nation's true characteristics,\" rather than the document written by Japan's American occupiers after World War II.\n\nAbe, an arch-conservative who has said he wants to make Japan a \"beautiful country\" again, has been working to revise the constitution to loosen some of the post-war shackles imposed on Japan.\n\nBut Nippon Kaigi's goals are widely seen as intended to restore the strength Japan had before the war. Kagoike promoted constitutional revision in a newsletter to kindergarten parents, encouraging them to \"emulate a great man like Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\"\n\nIf the case continues to snowball and if Abe is found to have a greater role than disclosed, it could gravely hurt the prime minister, analysts say.\n\n\"This could be so damaging that it could shake the foundation of the Abe administration,\" said Eiken Itagaki, a political analyst and former reporter for the left-leaning Mainichi newspaper.\n\nThe case encompassed local political and budgetary issues, but it also could cause a diplomatic storm with Japan's closest neighbours. \"Prime Minister Abe might think this story is a minor issue, but it has the potential to become very damaging,\" Itagaki said.\n\nAbe has been enjoying approval ratings above 60 per cent in polls and faces very few challenges, either from within his party or from the main opposition Democratic Party.\n\nBut the widening scandal could cause him to delay plans to dissolve the Lower House of parliament and call a general election.\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nShinzo Abe", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/41635469_-_24_02_2017_-_japan-politics_abe.jpg?VersionId=_uj.7lR1GD8HeLtCOJa_Q6hzqBGWupft", "alt_text": null}]}

Muffled groans were followed by nods and muttered comments.\n\nThe youth was then dragged off to a pickup truck and his arms tied behind his back. He confessed to a three-month membership in ISIS and spending a week in a training camp, but said he had only been a cook and never carried a weapon.\n\nAs growing numbers of residents flee fighting between insurgents and Iraqi military forces seeking to recapture the ISIS-held western half of Iraq's second largest city, security units have been transporting civilians to government-run camps and weeding out ISIS infiltrators.\n\nJust over a week into the offensive on the militants' last urban bastion in Iraq, some 14,000 inhabitants have slipped out of the city, trekking through stony desert. Most are women, children and elderly but there are also hundreds of young men who must pass screening by the security forces.\n\nAll are hungry and thirsty after three months under a virtual siege of western districts by Iraqi forces. Some have been wounded in the crossfire of a battle that could deal a hammer blow to ISIS' territorial ambitions.\n\nUp to 400,000 people may have to leave their homes during the new US-backed offensive launched this month after Iraqi forces finished clearing districts east of the Tigris River that cleaves the city in Iraq's far north.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Reuters saw four more in detention on Monday.\n\n\"The fighters don't come out,\" he said. Those who were loyal to the militant movement but played a less public, mainly non-combatant role are more likely to try to slip through the dragnet, the intelligence officer added.\n\nSecurity forces keep on hand some local Mosul inhabitants they refer to as \"sources\" to help them identify suspects.\n\nOne of the \"sources\", a wiry young man wearing a green balaclava to shield his identity, stood with intelligence officers as a new batch of men handed over their identification to be checked against a computer database.\n\nTELLTALE BEHAVIOUR\n\nMost ISIS militants are killed in battle, though Iraqi forces have captured alive a handful over the past week including a few from former Soviet republics and China.\n\nThe intelligence officer said he had learned to pinpoint ISIS associates from how they behaved with him. \"You can tell because they are afraid. Those who are not Daesh are also afraid but it's different from the fear of those who are with Daesh,\" he said, without elaborating, using an Arabic acronym for ISIS.\n\nThe Iraqi military considers the screening process to be effective so far, but gives no figures.\n\n\"We have a mechanism. We have names and sources but even so we don't know all of them. But there are people who cooperate; most of them are cooperative,\" the intelligence officer said.\n\nSome of those held in groups for interrogation were clearly motivated to expose ISIS supporters in their midst by the repression and brutality of ISIS' rule in Mosul.\n\n\"People are cooperative because two years is a long time to be under constant pressure,\" the intelligence officer said. \"When you ask who among you is with Daesh, there are people who will point them out and say they did such and such. Like these guys, this morning I brought them one and asked if they knew him. Two of them got up and said he is Daesh.\"\n\nA US intelligence official who asked not to be named said some ISIS combatants had escaped Mosul as well as the Syrian city of Raqqa amidst the chaos of combat, but US-backed forces' encirclement of both cities had reduced the risk of militants making their way out to carry out attacks elsewhere.\n\nPERILOUS PASSAGE\n\nPeople arrive at the initial screening site behind front lines just south of Mosul caked in dust, some carried on stretchers or the backs of others.\n\nThe first thing they ask for is usually a cigarette. Smoking was forbidden under the ISIS regime, but many people still risked lashes for a few puffs.\n\nSupplies of most commodities have run out and prices have skyrocketed in west Mosul since Iraqi forces cut off the last road westward to ISIS-controlled territory in Syria three months ago. Many families have subsisted on little more than bread. An elderly man waiting for security screening said people had died in their homes from hunger.\n\n\"There was nothing to buy. You have money but what can you do, eat money?\" he said.\n\n\"It's not that prices are high, (but that) there is no food.\n\n\"Some people had to leave their dead relatives in their house.\"\n\nThe journey out of western Mosul is treacherous and disorienting. Families are often separated and unsure when they will see each other again or where they will ultimately end up.\n\nCivilians say ISIS has targeted them with mortars and snipers along the route, which takes at least an hour of walking and another half hour piled into military trucks.\n\nA 16-year-old shepherd lost part of his flock last week when a mortar crashed into it. He slaughtered the wounded animals and sold the meat to Iraqi policemen securing the area.\n\nThis week, families were squatting in a ditch in the open desert waiting for trucks to carry them the rest of the way.\n\nA few women seized the opportunity to swap their black niqab veils for colourful headscarves, which show their faces and so were banned by ISIS.\n\nDawud Dargham was boarding a bus to a government-run camp after fleeing from a village near Mosul airport. He said he was anxious about the future. \"There is a limit to what we can endure.

Fearing it would become entirely unsalvageable, she stopped dyeing it in her early 50s.\n\nNow she loves her glossy grey hair. People on the street sometimes ask her, \"How can I get hair like yours?\"\n\nKono, who lives in Tokyo,was featured in Over 60 Street Snap II, a photo collection of fashionable women aged 60 and over published last year. She still keeps in touch with Ayako Miyahara, 74, also from Tokyo, and Teiko Furuya, 70, from Saitama prefecture, who were featured in a book in the same series.\n\n\"We can enjoy fashion without worrying about the colour of our clothes,\" said Miyahara. Furuya dyes her hair a blueish tint because she still has some black hair, but she said, \"I really want to do it in white.\"\n\nThe greying trend originated in Advanced Style, a photo collection published in the United States in 2012.

It became a sensation, and was even made into a documentary.\n\nAdvanced Style became a turning point for a fashion industry always in pursuit of youth, leading it to develop a higher regard for beauty at different ages.\n\nThat tide reached Japan as well, and photo collections featuring older, grey-haired women began to be published. Last year, Shufunotomo Co. also published Paris Madame Grey Hair Style, a photo collection featuring stylish Parisian ladies with undyed grey hair.\n\nThe number of celebrities and prominent figures with grey hair is increasing as well, and they are becoming style icons for the women of their generation. One of them is fashion coordinator Taki Kato, 71.\n\nWhen Kato was 45, she went on a business trip to the United States, where someone praised her grizzled hair by saying, \"What beautiful highlights\". At that point, she stopped dyeing her hair.\n\n\"I was able to let go of the inferiority complex that my grey hair gave me, and take pride in my way of living.\"\n\nPopular stylist Junko Ishida said: \"Grey hair also has the advantage that it makes it easier for you to enjoy fashion. Black hair limits what colours you can wear, but grey hair goes with youthful colours such as bright pinks and greens.\"\n\nThe attitudes of women in general are also changing. According to a survey held last year by Tokyo-based Recruit Lifestyle Co, 78 per cent of women who dye their grey hairs agree that \"depending on how it is presented, grey hair can make a very stylish impression\". That is no less than nine percentage points higher than two years ago.\n\nIzumi Yonezawa, an associate professor at Konan Women's University, who is well-versed in fashion culture, said: \"The generation of women who are now in their 60s or 70s were in their 20s when magazines for women like an an and non-no were launched.\n\n\"They constructed a personal sense of style for themselves, and I think asserting that grey hair is an expression of their individuality is a part of that. There is no question that the notion of what is fashionable for women has broadened.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nSocial conditions and trends", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/japanese-280217.jpg?VersionId=nfSG9971sJpMOnvW9jtUaUzY8SSVpNob", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

He later agreed in a phone call with Xi to honour the policy.\n\nLast week, in an interview with Reuters, Trump urged China to do more to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes. China later dismissed Trump's remarks, saying the crux of the matter was a dispute between Washington and Pyongyang\n\nSee more on\n\nUS foreign policy\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/03/01/41718414_-_28_02_2017_-_diplomacy-us-china-diplomacy.jpg?VersionId=lZHAIZaz9fE72t1kM2JJItDnoJrtn.4b", "alt_text": null}]}

They are coming from a variety of government intelligence and law enforcement agencies, multiple executives said, and their interest stems in part from concerns about the direction of US intelligence agencies under Trump.\n\nRetaining and recruiting talented technical personnel has become a top national security priority in recent years as Russia, China, Iran and other nation states and criminal groups have sharpened their cyber offensive abilities. The NSA and other intelligence agencies have long struggled to deter some of their best employees from leaving for higher-paying jobs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.\n\nThe problem is especially acute at the NSA, current and former officials said, due to a reorganisation known as NSA21 that began last year and aims to merge the agency's electronic eavesdropping and domestic cyber-security operations.\n\nThe two-year overhaul includes expanding parts of the NSA that deal with business management and human resources and putting them on par with research and engineering. The aim is to \"ensure that we're using all of our resources to maximum effect to accomplish our mission,\" NSA director Mike Rogers said.\n\nThe changes include new management structures that have left some career employees uncertain about their missions and prospects. Former employees say the reorganisation has failed to address widespread concerns that the agency is falling behind in exploiting private-sector technological breakthroughs.\n\nA former top NSA official said he had been told by three current officials that budget problems meant there was too little money for promotions. That is especially important for younger employees, who sometimes need two jobs to make ends meet in the expensive Washington DC area, the official said.\n\n\"Morale is as low as I've ever seen it,\" said another former senior NSA official, who maintains close contact with current employees.\n\nAsked about the risk of losing talent from the NSA and other agencies, White House spokesman Michael Anton said Trump had sought to reassure the intelligence community by visiting the CIA headquarters on his first full day in office.\n\nAnton also pointed to the military spending increase in Trump's budget proposal released on Monday.\n\nIt will likely take more than a visit to the CIA to patch up relations with the intelligence community, the current and former officials said.\n\nTrump has attacked findings from intelligence agencies that Russia hacked e-mails belonging to Democratic Party operatives during the 2016 presidential campaign to help him win, though he did eventually accept the findings.\n\nIn January, Trump accused intelligence agencies of leaking false information and said it was reminiscent of tactics used in Nazi Germany.\n\nHOW MANY?\n\nThe breadth of any exodus from the NSA and other intelligence agencies is difficult to quantify.\n\nThe NSA has \"seen a steady rise\" in the attrition rate among its roughly 36,000 employees since 2009, and it now sits at a\"little less than 6 per cent,\" according to an NSA spokesman. NSA director Michael Rogers said last year that the attrition rate was 3.3 per cent in 2015, suggesting a sharp jump in departures since then.\n\nSeveral senior NSA officials who have left or plan to leave, including deputy director Richard Ledgett and the head of cyber defence, Curtis Dukes, have said their departures were unrelated to Trump or the reorganisation.\n\nSome turnover is normal with any new administration, government and industry officials noted, and a stronger economy has also improved pay and prospects in the private sector.\n\n\"During this time, the economy has been recovering from the recession, unemployment rates have been falling and the demand for highly skilled technical talent has been increasing,\" an NSA spokesman said, when asked to comment on the reports of employee departures.\n\nIn a statement, Kathy Hutson, NSA's chief of human resources, said the agency continues \"to attract amazing talent necessary to conduct the security mission the nation needs.\"\n\nCONTROVERSIAL BOSS\n\nSome NSA veterans attribute the morale issues and staff departures to the leadership style of Rogers, who took over the spy agency in 2014 with the task of dousing an international furore caused by leaks from former contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nConcern about Rogers reached an apex last October, when former Defence Secretary Ash Carter and former director of national intelligence James Clapper recommended to then-president Barack Obama that Rogers be removed.\n\nThe NSA did not respond to a request for comment on the recommendation last fall that Rogers be replaced.\n\nRogers is now expected to retain his job at NSA for at least another year, according to former officials.\n\nRogers acknowledged concerns about potential morale problems last month, telling a congressional committee that Trump's broadsides against the intelligence community could create \"a situation where our workforce decides to walk.\"\n\nTrump's criticism of the intelligence community has exacerbated the stress caused by the reorganisation at the NSA, said Susan Hennessey, a former NSA lawyer now with the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe \"tone coming from the White House makes an already difficult situation worse, by eroding the sense of common purpose and service,\" she said.\n\nA wave of departures of career personnel, Hennessey added, \"would represent an incalculable loss to national security.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nDonald Trump\n\nDefence and military", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/03/01/41047321_-_06_01_2017_-_us-politics-russia-intelligence.jpg?VersionId=DTLYyLQ9f2iGpVuM9ifkDYWdY0IfW2lc", "alt_text": null}]}

Nostalgia undoubtedly plays a part when consumers are now faced with a choice of only similar-looking glass and metal flagship phones by other manufacturers. The 3310 proves to be a welcome respite.\n\nIts 2.4-inch colour screen is an improvement from the original, and it comes with new features such as web browsing and a two-megapixel camera.\n\nUnfortunately, Singapore users will not be able to use it to make calls or surf the web on its 2.5G connectivity as 2G networks are being phased out in April.\n\nFor an added dose of nostalgia, I fired up the popular Snake game on the phone, only to find a revamped version of the 2D game on it. There are more game modes, the graphics are more game-like, but it is not exactly the Snake of yore we know and love.\n\nThe original 3310 gained a reputation online, hitting peak levels of memes, for being sturdy and reliable - or even indestructible. I did not manage to put that to the test as the booth minders were surprisingly insistent that I do not attempt to harm the device.\n\nThe Nokia 3310 will cost \u20ac49 (S$72), with availability in selected markets to be announced at a later date.\n\nSee more on\n\nSmartphones\n\nTech review", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/03/01/331001tri.jpg?VersionId=_DwG6e_0L9vbYoKIpFgJ1aZ9fQ7y62sY", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/dscf9574.jpg?VersionId=sFS0bALrHKbU40.xmniQvtVQ.MVooJ58", "alt_text": null}]}

Another float swerved into the crowd and injured 20 people late on Sunday, on the championship's opening night.\n\nBut in both cases organisers decided the show must go on.\n\nTuesday's accident occurred around 3am, as members of the Unidos da Tijuca samba school strutted their stuff atop an enormous float dedicated to \"New Orleans, the City of Jazz\" - the school's theme for the year.\n\nSlowly, the top floor of the faux-brick float - designed to look like a building in the New Orleans French Quarter - keeled to one side and collapsed.\n\n\"I was on the platform of the float, to the left side, and suddenly I saw the right side collapse,\" dancer Raissa Ribeiro said through tears just after exiting the stricken float. \"People fell into the float's interior and some of them got stuck inside the metal structure.\"\n\nAs ambulances rushed to the scene, police struggled to push back dozens of photographers who flocked to snap pictures.\n\nAfter more than half an hour of chaos, the damaged float was allowed to finish the 700m parade through the Sambadrome, rescue workers still on its roof. That drew applause from the crowd, even as terrified dancers cried on the sidelines.\n\nThe carnival's all-time winningest samba school, Portela, then took the floor as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"These things happen, but there should be a security review. Carnival's a serious deal. We work hard all year, so when something like this happens, everyone's angry,\" said Washington Luis, a member of Unidos da Tijuca.\n\nSunday night's accident occurred when the Paraiso do Tuiuti samba school's float careered out of control in the rain.\n\nIt drove too close to a fence at the entrance to the competition piste, trapping several people. Three were seriously injured, including a news photographer who had her leg badly crushed.\n\nBut despite the pools of blood left on the rain spattered ground, the party soon got back in swing.\n\nThe head of the carnival's main organizing body, the Independent League of Samba Schools, called it a \"coincidence\" that two accidents hit the event in two nights.\n\n\"They each had different characteristics,\" the official, Jorge Castanheira, told Brazilian news site G1.\n\nThe organisers' gritty resolve to carry on with the festival of sparkling costumes, near-naked dancers and pulsating beats seemed fitting for Brazil, where this edition of carnival is an escape from the worst recession in a century and a particularly ugly year in the country's corruption-stained politics.\n\nSee more on\n\nBrazil\n\nFestivals/Celebrations\n\nAccidents", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/03/01/41712836_-_28_02_2017_-_brazil-rio-carnival-unidos_da_tijuca-accident.jpg?VersionId=gx6M.MDaYBYc5V7MfK37Qznb2CvCT7yU", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/03/01/41712931_-_28_02_2017_-_brazil-rio-carnival-unidos_da_tijuca-accident.jpg?VersionId=IG3cqeOySRlLem5vVYK1WgvMB7E5Bqll", "alt_text": null}]}

He faces a host of questions going into his first speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nDETAILS NEEDED\n\nSpecifics of his plan to overhaul former President Barack Obama's signature health-care law have not been released. Republican efforts to find a way to repeal and replace Obamacare have encountered resistance from party conservatives who say draft legislation emerging in the House will not reduce the cost of health care.\n\nTrump has yet to describe how to pay for a sharp increase in planned spending on rebuilding US roads and bridges.\n\nHis proposals to cut taxes for millions of people and corporations have not been sketched out. His strategy for renegotiating international trade deals remains unclear. He took delivery on Monday of a Pentagon proposal for fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria militants and must decide on it in the days ahead.\n\nTrump seeks a big increase in defence spending but that plan includes a demand that non-defence federal agencies cut funds to offset the cost, painful reductions likely to face opposition in Congress. US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he would not back slashing State Department funding as the administration is expected to propose.\n\nTrump's lack of legislative success so far contrasts with most of his recent predecessors, though not all of them.\n\nWith the country facing a financial crisis, Obama laid out an economic stimulus plan days after his January 2009 swearing-in and it was approved in mid-February. In early February, Obama signed two other Bills into law: one providing federally funded health care to children and another making it easier for employees to sue employers for wage-based discrimination.\n\nGeorge W. Bush sent a sweeping tax cut proposal to Congress less than three weeks after taking office in January 2001. It was enacted four months later. Bill Clinton fulfilled a central campaign promise in his first weeks in office when he enacted a family-leave Bill on Feb 5, 1993.\n\nRonald Reagan sent dozens of detailed budget cut plans to Congress less than a month after his 1981 swearing in but George H.W. Bush accomplished little of note in his first 100 days.\n\nDEMOCRATIC DISPLEASURE\n\nTrump's travel ban, which he says was needed for national security reasons, caused wide disruption at airports, sparked protests and was blocked by a federal court. He is expected to sign a replacement order on Wednesday.\n\nOnly three weeks into his term, Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after disclosures surfaced that Flynn had discussed US sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and then misled Vice-President Mike Pence about the conversations.\n\nStocks on major markets dipped along with the US dollar and US Treasury yields on Tuesday as investors waited for clues in Trump's address on how he aims to implement his economic agenda.\n\n\"If he gives minimal detail this evening, then perhaps we might get a little bit wind out of the sails on this recent equity move,\" said Erik Wytenus, global investment specialist at JP Morgan Private Bank.\n\nTim Albrecht, a Republican strategist in Iowa, said the speech was Trump's best opportunity to date to explain where he wants to take the country.

However, its location in the heart of a rapidly urbanising Asean means there are significant opportunities for companies to tap on.\n\nMr Iswaran's speech in outlined the various measures available to help SMEs expand overseas, innovate and deepen capabilities. This came after six of the 10 MPs who spoke before him expressed concerns that the Budget did not provide enough aid for small firms hit by the economic slowdown.\n\nMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten) said companies were hoping the Budget would offer some financial relief.\n\n\"However, it seems that their hopes will not materialise....For most of the smaller businesses, this year's Budget is a non-event,\" he added.\n\nIt will be tough to strike a balance between businesses' short-term concerns about operational costs and the government's longer-term considerations about the country's economic competitiveness, said Nominated MP Thomas Chua, who is also president of Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry.\n\nNon-Constituency MP Leon Perera said the Budget \"has not made a decisive shift towards building local enterprises as an engine of value creation, alongside multinational companies and government-linked companies\".\n\n\"This is a huge missed opportunity,\" he said, noting that Budget 2017 contained some new measures but \"is this enough to uncage our local firms?\"\n\nMr Perera also said funding support provided to local enterprises should be more selective and results-driven, \"with much more generous support and higher caps given to companies who truly have a track record of results and...the ambition to succeed globally\".\n\nIn his speech, Mr Iswaran said SMEs are at the centre of Singapore's economic transformation push and are receiving support through both broad-based and targeted programmes.\n\nHe noted that the Budget contained short-term relief for the hardest-hit industries, such as marine and offshore engineering, and construction.\n\nBeyond immediate challenges, however, Singapore must \"invest in the capabilities of our economy, people and enterprises, especially our SMEs\" to seize longer-term opportunities.\n\n\"We do not pick winners, but will support companies that are prepared to make these important transitions. And in all of these efforts, SMEs are our central focus,\" the minister said.\n\nResponding to Mr Perera, he added: \"The companies that are prepared to move further and go faster will be better, and will receive more support. But that does not mean that we are picking winners. The winners are picking themselves and adapting to our schemes.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore economy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/cropped6.jpg?VersionId=ixBMfWyCfVwQJcpuKeRSeLpULVvWMJrD", "alt_text": null}]}

Some 60 officers and at least four demonstrators were hurt in scuffles there that included bleach being thrown at police.\n\nMost countries consider all Israeli settlements on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war to be illegal. Israel disagrees, citing biblical, historical and political links to the land as well as security interests.\n\nPalestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, which Israeli forces left in 2005, with East Jerusalem as its capital. They say settlement construction could deny them a viable and contiguous country.\n\nSome 550,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements and East Jerusalem, areas that are home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians.\n\nThree weeks ago, Israel's parliament retroactively legalised about 4,000 settler homes built on privately owned Palestinian land. The new law did not apply to Amona or the nine dwellings in Ofra because of standing court rulings.\n\nSince US President Donald Trump took office in January, Israel has announced plans to build 6,000 more settler homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nBut at a White House news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Feb. 15, Trump startled the Israeli leader by saying he would like to see him \"hold back on settlements for a bit\".\n\nNetanyahu later said he hoped to \"reach an understanding\" with Trump on settlements.\n\nSee more on\n\nIsrael-Palestine\n\nPalestine", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/41716990_-_28_02_2017_-_mideast_israel_settlers_amona_eviction.jpg?VersionId=1huAJSViLigeU6Gv76WdGBB_COJpaflv", "alt_text": null}]}

The two-year Treasury yield, the maturity most sensitive to Fed policy expectations, surged to 1.26 per cent on Tuesday (Feb 28) in New York, heading for its steepest two-day climb this year.\n\nNew York Fed President William Dudley capped two days of hawkish comments from US central bankers when he said the case for tightening has become much more compelling. His interview with CNN came hot on the heels of comments from Fed San Francisco President John Williams - saying he expects a rate increase to get \"serious consideration\" at the coming meeting. Fed Dallas President Robert Kaplan said Monday policy makers should raise rates \"sooner rather than later,\" without paying excessive attention to market expectations.\n\n\"Any time we're as close to full employment and as close to the 2 per cent inflation mark as we are, and monetary policy is still accommodative, the odds of a rate hike at any given meeting should be 50-50, at a minimum,\" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nJanney has called for three hikes in 2017 since the start of the year, LeBas said. And \"if you're going to get to three, you probably start in March.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is preparing to outline fiscal plans in a speech on Tuesday night, potentially bolstering the case for a tax-cut-propelled pickup in the economy.\n\nLooking at the US overnight index swap curve, and adjusting for the spread between the policy rate and shorter-term OIS rates, the probability of a 25-basis-point increase next month stands at about 60 per cent, double the odds of a week ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\"Odds of more than 50 per cent are reasonable\" when betting on a March rate move, said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist at the Japanese unit of MCP Asset Management in Tokyo. \"There's an optimistic tone in the stock market. There's inflation pressure. That will push the Fed to hike rates.\"\n\nThe February employment report on March 10 may add evidence the US economy is expanding just as policy makers prepare to meet, he said.\n\nRosenberg said the US is on the verge of a breakout in inflation, and there are signs that costs for goods and services are gathering momentum. The price index for personal consumption expenditures probably hit the Fed's 2 per cent target for the first time since 2012, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists before the report Wednesday.\n\nA bond-market metric projecting expectations for consumer prices over the coming decade climbed to 2.09 per cent last month, the highest level in more than two years. The so-called break-even rate is derived by calculating the difference between yields for nominal and inflation-linked bonds.\n\nThe last time futures showed a 10-point jump in expectations for the March hike was Feb 15, when the US reported an increase in its consumer price index. Yellen also spoke, saying she hopes the economy allows the Fed to raise rates at a faster pace.\n\nIt'll be up to Yellen to clarify her plans when she speaks Friday.\n\n\"The market's a bit confused about March,\" said Peter Jolly, head of market research at National Australia Bank in Sydney. \"Janet Yellen is going to have to make the case for it if that's what they want to do. I'd still be betting against March.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS Federal Reserve\n\nInterest rates", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/03/01/41590974_-_20_02_2017_-_global-markets.jpg?VersionId=xcfOJc.94uaag88SDc9Yp1KfaDtkvwvp", "alt_text": null}]}

Many improvements have been made in terms of security services, security efficiency, security of hotels, the level of general security in the whole country.\"\n\nBritain's Foreign Office warns against all travel to some border regions of Tunisia and \"all but essential travel\" to the rest of the country.\n\nTunisia's economy is heavily dependent on tourism and has repeatedly asked for the warning to be lifted.\n\nSamantha Leek, the main lawyer for the inquest, said at one of the hearings that a report by a Tunisian judge had identified failings by local security which could have ended the attack before more police arrived and killed Rezgui.\n\n\"He said the units that should have intervened in the events deliberately and unjustifiably slowed down to delay their arrival at the hotel,\" she said.\n\n\"They had the ability to put an end to the attack before the police arrived but wasted a considerable amount of time in getting to the hotel,\" she added.\n\nBut Ammar said the accusation that the police had deliberately delayed their arrival was \"exaggerated and unfair\".\n\nA report on security at the hotels by a British embassy staff member conducted in January 2015 was also read out in court during one of the hearings by Andrew Ritchie, a lawyer representing 20 victims' families.\n\n\"There seems to be little in the way of effective security to prevent or respond to an attack\" from the beach, he quoted the report as saying.\n\nSee more on\n\nTunisia\n\nTerrorism", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/03/01/41715646_-_28_02_2017_-_britain_high_court.jpg?VersionId=ju3WKgKfQ0q9Lf4WlXVpFaDETuHNVtWZ", "alt_text": null}]}

The fingerprint sensor has moved to the front of the phone and more colours have been added to the range.\n\nBoth phones continue to sport a dual-Leica camera setup on the rear, with a 20-megapixel monochrome lens and a 12-megapixel colour lens. This led to some clear and sharp shots even in low light, and dramatic shots with a bokeh effect - where the background is blurred out - similar to that of pictures taken on a DSLR camera.\n\nFor the first time, even the front camera is a Leica camera - both the P10 and P10 Plus have an 8-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nThe P10 is priced at \u20ac649 (S$966) while the P10 Plus will cost \u20ac699.

Now we own trashy,\" he wrote.\n\nSome drew comparisons with photos of former president Barack Obama with his feet up on the desk of the Oval Office.\n\n\"Remember when Republicans used to flip out over Obama Oval Office decorum,\" posted one Twitter user.\n\nTrump's predecessor repeatedly took flak for photos in which he appeared to be kicking back. Obama was also chastised by critics for unbuttoning the previous Oval Office dress code that called for a suit jacket and a tie.\n\nConway recently came under fire for plugging the fashion brand of the president's daughter. The head of the US Office of Government Ethics urged the White House to investigate Conway after the incident, saying she should face disciplinary action.\n\nShe also famously coined the term \"alternative facts\" and referred to a \"Bowling Green massacre\" - which never happened - during an interview.\n\nConway later tweeted that she meant to say \"Bowling Green terrorists\" - referring to two Iraqi men who were indicted in 2011 for trying to send money and weapons to Al-Qaeda, and using improvised explosive devices against US soldiers in Iraq.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/41708764.1_41713282_-_28_02_2017_-_us-politics-trump.jpg?VersionId=.QoLsQk_kI.jwobSuATeCLJi_U1zFAzc", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/41708735_-_28_02_2017_-_usa_government.jpg?VersionId=elFg_cZtJfRGz2xrvN_Q7U1oEyjRTiF7", "alt_text": null}]}

We have been there. The military operation has been going on for some time already but we have failed. That has to be admitted,\" Duterte told reporters.\n\n\"But it's a matter of policy that we do not surrender to the demands of paying ransom. It will just increase the numbers,\" he said, referring to the Islamic militants.\n\nThe Abu Sayyaf, established with seed money from Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, have been kidnapping foreigners and locals for decades and holding them for ransom on its remote island strongholds in the southern Philippines.\n\nKantner's vessel, the Rockall, was found drifting on November 7 off the southern Philippines with the body of his female companion, Sabine Merz, who had been shot.

Russia, the world's largest oil producer, has bought a major stake in India's Essar refinery and plans to build one in Indonesia with state-owned Pertamina.\n\n\"The investment is wise as it ensures Saudi can increase its market share in Asia, at a time when rising US shale oil is displacing Saudi oil from the US market,\" Mr Gordon Kwan, Nomura's head of Asia oil and gas research, said.\n\n\"Being a shareholder of a refinery will give Aramco the upper hand when competing with other Opec countries such as Iran and Iraq, all targetting more oil sales into Asia.\"\n\nUnder the deal with Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), Aramco will supply up to 70 per cent of the crude for Rapid, which will consist of a 300,000 barrel per day (bpd) oil refinery and petrochemical plants.\n\nAramco has also strengthened its ties with Indonesia, South-east Asia's largest economy, providing 270,000 bpd of crude to the Cilacap refinery owned by Pertamina after taking a 45 per cent stake.\n\nThe deal \"will provide Aramco and the Kingdom a sustainable demand for the Saudi crude and will allow the companies to add value to that crude by making high quality products, fuels or petrochemicals for the Malaysian and neighbouring markets,\" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Saudi state television.\n\nSaudi Arabia exported an average of 6.96 million bpd in 2016 to the top six oil buyers in Asia, namely China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, out of total imports of 31 million bpd, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.\n\nThe Malaysian deal should bolster Aramco's IPO, which Saudi officials have predicted will value the company at a minimum of US$2 trillion through the sale of 5 per cent stake.\n\n\"It's a sound deal and looks good for the IPO. Saudi Aramco is paying 25 per cent of the project's costs and securing the right to supply 50 per cent of its feedstock,\" industry veteran John Driscoll, director of Singapore-based consultancy JTD Energy said.\n\nSaudi Aramco also has refinery ventures in South Korea, Japan, and China. It also invests Saudi Arabia with ExxonMobil, Total and Sinopec.\n\n\"Longer term, we expect Aramco needs to make more similar deals, perhaps buying stakes in PetroChina/Sinopec's refineries to ensure that they can sell more crude to China and Asia,\" Nomura's Mr Kwan said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nOil and gas sector\n\nMalaysia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/41563766_-_18_02_2017_-_saudi_aramco-ipo_restructuring.jpg?VersionId=FA8J9V2TYF9lFBNBIySgFyiifK.PJdeR", "alt_text": null}]}

One down, three to go. The league is still to play for. Chelsea is doing well this season but it's not over until it's over. We'll push them right until the end with the Europa League and FA Cup still to play for.\n\n\"We've got the players, we've got the big squad. The momentum is with us now, the mentality is right this season. It's taken the manager just six months to win his first trophy, which is amazing, coming so early in his Manchester United career.\"\n\nCentre-back Johnsen added: \"They won the first trophy under Mourinho on Sunday, which is a very good sign. You could see they are constantly improving their performances, they can even win on a bad day, which is another good sign.\n\n\"They have managed to get points (when the team is not playing well). They are up there. They have a chance to win more trophies this season.

Stocks gained 8.7 per cent, bonds rose 4.3 per cent, and real estate investment grew 0.8 per cent.\n\n\"The fund returned 6.9 per cent after a year of political events and uncertainty,\" chief executive officer Yngve Slyngstad said in the statement. \"All of the fund's asset classes generated positive returns, but it was the strong equity return in the second half of the year that drove the fund's results.\"\n\nThe fund rose for a fifth straight year, benefiting from a rally in equities during the fourth quarter that offset a drop in bonds. Equity markets rose after the surprise election of Mr Trump as US president amid optimism tax cuts and deregulation will spur corporate earnings.\n\n\"After the presidential election in the US, markets priced in higher growth and inflation in the global economy,\" Mr Slyngstad said.\n\nThe share of the fund's holdings in Europe fell to 36 per cent from 38.1 per cent a year earlier, while the portion in North America rose to 42.3 per cent from 40.0 per cent. The share held in Asia and Oceania slid to 17.9 per cent from 18.1 per cent. Emerging markets accounted for 10 per cent of the investments at the end of the year, up from 9.8 per cent.\n\n\"This slightly higher allocation to emerging markets was due to an increase in the value of our investments and to currency effects,\" the fund said.\n\nIt had 775 billion kroner invested in equities and fixed-income in emerging markets at the end of the year, compared with 736 billion kroner a year earlier. Investments in equities in frontier markets amounted to 13.3 billion kroner, up from 13.0 billion kroner at the end of 2015.\n\nThe fund had investments in 77 countries at the end of 2016 after Argentina was added during the year, it said.\n\nThe gains also came after the Norwegian government last year made its first ever withdrawals from the fund, which was set up in the mid-1990s. The government withdrew 101 billion kroner last year amid a growing debate over increased spending of oil wealth.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump", "images": []}

It's sure to come,\" President Rodrigo Duterte said recently.\n\nIn an interview with AFP in February, Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana listed the Abu Sayyaf and other \"terrorist\" groups that have pledged allegiance to ISIS as the Philippines' top internal security threat.\n\n\"We are trying to put more effort into suppressing the growth of ISIS in the south,\" Lorenzana said.\n\nOver the past two years the Abu Sayyaf has been involved in kidnapping dozens of people in increasingly brazen attacks mostly on foreign cargo vessels, but also on coastal tourist resorts in the south and neighbouring Malaysia.\n\nThe militants on Monday posted a video online of them beheading Jurgen Kantner, a 70-year-old German sailor who was abducted from his yacht in southern Philippine waters three months earlier.\n\nThey killed him after a demand for a ransom of 30 million pesos (US$600,000) was not met.\n\nTwo Canadian hostages kidnapped from yachts moored at a marina on a tourist island in the southern Philippines in 2015 were also beheaded last year after demands for ransoms of similar amounts went unfulfilled.\n\nThe Abu Sayyaf is holding 19 other foreigners on its remote southern island strongholds of Sulu and Basilan, according to the military.\n\nMost of them are Vietnamese, Indonesian and Malaysia sailors abducted from cargo vessels in or near the Sulu and Celebes seas.\n\nTo counter, the Philippines has said it is looking to Chinese and American forces to help patrol waters in the area, which also includes a busy international shipping channel called the Sibutu Passage.\n\nSeparately, the Philippines is in talks with Malaysia and Indonesia for joint patrols.\n\nIn his interview with AFP, Lorenzana said the Philippine naval and coast guard vessels could do little to catch the pirates' boats, which travelled at speeds of more than 80 kph.\n\n\"The Abu Sayyaf has better boats than us,\" Lorenzana said.\n\nThe Abu Sayyaf's spike as a kidnapping threat can be traced back to two events in 2014, according to security analysts.\n\nOne was the winding back of a US military programme to train Philippine forces on how to counter the Abu Sayyaf, and provide intelligence. The programme saw a rotating force of about 600 troops stationed in the south.\n\nIt ended in June 2014 after local Islamic extremists had \"largely devolved into disorganised groups\", according to a US government statement at the time.\n\nPreviously the Abu Sayyaf was regarded as a much bigger threat. It was accused of involvement in the 2004 bombing of a ferry in Manila that killed more than 100 people and other deadly attacks, as well as high-profile kidnappings.\n\nDuring the 12 years of the American presence the Abu Sayyaf's numbers were cut from more than 1,000 to about 300, according to Philippine military estimates then, and many of its top leaders were killed or detained.\n\n\"The departure of the US advisers led to a steady resurgence of the ASG (Abu Sayyaf) and eventually the emergence of two dozen ISIS-centric groups,\" Rohan Gunaratna, a Singapore-based regional terrorism expert, told AFP on Tuesday.\n\nAlso in 2014 the Abu Sayyaf had one of their biggest paydays ever, claiming to have secured the full ransom of more than US$5 million dollars for releasing two German sailors kidnapped that year.\n\nThat, and subsequent paydays worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, enabled the kidnappers to buy better weapons and boats, as well as pay local Muslim communities that harbour and protect them, according to analysts.\n\n\"The community celebrates when there's delivery of ransom. They kill cows, goats in festivity,\" Rommel Banlaoi, chairman of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research in Manila, told AFP.\n\nBanlaoi and other analysts said corrupt politicians and security forces were also involved, getting a share of payouts and ensuring the Abu Sayyaf survived military offensives.\n\n\"It's really organised crime,\" Banlaoi said.\n\nSee more on\n\nAbu Sayyaf\n\nPhilippines\n\nISIS", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/41694857.1_41697334_-_27_02_2017_-_philippines_unrest_abu_sayyaf.jpg?VersionId=8Q.RQXniOXCT9i417WI_Vtqjixgze03R", "alt_text": null}]}

Dorchester, Chengdu\n\nIt all started when a Chengdu town planner received a Christmas card of Dorchester in its hey-days, or so the story goes.\n\nConstruction of the Chinese \"British Town\", originally situated in Dorset, England, began in 2005 in Chengdu, capital of south-west China's Sichuan province.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Hallstatt, Guangdong\n\nIn one of China's more ambitious replica projects, the Unesco World Heritage site of Hallstatt in Austria was erected in Guangdong's Huizhou in 2012.\n\nThe idea was conceived by a Chinese mining tycoon and cost S$1.3 billion.\n\nReproducing the Austrian village's church clock tower and European-style wooden houses, the development was meant to become a tourist hotspot, but has become another ghost town.\n\n5. Jackson Hole, Beijing\n\nJust about 1\u00bd hours away from the Chinese capital, there is a Chinese version of the Wild Wild West.\n\nCompleted in 2006, the near-duplicate of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, has security guards outfitted in cowboy garb, a church and even Route 66.\n\nMany of the 1000-odd homes are owned by rich city-dwellers who want to get away from Beijing's hustle and bustle.\n\n6. White House, in various parts of China\n\nThe copycat versions of the US Capitol building have been popping up in several locations in China.\n\nPlaces boasting of White House include Wuxi and Fuyang, but Hangzhou's version tops the list with its extreme attention to detail.\n\nReal estate tycoon Huang Qiaoling had built his own White House, complete with an Oval Office and portrait gallery of United States presidents.\n\nThere are also miniatures of the Washington Monument and Mount Rushmore.\n\nMr Huang's grand estate has attracted even then US President George W. Bush to visit in 2002.\n\nSOURCES: ABC News, CBS News, Reuters, South China Morning Post, The Guardian, The Huffington Post, Time\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nBuildings\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nWin 2x tickets to New Zealand.

It also failed to ensure that the procedures actually practised by its employees to access the train track passed safety audits, were documented and disseminated.\n\nThe court heard that track access during traffic hours is an inherently dangerous and high-risk activity as it requires employees to be physically present on the train tracks when passenger train services are in operation.\n\nThe potential for harm to employees is high because serious or fatal accidents can easily occur unless proper care is taken to ensure that passenger trains are not permitted to approach the location where employees are working on the tracks.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

In fact, the procedure had not been complied with for many years.\n\nInvestigations further revealed that since as early as 2002, the Operations Control Centre (OCC) had been approving requests for track access which were not in compliance with the operating procedure. These deviations were not documented nor authorised by the company.\n\nSMRT failed to ensure that the various practices used by its employees to access train tracks during traffic hours passed safety audits, were documented and were disseminated. This resulted in an unsafe workplace for its employees.\n\nSince the fatal accident, the company required strict compliance with its written operating procedures on track access. It also took steps to require the OCC to exercise greater control over the scheduled train movements at the worksite.\n\nThe company, which was given until Monday to pay the fine, could have been fined up to $500,000 for contravening WSHA.\n\nSee more on\n\nSMRT\n\nAccidents\n\nMRT\n\nSingapore courts", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/dw-mrt-fatal-accident-170228.jpg?VersionId=LsYKnneSQ118p3jzDmOkjP2PH2CADsUo", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

Historically, in England, strawberries started appearing on May 1 and were available until the end of September.\n\nM&S and Tesco intend to have the British-grown fruit in selected stores this week, with availability increasing throughout the spring.\n\nHenry Maulik, Tesco's strawberry buyer, said: \"The arrival of the first English strawberries marks the start of the UK fruit season, and is a great indicator that spring is just around the corner.\" According to the industry body British Summer Fruits the strawberry season was only six weeks long 25 years ago, but industry investment has extended this by up to nine months. In 2014, British-grown fruit was being sold in supermarkets in December.\n\nEarly British strawberries have been grown, usually, in the warmer climes of Kent, Sussex and Wales, but computerised glasshouse technology now lets producers in Lancashire and Scotland be among the first to deliver.\n\nThe early batches will be of the Lusa variety, developed specially for early fruiting, as well as taste, large size and deep colour.\n\nMedlar Fruit Farms, in Lancashire, is expecting to grow strawberries until mid-November this year. The company's managing director, Steve Ball, said: \"We're pleased to have been able to put Lancashire well and truly on the map for strawberries. We've been working with Tesco to extend the British season so that shoppers can enjoy them for even longer.\" Strawberries, technically not a berry but rather an aggregate accessory fruit, have been eaten since Roman times when they were used for medicinal purposes. In 14th century France, Charles V had 1,200 strawberry plants in his royal garden, and early 15th century western European monks included the wild strawberry in their illustrations.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The I-net system provides Internet access to national servicemen and employees for their personal communications and Internet surfing via thousands of dedicated computer terminals in Mindef, as well as in Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camps and premises. No classified military information is stored on I-net.\n\nMindef said this was the first time that the I-net system was breached, resulting in the loss of the 850 personnel's NRIC numbers, telephone numbers and birth dates. The attack was executed remotely over the Internet.\n\nMindef said in a media briefing on Tuesday (Feb 28): \"The real purpose may have been to gain access to official secrets, but this was prevented by the physical separation of I-net from our internal systems.\"\n\nMr David Koh, Mindef's deputy secretary of technology, said: \"The attack did not come from camps or internal systems. Neither was it the work of causal hackers or criminal gangs.\"\n\nSecurity experts said the attack could have been state sponsored.\n\nMr Aloysius Cheang, executive vice-president of global computing security association Cloud Security Alliance, said: \"It is common for states to sponsor such attacks to access other countries' infrastructure, and build a portfolio of information that can be used to their advantage.\"\n\nUpon detecting the attack, Mindef disconnected the affected server from I-net, but it allowed I-net to continue to provide Internet access. Mr Koh said the hacker exploited vulnerabilities in the server and the vulnerabilities have been plugged.\n\nHe added: \"Mindef adopts a multilayer approach to security. The attacker only breached the outer layer but did not go deeper into classified systems.\" Classified and military data, and internal e-mail applications reside in a different system that is not connected to the Internet.\n\nAsked why the breach was not announced earlier, Mindef said it had to conduct an investigation before going public with the cyber attack.\n\nMindef said it conducted detailed forensic investigations into the entire I-net system to determine the extent of the breach. All other systems within Mindef and SAF are also being investigated.\n\nWhile the outcome of the investigations is pending, Mindef said it will contact all affected personnel within the week. They will be advised to change their passwords and report any unusual activity related to the use of their personal information.\n\nMindef has also informed Singapore's Cyber Security Agency and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore to investigate other government systems. No breaches have been detected so far, Mindef said.\n\nPwC Singapore's Asia Pacific Financial Crime and Cyber Leader Vincent Loy said that Mindef's policy to have separate networks for classified and non-classified information limited the impact of the attack.\n\nSee more on\n\nCyber security\n\nMinistry of Defence", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/mindef28.jpg?VersionId=e6cMPSBtV_hm4jhyx6YMZJUh5yYHuiar", "alt_text": null}]}

He approached her on May 21 last year, before she was to appear at an idol event in Koganei, western Tokyo.\n\nPrior to his sentencing, Iwazaki expressed remorse to the court. He said: \"I am really sorry for having caused great trouble to Ms Tomita and her family. I swear in this court that I will never go near Ms Tomita again.\"\n\nPublic prosecutors had sought 17 years for the \"repulsive\"crime that left Ms Tomita in a coma for two weeks, saying: \"He was relentless and brutal in stabbing the victim, who was unable to escape.\"\n\nBut Iwazaki's lawyers had argued, in mitigation, that the attack was not premeditated but was instead a \"sudden incident\".\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He may come and try to kill me this time.\"\n\nHer remarks, made behind a partition that shielded her from the defendant, prompted an agitated Iwazaki to shout: \"Then you should kill me.\" The court ordered him to be removed.\n\nMs Tomita added that she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. She said: \"When I was in hospital, I would get scared looking at a pair of scissors kept for treatment thinking I could be stabbed with them. I could not help myself thinking people coming to visit me were there to kill me.

Three-year licences will be given to pre-schools with at least two consecutive two-year licences.\n\nMore investigative powers:\n\nThe authorities will have new powers to interview people, and take photos, videos or audio recordings at pre-schools. Currently, the authorities are allowed to enter and inspect pre-school premises, and take documents from centres.\n\nLarger penalties; graduated penalty framework:\n\nThe maximum penalty under the new laws is a $10,000 fine and a year in jail. This was proposed to match the severity of the offences and to align them to similar penalties in other laws such as the Private Education Act.\n\nCurrently, the maximum penalty under the Child Care Centres Act is a $5,000 fine and a jail term of two years; that under the Education Act is a $2,000 fine and a year in jail.\n\nUnder the new penalty framework, administrative breaches will not be considered criminal offences. The authorities will have a wider range of regulatory sanctions - such as fines of up to $5,000, shortening of licences and public censures - instead of having to resort to revoking licences of operators who break the law.\n\nMr Tan said: \"The penalty will be proportionate to the breach.\"\n\nOther provisions in the Bill include requirements for all staff - including those who do not teach and those from vendors that run enrichment programmes - to be approved by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) before they can work at the centres, as well as requirements on the orderly closure of centres.\n\nThe passing of the Bill comes after about two years of public consultations and briefings with the sector to explain the new requirements.\n\nThe ECDA also held \"customised on-site guidance\" for kindergartens, as they are new to a licensing framework.\n\nThe new law is expected to take effect after other detailed regulatory requirements are gazetted.

The US$850 million to automakers has to be paid in full within five days after closing of the anticipated sale of the company, according to court papers.\n\nThe US has also charged three former Takata executives for their alleged roles in hiding the risk since 2000. The three - Hideo Nakajima, Tsuneo Chikaraishi and Shinichi Tanaka - are Japanese citizens who worked at Takata until about 2015, according to court papers.\n\nTakata has also been sued by dozens of drivers and passengers in the US claiming shrapnel injuries caused by the bags. The lawsuits allege that the company knew the air bags could fail, hid negative test results and stalled recalls.\n\nThe company is also facing complaints by injured plaintiffs who allege that the propellant can cause excessive-force deployments, often in low-speed collisions, without releasing shrapnel. Most of the shrapnel cases have been settled, according to court filings reviewed by Bloomberg News.\n\nMost of the injury and death lawsuits are combined before a Miami federal judge, who is also handling car owners' claims for economic losses related to the defects and recalls. Lead lawyers for the combined suits claimed Monday that Honda Motor, Toyota Motor and other automakers bought Takata air bags for years despite knowing they could rupture and injure people.\n\nHonda denied the claims. \"The suggestion that Honda chose to use Takata air bag inflators - despite knowing of the risk of rupture - because they were less expensive than other inflators is categorically false,'' the company said in a statement on Monday.\n\nBrian Lyons, a Toyota spokesman, declined to comment on the allegations.\n\nTakata's guilty plea removes another obstacle to the company's sale as it seeks a financial savior to help it complete the car recall.\n\nThe focus for Takata and prospective buyer Key Safety Systems Inc is now on whether to restructure the manufacturer through a court-mandated bankruptcy in Japan, a major bone of contention in the sale. Takata is aiming to sign an agreement with the successful bidder by March, people familiar with the discussions have said.\n\nKey Safety Systems, a Michigan-based air bag manufacturer that's owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp, was preferred over Sweden's Autoliv Inc as the bidder for Takata because a sale to the Chinese-owned company would have fewer antitrust concerns, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nKey Safety is also open to the option of letting Takata avoid a court-mandated restructuring in Japan, even though the preference is still for a court-directed process, a person familiar has said.\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nAutomobile sector\n\nFinancial crimes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/takata.jpg?VersionId=T5Qeg_mhl85eqwgyQjcFd9D_KNmZHqKW", "alt_text": null}]}

From all the accounts that influence people's minds, horrible events of the past apparently play the most pivotal part.\n\nFor Indonesia, the alleged coup attempt on Sept 30, 1965, blamed on the now defunct Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), is a past horror that has affected people's minds.\n\nMany consider the incident a thorn in the flesh, which is why communism is listed among the subjects to be discussed in the amendment to the Criminal Code (Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana or KUHP), which is now underway.\n\nDuring the deliberation of the draft revision to the KUHP, both the House of Representatives and the government share the opinion that Marxism-Leninism is a serious threat to the nation's unity and integrity.\n\nThe decision to address communism in the bill is said to anticipate a revival of communism in the wake of China's growing presence as an economic force and due to a borderless world that gives Indonesians access to \"foreign\" ideologies.\n\nThis happens despite the fact that China is leading a global campaign for free markets, the antithesis to communism.\n\nNot only have our policymakers ignored this phenomenon, they have also turned a blind eye to other thoughts that could potentially split the nation, such as radical Islamic ideology that wants to form a caliphate in Indonesia.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

One famous example of this paranoia was the massive campaign linking Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo to communism when he ran for president in 2014.\n\nCivil groups have ridiculed the idea that communism is the number one ideological threat. However, state institutions, the military and also some Islamic organisations remain steadfast in pushing their phobic narratives.\n\nAs part of precautions, the danger of communism and extreme thought must indeed be taken seriously. However, the extra attention against them must not justify oppression and abuse of power, such as happened in the past.\n\nWhile we agree that democracy is this country's philosophical foundation, measures taken to prevent and counter radical thought must not go against democratic principles. Any legal action taken against the supporters and perpetrators of radicalism should follow the rule of law, or else the democratisation that we have all witnessed will move backwards.\n\nThe Jakarta Post is a member of The Straits Times media partner Asia News Network, an alliance of 22 news media entities.\n\nSee more on\n\nEditorial Notes\n\nAsia Report", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/41638164_-_24_02_2017_-_indonesia_habib_rizieq.jpg?VersionId=E0p9hPKzzy7UaFFh0ZbN4dQIt7l2gI10", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

Laura, who is played by 11-year-old newcomer Dafne Keen, takes after Logan in more ways than one.\n\nStewart apologised that his health had not allowed him to attend a red carpet event on Feb 27, where 10,000 fans packed the space outside Taipei 101 for the chance to meet him and Jackman.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

A South Korean military official told Reuters the military would begin installing fences and soldiers would patrol the area.\n\nThe Lotte Group said on Feb 8 that Chinese authorities had stopped construction at a multi-billion-dollar real estate project in China after a fire inspection, adding to concern in South Korea about damage to commercial relations with the world's second-largest economy.\n\nAsked if South Korea had demanded the Chinese government suspend any economic retaliation, South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-kyun said: \"We have continuously persuaded China so far and will keep continuing efforts to do so.\"\n\nSouth Korean government officials have said Thaad is a defensive measure against North Korean threats and does not target any other country.\n\nSouth Korea's central bank said this month the number of Chinese tourists visiting the tourist island of Jeju had fallen 6.7 per cent over the Chinese New Year holiday from last year, partly because of China's \"anti-South Korea measures due to the Thaad deployment decision\".\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nSouth Korea\n\nDefence and military", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/thaad.jpg?VersionId=oPWK2x8vSfarZAIur4qu3rLs0VM.lIEK", "alt_text": null}]}

VietJet, known for marketing stunts like bikini-clad flight attendants, listed 300 million shares after an initial public offering at 90,000 dong a share.\n\nRising living standards and more affordable tickets from budget carriers like VietJet as the nation gradually liberalised its aviation market have helped boost demand for air travel. Vietnam will continue to see a double-digit increase in passenger numbers in the next decade, after annual growth of 17 per cent in the past decade, according to ACB Securities JSC in December.\n\nThe listing by Vietnam's only privately owned carrier will also boost the size and liquidity of the country's US$96 billion (S$134 billion) stock market, South-east Asia's second-best performer this year behind Singapore's Straits Times Index. Vietnam's VN Index has climbed 8.1 per cent this year, outpacing the 6 per cent advance in the MSCI South East Asia Index.\n\nHo Chi Minh City Securities places fair value for VietJet at 100,000 dong per share, it said in a Feb 7 note. VietJet is the leading low-cost carrier in a country at the beginning of a long-term growth cycle with a compound annual growth rate of passenger volume forecast at 14 per cent, according to the note. The airline has efficient cost management and potential to improve per-passenger ancillary revenue, it said.\n\nVietJet's core customers are working-class Vietnamese with low-to-medium incomes and an increasing demand for air travel, according to ACB Securities.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But at the same time, the country has forged ahead with its nuclear weapons and missile programmes despite tough international sanctions.\n\nEven China, its only friend, is getting increasingly fed up of its embarrassingly unpredictable ally. According to recent reports, it has refused to buy any more North Korean coal, thus bringing it in line with United Nations sanctions.\n\nA friend who has visited North Korea regularly over the last few years as a European Union consultant told me about the weird policies and the paranoia that hold the secretive communist country in thrall. Of course he was never allowed to speak to anybody without his official minder being present. But he saw the strict regimentation and the rampant poverty, especially in the countryside. Defectors from the North speak about the dreaded secret police and the concentration camps that hold thousands of those suspected of dissent.\n\nBut despite the hardships his people go through, Kim Jong Un reportedly has access to imported goodies like caviar and cognac.\n\nSo clearly, the sanctions and the stone-age agricultural practices and policies affect ordinary citizens, and not the party elites. And I'm sure that our own nuclear physicist Abdul Qadeer Khan - the man accused of selling nuclear plans to North Korea - was well looked after on his frequent trips to Pyongyang.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

And since people have no access to the internet, and foreign radio and TV broadcasts are still forbidden for North Koreans, they are unaware that they have a per capita GDP of a mere US$583 (S$819) versus US$34,300 for South Koreans.\n\nConstantly brainwashed about the existential US-led threat their country faces, they feel their sacrifices are worth the military strength they have achieved. And despite the presence of a powerful American army contingent in South Korea, the North presents a formidable threat to its southern neighbour.\n\nIn fact, it is the danger it poses to Seoul - a mere 60 km from the heavily militarised border - that has prevented outside forces from mounting an armed incursion to prevent this dangerously volatile country from developing a full range of nuclear-armed missiles.\n\nDespite the huge economic constraints the country's military operates under it has mobilised a huge paramilitary force of nearly six million soldiers, or around 25 per cent of the population. And although its anti-aircraft batteries and missiles are now outdated, their numbers still present a formidable deterrent. The country's poverty has not prevented its rulers from allocating some US$6 billion for defence annually.\n\nThus far, China has resisted calls to rein in its maverick ally, and to force it to change its behaviour. It has long feared that an imploding North Korea would cause a flood of refugees to cross over. And China has also desired a buffer between its borders and South Korea, with its powerful army, strengthened by a strong American force.\n\nBut now, by assassinating Kim Jong Nam, a member of the Kim dynasty under the protection of China, North Korea might finally have gone a step too far. While the reason for the killing by VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur airport is still unclear, the fact is that there had been an earlier attempt by North Korean agents. The current theory is that the North Korean dictator feared that his estranged half-brother might have been put up as an alternative to him by China one day. His elimination was thus a matter of survival for the paranoid Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe assassination has also strained relations with Malaysia which is furious that the very public killing took place on its soil.\n\nFor its part, North Korea has denounced the fact that it has been accused of being behind the hit. Its agents had probably assumed that given the subtle nature of VX, its presence would not be detected, and Kim Jong Nam's death would be assumed to have been caused by a heart attack. But CCTV cameras caught the swift action of the two women who carried out the actual hit while their North Korean minders watched from a safe distance before catching a flight to Pyongyang.\n\nKim Jong Un is the third in line from the Kim dynasty to assume absolute control of the country. Kim Jong Nam fell out of favour of his father, Kim Jong-Il for attempting to enter Japan on a fake passport to visit Disneyland. Once his half-brother took over, he had feared for his life and lived in Macau under Chinese protection. His visit to Malaysia proved fatal as he was constantly under surveillance by the North Korean secret service.\n\nNorth Korea is clearly an aberration in the 21st century with its secretive ways and its repressive rule. The half-baked socialist policies it follows has bankrupted the country, and yet it has continued on its prickly, paranoid path. The true reason its leaders refuse to relax their grip is to retain their position of power and privilege.

Three other Americans were wounded, and a $105 million aircraft was deliberately destroyed.\n\nIn a risky mission where almost everything that could go wrong did, the Pentagon has acknowledged that several civilians, including some children, were also killed. The dead included, by the account of relatives interviewed by human rights groups in Yemen, the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Al Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011.\n\nThe mission's casualties have raised doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation, initially during the Obama administration, and whether the right questions were raised before its approval, which took place over a dinner Trump held with top advisers five days after taking office. Senior Trump administration officials said that the Defence Department had conducted a legal review of the mission and that a Pentagon lawyer had signed off on it.\n\nBut the comments by Owens, his first public remarks since his son's death, cast a new spotlight on whether the mission's risks - to the US commandos and to Yemeni civilians - had been considered fully enough by Trump and his top aides.\n\nOn Feb 1, Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of Owens, who was known as Ryan, was returned to the United States. His death was the first in the military on the new commander in chief's watch.\n\n\"I'm sorry; I don't want to see him,\" Owens recalled telling a chaplain who had informed him that Trump was on his way from Washington. \"I told them I don't want to meet the president.\"\n\n\"I told them I didn't want to make a scene about it, but my conscience wouldn't let me talk to him,\" Owens said in the interview, which The Herald said took place on Friday at Owens's home in Lauderdale-by-the Sea, Florida.\n\n\"Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn't even barely a week into his administration? Why?\" said Owens, who told The Herald that he had not voted for Trump. \"For two years prior, there were no boots on the ground in Yemen - everything was missiles and drones - because there was not a target worth one American life. Now all of a sudden we had to make this grand display?\"\n\nThe operation was the first known US-led ground mission in Yemen since December 2014, when members of SEAL Team 6 stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. That raid ended with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him.\n\nOwens told the newspaper that he was a veteran himself, having served four years in the Navy before joining the Army Reserve in Illinois.

He left Google about a year ago after 15 years at the company, saying he planned to focus on philanthropy. He announced his plan to join Uber in January, saying he would work closely with Kalanick on the company's self-driving car program.\n\nThe Uber spokeswoman said the company did not believe its hiring process was flawed, but rather it was an issue with Singhal's failure to disclose the matter.\n\nSee more on\n\nUber\n\nSex offences\n\nGoogle", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/amit_0.jpg?VersionId=dA4KtWotlCi4YoEpLIy7ow1gUHEuZ8BZ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

As the company works to regain its reputation following last year's unprecedented recall of the Galaxy Note7 phone, it decided not to launch a new flagship smartphone at the show - breaking with tradition over the past three years.\n\nSamsung set the tone of its news conference with a video showcasing its safety testing procedures rather than touting the past year's successes or offering a flashy product announcement. \"Innovation is our legacy. Quality is our priority,\" the company's video said.\n\nThe company focused its presentation on new tablets, while announcing that its next phone will get its time in the spotlight at a March 29 launch event.\n\nThe company did not elaborate on why the phone's launch will come later, but it said last month when it reported the results of the Note7 investigation that it may delay its new phone's debut.\n\nThe next phone will have a new design, David Lowes, chief marketing officer for Samsung Electronics Europe, said in a live stream of the Barcelona news conference. But apart from an ad with the tagline \"Unbox your phone\" - which showed a stylized illustration of a phone with an edge-to-edge screen - the company provided no further details about its next model.\n\nThe next Galaxy phone will be a crucial test for Samsung, which had waged a successful campaign to chip away at Apple's iPhone before the Note7 crisis. The company has apologized for releasing phones that caught fire and exploded but has yet to follow up with a new smartphone to woo customers back and prove its stated commitment to safety.\n\nWith the Note7, Samsung flubbed an opportunity to score points off Apple, which in 2016 reported a year-long decline in iPhone sales for the first time. Samsung reported that it lost at least US$5 billion (S$7.03 billion) in sales and losses related to the recall. And that is not the only crisis facing the tech giant: Samsung also drew headlines this month after the South Korean government arrested its vice chairman and company heir-apparent, Lee Jae-yong, on bribery charges.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Furthermore, Samsung's brand fell from seventh to 49th place within a year, according to a Harris poll released this month that evaluated the reputation of household brand names.\n\nStill, despite its more measured tone in Barcelona, Samsung didn't pull all of its punches. The company showcased two tablets with designs clearly meant to take on top competitors, including Apple and Microsoft. The new 9.7-inch Galaxy Tab S3 is a high-end update to its Android tablet line. It has four speakers and will ship with the company's S Pen stylus.\n\nSamsung also showed off the Galaxy Book, a tablet that comes with a keyboard and stylus, which kicks off a new product line to compete with Apple's iPad Pro and Microsoft's Surface line. Unlike its competitors, Samsung will ship the Galaxy Book with the accessories necessary to make it a laptop replacement. Samsung also made a point to court the same creative class of customers - artists and designers who can take full advantage of its stylus - as have Apple and Microsoft.\n\nThe company did not announce release dates or prices for either product.\n\nSamsung is trying to rebuild its reputation by offering fewer and higher-quality products, a strategy that could improve its standing and reap greater profits, analysts said.\"Samsung is recommitting to its higher performance units, which offer better profit margins and opportunities to enhance the brand,\" said Rhoda Alexander, director at IHS Technology, in a research note shortly after the presentation.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nSamsung\n\nSmartphones\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nNetClass Technology Inc (NTCL) : News and History Unveiled\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nLurid tale of China\u2019s cross-dressing \u2018red uncle\u2019 goes viral online\n\nUS star Scarlett Johansson is highest-grossing lead actor globally\n\nAd\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA\u200b\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/41704870_-_28_02_2017_-_spain-telecom-mwc-mobile-world-congress.jpg?VersionId=r2guhT5_KleaiMmHBWBabCdxPULhRtlj", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

There were around 12 other detainees, and they told us to call our solicitors, if we had any.\n\n\"But it was a Sunday, and I only had my lawyer's office number.\"\n\nHer belongings are still in her UK home and she only carried \u00a325 (S$43.60), which are her earnings from working at the detention centre's laundromat, she told ST.\n\nUnder flight escort by four officers with the British authorities, she was sent on a long flight back to Singapore, with a stopover in Doha, Qatar. Two of her three sisters, Lily and Juspin Anthony, met her at the arrival gate.\n\nSaid Ms Lily Anthony, 54, a financial accountant: \"It was so sudden.

An ILR allows a person to stay in Britain without time restrictions.\n\nIn 1992, she moved back to Singapore with her husband. She stayed here as her mother was sick. When her mother died in 1999, she found that her ILR had lapsed as a clause in it says she cannot live outside Britain for more than two years. Her husband and their sons returned to Britain in 1998.\n\nHer numerous applications for another ILR have been rejected.\n\nHer case has caught the attention of the British press and pro-migrant advocacy groups in the past month. British MPs also weighed in on her plight, calling for the authorities to reconsider her deportation.\n\n\"Britain is her home, and there can be no justification for forcing her to leave,\" Mrs Clennell's MP, Mr Kevan Jones told BuzzFeed UK.\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"All applications for leave to remain in the UK are considered on their individual merits and in line with the immigration rules.

The 79-year-old Beatty handed the envelope to Dunaway, his co-star 50 years ago in Bonnie And Clyde, and she mistakenly blurted out La La Land. Two of the musical's producers had already given acceptance speeches by the time the third, Jordan Horowitz, realised the mistake.\n\nCullinan hasn't spoken openly about the error but PwC was quick to circulate an apology vowing to investigate what had gone wrong.\n\nCullinan and his colleague Martha Ruiz, who have personally handled the Oscars in recent years, recently explained in an interview that two sets of envelopes are on site during the event.\n\n\"We stand on opposite sides of the stage, right off-screen, for the entire evening, and we each hand the respective envelope to the presenter,\" Cullinan said in the interview published on medium.com.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

They were then to take Snapchat videos of each other doing so.\n\n\"Ruth said both thought it was perfectly safe because the ledge next to the linkway looked like a concrete structure,\" said Ms Tian.\n\nShe said Ruth also refuted earlier eyewitness accounts, which described Jonathan as \"vaulting\"over the 1.2m railing of the fourth-storey linkway to retrieve a phone that had fallen on what appeared to be a ledge.\n\nThe ledge was actually a decorative plasterboard casing, which was not meant to bear loads. It collapsed when Jonathan landed on it. He fell to the ground, and later died in hospital.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Three were seriously injured, including a woman news photographer who had a leg badly crushed.\n\nThe truck was topped with one of the extravagant floats that symbolise the world's most famous carnival.\n\nOf the 20 people injured in the accident \"eight were sent to hospital in ambulances,\" including three severely injured women, the Health Secretary of Rio de Janeiro's office said.\n\nBut despite the casualties and pools of blood on the rain spattered ground, the party soon got back in swing.\n\nBrazilians living through two years of steep recession and nearly 13 per cent unemployment have grasped this year's carnival as a chance to let off steam. In Rio especially, the thrill of hosting the Olympics six months ago has given way to the grim reality of rising crime and near bankruptcy of the state government.\n\nThere were intense cheers around the packed stadium of 70,000 people the moment that drumming began to thunder up from the piste.\n\nSamba queens dressed in sequined micro-costumes and vast feathered headdresses danced at dizzying speed. Behind them came armies of drummers and costumed dancers, interspersed by the floats.\n\nEach school picks a theme for its parade and is judged according to strict criteria. More schools were to parade on Monday night, with the champion being announced on Wednesday, the start of Lent in mostly Roman Catholic Brazil.\n\nThe most daring parade was from the samba school known as Imperatriz Leopoldinense, which chose the destruction of Brazil's majestic Amazon rainforest as its theme.\n\nSchools typically pick politically safe themes, often paying homage to Brazilian musicians. Paraiso do Tuiuti, for example, honoured the 50th anniversary of the \"Tropicalia\" musical movement.\n\nBut Imperatriz Leopoldinense waded into the debate over indigenous rights, agribusiness expansion into once pristine lands, and the future of the ever more under pressure Amazon.\n\nFloats included portrayals of the jungle, indigenous musicians, piles of skulls and a giant head of a crying indigenous man, crushed by a log the size of a bus.\n\nMembers of real native tribes were joining the parade to raise awareness about their plight.\n\n\"This parade is incredibly important,\" said Leticia Campos, 35, who was participating in a tight green costume with bright red wings, representing the forest on fire.\n\n\"People here never pay attention to the Indians when in fact they are the masters of the rainforest and it was stolen from them.\"\n\nThe parade has infuriated members of the powerful agribusiness sector, which is frequently accused of being a major contributor to global warming through logging and cattle ranching.\n\nThe Brazilian Association of Cattle Breeders called the parade \"unacceptable.\" The rice industry lobby warned of \"damage to the country.\"\n\nRio is Brazil's carnival capital. Tourism officials told Globo newspaper Sunday that as many as 1.5 million tourists have descended on the city, the best result in eight years, injecting some three billion reais (S$1.3 billion) into the local economy.\n\nSee more on\n\nBrazil\n\nAccidents", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/30-41680619_-_27_02_2017_-_brazil-carnival_.jpg?VersionId=UhM0IOCsjc_D6RWrSMB_eyoa9j8HqJQp", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/31-41680706_-_27_02_2017_-_brazil-carnival_.jpg?VersionId=IazdcUKPUBscPlryjtvrnmoo8OYBezCW", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/brazilcarnival-270217.jpg?VersionId=Rt8FijImthYJUjZKMuRd8DLpgHonZ.LJ", "alt_text": null}]}

Terms like sexual abuse are too weak to convey it,\" she said. \"This was not about truly voluntary migration, but forced or coerced deportation.\"\n\nSome children were said to have suffered \"torture, rape and slavery,\" she added.\n\nProfessor Stephen Constantine told the hearings that royal visits to such institutions legitimised them for people who saw the photographs, believing if it was good enough for the royal family, \"it is good enough for us\".\n\nThe hearings are being held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London.

Today was about bias, hatred and ignorance.\" According to transathlete.com, which provides information for transgender athletes, Texas is one of seven US states with policies it sees as discriminatory against transgender athletes.\n\nLou Weaver, who runs transgender programs for the LGBT rights group Equality Texas, said Beggs is abiding by current state rules, which need to be updated, \"so that guys like Mack can wrestle with their peers, which would be on the boys' team.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nWrestling\n\nGender issues", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/41662141_-_26_02_2017_-_sp_wrestler.jpg?VersionId=56Yu3kZe_EWIZ8Z9kgmDD_330MmE4u4u", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/41662142_-_26_02_2017_-_sp_wrestler.jpg?VersionId=HuHttgkswLMmivK7TUNpORiX6_dHEXcW", "alt_text": null}]}

But South Korean and US officials believe Kim, who had criticised his family's control of the isolated state, was assassinated by agents of the North.\n\n\"Among eight suspects in this case four are from the ministry of state security and two who actually took action are from the foreign ministry,\" Lee Cheol Woo, one of the lawmakers briefed by South Korean intelligence, told reporters.\n\n\"That is why it is a case of terrorism led by the state, directly organised by the ministry of state security and the foreign ministry,\" Lee added.\n\nMalaysian police have identified a total of eight North Koreans as suspects or as wanted for questioning. These include a North Korean embassy official believed to still be in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMalaysia's health minister Subramaniam Sathasivam said on Sunday that Kim Jong Nam died within 15-20 minutes of being assaulted by two women who are believed to have smeared VX on his face.\n\nHe had been at Kuala Lumpur International airport to catch a flight to Macau, the Chinese territory where he had been living under Beijing's protection.\n\nThe women, Indonesian and Vietnamese citizens, are in police custody and have told officials from their respective embassies that they believed they were taking part in a TV prank.\n\nTHREE TEAMS\n\nAnother South Korean lawmaker briefed by the intelligence agency, Kim Byung Kee, said the North Koreans had operated in three teams.\n\nTwo teams, each including officials from both North Korea's state scurity and foreign ministries, were responsible for hiring women in Indonesia and Vietnam and bringing them to Malaysia to carry out the attack. The third team provided\"support\".\n\nHe said South Korean intelligence said the North's embassy official in Kuala Lumpur, Hyon Kwang Song, was linked to the state security ministry and part of the support team.\n\nMalaysian police have said they may issue an arrest warrant for the diplomat if he does not cooperate, but it is unclear if they can do so given he has diplomatic immunity.\n\nThe one North Korean in police custody, Ri Jong Chol, was also believed to have been part of the support team, said Kim Byung Kee.\n\nMalaysian authorities have not commented on the roles that any of the North Koreans played in the killing.\n\nThe investigation into the killing, and Malaysia's refusal to hand over the body to North Korea before it is officially identified by the victim's next of kin, has caused a diplomatic rift between two hitherto friendly governments.\n\nSee more on\n\nNorth Korea\n\nKim Jong Nam\n\nSouth Korea", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/17-41690300_-_27_02_2017_-_northkorea-malaysia_kim.jpg?VersionId=yogLPWfZzEquckvI8oiB.lRd1eQW6nKq", "alt_text": null}]}

It's a very big endeavour and a very challenging venue to do a show there, but I don't want to make excuses.\n\n\"We're not going to be refunding tickets, but we apologise.\"\n\nIn the wake of the concert, which was the American hard rock icons' first in Singapore, social media was ablaze with complaints about the long wait for food, drinks and transportation, as well as issues with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) wrist tags that was meant to be used for cashless purchases of food and drink.\n\nSome concertgoers said they had to wait up to an hour to buy food and more than an hour for shuttle buses to leave the venue.\n\nTheir biggest grouse seemed to be with the RFID tags, which were given to ticket holders at the door. Many concertgoers had bought credits in advance but could not use them as the food and drinks ran out. There were 10 bars across the two pens, VIP area, and inside the hangar.\n\nMr Knudson said: \"We didn't plan the F&B out properly, we should've hired an F&B manager to plan out the flow of the audience in each of those pens and allowed people in Pen A to buy F&B from Pen B where there were more selections.\"\n\nThere was only one food stall in Pen A and three in Pen B.\n\nMr Knudson said his company was \"trying to embrace new technology\" with the RFID wristbands, but admitted it should have \"launched the wristband with the ticket at the very beginning instead of trying to force it at the last minute\".\n\nLAMC will be refunding any balance value in RFID wristbands but has not disclosed details on how this will be carried out.\n\nSandpiper Digital Payments Asia handled the software and systems for the RFID wristbands. Its managing director James Kane said it had raised concerns with organisers that there were not enough queues and staff at each gate to facilitate the large crowds.\n\nEntrances to Pen A and Pen B had only six queues each; by 7pm there was a backlog of thousands still waiting to get in.\n\nSandpiper, which worked with events such as dance music festival Road To Ultra 2015, said that while it had more than enough equipment on site to facilitate the scanning of large numbers of tickets, there were simply not enough staff provided by the concert organiser to do the job.\n\nIn a statement sent to the media, the company said: \"SDP did not feel that six entry queues for Pen A and Pen B would be adequate for an event of size over 30,000 people. However, it is the final decision of the organisers and their team to follow or ignore our recommendations.\"\n\nGetting in and out of the venue was a major problem too.\n\nChangi Exhibition Centre is accessible only by Aviation Park Road, a narrow two-way road, which saw traffic impeded by ongoing land reclamation works that took place on Saturday.\n\nMr Knudson said: \"We had requested that it be stopped on the day of the show but (the trucks) kept running all day, causing unnecessary congestion.\"\n\nWhile concertgoers made their own arrangements to get to the exhibition centre, LAMC sold tickets at $15 each for a shuttle bus service out of the venue to five destinations - Singapore Expo, Bedok, Tampines, City Hall and Bugis.\n\nMr Knudson declined to reveal how many buses LAMC had chartered for the night, but the mass exodus of concertgoers meant more than hour-long queues to get out, and many people getting on the 40-seater shuttle buses without tickets. Guns N' Roses' show was the second concert to be held at the venue; the first was Metallica's in 2013, which saw 40,000 in attendance and was also organised by LAMC Productions.\n\nLAMC Productions is not deterred from holding future concerts at Changi Exhibition Centre.\n\nMr Knudson said: \"It's a very challenging place, but it has tremendous potential to be the best concert venue in the whole region.\" Without elaborating, he added: \"I still think it's a better venue than the National Stadium.\"\n\nBut other concert organisers do not share his optimism about the venue.\n\nMr Matthew Lazarus-Hall, director of St Jerome's Laneway Festival, which held its seventh edition at the Gardens by the Bay last month, said of the place: \"The location and accessibility to and from seem to be an impediment to the venue as well as some of the site operations.\"\n\nMr Ngiam Kwang Hwa, 55, managing director of concert promoter One Production, agreed, saying Changi Exhibition Centre is \"less than ideal\".\n\n\"There's limited, if any, public transport options and with 40,000 people trying to get in and out, it's definitely going to be a problem,\" he said.\n\nLive Nation Lushington, an organiser of large-scale concerts such as the upcoming two-day Coldplay concert at the National Stadium, does not rule out the venue. But its managing director Michael Roche said: \"It has many challenges. All the infrastructure - food, beverage, toilets and transport, which is the biggest issue - would have to be in place.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nConcerts\n\nMusic", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/9-guns_n_roses_concert-41665058_-_26_02_2017_-_edgnr.jpg?VersionId=DJhtHPf1swQzPRddFp6RQq5CF3a_g5pe", "alt_text": null}]}

Sony unveiled concept earphones powered by Xperia Agent, a virtual butler that responds to voice commands and head gestures.\n\nWhile Sony's Xperia smartphones are an also-ran in a market dominated by Apple and Samsung Electronics, chief executive officer Kazuo Hirai has resisted pressure to shutter the mobile business.\n\nHe argues it will serve as a springboard into the nascent market for wearable and interconnected devices known as the Internet of Things.\n\nThe Japanese company is now betting on gadgets imbued with intelligent software to revive the formerly iconic consumer electronics brand.\n\nA messaging service may not seem like the obvious partner for the task, but Line joins a growing list of software companies entering the hardware space, including Facebook's acquisition of a virtual reality start-up and Snap's camera spectacles. The Tokyo-based company last year founded a machine learning and artificial intelligence lab to develop new services for its more than 220 million users as revenues from digital stickers and free-to-play mobile games slow.\n\nSony also unveiled Xperia Touch, a US$1,600 interactive projector that converts any flat surface into a 23-inch touchscreen, and a smartphone model with a super-slow motion camera and 4K screen.\n\nSee more on\n\nAI/artificial intelligence\n\nTechnology sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/28/sony.jpg?VersionId=TCXY0.2z3W7fzWYnh8qUv900C1xnxu.U", "alt_text": null}]}

Dozens of lawmakers in the lower house have switched loyalties to his party since he took office last year.\n\nThe four senators who lost their posts had attended a rally on Saturday to mark 31 years since the \"People Power\" uprising that removed dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The demonstration turned into a march to denounce the war on drugs.\n\nMore than 7,700 people have died since Duterte unleashed his bloody campaign eight months ago, a third in police raids and sting operations.\n\nThe authorities deny activists' claims that many of the other deaths were extrajudicial killings. \"If this is the price to pay for showing up at the streets ... for talking about democracy, if this is the price to pay, I'd gladly pay,\" said Paolo Benigno Aquino, who was voted out as head of the Senate education committee.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Sadly, the blood ties is also the most probable reason why Kim Jong Nam, 45, was killed in Kuala Lumpur on Feb 13.\n\nThe eldest of Kim Jong Il's three sons, Kim Jong Nam was born in 1971 to famous actress Song Hye Rim. His birth was kept a secret for many years because his grandfather Kim Il Sung disapproved of the relationship.\n\nMs Song was a divorcee of South Korean descent. She was born in the south-east of the Korean Peninsula during Japanese colonial rule and followed her parents to the North during 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nShe was kept away from Jong Nam whose main caregivers were his maternal grandmother and maternal aunt Song Hye Rang.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He was often confined behind walls with guards watching his every move. His aunt said he could be moody at times and had a short temper.\n\nEven so, he was the apple of his father's eye and deemed to be the heir apparent.\n\n\"Kim Jong Il doted on his son - sleeping with him, eating dinner and telephoning him when he was too busy to return home,\" said North Korean leadership expert Michael Madden, a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nEvery year on his birthday, Jong Nam is known to put on a military uniform and win \"promotions\" by his father. By age seven, he was already a top-ranked \"marshal\".\n\nWhen Jong Nam turned eight, he was sent abroad to study in Russia and Switzerland. His father started a new family and channelled his love for his eldest son to his new children, including youngest son Jong Un.\n\nJong Nam returned to Pyongyang when he was 18 and found himself trapped in a life of misery and captivity.\n\n\"It was very difficult for Jong Nam to feel free, as his father kept him under surveillance,\" Song Hye Rang wrote in a memoir published after she defected to Geneva in 1996.\n\n\"The feeling of emptiness grew stronger and stronger with each passing year, because Secretary Kim Jong Il had already left the house and was abandoning Jong Nam whom he had dearly loved,\" she wote in a translated extract of the memoir published on the North Korea Leadership Watch website, which is maintained by Mr Madden.\n\nIn 2001, Jong Nam grabbed international headlines after he was caught entering Japan on a fake passport in 2001.\n\nApparently it was the last straw for his father, because following that embarassment Jong Nam was banished to a life of exile in Macau where his second wife and children live. His first wife and their son live in Beijing.\n\nContrary to reports which said Jong Nam fell out of favour with his father over the passport incident, Mr Madden told The Straits Times that the two had kept in contact until the last months of Kim Jong Il's life.\n\n\"As in many parent-adult child relationships, they certainly had conflicts and arguments. However, he was never cut off from contact or support from his father.\"\n\nJong Nam was known to have travelled extensively to South-east Asia, where he reportedly kept mistresses and engaged in illicit business activities, and Europe, where his eldest son was studying.\n\nHe became media fodder and had a reputation of being a playboy and connoisseur of fine wines, lavish restaurants, luxury hotels and fancy casinos.\n\nTwice he was spotted at Singapore's Marina Bay Sands.\n\nBut in the secretive North, ordinary North Koreans are not even aware that he existed.\n\nA North Korean defector told The Straits Times last week (Feb 25) that before he escaped to the South in 2010, he had never heard of Jong Nam or his half-brother Jong Un.\n\nThe latter took power in late 2011, after the death of their father Kim Jong Il.\n\n\"The Kim family is God, but there are strict rules to follow. If you ask too much about the Kim family, you can be killed,\" the defector said on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Jong Nam was not someone to mince his words.\n\nIn 2010, a day before his younger brother was to make his first appearance as heir apparent in North Korea, Jong Nam told Japan's TV Asahi that he was \"opposed to third-generation succession\".\n\nIn interviews with Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi, who would later publish a book about their exchanges, Jong Nam called Jong Un a \"nominal figurehead\" and said the North Korean regime would collapse without reform.\n\n\"Even if it put him in danger, he wanted to tell his opinions to Pyongyang through me or other media,\" Mr Gomi said at a press conference held in Tokyo not longer after Jong Nam's death.\n\nThe talk is that Beijing had been offering protection to Jong Nam as an alternative heir to the North Korean regime in case Jong Un was dethroned.\n\nGiven China's history of invading Korean dynasties and interference with politics on the Korean peninsula, this could have deepened anxieties in Pyongyang about Beijing's true intent.\n\nThe two brothers were raised separately and met only once - during the private funeral of their grandfather Kim Il Sung in 1994.\n\nIn the wake of Jong Nam's murder, attention has shifted to his first-born and eldest son Han Sol.\n\n\"Where is Kim Han Sol?\" is a question that has kept the media abuzz, especially after Malaysian authorities called for Jong Nam's next-of-kin to provide a DNA sample for identification of his body.\n\nHan Sol, according to South Korea's spy agency, is in Macau - under Chinese protection.\n\nSee more on\n\nKim Jong Nam\n\nNorth Korea", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/26-41637946_-_24_02_2017_-_south_korea_north_korea_kim_jong_nam.jpg?VersionId=kiOXl7k2lb5diCYC53dEthHdHOBoBIME", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

Miss Universe pageant\n\nMiss Colombia was stripped of her crown minutes after host Steve Harvey awarded her the title in 2015.\n\nAs viewers around the world watched stunned, she had her crown removed and given to Miss Philippines.\n\nThe cringe-worthy episode was entirely Harvey's fault and left Colombians indignant on social media.\n\n\"I will take responsibility for this. It was my mistake; it was on the card,\" Harvey told the live audience.\n\n2. Australia's Next Top Model\n\nIn yet another beauty contest, a mix-up in the winner led to shocked gasps and dawning disappointment.\n\nHost Sarah Murdoch suddenly revealed the mistake after Kelsey Martinovich was announced as Australia's Next Top Model in 2010.\n\n\"Oh my God, I don't know what to say right now. I'm feeling a bit sick about this... I'm so sorry about this... it was fed to me wrong,\" said Murdoch.\n\nThe victorious Amanda Ware could not suppress a little cheer, and Martinovich herself was gracious in her loss, repeatedly saying: 0\"It's fine, don't worry.\"\n\nITV subsidiary Granada Media Australia, the production company behind the show's past six series, subsequently lost the contract, reportedly due to the cock-up.\n\n3. NRJ Music Awards\n\nSinger Katy Perry suffered some disappointment after she was made to hand back a trophy meant for fellow artist Rihanna.\n\nHost Nikos Aliagas announced the wrong winner for Best International Single at the French music award ceremony in 2009.\n\nHowever, Perry did not go home empty-handed - her album, One Of The Boys, won for Best International Album.\n\n4. MTV Video Music Awards\n\nMichael Jackson couldn't win this award - because it didn't exist.\n\nSinger Britney Spears was on stage to present the King of Pop a giant cake to celebrate his 44th birthday in 2002, calling him the \"artist of the millennium\".\n\nThe phrase made Jackson think that he was the recipient of the award, and he proceeded with an acceptance speech.\n\n\"Thank you very much... when I was a little boy in Indiana, if someone had told me that one day I would be getting - as a musician - the Artist of the Millennium award, I wouldn't have believed it,\" he gushed.\n\nTurns out his younger self would have been right.\n\nIn any case, the audience gave him a screaming cheer.\n\n5. Academy Awards\n\nThe motion picture awards ceremony had dished out yet another awkward moment back in 1933, this time in the Best Director category.\n\nTwo nominees' names both started with \"Frank\" and announcer Will Rogers made it more confusing by saying: \"\"Come on up and get it, Frank!\"\n\nFrank Capra begin making his way to the stage, but had to do a U-turn after he realised it was in fact Cavalcade director Frank Lloyd who pipped him to the award.\n\nCapra, who was nominated for his film Lady For A Day, described it as \"the longest, saddest, most shattering walk of my life\".\n\n\"I wished I could have crawled under the rug like a miserable worm,\" he said.\n\n\"When I slumped in my chair I felt like one.

It's a place for sustenance, not joy, and can hardly qualify as a dining destination when it lacks both greenery and charm.\n\nBut if you remember Christophe Lerouy as the original chef at Restaurant Alma before it attained its first Michelin star, then you may need to lock in the directions to this cement suburb of Mediapolis into your GPS and get down there.\n\nHis cooking was what gave Alma some grounding, even if its surroundings did not. But now that he's struck out on his own, he again has to make do with less-than-ideal ambience in this bar-turned-counter-dining set up.\n\nDSTLLRY par Christophe Lerouy\n\nWhere: 21 Media Circle, 01-01 Infinite Studios\n\nOpen: Noon to 2.30pm (Wednesdays to Fridays); 6 to 11pm (Mondays to Saturdays), closed on Sundays.\n\nInfo: Call 6334-4816\n\nPushing your way through large glass doors, you step into an all-black soundstage-like space, with harsh spotlights trained on an open kitchen, where Chef Lerouy and his team of young local chefs quietly assemble the night's meal.\n\nIf nothing else, fine dining is cheaper in this neck of the concrete jungle - the omakase-only menus are priced at S$95 for two tapas and six courses, and S$120 for the eight- course option.\n\nA single loaf of bread sits forlornly in a rather small see-through oven, so we know our names are on it. And so it is when its crusty, spongy self appears sliced and hot in a little cloth bag to keep it warm. Before long, three kinds of tapas arrive - a fish cracker (keropok) is topped with chopped raw and whole shrimp; a crispy skinned cold potato covered with smoked eel and tart creme fraiche; and lamb belly sitting on crispy pork crackling.\n\nIt doesn't justify our drive out from town at that moment, but a meal here is not a wham-bam performance of showmanship, but rather a steadily evolving meal that gets better and more intricate with each course.\n\nChef Lerouy's Alsace roots makes its presence felt in the menu but in a light, modern manner that is inventive and honest. There's nothing flashy about it, but it displays good technique and creativity.\n\nBeef tartare Asian-style features fresh meat lightly seasoned with a touch of sesame oil, topped with a savoury beurre blanc ice cream with a cold richness that plays off the silken meat very well. You also get to play with the condiments he's added - pickled cucumber, ginger puree and daikon puree cooked with soy which is almost a dead ringer for miso.\n\nFoie gras is served two ways - cooked in red wine for a slight alcoholic punch, and a whipped, aerated version, unexpectedly paired with coffee jelly and sour passion fruit jelly to balance off the richness. We're ambivalent about this but totally impressed with what is served next.\n\nIf you were a cabbage, you'd want to be in Chef Lerouy's shopping basket because he treats his vegetables the way chefs treat their prized wagyu. Why he takes so much trouble is an example of his philosophy that you don't need expensive ingredients to create fine cuisine. Here, he cooks the cabbage in a salt dough crust. It's brought to you still in its bread-like case, sliced open to reveal tender leaves which are immediately covered with thin slices of lardo and torched to create a layer of richness. The cabbage is plated and parsley sauce drizzled around it, decorated with dots of sour lemon conserve and egg yolk cream for extra depth. It's a lot of trouble for a humble vegetable, but the result is worth it.\n\nNext up is lobster poached till tender in garlic oil and chilli paste, adorned with roasted garlic and sweet black garlic puree. The chilli oil that is fused with lobster juices is made for dipping bread into. Chef Lerouy's imagination goes on non-stop with a winning tete-a-tete between escargot and tiny calamari, over a thin layer of squid ink pasta, parmesan cream and a pool of parsley beurre blanc.\n\nMelting-soft sous vide salmon in tomato bearnaise sauce and tenderloin flavoured with salty sopressado sitting on a brown jus spiced with paprika are examples of familiarity and controlled experimentation. We are not so hot on the confit ox tongue with the salmon or the potato fondant with the beef, but we'll give points to the chef for keeping our interest till the end. A deconstructed montblanc dessert ends off the meal on a comfortable note.\n\nOne thing that's clear throughout the meal is that eating on a high stool in stark, cold surroundings does not do justice to the chef's cooking. Food like this deserves proper tables and a classie, more intimate ambience. There's a lot of sincerity in the food, even if not everything hits a high note. If only he had the right stage, his would be a performance to watch.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\n@JaimeEeBT\n\nRating: 7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nOur review policy: BT pays for all meals at restaurants reviewed on this page.

Words such as \"inclusiveness\", \"empathy\", \"art\" and \"borders\" peppered the speeches of winners.\n\nThere was nothing as direct as actress Meryl Streep's thinly veiled anti-Trump speech during the Golden Globes earlier this year, but there was no mistaking Hollywood's stance on Mr Trump's edicts on immigration and transgender rights.\n\nMs Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, spoke of movies as \"proof that art does not belong to one single faith\".\n\n\"All creative artists around the world are connected by an unbreakable bond,\" she said in a speech.\n\nThe US' temporary ban on travellers from Iran and Syria affected two films, both of which won in their categories.\n\nIran's The Salesman won Best Foreign Language Film, but its director Asghar Farhadi, boycotted the awards to protest against the ban.\n\nThe producers of The White Helmets, winner of the Documentary Short Subject prize, were also affected by the ban, which prevented its cinematographer, Syrian national Khaled Kateeb, from entering the US.\n\nIncidentally, the two films set a precedent: They mark the first wins at the Oscars for streaming services Amazon, distributor of social drama The Salesman in the US; and Netflix, distributor of The White Helmets, which records the rescue operations of a volunteer team rescuing people from bomb sites.\n\nAmazon Studios also produced Original Screenplay winner Manchester By The Sea.\n\nThe wins for the streaming services will give the newer players a boost in prestige, making them more attractive to film-makers looking for alternatives to traditional studios.\n\nAnother surprise of the night came when the Best Actor award went to Casey Affleck instead of Denzel Washington, who looked to be the favourite after he took the Best Actor prize at the Screen Actors Guild of America (SAG) Awards for his role in the period drama Fences, which he also directed.\n\nUp till then, the 41-year-old Affleck was on a roll. For playing the troubled handyman Lee in Manchester By The Sea, he notched up Best Actor wins at the British Academy Film Awards (Bafta) and the Golden Globes.\n\nBecause there is a large overlap between SAG and Academy voters, it looked as if Affleck was out of the race. But in the weeks leading up to the Oscars voting deadline, he campaigned doggedly. In hindsight, it worked, and he shook off the bad press that followed allegations of sexual harassment that took place on one of his sets.\n\nBut how did La La Land lose the Best Picture prize to the underdog Moonlight?\n\nIt seems its lock on the night's top prize was more fragile than many believed. Since 2012, only one movie, Birdman (2014), has won both Best Picture and Best Director (for Alejandro Inarritu).\n\nOnly directors vote in the Best Director category, while everyone in the Academy votes for Best Picture. Since the bulk of the Academy is comprised of actors, the Best Picture prize tends to go to ensemble works that put acting first, while directors vote for a helmer's technique in mastering all aspects of a production, from sound to design to music and editing.\n\nThis year, it seems the Academy liked Moonlight's actors, while the directors felt that La La Land showed off Damien Chazelle's ability as a film-maker.\n\nLa La Land's wins in Directing, Best Actress (for Stone) and in the music categories had it poised to win Best Picture, but Moonlight's shock win also pointed to how Academy voters are now more ready to shower love on movies featuring minorities.\n\nIt still has a way to go - the Denzel Washington-directed drama Fences won only a Best Supporting Actress award for Viola Davis, and the biopic Hidden Figures won nothing.\n\nAlso, Ms Ai-Ling Lee did not become the second Singaporean to win an Oscar. She was nominated in two categories - Best Sound Editing alongside Mildred Iatrou Morgan, and Best Sound Mixing with Andy Nelson and Steve A. Morrow.\n\nShe and Morgan are also the first all-female team to be nominated in their category.\n\nIf she had won, she would have followed Mr Nickson Fong, an animator, who in 2013 won a Scientific and Technical Achievement Award for a technique that revolutionised visual effects.\n\nMoonlight's director, Barry Jenkins, receiving the award for Writing (Adapted Screenplay), saw the positives - while taking a hit at Mr Trump. \"All you people out there who feel your life is not reflected, the Academy has your back... we have your back. And for the next four years, we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you.\"\n\njohnlui@sph.com.sg\n\n\u2022The 89th Annual Academy Awards airs again on HBO (StarHub TV Channel 601) tomorrow at 10.35pm, on Friday at 9pm and on Sunday at 4pm.

Preheat the oven to 177 deg. C. Brush the baking dish lightly with oil.\n\n2. For the topping: Process the slivered almonds in a food processor and process until finely ground. Transfer to a medium bowl, along with the oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Drizzle with the \u00bc cup of oil; stir until well incorporated.\n\n3. For the filling: Combine the sliced pears, maple syrup and lemon juice in a large bowl. Sprinkle with the cornstarch, cinnamon and ginger; stir until the pears are evenly coated. Transfer to the baking dish, then crumble the topping over the pears.\n\n4. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until bubbling and the topping is lightly browned. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nRather than being loaded with added sugar, the natural sweetness and subtle flavor of ripe pears shines through, enhanced with a little maple syrup and gently spiced with ground cinnamon and ginger.\n\nAnd instead of leaning on butter, white flour and sugar for the crumble topping, this one is centered on the nutty crunch of ground almonds (or almond meal) with healthy oil and two kinds of whole grains: oats and whole-wheat flour.\n\nThe recipe has just the right level of sweetness to satisfy as a dessert, especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt on top, but not so much that it would be out of place for breakfast.\n\nI can tell you firsthand that, with a dollop of yogurt, it is a lovely way to start the day.\n\nNutrition | Per serving (based on nine servings): 250 calories, 3g protein, 40g carbohydrates, 10g fat, 1g saturated fat, 0mg cholesterol, 35mg sodium, 6g dietary fiber, 25g sugar\n\nEllie Krieger is a registered dietitian, nutritionist and author who hosts public television's \"Ellie's Real Good Food.\" She blogs and offers a weekly newsletter at www.elliekrieger.com.\n\nSee more on\n\nCooking and cookbooks\n\nFood and drink\n\nAmerican food\n\nRecipes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/pearcrumblewp.jpg?VersionId=..VSpv73nh2u2iRI3Bv8UcwMCdKcU.QH", "alt_text": null}]}

Well, we know that he gets his news fix online, and he surfs science and astronomy websites.\n\nPM Lee revealed his browsing habits during a\n\ndialogue hosted by venture capital firm Sequoia Capital\n\nin Singapore on Friday (Feb 24).\n\nHere are six things he shared about his surfing habits.\n\n1. He reads news online\n\nIn response to questions by Mr Shailendra Singh, managing director at Sequoia Capital, PM Lee said he reads local and international news on his desktop.\n\n\"I have on my desktop the news websites open: BBC, New York Times, Straits Times, Channel News Asia. They are there all the time,\" he said.\n\nHe added that he does not watch television any more because of this.\n\n\" If you want to see the snippet, it is there all the time,\" he said.\n\n2. He's into space\n\nMr Lee checks out the\n\nAstronomy Picture of the Day\n\n. The site, which is by the United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), posts an astronomy-related photo each day.\n\n\"Every day there is a picture, a nebula, a supernova, the sun, rings of Saturn, something like that,\" he said.\n\nThe site has been managed by professional astronomers Robert Nemiroff and Jerry Bonnell since 1995.\n\n3. He follows mathematics blogs\n\nMr Lee told Mr Singh that he \"sometimes looks at blogs by mathematicians to track what they are doing\".\n\nOne of the blogs he follows belongs to Australian-American mathematician\n\nTerrence Tao Chi-Shen\n\n, a professor at The University of California, Los Angeles' (UCLA's) Department of Mathematics.\n\n\"He covers all sorts of things,\" said Mr Lee. \"Usually I get lost after the first two paragraphs of his post but it is interesting to know what he is working on.\"\n\nProfessor Tao blogs about his research and expository papers, and invites discussion on various mathematic problems and issues.\n\n4. He tracks photography websites\n\nMr Lee is known to be a fan of photography, often posting pictures he takes on his social media pages, so having photography sites on his to-visit list is not a surprise.\n\nHe browses photography pages to get inspiration.\n\n\"You pick up ideas looking at what people do, how they take the pictures. Some hints, some sense of what you are looking for and how you analyse a scene,\" he said.\n\n\"Now when I look at pictures, you do not just say it is very pretty. You figure out where his leading lines are, where his focuses are, whether he put it on the one-third line or not and all sorts of technical things.\"\n\nHe likened the process to wine appreciation: \"It is like wine, oenophiles drinking wine and activating the brains instead of just the taste buds. But it is fun.\"\n\n5. Paid for a little-used Spotify subscription for about two years\n\nHe shared that he has iTunes, but does not use it very often. He let on that he tried Spotify, but did not use it much.\n\n\"I tried Spotify. I signed on and from inertia, I left it on for about two years and I was paying them $10 a month,\" he said. \"I will tolerate the advertisements every 20 minutes if I decide to listen to them again.\"\n\n6. He prefers physical books, but uses a Kindle for convenience\n\nMr Lee reads mostly on his Kindle, \"because it is much more convenient than carrying a book\".\n\nHowever, he lamented that the reading process on a Kindle device is not absorbed as well as with a physical book.\n\n\"With a physical book you have a sense of where you are, how far to go, where they fit together. You can flip back, you can side-line,\" he said.\n\nThe Kindle is not the same, he said, but the convenience makes it worthwhile.\n\nHe has previously shared his book picks with his Facebook followers.\n\nIn June last year, he wrote about three books he read while on his trip to the Middle East: Ari Shavit's My Promised Land: The Triumph And Tragedy Of Israel; Operation Thunderbolt, by Saul David; and A Rage For Order by Robert Worth.\n\nSources: https://apod.nasa.gov, www.terrytao.wordpress.com, The Straits Times\n\nSee more on\n\nLee Hsien Loong", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/19998399_-_04_05_2011_1.jpg?VersionId=Pg_YWsnRGsGK9uwwHnuomlcEvpFrze5v", "alt_text": null}]}

But his win broke a 20-nomination losing streak, the longest streak in Oscars history.\n\nHe was first nominated for the 1983 film Terms Of Endearment, losing to The Right Stuff. In the 34 years since, he has been credited on more than 200 movies.\n\nIn the speech he had long awaited, he began by thanking his colleagues, and then pivoted to a tribute to his mother: \"And a special thank you tonight to my mother, Skippy O'Connell, who 39 years ago got me a job in sound and when I asked her, 'Ma, how can I ever thank you?' she looked at me and she said, 'You know, I'll tell you how you can thank me: You can work hard, you can work really hard, and some day you can go win yourself an Oscar, and you can stand up on that stage and you can thank me in front of the whole world.'\n\n\"Mom, I know you're looking down on me tonight. So, thank you. Thank you all so much. I really appreciate this.\"\n\nO'Connell beat nominees including Singapore's Ai-Ling Lee, who with Andy Nelson and Steve A. Morrow, was named for work on La La Land.\n\nNotable loser-winners in Oscar history include composer Randy Newman. He won an Oscar for Monsters Inc. on his 16th try in 2002.\n\n\"I don't want your pity,\" he said when he finally got to give an acceptance speech. \"I want to thank first of all the music branch, for giving me so many chances to be humiliated over the years.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMovies", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/41680284_-_27_02_2017_-_correction-us-oscars-show_2.jpg?VersionId=KJfN25t87srdHH5HCaSnbPC0tEKwdsJA", "alt_text": null}]}

The \"will he or won't he\" surrounding his nominations had been a reason for most of us to follow the ceremony yearly.\n\nOr maybe La La Land's 14 nominations put you off.\n\nWhile it eventually won six, the film had tied the record for most nominations for a film, even for Best Costume which is weird because in the movie they basically wore, well, clothes.\n\nAnyway, apart from THAT moment of the Best Picture snafu which we will all probably be talking about for the rest of our lifetimes, here are five things that happened on this glitzy and glamorous night:\n\n1. Ryan Gosling's outfit\n\nThe La La Land actor has a very handsome face. But as he walked down the red carpet at Hollywood Boulevard, it was not his beautiful smile, smouldering eyes or statuesque physique that caught everyone's attention.\n\nInstead, it was his shirt. Underneath his suit was a white shirt with frills that had a classic vintage design.\n\nSocial media users had a field day, comparing his shirt to ones worn by their parents back in the 1970s, and even describing it as \"tragic\".\n\n2. Red carpet wardrobe malfunction\n\nActress Blanca Blanco wore a yellow and gold coloured dress, with a thigh-high split, to Hollywood's biggest night.\n\nTurns out, it was too high.\n\nThe star made the now questionable choice of going commando, and her lack of underwear provided the crowd with a lack of imagination, when her dress flipped open revealing what's underneath.\n\nDespite the faux pas, Blanco soldiered on pretending like nothing had happened. These actors are really good at their craft.\n\n3. Trump digs by host Jimmy Kimmel\n\nKimmel, who regularly dedicates segments of his talkshow to lampooning President Donald Trump, spent the night taking digs at the Commander-in-Chief.\n\nHe pretended to order CNN, the Los Angeles Times and New York Times to leave the Dolby Theatre venue, a reference to the President's recent press ban\n\n\"We have no tolerance for fake news. Fake tans, we love,\" he quipped.\n\nAcknowledging the President's preferred mode of communication, Kimmel took to Twitter and reached out to Mr Trump in a series of tweets. The tweets were retweeted over 100,000 times within five minutes.\n\nAnd while we're on the topic of Mr Trump...\n\n4. First Muslim actor to win an Oscar\n\nMahershala Ali made history when he won the award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Moonlight, becoming the first Muslim actor to win a golden statuette.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Ali emotionally thanked his \"wonderful teachers and professors\"and his wife who just gave birth to their daughter on Wednesday (Feb 22).\n\nThe milestone comes amid President Trump's travel ban saga.

Prosecutors had sought to question Park as a suspect, he said.\n\nThe corruption scandal erupted last year over accusations that Park colluded with a friend, Choi Soon Sil, to pressure big businesses to donate to two foundations set up to back the president's policy initiatives.\n\nThe scandal has led to weekly protests by tens of thousands of Koreans, not only those who want Park gone but also some who want to see her stay in power and blame North Korean agents for the political instability.\n\nPark, 65, was stripped of her powers after parliament's impeachment. She cannot be prosecuted while she remains president.\n\nThe scandal has also engulfed Samsung Group (SAGR.UL), South Korea's largest chaebol, or conglomerate. Jay Y. Lee, the head of the smartphones-to-biopharmaceuticals conglomerate, was arrested on Feb 17 on suspicion that he had pledged bribes to a company and foundations backed by Choi to curry favour.\n\nPark reiterated in a statement to the Constitutional Court read by her lawyer on Monday that she did not act in self-interest while in office. She also denied making improper demands or receiving illicit requests from Samsung.\n\nChoi, Lee and Samsung also deny wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors could issue up to another 15 indictments on Tuesday, including of Lee and other Samsung Group executives. Their findings were expected to be disclosed by Friday at the latest.\n\nHwang's office said the special prosecution investigation had served its purpose and it was in the country's best interests for it to conclude as scheduled on Tuesday.\n\n\"After much deliberation, the acting president has decided that it would be best for the country's stability to not extend the special investigation and for the prosecutors to take over,\"said Hong Kwon Heui, a spokesman for Hwang.\n\nHwang, who was appointed prime minister by Park in 2015, is seen as a potential candidate if Park's impeachment is upheld, which would trigger an election.\n\nHowever, soon after announcing there would be no extension of the investigation, Hwang found himself dragged into the scandal when the two main opposition parties said they would seek his impeachment too.\n\nThe special prosecution team has already indicted former Park aide Kim Ki Choon and former culture minister Cho Yoon Sun.\n\nShould the Constitutional Court uphold parliament's impeachment of Park, South Korea would hold an election within 60 days.\n\nSee more on\n\nPark Geun Hye\n\nSamsung", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/41460671_-_09_02_2017_-_files-skorea-politics-scandal-court.jpg?VersionId=CvIXBMkb_POjmGIXto1heJtFNZO5ox03", "alt_text": null}]}

But it was not, and the La La Land people quickly exited the stage as producers and stars of Moonlight, just as stunned as everyone else, walked on.\n\nActor-director Warren Beatty and actress Faye Dunaway had presented the Best Picture award. When Beatty opened the envelope, he took an extended pause before showing the card to Dunaway, who then announced La La Land as the winner.\n\n\"I want to tell you what happened,\" Beatty said in the chaotic moments after Moonlight was announced as the winner. \"I opened the envelope, and it said \"Emma Stone, La La Land.\" That's why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny. This is Moonlight, the best picture.\"\n\n\"It is true. It's not fake,\" said Moonlight director Barry Jenkins. \"My love to La La Land, my love to everybody.\".\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Let's remember it's just an award show, we hate to see people disappointed but we got to see some extra speeches.\"\n\nMoonlight also won statuettes for Best Adapted Screenplay and Supporting Actor.\n\nLa La Land, distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp and which had 14 nominations, won six Oscars, including Best Director for Damien Chazelle, who at 32 is the youngest to win the award. Casey Affleck won Best Actor for Manchester By The Sea.\n\nMoonlight's win was a crowning achievement for African-American film-makers after two years of controversy over institutional racism in Hollywood.\n\nInstead of the retro musical La La Land, a coming-of-age film about a black man, distributed by tiny A24, was Sunday night's big winner.\n\nOscar voters also honoured black actors Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) and Viola Davis (Fences) for both supporting-actor categories. Both were two of six black actors nominated for an Academy Award after two years when people of colour were snubbed.\n\nJenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney won for adapted screenplay for Moonlight, the first time multiple African-American writers have received an Oscar in the same year. \"This goes out to all those black and brown boys and girls and all those non-gender-conforming,\" McCraney said. \"This is to all of you.\"\n\nA lack of diversity remains an issue in front of and behind the camera, and the #OscarsSoWhite Twitter campaign of the last two years clearly bruised Hollywood, normally known as a bastion of liberalism.\n\nThe presidential election of Mr Donald Trump, a Republican, in November also gave this year's awards ceremony special significance, since actors such as Meryl Streep have directly drawn the president's ire for using their celebrity to make political statements.\n\n\"Thank you, President Trump,\" Kimmel said in his opening monologue. \"Remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist? That's gone, thanks to him.\"\n\nThat was one of several jokes at the president's expense, including several entreaties by Kimmel for Mr Trump to tweet about the proceedings. As of the end of the ceremony, he had not obliged.\n\nFew other presenters or winners made overt political statements. Ruth Negga, nominated for her role in Loving, and Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the musical Hamilton, were among actors wearing a blue ribbon Sunday night in support of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has battled Mr Trump's immigration restrictions in court.\n\nMeanwhile, Miranda was denied his chance to win an EGOT on Sunday. Just 12 people have completed the sweep of winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.\n\nMiranda, who has three Tonys, two Grammys and an Emmy and who was nominated in the Oscars' Best Original Song category for How Far I'll Go from Moana, had the chance to fill in his missing Oscar. No such luck. City Of Stars from La La Land took the prize.\n\nSee more on\n\nMovies", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/moonlight001.jpg?VersionId=kr_5q14aSj4XY9ZKFi67zW5a24jiJ1bH", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/moonlight.jpg?VersionId=oPHldcB01eIVFS5LtMH4aZa35HON4fZq", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/moonlight002.jpg?VersionId=rMhLdC66ThtzqDKf5j8hRzbeUZ4vpW9B", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/beatty3.jpg?VersionId=BxByN.2r_blo1uPfpz_EW_dJB8_kp7dK", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

While the academy has stepped up its game on diversity this year, it still seems to view it as purely a black-and-white matter.\n\nDev Patel, a British actor of Indian heritage, is not only the sole Asian actor nominated this year, but also the sole non-black acting nominee of colour.\n\nThe lack of Asian and Asian-American nominees has received some media attention over the years, but it has not created nearly as much uproar as when the academy has snubbed African-American actors.\n\nThis piece is by no means trying to pit one racial minority group against another.\n\nRather, we want to point out that Asian Americans, like African Americans, share a common struggle, which goes far beyond the lack of award nominations.\n\nThe more important issue at hand is the dearth of adequate and accurate representation of minorities in Hollywood films and TV shows.\n\nFor decades, producers typecast Asians in the role of the academically gifted best friend, the manga-loving gamer or the funny martial arts fighter. The Asian character was deployed usually as foil to a white protagonist, there to emphasise the leading character's struggles and growth.\n\nThen, characters like Cristina Yang on \"Grey's Anatomy\" and Mindy Kaling on \"The Mindy Project\" came along and took center stage in major network TV shows.\n\nMost groundbreaking was when \"Fresh Off the Boat,\" a sitcom starring an all Asian-American cast, debuted on ABC and was a network success. While these lovable characters have allowed more Asian Americans to occupy the screen, they have not always allowed for a more comprehensive and precise representation of Asian culture or the Asian-American experience.\n\nEddie Huang, whose autobiography was adapted to make the show, has openly criticised what he calls the \"neutered\" and \"exoticised\" depictions of his father and mother's Asian-American immigrant experience on the show.\n\nEleven episodes into the first season, Huang publicised his frustration with ABC's approach to the show and called it an \"ambiguous, cornstarch story about Asian-Americans\" that perpetuates \"an artificial representation of Asian-American lives.\"\n\nHuang ultimately stopped narrating for the show and claimed that he did not watch it because he did believe it accurately represented his story.\n\nThis romanticisation of Asia is not unique to \"Fresh Off the Boat\"; in fact, it is not even unique to Hollywood.\n\nThe mythologised idea of Asia dates back as early as the 1300s to Chaucer's depiction of Asia in \"Monk's Tale.\" And to this day, movies such as \"47 Ronin\" and \"The Great Wall\" perpetuate inaccurate ideas of Asian culture, whether they intend to or not.\n\nWhile Hollywood presents our fantasies, it is time for filmmakers in places like Taiwan, Japan and South Korea to present our realities. Movies set in ancient Asia featuring spirits and monsters may be fun to watch, but movies about the 228 Incident and the White Terror period, along with other significant historical events, could produce meaningful and potentially high-grossing films.\n\nTwo Taiwanese films that have performed well in recent years are \"Our Times\" and \"You're the Apple of My Eye\". Both movies were period films, set before the 2000s, about high schoolers in Taiwan.\n\nThe accuracy of the films and their characters made them successes with both local audiences and Chinese-speaking audiences abroad.\n\nIn an industry where any Asian representation at all, much less accurate representation, is already sparse, it may be time for our own industries here at home to make movies that feature us and the stories and culture dear to us. This is the only sure way of correcting wrong depictions of minorities.\n\nThe China Post is a member of The Straits Times media partner Asia News Network, an alliance of 22 news entities.\n\nSee more on\n\nEditorial Notes\n\nAsia Report", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/41676182_-_27_02_2017_-_oscars_87.jpg?VersionId=V_jMeAVLIp9wP.EQ9aDcHlUuB24rHGII", "alt_text": null}]}

No budget has been publicly released but authorities are spending millions of dollars giving Bhumibol a huge send off.\n\nFew Thais have ever seen a monarch's funeral.\n\nThe widely admired Bhumibol was the world's longest serving monarch until his October death.\n\nHe ruled for seven decades and his passing has plunged Thailand into an unknown future with his unpredictable and less known son Maha Vajiralongkorn on the throne.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Damon had to step down because of other commitments. \"I'm really proud to be part of this community,\" Affleck said. \"I'm just dumbfounded that I'm included.\"\n\nChazelle thanked his girlfriend, actress Olivia Hamilton, while accepting his statuette. \"This was a movie about love and I was lucky enough to fall in love while making it,\" he said.\n\nIt took six years for him to find a studio willing to finance and take a gamble on the film, which was conceived as a modern take on 1940s and 1950s Hollywood musicals. He also wrote the screenplay.\n\nIn 2015, Chazelle was nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for his breakout film Whiplash, about a young jazz drummer.

And State Councilor Yang Jiechi told China Daily this month that leaders from about 20 economies in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America had confirmed they will attend the gathering in May.\n\nXi announced the forum in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan 17. Coming just days ahead of the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, his address was widely praised in Europe as a robust defence of globalisation in the face of the potentially isolationist stance of the incoming US administration.\n\nBoth China and Europe are worried about the economic blowback from a more protectionist US and the potential threat it would pose to future trade. These concerns have provided a focus for the latest contacts between Chinese and European officials.\n\nEurope, however, is not immune to the populist, anti-globalisation trend. It was a factor in the United Kingdom's \"Brexit\" vote and will figure in a series of elections across the continent this year.\n\nThis helps explain why mainstream European politicians are stressing the need for equal treatment and reciprocity in trade relations with China.\n\n\"If we want to prevent the growth of protectionism in the international sphere, our great countries must be able to establish balanced trade relations,\" Cazeneuve told an audience in Beijing. \"There is still a lot to be done.\"\n\nThere was a similar message from Michael Clauss, Germany's ambassador to China, who last month told a Chinese newspaper: \"Opposing protectionism begins at home. That is why Germany will stay open for Chinese investment, and why we ask for more reciprocity from the Chinese side.\"\n\nThe prevailing rhetoric from Europe is that, while it welcomes large-scale Chinese investment, it would like to see greater access for European capital into the Chinese market. With anti-globalisation populists snapping at the heels of mainstream politicians this year in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, elected representatives have to persuade a sometimes skeptical public that ever closer trade ties with China truly represent a \"win-win\" opportunity for both sides.\n\nThere will be inevitable tensions along the way.\n\nEuropean officials have expressed unease over Beijing's growing bilateral ties with Eastern Europe, as it extends rail links through the Balkans. The European Commission was this week reported to be investigating the Chinese-backed Belgrade-to-Budapest high-speed rail link, a key element of the Belt and Road Initiative, to ensure its financing is in line with European Union laws.\n\nFrom China's perspective, one positive outcome of the Beijing forum in May would be to bring the Belt and Road concept to a wider European public and to present it as an opportunity. The initiative, at the moment, begs for more understanding and debate among European voters.\n\nA paper published by Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies last March asked whether the EU had already missed the Belt and Road train. It cited different perspectives and viewpoints among European capitals and the lack of a common EU voice on China's plans.\n\n\"The EU population is still not well aware of the OBOR (One Belt, One Road) initiative,\" according to the authors of the paper. They also criticised the European media for being too focused on Chinese mergers and acquisitions, rather than analysing the benefits of a long-term relationship based on a better understanding of reciprocal values and interests.\n\nThe paper also suggested China needed to update its public diplomacy on the Belt and Road Initiative to help build confidence among Europeans. The May forum should provide a platform for China's leaders to do just that.\n\nSee more on\n\nThe Asian Voice\n\nAsia Report", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/41624110_-_23_02_2017_-_china-italy-diplomacy.jpg?VersionId=UMsSnXmip0.r5Pqv4jg6bHS9l2vwlHpo", "alt_text": null}]}

The policy is on hold after a decision by a federal appeals court.\n\nFarhadi chose two Iranian-Americans - a female engineer and a former NASA scientist - to represent him at the ceremony.\n\nAnousheh Ansari, an engineer who was the first female space tourist, read a statement on behalf of Farhadi. \"My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the US,\" Ansari said, in reading from Farhadi's statement. \"Dividing the world into the 'us' and 'our enemies'categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war.\"\n\nThe Salesman tells the story of a quiet married couple whose relationship is pushed to the brink after the wife is attacked while alone in their Tehran apartment, and the husband goes to extreme lengths to seek revenge.\n\nAt the same time, the couple is appearing in a local production of Arthur Miller's play Death Of A Salesman, and elements of the work mirror their fraught lives.\n\nFarhadi's win came after thousands of people braved London's winter drizzle on Sunday for a screening of the film hosted by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Farhadi thanked the \"dear people of London who are gathered on this cold afternoon\", and said he was heartened by the reaction of film-makers and artists to \"the oppressive travel ban of immigrants\".\n\n\"I hope this movement will continue and spread for it has within itself the power to stand up to fascism, be victorious in the face of extremism and saying no to oppressive political powers everywhere,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Viola Davis won an Oscar on her third try on Sunday, for her acclaimed supporting role in Denzel Washington's big screen adaptation of August Wilson's searing play Fences.\n\nThe 51-year-old, a nominee in 2009 and 2012, bested a field that included two past Oscar winners - Nicole Kidman (Lion) and Octavia Spencer (Hidden Figures) - as well as Michelle Williams (Manchester By The Sea) and Naomie Harris (Moonlight).\n\n\"O captain! My captain! Denzel Washington, thank you for putting two entities in the driving seat - August and God. And they served you well,\" she said, appropriating a verse from US writer Walt Whitman.\n\nDavis and Mahershala Ali, who won a Supporting Actor prize earlier on Sunday for Moonlight, were among a record seven actors of colour nominated for Academy Awards this year.\n\nA film about the O.J. Simpson murder trial that transfixed the US two decades ago won the Best Documentary Oscar on Sunday, with its director Ezra Edelman dedicating the prize to crime victims.\n\nO.J.: Made In America, the nearly eight-hour documentary made for the film division of sports network ESPN, researches in depth the 1994 killings of the American football star's ex-wife Nicole Brown and her companion Ron Goldman.\n\nBuddy cop comedy Zootopia bagged the Oscar for Best Animated Feature film, crowning what turned into a record-breaking year of box office receipts for Disney in 2016.\n\nThe movie, which follows the exploits of intrepid rabbit police officer Judy Hopps, bested another Disney film, Moana, along with Kubo And The Two Strings, The Red Turtle and My Life As A Zucchini.\n\nSee more on\n\nMovies", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/viola_3.jpg?VersionId=KJZwGckuSDETFkYz1IaI_GhAhoiAyjGq", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/oscars12_0.jpg?VersionId=AIJSltLC5hnDeWUEwvTjyPoJU_QLcoXF", "alt_text": null}]}

And they served you well.\"\n\nShe was previously nominated for her supporting role in the 2008 film Doubt, and for Best Actress for the 2011 film The Help. As noted by The Washington Post, the win makes Davis the 23rd member of an exclusive group of actors who have won a competitive Emmy, Tony and Oscar for performance. Davis is also the first African-American to earn that distinction, as well as the first African-American actress to receive three Oscar nominations.\n\nAs she has garnered critical acclaim for her stage, film and TV performances, Davis has also earned a reputation for making powerful awards show speeches.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He started the day with a four-shot lead and with five birdies, four bogeys and a double-bogey, finished with a 12-under total of 268 - four strokes ahead of Morgan Hoffmann and Gary Woodland.\n\n\"My putter saved me,\" said Fowler, who was in the water off the tee en route to a double bogey at the sixth, and shockingly in the water again off the tee at 17, where he salvaged a bogey. He dropped another shot at the par-five 18th, where his third shot found a greenside bunker.\n\nDespite the ugly ending, the round saw Fowler win for the first time when holding the 54-hole lead on the PGA Tour, after four prior misses. His lead had dwindled before he rolled in a 40-footer at the 12th and a 25-footer at the next, and his advantage was up to five strokes when he birdied 16.\n\n\"It's nice to have a cushion when you are playing the last two holes,\" Fowler said, adding that the round in breezy conditions wasn't easy. \"To go from yesterday, where it was pretty chill out here, not a whole lot of breeze, and good conditions to just go hit golf shots and pick this golf course apart, today was completely different, a lot of crosswinds.\n\n\"This was a tough wind to play this golf course in.

Just didn't get the putts to come in down the stretch,\" Woodland said. \"But obviously Rickie is playing some great golf. So happy with the way I'm playing and looking forward to next week.\"\n\nEngland's Tyrrell Hatton, who started the day in second place, carded a two-over 72 to finish in a large group sharing fourth on 273.

This includes improving the quality of companies' disclosure of their CG practices and explanations for deviations from the CG Code.\n\nThe Council will also propose mechanisms to monitor the progress made by Singapore listed companies in strengthening their corporate governance practices.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The review of the CG Code will therefore take into account changes in Singapore's corporate landscape as well as international developments.\n\n\"With market participants paying greater attention to the corporate governance practices of listed companies, companies are now under increasing pressure to become more transparent and accountable to their stakeholders,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"It is important for our listed companies to go beyond mere box-ticking and boiler-plate explanations.

We expect those with no legal right to remain in the country to leave.\"\n\nMrs Clennell was detained on Jan 20, after a routine appointment at an immigration reporting centre in Middlesbrough, and has been held at the Dungavel Detention Centre in South Lanarkshire since the start of February.\n\nHer immigration battle, which has made headlines in Britain, has gone on for more than two decades. She was granted an Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) - which is typically given to foreign spouses of British citizens - when she married Mr John Clennell in 1990, after they met in a London pub. The ILR allows a person to stay in Britain without time restrictions.\n\nIn 1992, she moved back to Singapore with her husband. She stayed here as her mother was sick. When her mother died in 1999, she found that her ILR had lapsed as a clause in it says she cannot live outside Britain for more than two years. Her husband and their sons returned to Britain in 1998.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Micheal appealed against his conviction and sentence.\n\nOn Monday, a three-judge appeal court - comprising Judges of Appeal Chao Hick Tin, Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash - dismissed both appeals.\n\nThe court accepted that Micheal had used the parang to attack the construction worker, an Indian national. The \"sheer brutality\" of his attack warrants the imposition of the death penalty as he had shown a blatant disregard for human life, said the court.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

However, Justice Chao said the court was not satisfied that Tony had held on to the deceased for a significant period of time long enough for Micheal to inflict the fatal injuries.\n\nThe verdict was originally scheduled to be delivered last month but the court agreed to defer delivery of its judgment on the request of defence lawyers acting for the pair.\n\nThe lawyers, Mr Ramesh Tiwary and Mr Amarick Gill, had wanted to interview Donny Meluda, who was handed to Singapore police on Jan 18.

He was the highest-profile killing of a critic of President Vladimir Putin since the ex-KGB officer took charge in 2000.\n\nFive Chechen men from Russia's volatile North Caucasus are on trial for carrying out a contract hit, but those who ordered the killing have not been brought to justice.\n\n\"We came to pay tribute to the honesty and bravery of Boris Nemtsov,\" pensioner Galina Zolina told AFP, clutching a bunch of red carnations.\n\n\"We want to show the authorities that we haven't forgotten.\" Nemtsov, a charismatic figure who went from Kremlin insider under Boris Yeltsin to one of Putin's fiercest foes, was shot four times in the back as he walked home across a bridge with his girlfriend.\n\nSunday's march was permitted by the authorities but was not allowed to go past a makeshift memorial officials have repeatedly sought to dismantle at the spot where he was killed.\n\nSome 15,000 demonstrators, according to an estimate by the organisers and AFP, took part.\n\nHeavily escorted by police, they waved Russian flags and posters criticising the Kremlin and Russia's intervention in Ukraine, which Nemtsov had opposed right up to his death.\n\nIn one incident, an unidentified assailant threw what appeared to be a green antiseptic at former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, current chairman of the opposition People's Freedom Party. Kasyanov, his face covered in blobs of green liquid, stayed in his position on the front line of the march.\n\n\"The march can maybe get the attention of the authorities,\" said unemployed biologist Alexei Kuznetsov.\n\n\"It might be able to influence the investigation, show that the case resonates in society even if the authorities try to ignore it.\" In the northwestern city of St. Petersburg, some 1,800 people also marched in memory of Nemtsov, brandishing signs that read \"Who is the mastermind?\" \"Nemtsov was a true leader,\" said Andrei Pivovarov, local leader of opposition Open Russia. \"If he were alive, Russia would have been different.\" .\n\nLast October five men - including a member of an elite interior ministry unit in Chechnya - went on trial in a military court in Moscow for carrying out the contract killing for 15 million rubles (currently $250,000, 240,000 euros).\n\nBut despite claims from officials that the case has been solved, Nemtsov's family and allies insist that the probe into his death has left the masterminds untouched.\n\nThey say he was killed to stop his political activities - a murder trail that purportedly leads to the inner circle of Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's Kremlin-loyal strongman.\n\n\"The investigation stopped at the level of those who carried out the murder but nothing has been done to find those who ordered it,\" said Vadim Prokhorov, the lawyer for Nemtsov's family.\n\nNemtsov's slaying sent a chill through Russia's marginalised opposition.\n\nThe march came as authorities released prominent activist Ildar Dadin from jail in Siberia.\n\nDadin, who spent 15 months behind bars, was the only person to be convicted under a controversial law against public protests that has helped snuff out demonstrations against the Kremlin.\n\nSee more on\n\nRussia\n\nProtests", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/pzmarch27.jpg?VersionId=MTta.2SJXI6E6renF4MxU1j5VtuzjRnm", "alt_text": null}]}

This ties in with the ending of 2G mobile services in Singapore from April.\n\nThis means that phones like the 2.5G 3310 cannot be sold here to consumers and even if a person manages to get the handset from overseas, there are problems using it in Singapore.\n\nSingapore telco StarHub told The Straits Times that \"all 2G-only phones will not support calls, SMS and data services\" after 2G services end.\n\nConsumers thinking of using the 3310 to surf online on Wi-Fi networks in the absence of 2G will be out of luck, too - the handset does not have Wi-Fi support.\n\nStill, the new version of the 3310 will bring back its predecessor's popular \"Snake\" game and distinctive ringtones, said Arto Nummela, the head of Finnish start-up HMD Global which will produce the phone under a licensing agreement with Nokia.\n\n\"The telephone will allow you to talk for 22 hours, 10 times more than the original,\" he said during a presentation in Barcelona on the eve of the start of the Mobile World Congress, the world's biggest mobile phone show.\n\nLaunched in 2000, Nokia's original 3310 sold nearly 120 million units worldwide before it was discontinued in 2005, making it one of the world's best-selling mobile phones.\n\nAnalysts said resurrecting the popular model was a clever way for HMD Global to relaunch Nokia's brand.\n\n\"HMD launched three new smartphones and an iconic mobile. It is a way to create a halo effect around the other models by reviving talk about the Nokia brand,\" said Thomas Husson, a mobile analyst at Forrester.\n\nIn addition to the new 3310, HMD presented three new smartphones, the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 which will sell for different prices.\n\nThe Nokia 6 was already available in China and will now go on sale globally.\n\n\"We think (Nokia) could take 5 percent of the global smartphone market by the end of 2019. But it needs to get big quick or it won't work,\" said CCS Insight's device specialist and chief of research, Ben Wood.\n\nNokia was the world's top mobile maker between 1998 and 2011 but was overtaken by South Korean rival Samsung after failing to respond to the rapid rise of smartphones.\n\nIts telephone brand remains widely recognised, especially in developing markets.\n\nNow a leading telecom equipment maker, Nokia sold its entire handset business to Microsoft Corp in 2014.\n\nLast year HMD bought Microsoft Mobile's handset business and the right to use the Nokia brand.\n\nUnder the agreement, Nokia will receive royalty payments from HMD for sales of every Nokia branded mobile phone or tablet.\n\nSee more on\n\nSmartphones\n\nInfocomm technology", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/nokia-3310.jpg?VersionId=C32bWMS7zTbp3GNB.tgevav39UDsotw2", "alt_text": null}]}

I've only been nominated once before. I was a lot younger and I didn't fully appreciate the significance of it,\" said Affleck, 41, who was a losing best supporting actor nominee in 2008.\n\n\"There are a lot of people in the Academy... who I admire. Denzel Washington is one of the people who taught me how to act and I've never met the man.\"\n\nStone is expected to bag her first statuette in the best actress category despite a late push from France's Isabelle Huppert, who already has a Golden Globe and Spirit Award for rape-revenge thriller Elle.\n\nGosling is expected to be comfortably behind Affleck and Washington in best actor, however, languishing alongside Andrew Garfield (Hacksaw Ridge) and Viggo Mortensen (Captain Fantastic).\n\nTelevised live by ABC and shown around the world, the 89th Academy Awards will be held at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre, and hosted by late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. It begins at 9.30 am Singapore time Monday.\n\nIt is the highlight of the Tinseltown calendar, and wraps up two months of glittering prize galas. Fans of the red carpet parade are hoping the rain in the forecast will stay away.\n\nThis awards season, the popping of champagne corks has been muted by the tense political situation in the United States.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's controversial (and now halted) travel ban - which led Iranian director Asghar Farhadi to opt out of attending despite a nomination for The Salesman - has sparked much anger.\n\nOscars weekend started with an anti-Trump rally organised by the United Talent Agency in Beverly Hills, which featured speakers including Jodie Foster and Michael J Fox.\n\nAlso on Friday, directors of the five nominees for best foreign language film, including Farhadi, issued a statement condemning \"the climate of fanaticism and nationalism\" in the US.\n\nMoonlight picked up best film and director honours as well as four other statuettes at Saturday's Spirit Awards, which recognise achievements in independent filmmaking.\n\nDirector Barry Jenkins and many cast members wore pins symbolising unity, while Jenkins spoke of his disappointment over the divisions in society that the election had exposed.\n\nThe awards season has a long tradition of political activism, from Marlon Brando's Oscars snub in 1973 to Meryl Streep's rousing anti-Trump speech at this year's Golden Globes - and pundits are not expecting celebrities to hold back on Sunday.\n\nThis year's nominees reflected a push by the Academy to reward diversity after the #OscarsSoWhite controversy of the past two years that prompted calls for a boycott of the annual bash.\n\nBlack actors Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris are first-time nominees for Moonlight, while Fences hopefuls Washington and his co-star Viola Davis are both old hands, with 11 nominations between them and two wins for Washington.\n\nDavis is seen as a sure bet for her first Academy Award, and Ali is the favorite in his category.\n\n\"I watch the Oscars on TV. I come up with 14, 15 of my own personal speeches for that day to come when I get there... I'm in love with the Oscars,\" said African-American actor Andre Royo.\n\nFor Royo, best known for his work on HBO's The Wire, Moonlightis the best film of the year.\"\n\n\"The director executed the story from a real sensitive and organic point of view, and looked like he didn't care what the audience would think. He just wanted to tell a story,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nMovies", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/pzoscars27.jpg?VersionId=sXURCsiIOx7DvFob0KZa4pThFRijZg_4", "alt_text": null}]}

No one answers the door there and the mailbox outside is stuffed with unopened letters.\n\nIn fact, no company by that name exists in Malaysia. But two Malaysian companies controlled by North Korean shareholders and directors registered Glocom's website in 2009, according to website and company registration documents.\n\nAnd it does have a business, the draft UN report says. Last July, an air shipment of North Korean military communications equipment, sent from China and bound for Eritrea, was intercepted in an unnamed country. The seized equipment included 45 boxes of battlefield radios and accessories labelled\"Glocom\", short for Global Communications Co.\n\nGlocom is controlled by the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North Korean intelligence agency tasked with overseas operations and weapons procurement, the report says, citing undisclosed information it obtained.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Their citizens can travel to each other's countries without visas. But those ties have begun to sour after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's estranged half-brother Kim Jong Nam was murdered at Kuala Lumpur's international airport 2 on Feb 13.\n\nPAN SYSTEMS\n\nAccording to the \"WHOIS\" database, which discloses website ownership, Glocom.com.my was registered in 2009 by an entity called International Global System using the \"Little India\"address. A similarly named company, International Golden Services is listed as the contact point on Glocom's website.\n\nGlocom is operated by the Pyongyang branch of a Singapore-based company called Pan Systems, the draft UN report says, citing an invoice and other information it obtained.\n\nLouis Low, managing director of Pan Systems in Singapore, said his company used to have an office in Pyongyang from 1996 but officially ended relations with North Korea in 2010 and was no longer in control of any business there.\n\n\"They use (the) Pan Systems (name) and say it's a foreign company, but they operate everything by themselves,\" Low told Reuters referring to the North Koreans at the Pyongyang office.\n\nPan Systems Pyongyang utilised bank accounts, front companies and agents mostly based in China and Malaysia to buy components and sell completed radio systems, the UN report says. Pan Systems Pyongyang could not be reached for comment.\n\nOne of the directors of Pan Systems Pyongyang is Ryang Su Nyo. According to a source with direct knowledge of her background, Ryang reports to \"Liaison Office 519\", a department in the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Ryang is also listed as a shareholder of International Global System, the company that registered Glocom's website.\n\nReuters has not been able to contact Ryang.\n\nSMUGGLING CASH\n\nRyang frequently travelled to Singapore and Malaysia to meet with Pan Systems representatives, the draft UN report says.\n\nOn one such trip in February 2014, she and two other North Koreans were detained in Malaysia for attempting to smuggle US$450,000 (S$631,665) through customs at Kuala Lumpur's budget airport terminal, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.\n\nThe North Korean trio told Malaysian authorities they all worked for Pan Systems and the cash belonged to the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, according to the two sources.\n\nThe Malaysian Attorney General decided not to press charges because of insufficient evidence. A week later, the trio was allowed to travel, and the North Korean embassy claimed the cash, the sources said. All three had passports assigned to government officials, the sources said.\n\nMalaysia's Customs Department and the Attorney General's office did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend.\n\nThe Pan Systems representative in Kuala Lumpur is a North Korean by the name of Kim Chang Hyok, the UN report says.\n\nKim, who also goes by James Kim, was a founding director of International Golden Services, the company listed in the contacts section of the Glocom website. Kim is director and shareholder of four other companies in Malaysia operating in the fields of IT and trade, according to the Malaysian company registry.\n\nHe did not respond to requests for comment by mail or email.\n\nThe United Nations panel, which prepared the draft report, asked the Malaysian government if it would expel Kim and freeze the assets of International Golden Services and International Global System to comply with UN sanctions. The UN did not say when it made the request. \"The panel has yet to receive an answer,\" the report said.\n\nReuters has not received a response from the Malaysian government to repeated requests for comment about Glocom.\n\nPOLITICAL CONNECTION\n\nOne of Glocom's early partners in Malaysia was Mustapha Ya'akub, a prominent member of Malaysia's ruling United Malays National Organisation (Umno). Since 2014, he has been listed as a director of International Golden Services. As secretary of the Umno youth wing's international affairs bureau, Mustapha fostered political connections in the 1990s with countries, such as Iran, Libya and North Korea. Glocom's Little India address once housed a company owned by UMNO Youth.\n\nMustapha, 67, said he had been a Glocom business partner \"many years back\" and said it has been continuously controlled by several North Koreans, including Kim Chang Hyok, whom he said he knew. He did not divulge his role in the company, and denied any knowledge of Glocom's current business.\n\n\"We thought at the time it might be a good idea to go into business together,\" Mustapha told Reuters about his first meeting with his North Korean business contacts. He did not say who those contacts were or what they discussed. He denied any knowledge of Glocom's current business.\n\nGlocom advertises and exhibits its wares without disclosing its North Korean connections. \"Anywhere, Anytime in Battlefield,\" reads the slogan on one of several 2014 Glocom catalogues obtained by Reuters.\n\nAn advertisement in the September 2012 edition of the Asian Military Review said Glocom develops radios and equipment for\"military and paramilitary organisations\".\n\nA spokesman for the magazine confirmed the ad had been bought by Glocom, but said the magazine was unaware of its alleged links to North Korea.\n\nGlocom has exhibited at least three times since 2006 at Malaysia's biennial arms show, Defence Services Asia (DSA), according to Glocom's website.\n\nAt DSA 2016, Glocom paid 2,000 ringgit (S$632) to share a table in the booth of Malaysia's Integrated Securities Corporation, its director Hassan Masri told Reuters by e-mail.\n\nHassan said he had nothing to do with Glocom's equipment and was unaware of its alleged links to North Korea.\n\nAside from the North Koreans behind Glocom, clues on its website also point to its North Korean origins.\n\nFor instance, one undated photo shows a factory worker testing a Glocom radio system. A plaque nearby shows he has won a uniquely North Korean award: The Model Machine No. 26 Prize,\"named in honour of late leader Kim Jong Il, who is said to have efficiently operated \"Lathe No. 26\" at the Pyongyang Textile Factory when he was a student.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nNorth Korea\n\nKim Jong Nam\n\nKim Jong Un", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/41623453_-_23_02_2017_-_northkorea-malaysia_kim-expel.jpg?VersionId=GSEVg6uA1.nkrl5BaY0w3ZGnIWlaK31i", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

Some people use them as secondary phone to lend to visiting friends and family from another country and avoid roaming charges.\n\nBritish actor Eddie Redmayne, who won an Oscar in 2015 for his role as scientist Stephen Hawking in \"The Theory of Everything\", made headlines as he became the latest in a growing band of smartphone refuseniks.\n\n\"It was a reaction against being glued permanently to my iPhone during waking hours. The deluge of emails was constant and I found myself trying to keep up in real time, at the expense of living in the moment,\" the 35-year-old said of his decision to go back to a less sophisticated phone.\n\nWithin any age group, it's not hard to find people who refuse to join the smartphone revolution.\n\n\"I have no interest in a smartphone - it's expensive, fragile and I don't see the use for it,\" said Sandrine, 39, a Paris-based illustrator.\n\n\"There is also the whole commercial aspect as well, with the need to update phones all the time, without mentioning the opacity of work conditions in China\" where many smartphones are made, she added.\n\nGermany's Deutsche Telekom includes several basic phones in its catalogue to meet the needs of clients \"who just want to be reachable\", said a spokeswoman for the operator.\n\nNokia's original 3310 sold nearly 120 million units worldwide, making it one of the world's best-selling mobiles, but it is unlikely the revamped version unveiled Sunday, which includes internet access, will post similar sales.\n\nHMD Global, the Finnish start-up which bought the rights to the Nokia brand last year and is making the phones, is seeking publicity for the three other smartphones which it unveiled alongside the new 3310, said Forrester analyst Thomas Husson.\n\n\"It is a way to create a halo effect around the other models by reviving talk about the Nokia brand,\" he said.\n\nIan Fogg, head of mobile at research firm IHS, said that HMD, as a start-up, \"needs to leverage the warm memories (of the 3310) and show that they are innovating too.

The officer who arrested me was 'inexperienced',\" Henry Rousso, a historian who specialises on the Holocaust and the Nazi occupation of France, wrote Saturday (Feb 26, 2017) on Twitter.\n\nRousso confirmed an earlier announcement by officials at Texas A&M University that he had been detained upon arrival last Wednesday. He was admitted into the United States early on Thursday.\n\nRousso, 62, is a senior researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, or CNRS.\n\nHe has spoken over the years at several prominent US universities as well as the Holocaust Memorial Museum in the US capital, and was a visiting professor at Texas A&M in 2007, according to his online profile.\n\nIn an article published on the Huffington Post website on Sunday, Rousso said that a young police officer asked him to undergo a \"random check\" with informal questions.\n\nWhen the officer was unsatisfied with his replies, the invitation from the university and his visa, the interview became a formal questioning, which required Rousso to take an oath and submit to fingerprints as well as a standard body search to which he objected.\n\nThere were \"questions about my father, my mother, my family situation, with the same questions asked dozens of times: who employs me, where I live et cetera,\" Rousso said in the Huffington Post.\n\nRousso was told he would be put on the first plane back to Paris.\n\nBut in the early hours of the morning he was admitted into the US after the president of Texas A&M, an immigration law professor \"and several lawyers\" intervened.\n\nPolice told him that the official who had questioned him was \"inexperienced\" and was unaware that activities connected to teaching and research could be carried out with an ordinary tourist visa, Rousso wrote. No apology was forthcoming.\n\n\"On the other side of the Atlantic, one now has to face complete arbitrariness and incompetence,\" Rousso said, concluding regretfully, \"the United States aren't quite the United States any more.\" He thanked supporters on Twitter, and added: \"My situation was nothing compared to some of the people I saw who couldn't be defended as I was.\"\n\nIn late January President Donald Trump issued an executive order imposing a 90-day entry ban for citizens of seven Muslim majority countries, though not including Egypt. The travel ban has since been halted by a US federal court.\n\nSee more on\n\nFrance\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/pzhenry27e_2x.jpg?VersionId=3yIYVP__A8Rv76l4q23.v0GKEMx6.YGN", "alt_text": null}]}

The pin represents their support for the nonprofit American Civil Liberties Union, which works to defend the rights and liberties of the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n\nOthers, such as Nicole Kidman, took the opportunity to redeem themselves from past fashion faux pas. Her outfit to the Screen Actors Guild Awards in January, a questionable green feathered dress from Gucci, received much flak.\n\nMeanwhile, Meryl Streep (nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role for Florence Foster Jenkins) steered clear of the red carpet, likely to avoid a pre-Oscars brouhaha with German fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld: he had mistakenly accused her of canceling a couture gown order with Chanel for another fashion house.\n\nLagerfeld is the head designer and creative director of Chanel.\n\nStreep, however, took a front row seat at the Oscars in a blue, off-shouldered and sequined Elie Saab dress.\n\nHere are some of the best and worst looks of the night.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select. Stay informed.\n\nSingapore\n\nHSA intensifies crackdown on vapes; young suspected Kpod peddlers nabbed in Bishan, Yishun\n\nSingapore\n\nMan charged over distributing nearly 3 tonnes of vapes in one day in Bishan, Ubi Avenue 3\n\nSingapore\n\nPublic healthcare institutions to record all Kpod cases, confiscate vapes: MOH, HSA\n\nSingapore\n\nMan allegedly attacks woman with knife at Kallang Wave Mall, to be charged with attempted murder\n\nSingapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join Asean\n\nSingapore\n\nUN aviation and maritime agencies pledge to collaborate to boost safety, tackle challenges\n\nSingapore\n\nHigh Court dismisses appeal of drink driver who killed one after treating Tampines road like racetrack\n\nSingapore\n\n18 years\u2019 jail for woman who hacked adoptive father to death after tussle over Sengkang flat\n\nBest\n\n1. Taraji P. Henson\n\nThe charismatic and beautiful Henson, 46, wears the simplest of dresses so well, accessorised with a megawatt choker necklace.\n\n2. Emma Stone\n\nStone, nominated for Best Actress in a leading role for La La Land, is a beautiful vision in this Givenchy beaded number with layered fringe detail. The 28-year-old looks perfectly polished with glamour curls and deep red lips.\n\n3. Janelle Monae\n\nTrust actress and singer Janelle Monae's determination to stick to her black and white style and make it look fresh and interesting every time. Her Elie Saab Haute Couture gown might have a lot going on - feathers, sequins and beads on a sheer bodice - but Monae, 31, pulls it off with confidence and swagger.\n\n4. Chris Evans\n\nWorst\n\n1. Cynthia Erivo\n\nThe lace and embroidered dress by Paolo Sebastian just did not suit Erivo, 30. The British actress, singer, and songwriter's toned arms could have been shown to much beter effect in a toga-style chiffon dress instead.\n\n2. Leslie Mann\n\nPerhaps the Mann, 44, was going for Belle in Beauty and The Beast, but the wrinkles in her dress and that lackluster bow at the neckline killed that dream. What a pity as the shape of the dress is so promising.\n\n3. Zuri Hall\n\nTrends\n\n1. Feathers\n\nFor better or for worse, feathered dresses continue to dominate the red carpet. Feathers can be flamboyant, like Cher's feathered headdress in 1986, but when placed at the bottom half of gowns, it just looks like a feather duster. Hopefully this trend will die down quickly.\n\n2. Red dresses\n\n3. The blue tux\n\n4. Beaded dresses\n\nBeaded dresses are a lot more elegant than sequins, which can be tacky. Heavyweight red carpet style stars such as Nicole Kidman, Emma Stone and Jessica Biel dazzled in nude or gold beaded numbers.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/collage2.jpg?VersionId=l3ugjdo_pbuWADrtcMol01Z2mx1EsBWr", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Sunday that his speech will be cast in largely broad strokes, touching on an array of topics including healthcare, jobs, infrastructure and border security.\n\nTrump has said he will offer detailed plans on healthcare and tax policy around the middle of next month, issues that will be on the agenda on Monday when Trump is set to meet jointly with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nMany in the party say clarity on such issues needs to come sooner rather than later for Trump to seize the mantle on issues that could go a long way towards determining the fate of his presidency.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select. Stay informed.\n\nSingapore\n\nHSA intensifies crackdown on vapes; young suspected Kpod peddlers nabbed in Bishan, Yishun\n\nSingapore\n\nMan charged over distributing nearly 3 tonnes of vapes in one day in Bishan, Ubi Avenue 3\n\nSingapore\n\nPublic healthcare institutions to record all Kpod cases, confiscate vapes: MOH, HSA\n\nSingapore\n\nMan allegedly attacks woman with knife at Kallang Wave Mall, to be charged with attempted murder\n\nSingapore\n\nSingapore boosts support for Timor-Leste as it prepares to join Asean\n\nSingapore\n\nUN aviation and maritime agencies pledge to collaborate to boost safety, tackle challenges\n\nSingapore\n\nHigh Court dismisses appeal of drink driver who killed one after treating Tampines road like racetrack\n\nSingapore\n\n18 years\u2019 jail for woman who hacked adoptive father to death after tussle over Sengkang flat\n\n\"On many of these issues, President Trump will be the referee; he'll be the tiebreaker,\" said Representative Luke Messer, the House Republican Conference's policy chairman. \"I do think the sooner he makes clear his preferences the better, because it will help us work through these policy debates within our own party. My guess is some of that will start (Tuesday) night.\"\n\nTrump's trip to the Capitol on Tuesday is not officially a \"State of the Union\" address but it will have many of the trappings of such visits. Both Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence are planning to travel outside Washington later in the week to reinforce their priorities - something administrations typically do following agenda-setting speeches.\n\nThrough a series of executive orders in his first five weeks, Trump has set the framework on several initiatives, including stepped-up immigration enforcement and cutting regulations on businesses. He has also nominated a judge to the Supreme Court with strong conservative credentials.\n\nBut Trump can claim no major victories so far in Congress, where he is seeking an array of bold initiatives, including what aides say is a forthcoming infrastructure package.\n\n\"Despite some of the spin the White House is putting out about how much progress they've made on their legislative agenda, I'm not sure many Republicans see much progress on two key issues - healthcare and tax reform - and they're getting a little nervous,\" said Jim Manley, a lobbyist who was a longtime aide to former Senate minority leader Harry Reid.\n\nRepublican lawmakers are now hustling to assemble healthcare legislation that addresses dueling concerns within the party. On one hand, they are eager to fulfil seven years of promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act and lessen the federal government's role in healthcare. On the other hand, many are wary of roiling insurance markets and rolling back the ACA's expansion of Medicaid, a program that covers 76 million Americans.\n\n\"I think there are some very conservative Republicans in the House who are going to say, just get rid of the whole thing,\" Ohio Governor John Kasich said on Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation.\n\n\"That's not acceptable when you have 20 million people or 700,000 people in my state, because where do the mentally ill go, where do the drug addicts go?\"\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan from Ohio, one of the House Republicans who opposes maintaining the Medicaid expansion or other Obamacare programs, retorted on ABC's This Week: \"We didn't tell the American people we're going to repeal it except we're going to keep the Medicaid expansion... We told them we were going to repeal it and replace it with a market-centered, patient-centered plan that actually brings back affordable health insurance.\"\n\nAsked if he was confident there were votes in Congress for that, Jordan said, \"We better have the votes for that, because that's what we told the people.\" Trump and his deputies have offered little guidance on specific steps, and he has passed up opportunities to do so. In a January address to a Republican congressional retreat in Philadelphia, Trump offered no new details on what provisions he wants to see.\n\nAny healthcare legislation will require making major trade-offs between coverage levels and government spending that will ultimately affect millions of Americans, and Trump has committed to keeping two costly ACA mandates: requiring insurers to cover applicants who have preexisting health conditions, and allowing children younger than 26 to remain on their parents' health plans.\n\nTrump also said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he would not touch Medicaid - a promise that is at odds with the plans of House Republicans.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sarah Sanders said on Sunday during an appearance on ABC's This Week that nothing has changed on that front.\n\nAt town hall events across the country last week, pro-ACA activists and others pushed GOP lawmakers to explain how their plan would affect those now covered. Without key debates resolved on tax incentives, coverage requirements and the fate of Medicaid, lawmakers have largely responded in generalities.\n\n\"Healthcare can be a very stressful thing,\" Senator Tom Cotton, who faced a furious crowd of more than 2,000 constituents last week, said on Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. \"That's why when we repeal Obamacare, we have to get it right.\"\n\nTrump is facing similarly hard choices on tax reform, where Ryan is pushing a major change to the corporate income tax known as \"a border adjustment tax\", under which companies' imports would be taxed but their exports would not be.\n\nThat concept would appear to be compatible with Trump's preference for hefty border tariffs, and it could also offset the cost of a major reduction in corporate tax rates that Trump has promised. But some economists say it would raise the price of imported goods in the US and complicate existing free trade agreements.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday with Reuters, Trump said border adjustment \"could lead to a lot more jobs in the United States\" but did not explicitly endorse it. He had previously told the Wall Street Journal that it was \"too complicated\".\n\nRyan has set out an aggressive timeline for passing a tax reform bill, eyeing passage by year's end. Last week, Pence said he and Trump would deliver tax relief \"by summertime\". But that schedule assumes that Republicans don't get bogged down in healthcare legislation over the next six weeks.\n\nIn the nearer term, Trump has pledged to issue a new executive order this week in the wake of judges blocking a previous directive that sought to restrict travel to the United States by refugees and people in seven majority-Muslim countries.\n\nThe first order was rolled out hastily and led to confusion across the globe.

While some of the protesters support Park, most want her to become South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be thrown from office.\n\nPark, 65, was impeached by parliament in December and has been stripped of her powers while the Constitutional Court decides whether to uphold parliament's impeachment vote, with Hwang acting president in her place.\n\nShe cannot be prosecuted while she remains president.\n\nThe scandal has also engulfed Samsung Group (SAGR.UL), South Korea's largest chaebol, or conglomerate. Lee Jay Yong, the head of the smartphones-to-bio-pharmaceuticals conglomerate, was arrested on Feb 17.\n\nPark, Choi, Lee and Samsung all deny any wrongdoing.\n\nHwang, who was appointed prime minister by Park in 2015, is seen as a potential candidate if Park's impeachment is upheld, which would necessitate an election.\n\nHowever, soon after announcing there would be no extension of the investigation, Hwang found himself dragged into the scandal's fallout when South Korea's two main opposition parties said they would seek his impeachment.\n\nSpecial prosecution spokesman Lee Kyu Chul said Hwang's decision to decline the investigation team's request for an extension was \"very regrettable\" and that it had not had enough time to complete its probe, which ultimately targets Park.\n\n\"The special prosecutor's office will complete its investigation in a thorough manner,\" Lee said.\n\nThe special prosecution has already indicted former Park aide Kim Ki Choon and former culture minister Cho Yoon Sun.\n\nIt had also sought to question Park but was now unlikely to have time.\n\nShould the Constitutional Court uphold parliament's impeachment of Park, South Korea would hold an election within 60 days of the ruling.\n\nThe president's office has voiced concern that the special prosecutor's investigation could affect the outcome of any early presidential election.\n\nSee more on\n\nSouth Korea\n\nPark Geun Hye", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/hwang.jpg?VersionId=sHg68j1z35562M29VZu9MpvJ5rbKgZIi", "alt_text": null}]}

It also has dual rear cameras.\n\nChinese telecoms giant ZTE unveiled what it said is the world's first smartphone compatible with the lightening-fast 5G mobile internet service that networks expect to have up and running by 2020.\n\nTwo former big name phone brands - Nokia and Blackberry - also unveiled new devices on the eve of the congress as they attempt to make a comeback.\n\nNokia presented three new Android smartphones and showcased a revamped version of its iconic 3310 model more than a decade after it was phased out.\n\nBlackBerry debuted a new high-end device, the KEYone, that brings back the brand's signature physical keyboard and has a larger screen than previous models.\n\nLike Nokia, its new phones will be made under licence by a Chinese manufacturer.\n\nWhile Samsung did not present a new smartphone, it did present two new tablets with improved screens, battery life and speakers.\n\nThe congress comes as smartphone sales in developed markets, mainly Western Europe and North America, are poised to peak this year, according to research firm CCS Insight.\n\n\"Unless we see a major new disruption similar to the one prompted by the Iphone's arrival in 2007, we expect smartphone sales in Western Europe and North America to slowly decline after 2017,\" said CCS analyst Jasdeep Badyal.\n\nCCS predicts the global phone market will reach 2.35 billion units in 2019, up from 1.96 billion in 2014.\n\nSee more on\n\nSmartphones\n\nSamsung", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/41667026_-_27_02_2017_-_spain_mwc2017.jpg?VersionId=5FOs_AmVuSjUtfQjEUGZ9nXc9uaOXXI0", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

The new 3310 will have the 'Snake' game too\n\nBack in the days before touchscreens and snazzy graphics, \"Snake\" was the best game any kid could get on a phone.\n\nThe premise of the game was simple - eat as many dots as you can without knocking into the snake's body, which grows with the number of dots eaten.\n\nThere were many versions of \"Snake\" - the one on the original 3310 was \"Snake II\".\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Its battery life is billed as 'awesome'\n\nThe original was known for its extensive battery life, and the new version seeks to emulate that.\n\n\"The telephone will allow you to talk for 22 hours, 10 times more than the original,\" said Arto Nummela, the head of Finnish start-up HMD Global which will produce the phone.\n\nAccording to Nokia's site, the phone comes with a removable 1200 mAh battery, offering up to 31 days of maximum standby time, up to 51 hours of maximum MP3 playback time and up to 39 hours of maximum FM radio playback time.\n\nThe original had a standby battery life of 55 to 260 hours.\n\n3. The original phone was one of the best-selling phones ever\n\nLaunched in 2000, the original 3310 phone sold nearly 120 million units worldwide until it was phased out in 2005.\n\nAccording to a press release by Nokia in 2005, if all the Nokia 3310/3330 phones sold were laid end-to-end, the line would stretch from Helsinki, Finland to Santiago, Chile - over 13,500km.\n\nThe new phone - which reportedly weighs less than 85g whereas the original was a hefty 133g - is expected to hit the market in the second quarter of 2017.\n\n4. The new version includes a camera and allows web browsing\n\nThe phone is significantly different from the old version - the 2000 version did not come with a camera.\n\nThe new model, priced at \u20ac49 (S$72) on the Nokia site, comes with a 2-megapixel camera with LED flash \"for simple snaps\".\n\nAlso available on the new model is web browsing - but with a 2.5G connectivity, do not expect it to be as upscale as modern smartphone users are accustomed to.\n\nHowever, Nokia fans hoping to make calls on the 2.5G phone in Singapore are out of luck. StarHub told The Straits Times that \"all 2G-only phones will not support calls, SMS and data services from April\". This is because Singapore's 2G networks will be closed from then.\n\n5. New version, new colours\n\nIt comes in four colours - two glossy hues of warm red and yellow, and two matte colours: dark blue and grey. The dark blue hue is the closest to the original colour.\n\nStorage has been bumped up to 16MB with a MicroSD card slot that can support up to 32GB.\n\nThis may seem mediocre or even lacking, but consider this: The original reportedly could store only eight dialled numbers, eight received numbers and eight missed calls in its call records.\n\n6. The iconic ringtone is back\n\nAlso making a re-appearance is the iconic ringtone - although the details have not been fleshed out yet.\n\nWhat we do know is that Nokia is out for nostalgia by adding the tinkling tone back into the new device - albeit with a slightly snazzier sound.\n\nHave a listen\n\nhere\n\n.\n\n7. The phone has achieved cult status on the Internet\n\nWhether or not the new Nokia 3310 helps to launch the brand back to the top of the phonemaking charts, the original device has already secured its place in online annals.\n\nThe Nokia 3310 has been immortalised online with a proliferation of memes lauding its \"indestructible\" nature.\n\nThe meme, which has its roots in webpages and forums such as Reddit, posits the phone as an incredibly powerful force.\n\nAmong the names it has been given are: \"The Terminator of cellphones\" and \"the Witch King\", the chief of the Nazgul creatures in The Lord Of The Rings.\n\nThere have also been numerous videos and experiments posted on video platforms like YouTube to prove the hardiness of Nokia 3310 phones, including dropping it from heights and attempting to destroy it with hammers and even industrial crushers.\n\nSOURCES: AFP, Gsmarena.com, Knowyourmeme.com, Nokia.com, Wired.com\n\nSee more on\n\nSmartphones\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nNetClass Technology Inc (NTCL) : News and History Unveiled\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nLurid tale of China\u2019s cross-dressing \u2018red uncle\u2019 goes viral online\n\nWales coach Wilkinson issues plea for better opportunities after Euro 2025 exit\n\nAd\n\nHere's How To Evaluate And Enhance Your Career Health\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/41668967_-_27_02_2017_-_telecoms-mobileworld_nokia-hmd.jpg?VersionId=gSJsPTahAiXKXB7pjQ8xB0nIMgcdEnJl", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

He was also asked how the two sides could work together to enhance mutual trust.\n\n\"Singapore will continue to be a strong supporter of China's peaceful development and constructive engagement in the region,\" Mr Teo said.\n\nLast September, there was an exchange of letters between Singapore's ambassador to China, Mr Stanley Loh, and Mr Hu Xijin, the editor of the Chinese newspaper Global Times, after the latter published a scathing report criticising Singapore's diplomats for raising the South China Sea issue at the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Venezuela. Mr Loh had said the actions and words attributed to Singapore in the report were \"false and unfounded\".\n\nLast November, Hong Kong Customs detained nine armoured vehicles of the Singapore Armed Forces onboard a container ship transiting there.

One of them will be located in the southwest municipality of Chongqing.\n\n\"Traditional FTZs are geographically bounded, like a bounded warehouse,\" said Mr Chan.\n\nHe told reporters that in his meeting with Chongqing mayor Zhang Guoqing earlier on Sunday, they had an \"interesting discussion\" on how both sides can have a breakthrough transcending the concept of a geographically marked FTZ.\n\n\"In the new economy, boundaries are not necessarily the defining characteristics,\" he added.\n\nEarlier, Mr Chan witnessed the signing ceremony of 10 commercial pacts between Singapore and Chongqing companies as part of the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI).\n\nThe total value of the 10 deals are worth about US$1.4 billion (S$1.97 billion).\n\nThe CCI is Singapore and China's third joint project, started in November 2015, after Suzhou Industrial Park and Tianjin Eco-City. It aims to help drive growth in China's less developed western region by improving Chongqing's transport and services links to the region and beyond.\n\nThe four main pillars of cooperation are in transport and logistics, aviation, information and communication technology and finance.\n\nMr Chan said that Singapore and Chongqing could look to cooperate in new sectors, beyond the four pilliars, in areas such as medical, education, precision engineering and infrastructure under the FTZ.\n\n\"We could link up the CCI concept with the new FTZ concept, and we are excited by this,\" Mr Chan added.\n\nAnother signing ceremony held elsewhere in Beijing yesterday saw five pacts being inked on cooperation to improve the infrastructure and services in Tianjin Eco-City (TEC).\n\nStarted in 2008, the eco-city is Singapore's second joint project with China. Before it was developed, the site in the north-eastern port city was a mix of saltpans, barren land and a large wastewater pond. Today the 30 sq km green township more than 70,000 residents and 4,500 registered companies with a total registered capital of 200 billion yuan (S$40.9 billion).\n\nThe two governments are collaborating to develop it into an environmentally friendly and resource-efficient city that can be used as a model for sustainable development in other Chinese cities.\n\nThe new TEC agreements cover areas such as water resources management, digital media, healthcare, research and development as well as the implementation of a \"smart city\" masterplan.\n\nBoth signing ceremonies were held ahead of an annual high-level bilateral meeting between Singapore and China, which will take place on Monday (Feb 27) in the Chinese capital.\n\nKnown as the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC), the meeting is a platform to discuss ways to deepen and broaden Singapore-China cooperation.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean will co-chair the 13th session with Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli.\n\nThe 18th China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Joint Steering Council (JSC), and the 9th Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city JSC as well as the inaugural Chongqing Connectivity Initiative JSC will also be held on Monday.\n\nSee more on\n\nChan Chun Sing\n\nChina\n\nTrade", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/26/ccs.jpg?VersionId=FZCWum4qllR5m.hhjiknOSoQZOOas7wQ", "alt_text": null}]}

The total value of the 10 deals are worth about US$1.4 billion (S$1.97 billion).\n\nKnown as the Chongqing Logistics Development Platform (CLDP) and the Multi-Modal Distribution and Connectivity Centre (DC), the two projects are borne out of the Transport and Logistics Masterplan for the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI).\n\nThe CLDP, a company set up to do logistics planning, will develop standards and best practices for the transport and logistics industry. The DC is a logistics hub that caters to different transport modes such as river, rail, air and road, said IE Singapore.\n\nThe CCI is Singapore and China's third joint project, started in November 2015, after Suzhou Industrial Park and Tianjin Eco-City. It aims to help drive growth in China's less developed western region by improving Chongqing's transport and services links to the region and beyond.\n\n\"The two projects raise Chongqing's status as a key inland logistics hub for western China, and also contribute to China's Belt and Road initiative,\" said Mr Lee Ark Boon, chief executive of International Enterprise Singapore, the agency facilitating commercial projects from the CCI office.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious blueprint driven by Chinese president Xi Jinping that aims to bolster global trade by connecting China with Asia, Europe and Africa through land and sea routes.\n\nThe city of Chongqing is situated on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in western China. It is a key node linking China to Europe through a network of roads and rail across Central Asia on an overland route. It is also connected to Southeast Asia through a highway that connects to the port city of Qinzhou in southern Guangxi.\n\nIE Singapore will form a work group with the Chongqing Municipal Government to oversee and support the roll-out of these two projects.\n\n\"We hope that the two projects will serve as a model for future cooperation and play a leading role in spearheading other similar projects,\" said Mr Tang Zongwei, chairman of the Chongqing Liangjiang New Area Development and Investment Group. The company is participating in both projects together with other Singapore and Chongqing players.\n\nMr Teo Siong Seng, managing director of Singapore company Pacific International Lines (PIL), which is also a signatory to both projects, said: \"The two projects signals a breakthrough in cooperation between both sides.\"\n\nHe observed that in the past, cooperation projects tend to be investment-heavy, but in this case, it is the combination of a project that focuses on planning and does not require intensive capital outlay, and one that requires more capital investment.\n\n\"It is also notable that the projects bring together leading players in both Singapore and Chongqing, who would otherwise be competitors (in the transport and logistics industry),\" said Mr Teo, who is also chairman of the Singapore Business Federation and industry adviser to the CCI.\n\nThe other eight agreements signed on Sunday cover areas in transport and logistics, information and communication technology, finance and healthcare.\n\nOne of them is a deal between Singapore Press Holdings and Chongqing-based e-commerce company ZhuBajie Net. The two have set up a joint-venture company for a bilingual business-to-business online creative services platform targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises in Singapore, Malaysia and other parts of Southeast Asia.\n\nOn Sunday, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing and Chongqing Mayor Zhang Guoqing witnessed the signing ceremony of the 10 projects at a hotel in Beijing.\n\nThe signing ceremony was held ahead of an annual high-level bilateral meeting between Singapore and China, which will take place on Monday (Feb 27) in the Chinese capital.\n\nKnown as the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC), the meeting is a platform to discuss ways to deepen and broaden Singapore-China cooperation.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean will co-chair the 13th session with Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli.\n\nThe 18th China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Joint Steering Council (JSC), and the 9th Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city JSC as well as the inaugural Chongqing Connectivity Initiative JSC will also be held on Monday.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nSingapore foreign policy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/26/c069382c-4133-4fc8-b50f-cc48ead2d795.jpg?VersionId=K8fq6qaZRF1QmjCrc9U2oV.5luCeq.Tc", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/26/meeting0226.png?VersionId=0x7py12OvsHAeEUJl.lwfIZ00F_zd7L2", "alt_text": null}]}

And if Ms Ai-Ling Lee wins, she might be making history along the director of the film on which she worked, the musical La La Land.\n\nThe film's director, Damien Chazelle, is expected to bag the Best Director Oscar, and if that happens, he will become the youngest-ever person with that award.\n\nMs Lee, 38, is nominated in two categories - Best Sound Editing alongside Mildred Iatrou Morgan, and Best Sound Mixing with Andy Nelson and Steve A. Morrow.\n\nShe and Morgan are also the first all-female team to be nominated in their category.\n\nIf Ms Lee wins, she will not be the first Singaporean with an Oscar. In 2013, Nickson Fong, an animator, won a Scientific and Technical Achievement Award for a technique that revolutionised visual effects.\n\nThe momentum on Sunday (Monday, Feb 27, Singapore time) will be behind La La Land, which at 14 nominations, gives it a tie with Titanic (1997) and All About Eve (1950) for the most nods. With its global box office of over US$360 million (S$505 million), it is also the most commercially successful of the Best Picture nominees.\n\nThis will also be the first Academy Awards held since Mr Donald Trump became President of The United States.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But if recent Golden Globes are anything to go by, a few stars will be tempted to use the podium, with its televised reach into 225 countries, to condemn his actions.\n\nOr, if they prefer to be more positive, they might lean heavily on how their film teaches inclusivity and the acceptance of those who are different.\n\nThe streets around the Dolby Theater, where the ceremony will take place, are cordoned off, but at 10am on Sunday, fans hoping to catch a glimpse, or perhaps even get an selfie or autograph of a star, could be seen waiting by the fenced-off zones.\n\nMost of the Los Angeles natives that I spoke to were scornful of the Academy Awards. They tend to see it as a gathering of the elites eager to congratulate themselves. The Academy's love of La La Land, a film that celebrates the Hollywood dream factory, is proof of that sentiment, they say.\n\nBut on the street, there are less cynical out-of-towners such as teenager, Ms Sierra Charles, who is hoping for a Best Picture win for her favourite film, Hidden Figures. It is a biopic about the contributions of African-American women to the American space programme in the 1960s. With Trump-style conservatism is at its height, the film's message is inspiring, she says.\n\n\"It's just so powerful. It's a good movie to come out during this time.\"\n\nThe 89th Annual Academy Awards airs on HBO (StarHub TV Channel 601) on Monday at 8am Singapore time, with an encore telecast the same day at 7pm.\n\nSee more on\n\nOscars\n\nMovies", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/sunday_street2.jpg?VersionId=YHwJYp4WCNOtKSNeyIsq1O7wbEh0ylDZ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

Dr Lee is also the co-author of Shaping Maths and Maths Works!\n\nADVICE FOR STUDENTS\n\n1. Try to understand the problem first. What is the problem about? What information is given to you and how does it help you to better make sense of the given diagram? What else do you know given that the area of Triangle BEC is three times the area of Triangle AED? Did you use any other information that is not given in the question? If yes, why do you think the information is true for this question?\n\n2. Work out a plan to solve the problem. What can you do with the information given? What other information can you derive? Can you represent all these on another diagram?\n\n3. Try to make sense of the answer. Is there a way to check it? What have you learnt from solving this problem?\n\nADVICE FOR PARENTS\n\n1. Refrain from telling the child what to do, such as telling the child to \"look at\" the diagram. Instead prompt the child to make sense of the given problem more holistically, e.g. \"Did you manage to get all the information about the problem?\" or \"Where else in the problem can you get more information about the problem?\"\n\n2. Encourage the child to annotate the given diagram and to draw additional diagrams where necessary to develop a plan to solve the problem. This would make it easier for the child to better visualise possible relationships that might exist between the unfamiliar.\n\n3. Help the child look for words to activate the necessary mathematics knowledge and skills. In this case, the skill needed is how to find the area of a triangle, which is determined by the formula \u00bd x base x height. There are several triangles in this problem. Encourage the child to determine the areas of those which they can identify a base and corresponding height as a start.\n\n4. In most problems where diagrams are involved, they are only drawn to proportion but not to scale. Some children may make invalid conclusions about the diagram based on visual illusion.\n\nBrought to you by Marshall Cavendish Education", "images": []}

I was able to avoid the trouble and make some birdies.\"\n\nFowler's 54-hole total is one off the record set by Davis Love in 2003.\n\nHatton, whose five victories as a professional include a European Tour win at the Alfred Dunill Links Championship last year, was just one stroke adrift after birdies at the 12th, 13th and 14th.\n\nBut he bogeyed at the 17th as Fowler birdied two of his last three.\n\n\"I'll go out there and play the best I can tomorrow, that's all I can do,\" said Hatton, who finished equal fifth in the Open Championship and tied for 10th in the PGA Championship last year.\n\n\"I can only control what I do and we'll see how it goes.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nGolf players\n\nGolf tournaments", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/26/15-rickie_fowler_-41659980_-_26_02_2017_-_spo-glf-usp-the-honda-classic-round-three.jpg?VersionId=N00rtS46KoQyy_qy7V9YWSg2SnJFWv0a", "alt_text": null}]}

This year, Samsung has postponed the presentation of the Galaxy S8, its next key device.\n\nInstead, it took the wraps off the Galaxy Tab S3 and the Galaxy Book, which comes in a 10.6-inch and a 12-inch version.\n\nThe Galaxy Book will run on Microsoft Windows 10. The Tab S3 will have speakers by Harman-owned AKG, Samsung's first use of the brand since agreeing to buy Harman for US$8 billion last year.\n\nSamsung withdrew the Galaxy Note 7 last October after faulty batteries led some devices to catch fire, leading to a loss of consumer trust, wiping out US$5.3 billion of operating profit, and allowing Apple's iPhone to overtake it in sales.\n\nSamsung's smartphone market share dropped to 17.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, while Apple's rose to 17.8 per cent, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics.\n\nSamsung is expected to launch the S8 in April.

We played to the laws and I thought we were fantastic.\n\n\"I'm very proud of the players today.\" Italy kept the game scoreless until the 24th minute when England prop Dan Cole was driven over for an unconverted try.\n\nBut Allan, who missed two earlier penalty attempts, cut the deficit for the vast underdogs with a well-taken drop-goal in the 33rd minute.\n\nEngland, who had been massive odds-on favourites at 1/150 with some bookmakers before kick-off, astonishingly found themselves behind on the stroke of half-time.\n\nAn Allan penalty came back off the post and wing Giovanbattista Venditti was first to the loose ball for a try that stunned Twickenham.\n\nAllan converted and Italy turned round five points in front.\n\nBut two tries in three minutes early in the second half from Danny Care and Elliot Daly, the latter converted by Owen Farrell, saw England into a 17-10 lead.\n\nThe opening quarter had ended with the game still scoreless as Italy frustrated England.\n\nHartley repeatedly asked for clarification from referee Romain Poite over what he would allow at the ruck, only for the French official to reply: \"I am not a coach.\" England, unlike Italy however, did make the most of their first clear chance, with Cole bundled over from a catch and drive.\n\nFarrell, winning his 50th cap, sliced his conversion but England were 5-0 up.\n\nEngland, however, generally struggled to get out of their 22 and Italy's pressure was rewarded when Allan landed a 20-metre drop-goal to cut the deficit to two points before Venditti's try threatened an upset.\n\nEngland regained the initiative with two tries in a matter of minutes at the start of the second half.\n\nCare, in a move all too familiar to O'Shea, who coached him at London club Harlequins, then caught the Italian defence napping with a try off a quick tap penalty that left the scores tied at 10-10 following Farrell's missed conversion.\n\nThree minutes later, England went over again.\n\nThey won a line-out and, after Maro Itoje fed James Haskell, the ball was spread wide and wing Daly - whose late try saw England come from behind to beat Wales - went over.\n\nThis time Farrell converted and England had breathing space at 17-10.\n\nItaly though were far from finished with Campagnaro, who plays his club rugby in England for Exeter, brushing past fly-half George Ford and weaving past fullback Mike Brown for a fine try.\n\nPadovani failed with the conversion but England's lead had been cut to just two points.\n\nThe normally reliable Farrell then missed another penalty before Nowell, either side of Te'o's score, crossed twice against a tiring defence.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nRugby\n\nBritain", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/pzrugby27.jpg?VersionId=WOOYZVrBtaYpyOuGcJBPd8jgpiJjafMC", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

Stoke could barely manage to rouse themselves and after Joe Allen hit the side netting for the visitors, Kane produced the 14th-minute opening goal that put the home side firmly in control.\n\nThe chance came when Stoke's Ryan Shawcross failed to clear Eriksen's threaded pass, but Kane's finish was ruthless, with the striker latching onto the loose ball and producing a first-time shot that flew across keeper Lee Grant.\n\nThe technique Kane demonstrated in claiming his second in the 32nd minute was even better.\n\nEriksen's right-wing corner was played out to Kane, who had positioned himself on the edge of the area, where he hit the bouncing ball on the full, left-footed, inside Grant's right-hand post.\n\nPrior to that, Stoke threatened when Peter Crouch slid in to meet Erik Pieters' low cross, only to be denied by the boot of Spurs Keeper Hugo Lloris, while Charlie Adam collected a booking for a foul on Alli.\n\nBut their response quickly faded and Tottenham's third came when Adam again fouled Alli to concede a free-kick 30 yards out.\n\nEriksen rolled the ball to Kane, whose low shot deflected off the defensive wall, wrong-footing Grant and securing the striker's hat-trick.\n\nStoke boss Mark Hughes was clearly angered by his side's display but worse was to come in first-half stoppage time when Kane out-paced Bruno Martins-Indi on the right and burst into the box before squaring for Alli, who slid in for the fourth.\n\nInjury to Toby Alderweireld at the start of the second half provided Spurs' first setback of the game, while the sight of Kane colliding with a post was also a momentary cause for concern.\n\nThat aside, the only frustration for Spurs and Kane was that they failed to add to their first-half tally, with Grant producing an excellent save to deny the striker his fourth goal.\n\nSee more on\n\nEPL\n\nTottenham Hotspur", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/pztot27.jpg?VersionId=pf_6MW66O2M1js9Cyj_nviH.Y4PwwJ5V", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

On Saturday (Sunday, Singapore time), one day before the event, that fact is truer than ever.\n\nAs I walk around the red carpet area next to the Dolby, I see homeless people, but they will all be gone by tomorrow. The streets around the hall will be closed, and even the nearest Metro underground station will be shut.\n\n\"Don't even think about going to Hollywood on awards night\" is the headline at local news outlet Curbed Los Angeles, in a piece about the security controls.\n\nBut the number of tourists thronging the area have not abated, despite the controls. A random poll of passers-by showed mostly indifference to the Oscars.\n\nThis is about par for the course - only in years when a huge box-office hit is in the running for Best Picture, such as in 1998 with Titanic, or in 2010, with Avatar - do most people show interest and television ratings for the event soar.\n\nThis year, though, there is only one commercial hit in the list: the social drama Hidden Figures, which has so far taken US$171 million (S$240 million) globally. Compare that with the critically-acclaimed but less popular coming-of-age drama, Moonlight, a nominee going in with a comparatively tiny US$21.5 million in global takings.\n\nBecause of the carpet, rails and tight security, it is obvious that something is going to happen here on the Boulevard, even to the most oblivious. Many stop to take selfies with the railings and what little could be seen of the carpet from behind the white curtain.\n\nOne man who was quite keen to talk about the Oscars was the street performer who goes by the name Don Diego Alejandro, also known as Black Zorro.\n\nClad all in black, with cape, wide-brimmed hat, eye-mask and rapier, he is one of the many unlicensed cosplayers in the area who pose with tourists for money. He would not give his real name.\n\n\"I'm rooting for Fences, I'm rooting for Hidden Figures,\" he says of the two Best Picture nominees.\n\nHe namechecked his favourite actresses - Viola Davis (Fences) and Octavia Spencer (Hidden Figures), both nominated in the Supporting Actress category.\n\nBlack Zorro - BZ for short - is happy that the crowds are here despite the traffic cordons. \"I'm always busy, always boomin'.

He was 61.\n\nHis death, from complications of surgery, was announced on Sunday (Feb 26) in a statement from a representative for his family. It did not elaborate on when and where Paxton died. But Rolling Stone reported that he died on Saturday.\n\nEarly in his career, Paxton had small parts in The Terminator in 1984 and Aliens in 1986. Both films were directed by James Cameron, who later featured the actor in more high-profile roles: as a used-car salesman who ripped off Jamie Lee Curtis' character in True Lies in 1994, and as the treasure-hunting scientist who discovered the wreck of the ocean liner in Titanic in 1997.\n\nIn the 1990s, he also starred in Ron Howard's Oscar-nominated film Apollo 13, portraying Fred Haise, one of three men trapped orbiting above Earth, and in Twister, as a storm-chaser.\n\nOver the last decade, Paxton appeared regularly on TV.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, he played Bill Henrickson, the patriarch of a polygamist family in Utah, on the HBO series Big Love. He received three Golden Globe nominations for his acting on the show.\n\nIn 2012, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for playing Randolph McCoy in the three-part miniseries Hatfields & McCoys, on the History channel. And in 2014, he appeared in six episodes of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., on ABC.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

A spin-off of the 2001 movie starring Denzel Washington, the series premiered earlier this month and only four episodes have been broadcast. In total, 13 episodes of Training Day have been filmed, and Paxton appears in all of them.\n\nIn the near term, the show will continue to be shown on Thursday nights, but its future is not certain: Reviews have been mixed - though Paxton's performance as a rogue cop has been praised - and it averages little more than 4 million viewers.\n\nTributes to Paxton poured in on social media.\n\n\"Bill Paxton was, simply, a wonderful man. A wonderful man,\" Tom Hanks, a co-star in Apollo 13, wrote on Twitter.\n\nCary Elwes, one of his co-stars in Twister, shared a photograph of the two men on set and said he was very sad to hear of Paxton's death.\n\nCurtis called him \"a funny, talented, loving human\". Howard called the news \"crushing\".\n\nPaxton was born on May 17, 1955, in Fort Worth, Texas. Survivors include his wife of more than 30 years, Louise Newbury; and two children, James and Lydia.\n\nSee more on\n\nCelebrities\n\nMovies\n\nObituary\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nNetClass Technology Inc (NTCL) : News and History Unveiled\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nFormer NCT member Taeil sentenced to 3\u00bd years for rape\n\nAd\n\nSingapore\u2019s Sustainability Sector: Employment Opportunities\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/27/pzbill27e_2x.jpg?VersionId=9.sVfSz4_Ee40ZsXclDKsXVM_yqwClhY", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.

Although the city has done away with polluting furnaces, Li's neighbourhood is still regularly covered with a thick layer of pollution coming from surrounding industrial districts.\n\nStill, Sinopec aims to develop 20 such \"smokeless cities\" nationwide by 2020.\n\nThe company's ambitions align with the ruling Communist Party's plan to significantly reduce air pollution in Chinese cities, in part by increasing the use of clean energy to replace carbon-based fuels.\n\nThat goal includes a 10-fold increase in geothermal resources: growing electrical output to 530 megawatts by 2020 and tripling the floorspace of buildings heated by geothermal energy.\n\nAlthough it sounds like a big number, it would still be a drop in the bucket of overall Chinese electricity production (5.638 billion megawatts in 2014) and very modest compared to Iceland (close to 700 MW) or the United States (3,930 MW).\n\nLin Boqiang, the director of the energy research centre at Xiamen University, is sceptical of the project.\n\n\"It's clean, but compared to solar or wind, the cost of geothermal is incredibly high,\" he told AFP, questioning whether the project could survive without state support.\n\n\"Its future is certainly not as assured as solar... The market for Sinopec is still marginal.\"\n\nAt Sinopec, Duan Qiaohong, who is responsible for the Communist Party committee involved with the Sino-Icelandic joint venture, discussed the problem in veiled terms.\n\n\"It is evidently a crucial question whether there is demand in the market, that's ultimately what decides in the end,\" he told AFP.\n\nThe sector produces only \"meagre profits\" and in the absence - for the time being - of national support, it still depends on subsidies from local authorities, he said.\n\nBut \"other big public groups have followed in Sinopec's footsteps\" and increased competition could encourage the development of cheaper geothermal technologies, Duan said.\n\nEither way, he added, the future looks bright: \"The geothermal industry corresponds perfectly with current clean energy priorities.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nRenewable energy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2017/02/26/1-41060310_-_07_01_2017_-_china-iran_oil.jpg?VersionId=K4Rdbp2i57slm1Jx1q2ciuRcMn5JWRuw", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f234148e5bfd5d3b01cd861684126c58ef8a47a90964c2f7bb872a21e6d758d6", "alt_text": "A person holds a disposable vape as he vapes near London Bridge in London, Britain, May 30, 2025.
