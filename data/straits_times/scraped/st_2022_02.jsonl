Both the EGM and scheme meeting will be held via electronic means.\n\nHowever, shareholders must electronically submit their votes to both resolutions by March 19.\n\nUnder the distribution in-specie resolution, more than 50 per cent of the total number of votes cast must approve the distribution in-specie.\n\nUnder the scheme resolution, two thresholds must be met. First, more than 50 per cent of the number of shareholders (headcount vote), and at least 75 per cent in the value of votes cast, must approve the takeover bid by Cuscaden.\n\nBoth resolutions must be approved by SPH shareholders for the Cuscaden takeover offer to succeed.\n\nShould shareholders approve both the resolutions (which are inter-conditional), they will then be asked to elect their preferred choice: receiving either all cash or a mix of cash and SPH Reit units.\n\nThis preference would determine whether a chain offer for SPH Reits is triggered.\n\nIf most shareholders choose cash, Cuscaden's shareholding of the SPH Reits could increase to 30 per cent or more, thus triggering a chain offer for the Reits.\n\nThe exercise, if approved by shareholders, will lead to the privatisation of SPH.\n\nEvercore, the independent financial adviser to the deal, has said the offer is fair and reasonable, while SPH's independent directors are calling on shareholders to vote for the deal.\n\nBut the deal is by no means assured until and unless shareholders vote for it.\n\nMr Christopher Lim, Cuscaden spokesman and HPL group executive director, said his side had been working closely with SPH to bring the Cuscaden scheme to SPH shareholders.\n\n\"Following the dispatch of the Cuscaden composite document today and the scheduling of the EGM and scheme meeting on March 22, 2022, we are another step closer to delivering our compelling offer to SPH shareholders,\" he said.\n\n\"If the Cuscaden scheme is approved, SPH shareholders can look forward to realising the value of their investment in SPH.\n\n\"A key feature of the Cuscaden scheme is that it provides flexibility for SPH shareholders, with two consideration options for each SPH shareholder to choose from: either all cash or cash and SPH Reit units.\"\n\nUpon completion, SPH shareholders will receive their funds in May.\n\nMeanwhile, SPH has asked its shareholders to submit questions in advance by 1pm this Saturday for the purposes of Investors' Day or by 2.45pm on March 13 for the purposes of the EGM and scheme meeting.\n\nThe Cuscaden composite document comes on the back of the Feb 9 termination of the Keppel scheme following a fierce battle between Cuscaden and Keppel for SPH, which began late last year.\n\nKeppel made an initial offer of $2.351 per share for SPH's non-media assets - comprising 66.8 cents in cash, 0.596 Keppel Reit unit and 0.782 SPH Reit unit per SPH share.\n\nAfter Cuscaden emerged with a competing offer, Keppel raised the cash component of its offer to 86.8 cents per share. The number of Keppel Reit and SPH Reit units remained the same, with Keppel saying this offer was final.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore companies\n\nSingapore Press Holdings\n\nTakeover/Buyout\n\nShareholders", "images": []}

But it said residents were advised to shelter and not go outside unless necessary, with fighting at street level continuing in many areas.\n\nAt least 352 civilians, including 14 children, had been killed since the beginning of Russia's invasion, Ukraine's Health Ministry said on Sunday, with 1,684 people wounded. They did not include those killed yesterday in Kharkiv.\n\nAs missiles rained down in Ukraine, some 400,000 civilians, mainly women and children, have fled into neighbouring countries, a United Nations relief agency said.\n\nA senior US defence official said Russia had fired more than 350 missiles at Ukrainian targets since it launched the invasion last week, some hitting civilian infrastructure.\n\nRussia calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special operation\" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.\n\nIn response, Western-led political, strategic, economic and corporate sanctions were unprecedented in their extent and coordination, and there were further pledges of military support for Ukraine's badly outgunned armed forces. In the Baltic state of Latvia, the Parliament gave its blessing to any citizen who wanted to fight in Ukraine against the Russian invaders.\n\nSeveral countries have said that they would send arms to Ukraine to help in the fight against the Russians.\n\nIn a speech yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Russian soldiers to lay down their weapons and leave the country to save their lives, the BBC said.

They stood by the roadsides, under a low sky with bright stars.\n\n\"I am so proud of our people,\" said Ms Oksana Mudryk, the mayor of Khomutyntsi village, about 65km south-west of Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. \"Our village is so tiny that I was thinking, 'Do we even have anybody to patrol the streets?' I thought maybe three guys at most would come to patrol with me. But in one day after the war started in Kyiv, I have signed up more than 30 people.\"\n\nMost of the attention in the first days of the war has focused on Ukraine's large cities, which are the main targets of Russian troop movements and the scene of pitched street battles and deafening artillery attacks.\n\nBut out in the countryside, a massive grassroots movement is under way in villages like Khomutyntsi as ordinary Ukrainians - farmers, shop owners, day labourers and taxi drivers - take up arms to join a battle that has abruptly upended their lives.\n\nThe mobilisation of civilians to fight against seemingly impossible odds has been one of the distinguishing features of Ukraine's unexpectedly fierce resistance. And though it may end tragically, Ukrainian officials have been pointing to the effort with pride.\n\n\"The Russian leadership does not understand that it is at war not only with the armed forces of Ukraine, but with the entire Ukrainian people,\" Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said in a news briefing on Sunday. \"And these people have already risen to the liberation struggle, liberation war against occupiers.\"\n\nDisplays of defiance have been recorded across the country.\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, where Russian armoured columns entered towns and villages, some local residents confronted soldiers with angry words. In northern Ukraine, a man knelt briefly in front of a tank.\n\nOne Ukrainian woman filmed herself on a cellphone taunting a Russian soldier by telling him to put sunflower seeds in his pocket, so that when he died in Ukraine, flowers would grow.\n\nIn Khomutyntsi, the big meadow that stretches along the Postolova River is normally a place of leisure. Villagers fish in the river all year round and swim there in the summer. But this past weekend, the whole village gathered in the meadow to build trenches, a checkpoint and underground shelters.\n\nMs Mudryk drove her car last Saturday night to check on her volunteers. She does this several times each night, as patrols keep guard on the roadsides from dusk to dawn.\n\nWhy would the Russian army come to Khomutyntsi, a cluster of one-storey, white-plastered homes, garden plots and dirt roads, with about 400 residents, surrounded by forests and fields?\n\nIt might seem unlikely. But if Russian troops did arrive, they would not go unnoticed by local people on the watch.\n\n\"I am crying so much as it is very difficult to get used to our new reality,\" Ms Mudryk said. \"But I bow my head in honour to our people. Today, we were asked to bring some help with food to soldiers. In two hours, we loaded a full van of food, just from our village.\"\n\nThere is bravery, but there is also great fear. Standing on the road in the dark, the mayor pointed at a star in the sky that seemed to be behaving strangely, worried it might be a Russian drone over the village.\n\nMr Serhiy Osavoliuk, who signed up for patrol duty, said his wife soon followed suit. \"My wife, probably thinking of controlling me, signed up as well,\" he said. \"Now we patrol together.\"\n\nThe pair walk about with flashlights, stopping cars and checking who is inside. Usually, it is just local people.\n\nScenes like these are repeated in village after village through the countryside. Hundreds of local people helped build fortifications, bringing big sacks from their houses and filling them with sand.\n\nMany of the civilians doing support work, like Mr Osavoliuk and his wife, are unarmed, although a few have guns or have asked for them. But it seems as if everybody is doing what they can, hoping that even little actions might help.\n\nThe national road agency of Ukraine, for example, issued an order to take down all the road signs - to make it harder for Russian troops to navigate.\n\nOn the road between the towns of Vinnytsia and Kalynivka, the process had already started, bringing one more strange new scene on the side of familiar roads.\n\nThe sign for the village Pysarivka disappeared in just five minutes. Road service worker Volodymyr, who is 55 and did not want to provide his last name for safety reasons, said he had been driving around tearing down signs. \"It is important for them to get lost,\" he said of the Russians.\n\nThe town square near a military recruitment centre in Kalynivka was filled with men with duffel bags, and also their wives and children who came to say goodbye.\n\nAn older man named Viktor came to say goodbye to his son. \"My soul is restless,\" he said. \"How would you feel sending your son to the war?\"\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nRussia\n\nWars and conflicts", "images": []}

Ukraine's emergency services said five people were killed in the attack.\n\nAfter a blast sounded around the city and smoke was seen rising in the Babi Yar district, the interior ministry said equipment had been damaged and \"channels won't work for a while\".\n\nBut the tower structure remained intact.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry had earlier said\u00a0Russian troops would soon carry out an attack on what they said\u00a0was the infrastructure of Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services in Kyiv and urged residents living nearby to leave.\n\n\u201cIn order to suppress information attacks on Russia, the technological infrastructure of the SBU (Ukraine\u2019s Security Service) and the 72nd main PSO (Psychological Operations Unit) centre in Kyiv will be hit with high-precision weapons,\u201d defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. \u201cWe call on... Kyiv residents living near relay nodes to leave their homes.\"\n\nHis statement came hours after reports of fierce fighting and strikes being carried out by the Russian army on residential areas in several cities in Ukraine.\n\nRussia says it does not target civilians, but Ukraine says up to 350 civilians have been killed since Russia invaded.\n\n\"This morning the central square of our city and the headquarters of the Kharkiv administration was criminally attacked,\" Kharkiv's regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said in a video on Telegram, posting footage of the massive blast and debris inside the building.\n\n\"Russian occupiers continue to use heavy weaponry against the civilian population.\"\n\nMr Sinegubov said Russia launched GRAD and cruise missiles on Kharkiv but that the city defence was holding.\n\n\u201cSuch attacks are genocide of the Ukrainian people, a war crime against the civilian population!\u201d he said.\n\nKharkiv, a largely Russian-speaking city near the Russian border and Ukraine's second biggest city, has a population of around 1.4 million.\u00a0It has been a target for Russian forces since President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine last Thursday.\n\nIt was the first capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic set up by the Bolsheviks, and is also home to some of Ukraine's most important industry, including a tank factory, as well as numerous IT companies.\n\nIn the south, Mariupol\u00a0mayor Vadym Boichenko said the city was under constant shelling.\n\n\u201cWe have had residential quarters shelled for five days. They are pounding us with artillery, they are shelling us with GRADS, they are hitting us with air forces,\u201d Mr Boichenko said in a live broadcast on Ukrainian TV.\n\n\u201cWe have civilian infrastructure damaged \u2013 schools, houses. There are many injured. There are women, children killed,\u201d he said.\n\nMariupol's regional governor\u00a0Pavlo Kyrylenko said the city was now without electricity following the attacks.\n\n\u201cMariupol and Volnovakha are ours!\u201d Mr Kyrylenko wrote on Facebook. \u201cThe two cities are under pressure from the enemy but they are holding on. In Mariupol, electricity lines have been cut and the city is without power.\"\n\nRussian-backed separatist leader in Donetsk, Mr Denis Pushilin, said\u00a0his forces aimed to encircle Mariupol on Tuesday, RIA news agency quoted him as saying.\n\nIn a video statement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0described the Russian shelling of Kharkiv as a war crime and said defending the capital from Moscow\u2019s army was a top priority.\n\n\u201cThe strike against Kharkiv is a war crime. This is state terrorism on the part of Russia,\u201d he said. On the sixth day of Russia\u2019s invasion, \u201cthe defence of the capital today is the key priority for the state\u201d, he added.\n\nSatellite images taken on Monday showed a Russian military convoy north of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv that stretches for more than 60km, substantially longer than the 27km\u00a0earlier reported, private US company Maxar Technologies said.\n\nThe photos showed that the convoy, which had\u00a0been massing since Sunday,\u00a0hads mushroomed to some 64km of military vehicles, covering\u00a0the entire stretch of road from near Antonov airport, some 30km from the capital, to the town of Prybirsk \u2013 a distance of approximately 60km.\n\nMaxar also said additional ground forces deployments and ground attack helicopter units were seen in southern Belarus, less than 30km\u00a0north of the Ukraine border.\n\nAs Russian forces attempt to close in on Kyiv, Moscow faces increasing international isolation as talks to resolve the conflict failed to make a breakthrough.\n\nRussia faces economic turmoil as Western nations, united in condemnation of its assault, hit it with sanctions that rippled around the world and whose targets include President Vladimir Putin and his confidants.\n\nThe European Union\n\nplaced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and officials\n\nand some of its members urged the bloc to begin talks on Ukrainian accession.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky signed a letter formally requesting EU membership, an emphatic statement of commitment to Western values.\n\nBut Mr Putin\n\nshowed no sign of reconsidering the invasion\n\nhe unleashed on Russia's neighbour last Thursday in an attempt to pull it firmly back under Moscow's influence and redraw Europe's security map.\n\nHe dismissed the West as an \"empire of lies\" and replied to the new sanctions with\n\nmoves to shore up Russia's crumbling rouble currency.\n\nThe Russian invasion - the biggest assault on a European state since World War II - has failed to achieve the decisive early gains that Putin would have hoped for, and Kharkiv in Ukraine's northeast has become a major battleground.\n\nRegional administration chief Oleg Synegubov said Russian artillery had pounded residential districts even though no Ukrainian army positions or strategic infrastructure were there.\n\nAt least 11 people were killed, he said.\n\n\"This is happening in the daytime, when people have gone out to the pharmacy, for groceries, or for drinking water. It's a crime,\" he said.\n\nKharkiv's mayor, Mr Igor Terekhov, said four people had died after emerging from a bomb shelter to collect water, and that a family with three children had burned to death in a car.\n\nEarlier, Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said Russian rocket strikes on Kharkiv had killed dozens. It was not possible to verify the casualty figures independently.\n\nMoscow's United Nations ambassador, speaking in New York, said the Russian army did not pose a threat to civilians.\n\nImages from the US satellite company Maxar showed a Russian military convoy stretching over 27km and moving closer to the capital, Kyiv, which remains under Ukrainian government control.\n\nThe United States expects Russian forces to try to encircle Kyiv in the coming days and could become more aggressive out of frustration with their slow advance, said a senior US defence official.\n\nOn Kyiv's streets, signboards normally used for traffic alerts showed the message: \"Putin lost the war. The whole world is with Ukraine\".\n\nFighting also occurred throughout Sunday night around the port city of Mariupol, said the head of the Donetsk regional administration, Mr Pavlo Kyrylenko. He did not say whether Russian forces had gained or lost ground.\n\nRussian forces seized two small cities in southeastern Ukraine and the area around a nuclear power plant, according to the Interfax news agency.\n\nCeasefire talks, Western sanctions\n\nTalks between the two sides were held on the border with strong Russian ally Belarus - a launch pad for invading Russian troops.\n\nUkraine had said it wanted to secure an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces. The Kremlin declined to comment on its goals.\n\nThe meeting ended with officials heading back to capitals for further consultations before a second round of negotiations, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told reporters.\n\n\"The Russian side, unfortunately, still has a very biased view of the destructive processes it has launched,\" Mr Podolyak tweeted.\n\nRussian delegation head Vladimir Medinsky told reporters: \"The most important thing is that we agreed to continue negotiating.\"\n\nRussia calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special operation\" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.\n\nThe Western-led response has been emphatic, with sanctions that\n\neffectively cut off Moscow's financial institutions from Western markets.\n\nThe United States imposed new sanctions on Russia's central bank and other sources of wealth on Monday, and many Western companies began to disentangle themselves from their Russian operations.\n\nOver the weekend, some Russian banks\n\nwere barred from the SWIFT international payments system.\n\nThe rouble plunged 32 per cent against the dollar before recouping about half of its losses, and Russia's central bank cranked up its key interest rate to 20 per cent from 9.5 per cent. Authorities told export-focused companies to be ready to sell foreign currency.\n\nIn Brussels, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said EU sanctions would have a cost for Europe \"but we have to be ready to pay the price, or we will have to pay a much higher price in the future\".\n\nThe invasion has brought relations between the United States and Russia, the world's two biggest nuclear powers, to their worst point in years.\n\nThe United States\n\nexpelled 12 Russian diplomats at the United Nations,\n\nciting national security concerns. Russia described the move as \"hostile\".\n\nRussia has not shown interest in creating a \"deconfliction mechanism\" with the United States over the Ukrainian conflict, the Pentagon said on Monday. The two countries have such a mechanism in other areas, like Syria, where both operate in close proximity.\n\nBattle for cities\n\nUN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said\n\nat least 102 civilians in Ukraine had been killed since Thursday\n\nbut the real figure could be \"considerably higher\".\n\nUkraine's health ministry said on Sunday 352 civilians, including 14 children, had been killed since the beginning of the invasion.\n\nMore than half a million people have fled to neighbouring countries, according to the UN refugee agency.\n\nPartners in the US-led NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) defence alliance were providing Ukraine with air-defence missiles and anti-tank weapons, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said.\n\nThe Kremlin accused the EU of hostile behaviour, saying weapons supplies to Ukraine were destabilising and proved that Russia was right in its efforts to demilitarise its neighbour.\n\nBut there was support for Ukraine from unexpected quarters.\n\nUS technology firm Microsoft said it had provided threat intelligence and defensive suggestions to Ukrainian officials about attacks on a range of targets, and also advised the government about attempted cyber-thefts of data.\n\nAnd European soccer's governing body, UEFA, scrapped sponsorship by the Russian state gas giant Gazprom reported to be worth 40 million euros (S$60 million) a season, and Uefa and the global federation Fifa\n\nsuspended all Russian teams until further notice.\n\nFollow The Straits Times' live coverage on the Ukraine crisis here.\n\nSee more on\n\nRussia\n\nUkraine\n\nWars and conflicts", "images": []}

Still, it had so far mainly focused on military targets.\n\nCiting a Russian offensive on the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, the official cited early indications that Russia might be adopting siege tactics, \"It appears that they are adopting a siege mentality, which any student of military tactics and strategy will tell you, when you adopt siege tactics, it increases the likelihood of collateral damage,\" the official said.\n\nSo far, the Russian offensive cannot claim any major victories. Russia has not taken any Ukrainian city, does not control Ukraine's airspace, and its troops remained roughly 30km from Kyiv's city centre for a second day, the official said.\n\nSiege tactics typically involve encircling enemy positions, cutting off supply and escape routes, then attacking with a combined force of armour, ground troops and engineers.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Economists had expected a decline of 0.7 per cent.\n\nA separate report by the ministry showed that retail sales fell 1.9 per cent in January from the previous month compared with economists' forecast of a 1.2 per cent decrease. The weakness in sales shows consumers were less willing to spend than expected amid the country's biggest Covid-19 wave.\n\nThe continued decline in output suggests a further delay in Japan's economic recovery, with the outlook further clouded by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the potential fallout for global trade and commodities markets.\n\nWhile the consensus among economists before yesterday's data was for Japan to still eke out growth in the first three months of this year, the country is lagging behind its peers in recovering to pre-pandemic levels. Further signs of a setback in momentum could spark calls for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to take more action to shore up growth ahead of an election in the summer.\n\nConsidering the fragile state of the economy and the still feeble strength of inflation, the Bank of Japan is likely to stick with its stimulus measures, despite speculation that it may consider adjusting policy as its global peers make hawkish moves.\n\nJapan's biggest automakers were forced to make production cuts in January due to supply constraints triggered in part by the spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant at home and abroad, leading to a 17 per cent fall in output from the car sector compared with December.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Nissan Motor's production fell by 25 per cent.\n\nWhile the Omicron impact on supply chains should ease in the coming months, the Russian invasion has joined the list of concerns for manufacturers.\n\n\"The rapid spread of Omicron infections and higher commodity prices due to supply problems related to Ukraine risks will probably weigh on output,\" said Bloomberg Economics analysts.\n\nOmicron impacted January retail sales as the sudden escalation of cases discouraged shoppers from spending. The weak result suggests the hit to consumption from Omicron could be larger than feared.\n\nPolicymakers will be closely watching to see how Japan's sharply rising energy costs are affecting consumers known for their deflationary mindset.\n\nWithout a strong recovery in consumer spending this quarter, Goldman Sachs and UBS are among those that expect the economy to shrink.\n\nMr Kishida said last Friday that he will ramp up support for households and businesses to mitigate the impact of surging oil prices.\n\nSome economists, including Mr Kazuma Maeda of Barclays, see a good chance that the Prime Minister will unveil another economic package before the election.\n\nStill, Omicron restrictions on activity may be hampering the implementation of existing stimulus measures from Mr Kishida's larger-than-expected economic package announced in November.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nManufacturing\n\nSupply chains\n\nUkraine", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

His heroic act significantly slowed down the push of the enemy, allowing the unit to relocate and organise defence,\" the statement continued.\n\nMilitary commanders said they planned to give Volodymyrovych a posthumous award for his heroic act, New York Post reported.\n\nSeparately, footage has emerged of brave Ukrainians from the embattled city of Chernihiv appearing to launch an unarmed defence in front of storming Russian troops over the weekend, British media reported.\n\nIn the footage, citizens from the northern Ukraine city can be seen rushing to block the path of a line of Russian tanks.

Soldiers need to move back to their barracks. Leaders need to move to peace. Civilians must be protected,\" he pleaded.\n\nRepresentatives of more than 100 countries were expected to speak as the global body decides if it will support the resolution that demands Russia immediately withdraws its troops from Ukraine.\n\nThe resolution is non-binding but will serve as marker of how isolated Russia is.\n\nThe wording of the resolution was watered down to try to attract maximum support, according to drafts seen by AFP. It no longer \"condemns\" in the strongest terms, Russia's aggression but rather \"deplores\" it.\n\nA vote is expected on Wednesday. Its authors hope they may exceed 100 votes in favour - though countries including Syria, China, Cuba and India are expected to either support Russia or abstain.\n\nIt will be seen as a barometer of democracy in a world where autocratic sentiment has been on the rise, diplomats said, pointing to such regimes in Myanmar, Sudan, Mali, Burkina Faso, Venezuela, Nicaragua - and, of course, Russia.\n\n\"If Ukraine does not survive, the United Nations will not survive. Have no illusions,\" said Ukraine's ambassador to the UN, Mr Sergiy Kyslytsya, imploring countries to support the resolution.\n\nRussian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia reiterated Moscow's stance - flatly rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies - that its military operation was launched to protect residents of breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The hostilities were unleashed by Ukraine against its own residents,\" he said from the podium.\n\n\"Russia is seeking to end this war,\" Mr Nebenzia added.\n\n2014 Crimea vote\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24.\n\nMoscow has pleaded \"self-defense\" under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\nBut that has been roundly rejected by Western countries and the UN, which accuse Moscow of violating Article 2 of the Charter, requiring its members to refrain from the threat or use of force to resolve a crisis.\n\nAddressing the General Assembly, British ambassador Barbara Woodward said countries \"must stand together to defend the rules and enforce the accountability that we have built together\".\n\n\"If we do not stand up for them now, then the safety of every nation's borders and independence are at risk,\" she said.\n\nChina's ambassador, Mr Zhang Jun, said \"nothing can be gained from starting off a new Cold War,\" but did not indicate how Beijing would vote.\n\nThe move to hold the emergency session was sparked by Russia using its veto Friday to block a Security Council resolution that condemned Moscow's invasion and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops.\n\nRussia did not have veto power to derail the referral of the war to the General Assembly, allowed under a 1950 resolution called \"Uniting for Peace\".\n\nIt allows for members of the Security Council to turn to the General Assembly for a special session if the five permanent members - Russia, the United States, Britain, France and China - fail to agree to act together to maintain peace.\n\nThere is no right of veto at the General Assembly, which held a similar vote in 2014 condemning Russia's seizure of Crimea and obtained 100 votes in support.\n\nSeparately Monday, the Security Council was scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, where up to seven million people are expected to flee the fighting.\n\nFollow The Straits Times\u2019 live coverage on the Ukraine crisis here.\n\nSee more on\n\nRussia\n\nUkraine\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nUN", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/03/01/US-UNITED-NATIONS-HOLDS-SPECIAL-EMERGENCY-SESSION-ON-UKRAINE-213605.jpg?VersionId=.zoADKxtpg4OKRM0Yh_ff1hkzg0VABga", "alt_text": null}]}

This compares with a 6.3 per cent increase for landed use and a 10.9 per cent jump for non-landed use in the previous revision.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

DC rates at most suburban and city fringe areas remained flat, he added.\n\nDC rates for hotel/hospital use were cut by 0.7 per cent on average, due in part to a lack of tourist arrivals and reduced occupancy rates.\n\nKnight Frank's head of research Leonard Tay noted that 25 sectors out of 118 recorded declines in DC rates, with the largest drop of 10 per cent in the Shenton Way, Straits Boulevard, Marina Boulevard and Raffles Quay area.\n\n\"This was probably due to the Marina View site being awarded at $1.5 billion, or $1,379 psf ppr, in September 2021 to the one sole bidder who had triggered the site launch.\"\n\nMeanwhile, DC rates remain unchanged for all the other use groups: place of worship/civic and community institution; open space; agriculture; and roads/railways.\n\nSee more on\n\nURA\n\nProperty market/sector\n\nProperty investments\n\nSingapore property\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

The US and its allies are discussing a coordinated release of about 60 million barrels of oil from their emergency stockpiles, as Russia's invasion has pushed crude prices above US$100, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nBelarus was yesterday preparing to send troops into Ukraine to help its ally Moscow, the Washington Post reported, citing an unnamed US official. This comes as Belarusians voted to allow the country to host nuclear weapons and Russian forces permanently.\n\nFive days after the invasion yesterday, Russia is facing a wall of Western sanctions. These had targeted Russian banks, companies and individuals, leading to a collapse in the rouble and prompting the central bank to impose capital controls to try and avert investor panic and shore up the economy.\n\nSeveral European subsidiaries of Sberbank Russia, majority-owned by the Russian government, were failing or were likely to fail due to reputational cost of the war in Ukraine, the European Central Bank said.\n\nThe US yesterday blocked any transactions involving Russia's central bank, National Wealth Fund and the Finance Ministry in further punishment of Moscow.\n\nEnergy giant BP, global bank HSBC and the world's biggest aircraft leasing firm AerCap joined a growing list of companies looking to exit Russia yesterday.

Citigroup fell 4.5% and helped push the S&P 500 banks index down 2.35% as the US 10-year Treasury yield slipped.\n\nThe broader S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.5%. Global stocks slumped, the Russian rouble tanked to record lows and safe-haven assets got a boost after Western allies imposed new sanctions that limited Moscow's ability to deploy its $630 billion foreign reserves and cut off some of its banks from the SWIFT global payments system.\n\nRussian artillery bombarded residential districts of Ukraine's second-largest city, as Moscow's invading forces met stiff resistance on a fifth day of conflict.\n\n\"The Russia-Ukraine invasion in itself is not likely going to be a long-term headwind for US equities. But I think in the short term, it's a massive contributor to the equity pullback,\" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy sector rallied 2.6%, thanks to higher oil prices. Defence stocks Raytheon Technologies, Lockheed Martin Corp, General Dynamics Corp, Northrop Grumman and L3Harris Technologies gained between 2.8% and 8% following news that Germany would increase its military spending.\n\nCybersecurity stocks also rallied, with Palo Alto Networks , Fortinet, Zscaler and CrowdStrike Holdings all climbing more than 4%.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.41% to 13,751.40, ending higher for the third straight session. Monday's session was busy.\n\nVolume on US exchanges was 14.5 billion shares, compared with the 12.2 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. The S&P 500 fell 3.15% in February, while the Nasdaq lost 3.43%. So far in 2022, the S&P 500 has lost over 8%, the index's deepest two-month decline since March 2020.\n\nThe worsening geopolitical crisis has added to investors'concerns about soaring inflation and the Federal Reserve's rate-hike plans.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq logged their biggest two-month declines since the pandemic-led crash in March 2020. The CBOE volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose for a second straight session.\n\nDelta Air Lines Inc dropped 3.9% after Russia closed its airspace to airlines from 36 countries in response to Ukraine-related sanctions targeting its aviation sector.\n\nFirst Horizon Corp surged 29% after TD Bank Group offered to acquire the U.S. bank in an all-cash deal valued at $13.4 billion.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Marseille is about 31/2 hours from Paris via the high-speed TGV train.\n\nBoth airlines also offer multiple connecting flights to Marseille every day.\n\nWHERE TO STAY\n\nIf you are looking for stylish accommodation in Marseille, you cannot go wrong with Hotel Le Corbusier (\n\nwww. hotellecorbusier.com\n\n) in the iconic Cite Radieuse.\n\nThe impossibly hip Philippe Starck-designed Mama Shelter Marseille (\n\nmamashelter. com/marseille\n\n) is just a 10-minute walk from the trendy Cours Julien district.\n\nTuba Club (\n\nwww.tuba-club.com\n\n) is a former diving club-turned-trendy, no-frills five-room hotel perched on the coast for those in the know craving a respite from city life.\n\nWHAT TO BUY\n\nSavon de Marseille\n\nAn all-natural soap with 72 per cent pure vegetable oils without colourings or additives.\n\nThere are only four surviving manufacturers of authentic savon de Marseille today which still make the soap using traditional methods and recipes - Le Serail, Savonnerie du Midi, Marius Fabre and Fer a Cheval.\n\nBleu de Chine\n\nThe indigo-blue Chinese labourer jacket with a Peter Pan collar became popular with French dock workers in Marseille and the Mediterranean region after a Frenchman first saw them in Singapore in the 1930s.\n\nEven Spanish artist Pablo Picasso was once photographed wearing it.\n\nChapeau provencal\n\nThe chic wide-brimmed hat secured by a black ribbon worn by farm workers in Provence became a must-have fashion accessory after fashion designer Simon Porte Jacquemus showcased it in his spring/summer 2017 \"Les Santons de Provence\" collection.\n\nWhile it might be too dramatic for everyday wear, it looks great hung on the wall when not in use.\n\nNavette de Marseille\n\nThis is an orange blossom-scented biscuit baked in the shape of a boat that can be kept for a whole year.\n\nBest place to try the melt-in-your-mouth biscuits would be at Four des Navettes (\n\nwww.fourdes navettes.com\n\n) - the oldest bakery in Marseille - which still bakes them in an 18th-century oven.\n\nI had come here for Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier's post-war brutalist masterpiece, Cite Radieuse, the first of his Unite d'Habitation housing projects.\n\nIt did not disappoint and showed me how it is possible to rethink modern dwelling as a cost-effective, self-sufficient solution that has stayed relevant through the times.\n\nBut Marseille is more than Le Corbusier and post-war modernism.\n\nThe past decade has seen multiple contemporary projects by prominent architects, which have revitalised the city's urban landscape with innovative form and design.\n\nFor a country that is grappling with immigration and national identity issues, the surging cost of living, drug crimes and rise of the far right - apart from the pandemic in the last few years - in some ways, Marseille offers a small peek into French urban society today.\n\nMarseille's ambition is reflected in its contemporary architectural gems while the dynamism of its diverse population bears witness to the hope that perhaps the city, imperfections and all, may one day stand as the vision of French multiculturalism.\n\n\u2022A former tax consultant, Soh Wee Ling is a freelance writer and photographer who is back in Singapore after a decade abroad, including five years in Paris. She is partial to pastis and hopes the weather will be warm enough for a swim in the Calanques the next time she is in Marseille.\n\n1 Villa Mediterranee\n\nFor Villa Mediterranee, Milanese architect Stefano Boeri looked to a sleek aesthetic, free from distracting exterior details, befitting an archive and research centre dedicated to all things Mediterranean.\n\nSitting along the seafront next to the Mucem museum, the structure with a dramatic overhang features an exhibition gallery, an ornamental pool and an underwater conference centre, reinforcing the fact that the sea is central to coastal communities in the Mediterranean.\n\n2 Musee des civilisations de l'Europe et de la Mediterranee (Mucem)\n\nUnveiled in 2013 when Marseille was designated European Capital of Culture, Mucem aims to celebrate Mediterranean cultures and history.\n\nFrench architects Rudy Ricciotti and Roland Carta's vision of a modern kasbah complete with concrete latticework offers breathtaking views of the port, the sea and Fort Saint-Jean, linked to Mucem by a black reinforced concrete bridge.\n\n3 Stade Velodrome\n\nFootball fans need no introduction to OM, Marseille's famed football club. Stade Velodrome, home to OM, is also the second-largest football stadium in France with a capacity of more than 67,000.\n\nIn 2014, French architecture firm SCAU added a milky, sculptural stretched Teflon-coated fibreglass canvas roof to the stadium that is as functional as it is sleek - low maintenance, resistant to rain and the strong, cold Mistral that blows across southern France - providing sun protection and optimising acoustics.\n\n4 Fonds regionaux d'art contemporain Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (Frac Paca)\n\nJapanese architect Kengo Kuma's take on Frac Paca, Marseille's contemporary art centre in the La Joliette district, plays on negative space and light through its distinctive chequered glass facade.\n\nThe building aims to connect the museum to Marseille and its people, referencing the city's alleys and plazas, bringing to life novelist Andre Malraux's vision of a museum without walls.\n\n5 La Marseillaise\n\nWithin walking distance to skyscraper Tour CMA CGM, the latest addition to the Marseille skyline is Pritzker Prize-winning French architect Jean Nouvel's striking gradient blue-white-red-hued office tower, appropriately named La Marseillaise and incorporating eco-friendly features such as sustainable materials. Contrary to what most people might think, the colours are chosen not for the French flag, but for Marseille - blue for the sky (and even OM), white for the Calanques and red for the rooftops of the Le Panier district.\n\n6 La Friche la Belle de Mai (La Friche)\n\nA trendy cultural and urban arts complex repurposed from a 19th-century former tobacco factory over a 12-year period, the architectural highlight at La Friche is the Panorama, a cantilevered white block of a contemporary art space designed by ARM Architecture and opened in 2013, perched precariously on the roof.\n\nThe renovated 8,000 sq m multipurpose rooftop terrace, boasting breathtaking views of Marseille, comes alive especially in the summer with concerts and outdoor cinema screenings.\n\n7 Tour CMA CGM\n\nDesigned by the late Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid for Marseille-headquartered shipping giant CMA CGM, the 147m-tall building towers over the city and the commercial port.\n\nIts understated curved facade, with gently converging then diverging fluid lines, has segments differentiated by dark glazing, which not only provides a solar screen, but also allows natural light to filter in without excessive glare.\n\n8 Vieux Port Pavilion\n\nAt Marseille's Vieux Port (Old Port), you cannot miss the futuristic pavilion conceived by British multidisciplinary practice Foster + Partners.\n\nWhile its canopy of polished steel would not look out of place in a dystopian future, the 46m by 22m shelter has redefined public space without stealing the limelight from the hustle and bustle of the neighbourhood.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nTravel and leisure\n\nFrance\n\nArchitecture\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Flip7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nFlexible Monthly Plans From $40/month with Nespresso Subscription\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

He said she was unaware of a notice announcing that she had severed ties with him.\n\nThe notice, which declared that Madam Tam Mei Kam, 98, had disowned Mr Mui, 70, appeared in Hong Kong newspapers last month.\n\n\"My mum did say before that she wanted to sever ties with me, but she said it out of anger and did not go ahead,\" he said.\n\nHe added that he did a check and found out that Ms Cheng, his mother's personal assistant and caregiver, was behind the notice.\n\nWhen he asked Ms Cheng about it, she said she had nothing to do with it and hinted that she was following his relatives' orders.\n\nHe suspected that the notice was the idea of his nephew, Mr Mui Pak Leon, who has been visiting Madam Tam frequently in hospital.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

She disclosed that she had cut him off financially six months ago, after suspecting that he had a mistress, and threatened to disown him if he did not drop the lawsuit.\n\nMr Mui is Madam Tam's only surviving child.

Her younger son Tak Ming died of throat cancer at 62 in 2015, and her elder daughter Ann died of cervical cancer at 40 in 2000.\n\nSee more on\n\nCelebrities\n\nMusic\n\nFamilies\n\nHong Kong", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

The club have since made a formal complaint to the league.\n\nFormer Premier League and Fifa referee Dermot Gallagher later said on Sky Sports: \"It is a penalty, no doubt. The VAR (video assistant referee) inspected it for too long.\"\n\nAsked about the incident yesterday, Guardiola admitted Rodri had handled the ball, but pushed back at the suggestion that the decision could have a big effect on the rest of the season both for his title-chasing side and relegation-threatened Everton.\n\n\"Entire season? Can this episode affect a whole season? I will review a lot of incidents. It looks offside for Richarlison, if it's not offside it's a penalty,\" he said, ahead of his side's FA Cup fifth-round clash against second-tier cellar-dwellers Peterborough United tonight.\n\nCity could be without back-up goalkeeper Zack Steffen and midfield starlet Cole Palmer, who may not be match fit, but Jack Grealish and Gabriel Jesus are available for selection while Guardiola confirmed Oleksandr Zinchenko would feature.\n\nThe Ukrainian utility man was visibly emotional ahead of the Everton win as fans showed their support for his homeland, following Russia's invasion.\n\nHe shared a touching hug with compatriot Vitaliy Mykolenko of Everton before the match. The City man has been openly critical of Russia's actions and its president Vladimir Putin on social media and attended an anti-war vigil in St Peter's Square in Manchester city centre last week.\n\nSaid Guardiola: \"He is absolutely fine. It will be good for him to show why he is here and a magnificent player needs to play football.\"\n\nTottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte was also asked about the conflict ahead of his side's FA Cup fifth-round clash with second-tier Middlesbrough, who knocked out Manchester United in the previous round. He said: \"War is not the answer for anything. The world has to be compact and show solidarity against stupid people.\"\n\nThe Italian seemed to question his future at the club after their disappointing 1-0 loss to lowly Burnley last week but Son Heung-min hailed his manager, telling the Evening Standard: \"We have a fantastic manager. He brings passion, he brings so much positive energy... That's why he's special. He's so passionate. He wants to win.\"\n\nSpurs will be without Rodrigo Bentancur, while Oliver Skipp, Japhet Tanganga and Lucas Moura are also injury doubts.\n\nPETERBOROUGH V MAN CITY\n\nSingtel TV Ch111, tomorrow, 3.05am\n\nMIDDLESBROUGH V TOTTENHAM\n\nCh113, tomorrow, 3.45am\n\nSee more on\n\nPep Guardiola\n\nManchester City\n\nRussia\n\nEverton", "images": []}

The women's team are unranked in all the categories.\n\nKoh said the BAS will work with different agencies such as Sport Singapore, Singapore Sports Hub, Ministry of Education and People's Association to roll out more 3x3 tournaments \"using different venues and platforms\" to popularise the sport among youth, which would allow it to build a larger pool of talent.\n\nThe men and women's 3x3 teams are currently playing friendlies in Malaysia to prepare for the Asia Cup, as well as to beef up their case to participate in the May 12-23 SEA Games.\n\nNational player Delvin Goh is itching for some competitive action as the Asean Basketball League has been suspended since the pandemic.\n\nThe Singapore Slingers forward said: \"Our playing careers are not that long, and we have wasted too much time without being able to compete, so we are craving for competitions like these.\n\n\"People should find 3x3 familiar as most of us started playing this way on the streets and at the neighbourhood courts. It is a fast-paced and action-packed game, which will attract fans and eventually bring up the level of basketball here as we learn from Asia's best.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore sports\n\nOlympics\n\nSport Singapore", "images": []}

The city's press office did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the Nets.\n\n\"Within the next few weeks, you're going to see many of these mandates dissipate,\" Adams said last week.\n\nLast month, he had called the rule that bars Irving from playing in home games \"unfair\", given that unvaccinated athletes from opposing teams can play at both the Barclays Centre and Madison Square Garden, the home of the New York Knicks.\n\nIrving has played only 15 of the Nets' 61 games, partly because of his refusal to be vaccinated, and was out for yesterday's home game against the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe 29-year-old's inconsistent availability and injuries to other players have contributed to the Nets' struggles (32-29). They are eighth in the Eastern Conference with about a quarter of the season left. To avoid the league's play-in tournament for the post-season, they would need to finish in the top six.\n\nIrving said after the Nets' victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday that he is just remaining patient to see \"where things end up in this next week or so or next two weeks\".\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nBasketball players\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\nVaccines\n\nCovid-19", "images": []}

The figure does not include those internally displaced.\n\n\"More than 500,000 refugees have now fled from Ukraine into neighbouring countries,\" UN refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi said in a tweet.\n\nAccording to an earlier count by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, more than 280,000 people fled Ukraine into Poland alone.\n\nNearly 85,000 crossed into Hungary, more than 36,000 into Moldova, over 32,500 into Romania, 30,000 into Slovakia and over 300 into Belarus, UNHCR said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Harden was a flawless 10-for-10 from the line.\n\nSaid Maxey: \"Playing with guys like this is extremely special, playing with a former MVP and a guy up here who I think is the MVP this year.\"\n\nIn Harden's first two games for his new team, the Sixers averaged 129 points and won both. They are third in the Eastern Conference on (37-23), 21/2 games behind leaders Miami Heat.\n\nMeanwhile, in San Francisco, Dorian Finney-Smith tipped in his own miss to give Dallas the lead for good with 5:05 to play and the Mavericks used a 26-1 run to erase a 19-point, fourth-quarter deficit en route to a shock 107-101 win over the hosts Golden State Warriors.\n\nLuka Doncic, the leading scorer among visitors in the three-year history of the Chase Centre, went for a game-high 34 points as part of a double-double with a game-high 11 rebounds for the Mavericks.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns (49-12), who sit one place above the Warriors at the top of the Western Conference, also lost. The surging Utah Jazz (38-22), fuelled by 26 points from Donovan Mitchell, downed the NBA-leading Suns 118-114 to post their eighth victory in nine games.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nNBA\n\nBasketball players\n\nJames Harden\n\nGolden State Warriors", "images": []}

That was a brave effort, considering that he was lame on the left fore just a couple of days before the time-honoured race.\n\nAfter four outings, the real Katak resurfaced with his two wins on the trot, both with jockey Danny Beasley astride.\n\nLe Grange, who is now sharing top spot with Tim Fitzsimmons and Daniel Meagher at the top of the premiership table with 12 winners, was pleasantly surprised with Katak's vast improvement.\n\n\"His mannerisms are more those of a real racehorse now. He has improved so much,\" said the genial South African.\n\n\"Danny jumped off saying he is looking for a mile and a quarter (2,000m) and even a mile and a half (2,400m).\n\n\"He's so much easier to train now, and to see him win like that and still cry for more ground, it's scary.\n\n\"It's always a pleasure to have Danny on. He rode the horse beautifully, and it's exciting times for Marsh and Guy and Bryn.\"\n\nWhile Katak's first Kranji success was forged with some degree of challenge, Saturday's had shades of a one-way traffic once Beasley drove him to the lead.\n\nHeartening Flyer, his last-start runner-up, did keep him honest throughout. But, in reality, Katak was always under a firm grip and travelling on the bit.\n\nWhen Beasley slipped some reins to the $8 hot shot at the top of the straight, all doubts whether his last win could be a one-off were allayed from the moment he skipped away.\n\nWith Heartening Flyer beaten, it was long shot Sacred Croix who finished the best among the beaten brigade. He lost by two lengths.\n\nThe winning time was a smart 1min 35.61sec for the 1,600m on the Short Course A.\n\n\"This is the South African horse back to the fore,\" said Beasley.\n\n\"As Ricky said before, his first prep was too quick. He needed more time to settle in.\n\n\"He has improved a lot from his first win, just from the way he travels underneath you. Ricky has done a wonderful job with him and you can feel it every time you ride him.\n\n\"There is no doubt he needs further, up to 2,400m. But, unfortunately, we don't have such races here.\n\n\"He wouldn't be out of place in New Zealand and would also be competitive over a mile and a half in pretty good company in Australia.\n\n\"He will only get better with more racing. There's still more improvement to come out of him.\"\n\nKatak has taken his local prize money to just over the $200,000 mark for Vasco Stable. More will pour in soon.\n\nSee more on\n\nSports and recreation\n\nHorse racing\n\nSingapore", "images": []}

Austria's Financial Market Authority imposed a moratorium on Sberbank Europe, which is based in the country.\n\nThe ECB's warning extended to Sberbank subsidiaries in Croatia and Slovenia. Sberbank's branches in Slovenia were closed until tomorrow, and services temporarily limited to card transactions with a withdrawal limit of \u20ac400 (S$610) a day. The Croatian central bank said depositors at Sberbank would be allowed to withdraw just under \u20ac1,000 a day.\n\nSeparately, Deutsche Boerse, the German stock exchange operator, said that it was suspending from trading a number of securities from Russian issuers with immediate effect. The list includes Sberbank and VTB Bank.\n\nLess than a week after President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine, Russia is at risk of succumbing to the biggest financial crisis of his more than two decades in power. Some warned of catastrophic economic damage now that the US and the European Union have agreed to block access to much of the US$630 billion (S$855 billion) that Russia's central bank has built up as a buffer to protect the economy.\n\n\"The most important thing is that the West is freezing the central bank's reserves,\" former Russian prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov wrote on Twitter. \"There is nothing to support the rouble with... Hyperinflation and catastrophe for the economy is not far away.\"\n\nThe cost of insuring Russia's government debt, meanwhile, rose to a record. For the first time ever, the price of protecting Russia's debt is no longer being officially quoted in basis points, with protection sellers now demanding payment in advance, signalling perceptions that default might be imminent.\n\nYesterday credit-default swaps (CDS) insuring US$10 million of the country's bonds for five years were quoted at about US$4 million upfront and US$100,000 annually, signalling around 56 per cent likelihood of default, according to ICE Data Services.

We are not silly. You need luck. We have to survive, work hard and, we have to play on Wednesday again,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"We don't get nervous when things don't go well. We are more experienced now.\n\n\"It's a big one for us. The first time for this group...\n\n\"It was like two lions going at each other. It was absolutely crazy. It was one of the most spectacular shoot-outs I ever saw.\"\n\nReds captain Jordan Henderson is hopeful of lifting more silverware. He told talkSport: \"At the start of the season, you never set out to go for certain trophies and not go for them... Hopefully, we can just continue on that road and in the near future, hopefully, there's more trophies to be won.\"\n\nIt was a fittingly tense conclusion to a thrilling encounter that finished 0-0 after extra time despite both sides creating numerous chances. Liverpool had a Joel Matip goal controversially disallowed for a dubious offside against Virgil van Dijk in the second half.\n\nChelsea were denied three times by the offside flag.\n\nBut in the end, it was a tale of two back-up goalkeepers, the Reds' Caoimhin Kelleher, whom Klopp has trusted in all domestic cup ties, and Arrizabalaga, who lost his spot for the final having played in all Chelsea's previous League Cup matches this season.\n\n\"Even in professional football, there should be space for some sentiment,\" said Klopp.\n\n\"Caoimhin Kelleher is a young boy, plays in all the competition, what do I do? I am two things, a professional manager and a human being and the human being won.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old Irish custodian has played just 16 times for the Reds, but has won more penalty shoot-outs (three) than any goalkeeper in the club's history.\n\nKelleher even scored from the spot with the Reds' 11th penalty, which teammate Andy Robertson described as a \"different class\".\n\nArrizabalaga has a reputation as a penalty-saving expert and came off the bench to help win the Uefa Super Cup shoot-out against Villarreal earlier this season.\n\nSaid Blues boss Thomas Tuchel: \"We did it before with Kepa, he is slightly better in penalty-saving and that is why I made the decision. It is unusual all 11 players need to shoot, he took it a bit too quick. Sometimes these things can turn against you but you make them when they need to be made, not after when people can judge you.\"\n\nThere was plenty of judgment of Tuchel's decision. Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie Redknapp told Sky Sports: \"It is a rubbish idea. It is a case of being too clever for your own good... How could anyone say they wouldn't have won it if Mendy was in goal? It's rubbish, it's nonsense - he didn't even get near to a penalty.\"\n\nHis former England teammate David James said on the BBC: \"You have to wonder the psychological impact of Kepa, who having done so well in helping to get Chelsea to the final only to be told you're not playing. Mendy was man of the match and then you're expected to go on and save pens.\n\n\"The psychological pressure on him would have been absolutely massive.\"\n\nREUTERS, AFP\n\nSee more on\n\nJurgen Klopp\n\nThomas Tuchel\n\nLeague Cup\n\nLiverpool", "images": []}

I had good rides, but I also needed luck in the running,\" said Nunes. \"I've ridden five winners before, but six was my best score back in 2014.\"\n\nProsperous Return's recovery, from his creditable fifth to Hard Too Think in the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Cup over 1,800m last October to land the $70,000 Class 3 event over 1,200m, really impressed Nunes.\n\nHe knew there was an engine in the Michael Clements-trained and Tivic Stable-owned galloper from his trackwork.\n\n\"When I jumped on the horse, I could feel the energy, and he went on to show what a really good horse he is,\" he said. \"I rode him back in the field and he ran on very well. He's a lovely horse.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll improve after that first run. I thought the 1,200m was a bit sharp, but I rode him quiet so he can finish it off.\"\n\nProsperous Return was among a pool of quality horses Clements could tap from for the big races last year. He fared okay, but the ultimate test, the Group 1 Singapore Gold Cup over 2,000m was skipped in favour of a break.\n\nClements' assistant trainer, Michael White, must have felt vindicated after the tough decision to bypass the $1 million time-honoured race last November paid dividends on Saturday.\n\n\"He's a promising horse. We skipped the Gold Cup last year as we felt he wasn't ready for such a race after the QE II Cup,\" said the Australian.\n\n\"We gave him a nice break and, even though the distance was too short today, we thought he was the best horse in the race.\"\n\nProsperous Return surely looked the part at the 300m mark, where he came off a smothered run from the rear to dash through the pack with a pulsating kick.\n\nAnother comeback runner, Sure Will Do (Wong Chin Chuen), was also in the mix. He came swooping down on the outside.\n\nBut Prosperous Return produced the better turn of foot on the inside to score by a length to justify his $12 favouritism in 1min 10.10sec on the Short Course A.\n\nUnfortunately, there was bad news after the race. Prosperous Return was found to have bled in both nostrils.\n\nHe has been barred from trackwork for two months and racing for three months.\n\nThis has ruled him out from the $1 million Group 1 Kranji Mile on May 21.\n\nSee more on\n\nSports and recreation\n\nHorse racing\n\nSingapore", "images": []}

The world has already warmed by 1.1 deg C since pre-industrial times.\n\nAt this level of warming, some climate impacts are already locked in and considered close to irreversible in some natural ecosystems, such as the long-term decline of coral reefs in the South China Sea, said Dr Chow.\n\nHe added that a warmer earth could mean that parts of Asean dependent on water from glacial melt - such as cities along the upper Mekong - will likely have reduced freshwater resources, due to the loss of ice there.\n\n\"Crop yield could also be reduced if the world gets warmer, and other climate-driven events such as floods, droughts and tropical cyclones could further affect yield,\" said Dr Chow.\n\nIf cities and countries want to reduce such climate risks, then adaptation is essential to minimise future loss and damage, he added.\n\nAdaptation refers to measures that countries can take to reduce the impacts of climate-driven events on societies, while loss and damage is a term used in climate change discussions that refers to climate impacts that societies are currently suffering which cannot be, or have not been, reduced by adaptation efforts.\n\nFor sea-level rise, for example, adaptation measures could include building sea walls or restoring mangroves.\n\nTo reduce flooding in urban areas, an adaptation strategy could include having land-use planning policies that discourage buildings in areas exposed to floods or cyclones, said Dr Chow.\n\nBut the latest IPCC report - which focuses on the impacts of climate change on human societies - had identified large gaps between adaptation action taken and what is needed to deal with the increasing risks. These gaps are largest among lower-income populations, it said.\n\nIn Asia, obstacles to greater climate adaptation include fragmented, reactive governance, lack of finances, and inadequate evidence on which actions to prioritise and how to sequence them, said the IPCC.\n\nDr Chow pointed to how unplanned development still occurs in parts of urban Thailand and the Philippines along its rapidly urbanising coastlines. This increases the risks of loss and damage to vulnerable populations, he said.\n\nDespite the challenges, the IPCC said that early adaptation is crucial to help vulnerable communities cope with climate impacts.\n\nThis is because with every degree of warming, climate change impacts get more severe, while the effectiveness of available adaptation options decreases, it said.\n\nHowever, to reduce impacts of climate change on societies, adaptation must go hand in hand with efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSee more on\n\nAsean\n\nClimate change\n\nEnvironmental issues\n\nSustainable living/development", "images": []}

Our actions today will shape how people adapt and nature responds to increasing climate risks.\"\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two key prongs of climate action.\n\nMitigation refers to efforts to reduce emissions, such as switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy, while adaptation is geared at helping communities cope with impacts, like building sea walls to keep out rising sea levels.\n\nBut the latest IPCC report - which involved more than 200 authors from different countries, including Singapore - noted that progress on adaptation is uneven.\n\nThere are gaps between action taken and what is needed to deal with the increasing risks, and these gaps are largest among lower-income populations, it said.\n\nThe latest report builds on the first of the AR6 reports which was released last August. That report had focused on indicators of the climate crisis, such as temperatures and rate of sea-level increase.\n\nThe latest one highlights the implications of these indicators on societies.\n\nFor example, it found that increasing heat and extreme weather are driving wildlife towards the poles, higher latitudes or deeper ocean waters.\n\nThis has repercussions on food security for many communities.\n\nFor instance, the IPCC noted that many Pacific island countries could see their maximum fish catch potential drop by at least 50 per cent by 2100 compared with the period from 1980 to 2000, even if the world makes drastic cuts in the amount of emissions released.\n\nChanges in temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather have also increased the frequency and spread of diseases in wildlife, agriculture and people.\n\nIn Asia, the report highlighted how increased frequency of hazards such as heatwaves, floods or drought could increase vector-borne and water-borne diseases, undernutrition, mental disorders and allergic diseases.\n\nDespite the dire outlook, however, the report said mankind can still reduce the magnitude of climate impacts on societies by harnessing nature.\n\nIPCC Working Group 2 co-chairman Hans-Otto Portner said healthy ecosystems are more resilient to climate change and provide life-critical services such as food and clean water.\n\n\"By restoring degraded ecosystems and effectively and equitably conserving 30 to 50 per cent of earth's land, freshwater and ocean habitats, society can benefit from nature's capacity to absorb and store carbon, and we can accelerate progress towards sustainable development,\" he said.\n\nSecretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Jagan Chapagain said the IPCC report confirms what aid organisations have already been witnessing for years.\n\n\"Climate change is already disrupting the lives of billions, particularly the world's poorest who have contributed the least to it,\" he said.\n\n\"The global response to Covid-19 proves that governments can act decisively and drastically in the face of imminent global threats - we need the same energy and action to combat climate change now.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nClimate change\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nScience\n\nEnvironmental issues", "images": []}

Total operating cost crept up by 6.6 per cent to $3.33 billion.\n\nOperating profit ended 72.6 per cent higher at $210 million, giving the group an operating margin of 5.9 per cent, from 3.8 per cent previously. Net earnings after tax attributable to shareholders was 114 per cent higher at $130.1 million.\n\nFor the year, the group received $84.6 million in government relief, down from $169.3 million in 2020. But even before factoring in the relief, it posted an operating profit of $125.4 million, from a loss of $47.6 million.\n\nNet earnings per share rose by 113.5 per cent to six cents. Net asset value per share stood at 124.9 cents, from 122.15 cents.\n\nNet cash and equivalents stood at $919.1 million, versus $742.8 million the year before. Gross gearing fell to 12.7 per cent, from 18 per cent in 2020.\n\nComfortDelGro chief executive Yang Ban Seng said: \"It has been another challenging year, but the high global vaccination rate has helped economic recovery through the easing of social restrictions and the reopening of borders.\"\n\nHe added: \"As a transport operator, we have certainly benefited from the increases in economic activity, but we are not out of the woods yet.\"\n\nThe taxi business improved significantly, going from an operating loss of $64.4 million in 2020 to an operating profit of $18.5 million as rental discounts lessened and call bookings increased.\n\nThe group said call bookings were now 90 per cent of 2019 levels of around 80,000 a day.\n\nIts public transport business posted a 5.3 per cent rise in operating profit to $130.7 million as more people returned to work and leisure activities rose.\n\nIts inspection and testing services business benefited from a recovery in non-vehicle testing activity, and posted a 15 per cent rise in operating profit to $30.6 million.\n\nIts driving centre division saw operating profit rise 73 per cent to $14.9 million, largely because there had been Covid-19-related closures in 2020.\n\nDirectors are recommending a final dividend of 2.1 cents per share. Together with an interim dividend of 2.1 cents, this represents a 70 per cent payout of net profit, versus 50 per cent last year. In 2020, there was no interim dividend, while the final dividend was 1.43 cents.\n\nGroup chairman Lim Jit Poh said the group was still aiming to unlock the value of its investments in Australia by looking for investment partners. Its move to float its businesses Down Under was aborted last year on the back of a spate of other listings.\n\nMr Lim added that ComfortDelGro was also now looking at expanding into the logistics arena.\n\n\"We've been moving people. Now we want to move goods,\" he said, adding that this would include attendant activities such as warehousing. \"This is likely to be through acquisitions.\"\n\nLast November, it entered into a joint venture to start a concrete-transporting business in China.\n\nSee more on\n\nComfortDelGro\n\nTaxis\n\nPublic transport", "images": []}

She suggested a points system that considers a range of non-salary factors to make the work pass system more transparent and economical.\n\nWith a tight labour market, the higher salary cut-offs will hurt employers, she added yesterday. \"The higher work pass thresholds have triggered international firms to review the sustainability of their operations in Singapore.\"\n\nThe latest changes will see the qualifying salaries for new EP and S Pass applicants go up by $500 to $5,000 and $3,000 respectively from September.\n\nIn the financial services sector - which has higher salary norms - the bar will be raised from $5,000 to $5,500 for new EP applicants. A salary threshold of $3,500 will be introduced for incoming S Pass holders in the sector.\n\nFor older EP and S Pass applicants, their higher salary cut-offs will be raised in tandem. For renewals, the changes will apply a year later - from September 2023.\n\nMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) welcomed the changes, saying: \"Theoretically, this means that jobs which previously paid between the old and new salary thresholds - which could have gone to a foreign employee previously - will now have to be filled by a local.\"\n\nBut he asked if the Government would consider further differentiation of sectors beyond just carving out the financial service sector.\n\n\"Different sectors pay vastly different salary scales, and the point at which they require foreign labour or expertise may vary significantly,\" he said. \"Having a single uniform qualifying salary may also penalise sectors where Singaporeans are less interested in those jobs, while those employers cannot get pass holders to do the jobs.\"\n\nNon-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai said the EP qualifying salary tweak is \"too little to be effective\". He reiterated an earlier call for a monthly levy of $1,200 to be imposed on each EP holder to \"ensure fair competition\".\n\nNominated MP Janet Ang highlighted that many companies in certain sectors, such as construction and food and beverage, have participated in recruitment fairs over the past two years, but had little success in getting Singaporeans. She hoped the Government could look at sectoral differentiation for the short to medium term.\n\nMr Edward Chia (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) also said some employers have shared with him their difficulties in hiring Singaporeans, adding that the local workforce is expected to shrink with the ageing population and low birth rates.\n\n\"While I agree that we must provide gainful employment for Singaporeans and strengthen the complementary factor with the foreign workforce, we may soon reach or already have reached a point where there is simply not enough of us,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nWorking life", "images": []}

Two trips involved Teva Raj being picked up from his office at 1 Cluny Road.\n\nHe did not offer to pay Mr Ong for the services, nor did Mr Ong ask for payment, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Victoria Ting.\n\nAnother NParks officer, Mr Johnny Go, director at the division at the time, joined Teva Raj on two occasions.\n\nHe has been issued a stern warning, while Mr Ong was given a conditional warning.\n\nSome time in 2019, HEHC was experiencing manpower delays and Teva Raj suggested to HEHC to get Soon Sin to step in as a sub-contractor. Soon Sin took over HEHC's works for a period of three months.\n\nTeva Raj also instructed NParks staff not to issue any notice of infringements to HEHC as this would cause disruption to the works.\n\nTeva Raj's lawyer, Mr Bernard Sahagar, told the court that NParks had become his client's \"family and passion\".

Shanmugam addressed Parliament and said penalties for sex crimes against minors would be reviewed.\n\nOther sexual offences will also be expanded and made clearer from today.\n\nIt is an offence to get consent for sex by deceiving a victim about the use of any sex protection measure or about the carrying of a sexually transmitted disease (STD).\n\nThis will be expanded, so that tricking victims into consenting to being touched sexually by a third person will also count as an offence.\n\nThe offence will also be clarified to include tricking the victim about the risk of contracting an STD, such as when the offender lies to the victim that the STD is not transmissible through sex.\n\nDefinitions for terms relating to voyeurism, child abuse material and abuse material of minors will also be made clearer.\n\nThe offence of having sex with a corpse, which is currently worded to apply to \"any man\", will be made gender neutral and expanded to cover other forms of sexual acts with a corpse.\n\nSeveral changes to non-sexual crimes will also kick in from today. It is currently a crime to provide false information to a public servant to make the latter \"improperly use, or not to use\" lawful powers.\n\nThis will be expanded to include making the person use powers inefficiently or ineffectively, such as by giving false information about the identity of a suspect.\n\nThe maximum sentence of two years' jail and a fine remains the same.\n\nThe offence of obstructing a public servant will also be tweaked.\n\nCurrently, the maximum sentence is three months' jail and a $2,500 fine.\n\nThe maximum jail sentence will be raised to six months, and \"obstruction\" will also be clarified to mean not just physically obstructing a public servant, but also providing false information.\n\nAs part of the amendments, the language of the Penal Code will be modernised.\n\nArchaic terms such as \"wantonly\", \"malignantly\" and \"maliciously\" will be replaced with more easily understood words such as \"rashly\" and \"intentionally\".\n\nOther amendments, such as expanding the jurisdiction of a magistrate's court and district court relating to racially or religiously aggravated offences, will come into force at a later date together with amendments to the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act.\n\nSee more on\n\nSex offences\n\nLaw and legislation\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs", "images": []}

It involved a survey and interviews, as well as observation.\n\nThrough listings provided by ride-hailing firm Gojek, which provided funding for the study, 958 PHV drivers were surveyed.\n\nThe researchers also conducted 75 in-depth interviews with drivers and riders, and followed and observed a number of them at work.\n\nPresenting the findings yesterday, Dr Mathews said the team hopes to poll delivery riders as well, but has yet to get a good sample.\n\nThe researchers found that involvement in full-time platform work can impede long-term career mobility and take time away from upskilling pursuits.\n\nOlder and better educated PHV drivers had a harder time finding other jobs similar to their previous roles or relevant to their education and training. About 49 per cent of PHV drivers polled felt they had no choice but to do platform work.\n\nThe flexibility on offer is a major draw, with 76 per cent of the drivers citing it as a reason why they became PHV drivers.\n\nBut there exists a paradox for full-time platform workers as they may not be able to afford to enjoy this autonomy.\n\nTo earn a good wage, workers have to slog and \"grind\", said the researchers, citing the example of a delivery rider who earned more than $5,000 a month but had to cycle for more than 12 hours a day almost every day to hit that figure.\n\nPlatform workers are also at the mercy of others, with challenges ranging from opaque algorithms to changing policies.\n\nSo even though 57 per cent of those polled said they could tolerate the pressures of being a PHV driver, only about 40 per cent said they were satisfied with the job, and only 20 per cent said their overall quality of life had improved.\n\nAbout 44 per cent said their health had worsened.\n\nPlatform workers lack savings and are financially stressed, the researchers found.\n\nAbout 50 per cent did not make any voluntary CPF contributions.\n\nThe researchers said: \"Our report does not provide insights into other types of similar work. Arguably the conditions for them may be as, or more, difficult.\n\n\"Nonetheless, the precarity that some of our respondents feel forebodes possible work conditions as more technology is developed to facilitate how people work.\"\n\nIn a panel discussion yesterday, Associate Professor Irene Ng from the National University of Singapore's department of social work said there may be a need to rethink employment legislation to cover the rising number of platform-based and non-standard work arrangements.\n\nBut Professor Danny Quah, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said changing laws may be a blunt instrument.\n\n\"For now, we are trying to see whether a fine-tuned adjustment that focuses on the specific characteristics of platform workers is something that might be better for everyone,\" said Prof Quah, who is also vice-chairman of an advisory committee set up to strengthen protections for platform workers.\n\nFive ways to provide support\n\nIn a study of workers who rely on jobs from online platforms such as ride-hailing and food delivery apps, researchers from the Institute of Policy Studies have proposed five interventions to support these platform workers.\n\n\u2022 They suggested mandating, or at least incentivising, private-hire vehicle drivers, delivery riders and platform companies to contribute to the Central Provident Fund. This is to help workers save for their healthcare and retirement needs.\n\n\u2022 The researchers proposed implementing a rest period policy for private-hire car drivers who spend long hours on the road. This would involve nudging drivers to rest after driving for a predetermined time, and encouraging them to lead healthier lifestyles.\n\n\u2022 More assistance should be given to help platform workers pivot to new careers, said the researchers. They gave the example of raising awareness of schemes that help workers find work or reskill.\n\n\u2022 The researchers suggested launching a public campaign to educate potential drivers and riders on the realities of platform work.\n\n\u2022 Finally, Singapore's urban infrastructure could be designed to be friendlier and safer for food delivery riders, they added.\n\nThe researchers said it is crucial to recognise that platform workers are a diverse group. Any intervention must take this into account for it to be successful, they added.\n\nSee more on\n\nRide-hailing apps\n\nFood delivery services\n\nSelf-employment\n\nWorker welfare", "images": []}

One example is to raise the corporate tax in line with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative or BEPS 2.0, a global effort to impose a minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15 per cent. This could generate $3.45 billion, even if small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are allowed to retain their current effective rate of 3 per cent, he said.\n\nHe said additional taxes on wealth, including the Government's proposed changes to property tax, could generate $3.7 billion. Reducing the share of reserve interest income that is returned to Singapore's reserves from the current 50 per cent to 40 per cent could generate $4.31 billion while continuing to grow the reserves, albeit at a slower rate, Prof Lim said. Increasing taxes on gambling, alcohol, tobacco and carbon emissions could generate $3.65 billion, he added.\n\n\"We can, in fact, choose not to raise GST by adjusting some of the other levers available to us,\" he said. \"One could even mix and match among the proposals to craft a revenue mix we can accept.\"\n\nProf Lim said he cannot support the Budget statement because of its \"stubborn reliance on raising the GST\", but he expressed support for other aspects such as the expansion of the Progressive Wage Model to more sectors and the Small Business Recovery Grant, which is targeted at SMEs and sectors that are hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nGST\n\nJamus Lim", "images": []}

She remained there until the family was sure that everyone was virus-free.\n\n\"I feared further spreading within my family...

I had to give him a bit more screen time to keep him still,\" she added.\n\nGetting a good night's sleep in the living room was not a challenge for the toddler. \"He can pretty much sleep anywhere as long as he's comfy... And he was very tired during the first two days.\"\n\nFortunately, Ms Lee was the only other family member to get infected, as she was taking care of her son. She had mild symptoms.\n\nShe then packed away the living room mattress and isolated in the master bedroom with her son.\n\nApart from a 38.5 deg C fever and a little cough for two days, the boy was well from the third day.\n\n\"He was pretty much on his own, and I only needed to feed him and clean him up.

It is better to raise it in two tranches than two percentage points in one go,\" said Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance and Trade and Industry.\n\nThe GST hike from 7 per cent to 9 per cent will be implemented in two stages, with one percentage point on Jan 1, 2023, and another percentage point on Jan 1, 2024, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong had announced in his Budget statement on Feb 18.\n\nOf particular concern among MPs who spoke was how the tax increase might affect middle-income Singaporeans, who typically do not qualify for many support measures and will not get as much help, but could see their spending power erode as prices of utilities, food and other necessities rise.\n\nMPs said the $6.6 billion Assurance Package - meant to help cushion the increase in GST - may help this \"sandwiched generation\" tide over the transition period, but noted that they would need more help to cope with higher living costs after that.\n\nTheir remarks prompted Mr Wong to assure the House that he would give a full response to their \"relevant, important questions\" during his round-up speech tomorrow after all MPs speak.\n\nSome MPs had, in their speeches, suggested that part of the answer to helping middle-income earners cope lies in raising their wages.\n\nMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) said this would help Singaporeans cope with rising costs of living in a \"sustained manner\". He mooted raising the salaries of all front-line workers across the board, including healthcare workers and pre-school teachers, to recognise their contributions during the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) said workers should be given more training opportunities so that they can upgrade themselves and go on to jobs with higher wages as they progress in their careers.\n\nHe urged the Government, unions and businesses to work together on the most suitable training models for their sectors, and to find the best trainers.\n\nEven as the backbencher MPs acknowledged that tax increases were bound to be unpopular, they agreed that raising the GST was necessary in the face of growing social and healthcare spending.\n\nMany noted that the tax system has become more progressive over time and said the GST increase, along with the offset packages, will further this leftward shift.\n\nMr Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru) underlined that the Government had taken other steps to raise revenue before deciding to raise the GST rate. He cited the recent moves to finance long-term infrastructure investments through borrowing, and to transfer some of the foreign reserves managed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to sovereign wealth fund GIC so as to generate more income from the reserves. He also pointed to the wealth taxes, as well as an increase in income taxes for earners in the top income brackets, that were introduced in this year's Budget.\n\n\"All these show that our Government has listened carefully to people from all walks of life, balanced our country's needs with the complex global situation, and came up with practical ways to make Singapore better,\" he said.\n\nNominated MP Hoon Hian Teck, who is dean of the Singapore Management University's School of Economics, said that raising revenue through different tax sources can help balance equity with efficiency.\n\nGiving the example of raising income taxes, he said that beyond a certain point, it could result in people working less, leading to the tax base shrinking. Hence, it makes sense to diversify and raise various taxes, instead of focusing on only one type of tax.\n\nProfessor Hoon added that it makes sense to raise taxes to pay for recurrent spending, so that the national reserves can be saved for use on a rainy day to manage external shocks, as has been done during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnother MP who shared Prof Hoon's sentiment on striking the right balance was Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang). He warned: \"If we push the narrative that the wealthy are responsible for driving inequality, we risk provoking resentment and jealousy against those who may have accumulated wealth through hard work and sacrifices. This will only further polarise society.\"\n\nSumming up a sentiment expressed by many of the PAP backbenchers who spoke yesterday, Mr Yip said: \"Our current revenue structure is a balanced one, where ultimately, everyone contributes taxes, but those who are richer contribute more.\"\n\nEven as MPs acknowledged the need to raise revenue, Mr Yip also reminded the House that \"doing more for our people doesn't necessarily mean we should spend more\".\n\n\"Instead, we should challenge ourselves and think hard about what we should spend less on,\" he added.\n\nUrging prudence, he suggested that government agencies can cut down on duplication of work, for instance, providing for a specific window for the laying of broadband cables, water pipes and electrical cables, so that the roads need only be dug up once.\n\nMr Yip also noted that there was a mentality that if a ministry has surpluses, it must have not worked hard enough, saying this must change.\n\n\"Ministries should not feel guilty about having excess money to return to the coffers. In fact, the Government should throw a grand challenge - create an award and recognise ministries that best reduce their expenditure, streamline their operations and cut out non-essential projects,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nGST", "images": []}

However, it is important to cultivate the growth mindset that those who can afford to pay a little more taxes should do so,\" she said.\n\nMr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance and Trade and Industry, sounded his support for the Budget and measures that steepen the overall progressivity of Singapore's tax structure.\n\n\"In recent years, as income and wealth disparities continue to widen, the view that the better-offs should contribute more in taxes has gained traction. It is heartening that in Singapore, we are also hearing such calls from high-income earners and those who are wealthy themselves,\" he said.\n\n\"This reflects our values and mutual responsibility amongst ourselves as a society and as a nation.\"\n\nMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) suggested that instead of depending heavily on taxes to redistribute wealth, Singapore could explore enhancing its philanthropic policy framework to accommodate new forms of giving and encourage the establishment of more foundations that are more sophisticated.\n\n\"Wealthy families and philanthropists are keen to explore new models such as social impact bonds, impact investing, venture philanthropy and so on.

Disruptions to palladium supply would affect the semiconductor industry and the wider technology goods market.\n\n\"We are working with our key companies to review their business continuity plans, to minimise disruptions to their business operations,\" Mr Gan said. \"We must also be prepared for the follow-on impact on trade and investment flows. A protracted conflict will affect business confidence and weigh on global economies, and impact their recovery from the pandemic.\"\n\nMr Gan said the conflict in Ukraine is a stark reminder that as a small country and open economy, Singapore is vulnerable to the vagaries of international developments - military conflict, global inflation and supply disruptions, or other trends such as technology and climate change. \"It is crucial that we strengthen our defences against such external shocks. To do that, we need to build a vibrant, diversified and resilient economy, as well as forge a cohesive and united society,\" he said.\n\nMr Gan said that given the Republic's open economy, it would not be possible to totally insulate Singapore from the impact of higher global costs.\n\nA multi-pronged strategy has been implemented to address inflation concerns, including measures to manage various cost drivers such as electricity prices and rental costs, and to support businesses, he added.\n\n\"The Government will monitor this inflation situation carefully, and will not hesitate to provide more help should there be a need to,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore economy\n\nUkraine\n\nInflation/Price level\n\nGan Kim Yong", "images": []}

It carries a jail term of up to two years.\n\nIn 2007, after a robust parliamentary debate on whether Section 377A should be repealed, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the status quo remains but the law would not be proactively enforced.\n\nThis was because the Government took the view that a balance had to be struck between accepting homosexual individuals as part of society and respecting the more traditional views of mainstream society, said the court.\n\nThe court said this \"political compromise\" took on legal significance in 2018, when Attorney-General Lucien Wong expressed a general policy of not prosecuting consenting adults for private sexual acts.\n\nThe court held that Mr Wong's representations are given legal force by the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations.\n\nThe court said the exceptional circumstances surrounding the non-enforcement of Section 377A call for a limited recognition of this doctrine.\n\nThe expectations of gay men that Section 377A will not be enforced for consensual acts merit legal protection, said the court. It said its decision preserves the legislative status quo and removes uncertainties faced by homosexual men.\n\n\"Our finding therefore gives practical legal effect to both the political compromise on Section 377A that the Government struck in 2007 and the legitimate expectation engendered by A-G Wong's representations,\" said the court.\n\nDr Tan described the court decision as a \"partial but significant victory for the LGBT community\".\n\nHe said: \"Although... it may be disheartening that the apex court has not ruled Section 377A unconstitutional, it has however declared the statute 'unenforceable'. This will have numerous legal and social ramifications that will play out in the months and years to come.\"\n\nHe said he has filed a court application to compel the Cabinet to move a Bill to repeal Section 377A.\n\nMr Ong said: \"I am disappointed with the outcome but the ruling does not mean the end of the community's pursuit for equality.\"\n\nHe added that it will take more time before the community finds full recognition and acceptance by policymakers and society.\n\nMr Ong was represented by Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, Mr Choong was represented by Senior Counsel Harpreet Singh Nehal, and Dr Tan was represented by Mr M. Ravi.\n\nThe trio argued that Section 377A, enacted in 1938, violates Article 12 of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law.\n\nThey argued that men were being treated unequally because women cannot be punished for acts of gross indecency.\n\nThey also argued it was absurd to criminalise a particular sexual orientation when scientific evidence shows that sexual orientation cannot be voluntarily changed.\n\nState counsel contended that the highly divisive issue of whether Section 377A should be repealed was for Parliament to decide.\n\nKey events\n\n2007:\n\nAfter much debate in Parliament, Section 377A is retained with the assurance that it will not be proactively enforced.\n\n2010:\n\nMr Tan Eng Hong is charged under Section 377A and files a constitutional challenge against the provision.\n\n2012:\n\nGay couple Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee file their own challenge.\n\n2013:\n\nThe High Court dismisses both challenges.\n\n2014:\n\nThe Court of Appeal rules that Section 377A is constitutional.\n\n2018:\n\nVeteran diplomat Tommy Koh urges a new court challenge, after India's top court decriminalises consensual gay sex.

Mr Chua and Ms Foo were among MPs who discussed in Parliament the new wealth tax measures announced in this year's Budget, including raising property tax.\n\nMr Chua said: \"When viewed from a glass half-full perspective, it is a step in the right direction when it comes to tackling wealth inequality and strengthening our social fabric, albeit a small step.\n\n\"However, when viewed from a glass half-empty perspective, the measures are a token rather than a meaningful attempt at wealth taxes in Singapore.\"\n\nThese taxes are expected to raise $600 million of additional tax revenue a year when implemented, which is considerably lower than expert estimates, he said.\n\nHe added that while the increase in headline marginal property tax rates appears high, the actual impact on the households involved is unlikely to be material.\n\n\"Based on my analysis, a centrally located condo in Cairnhill that is being leased out as an investment property needs to raise rents by only 2 per cent to offset the higher property tax rates, while that of a luxury development located in Nassim Road, commanding monthly rentals of almost $20,000 a month, needs to raise rents by only 7 per cent to offset the higher property taxes,\" he said.\n\nOn the new additional registration fee tier for cars, he cited how this will add 6 per cent to 7 per cent to the cost of a Bentley Flying Spur, a luxury saloon, adding that this is not a meaningful wealth tax for buyers willing to fork out close to $1 million for a fast-depreciating asset.\n\nMs Foo said that while the amount raised by wealth taxes may not seem large, property-related taxes such as the ABSD have, in fact, contributed significantly to Singapore's revenue base over the years.\n\n\"As ABSD targets mainly property investors, this has effectively become a form of wealth tax, apart from acting as a policy measure to cool the property market,\" she said.\n\nShe added: \"While the Government may not consider this a stable form of revenue base, I think investors should not hold out much hope for the ABSD to be lifted, as it is now a significant part of government revenue.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) said the property tax hike might affect older residents who do not draw an income but live in properties that will see higher taxes. \"These are properties that they may have bought long ago. Upon retirement, they have no income and are burdened with the ever-increasing cost of living and now have to pay higher property tax as well,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nProperty market/sector\n\nTaxation", "images": []}

This dispersion of the droplets into a uniform film prevents fogging.\n\nAn average blink lasts about 100 milliseconds.\n\nThe team expects the coating to have applications in a myriad of objects, ranging from spectacles to surveillance cameras and even solar panels.\n\nProfessor Chen Zhong of the NTU School of Materials Science and Engineering said: \"Most anti-fogging solutions today are temporary and have limited efficacy.\n\n\"Our team has demonstrated an approach that is fast to fabricate, taking around an hour, and produces long-lasting results, proving its potential for wide-ranging practical applications.\"\n\nBy tapping ultra-violet light for a full day, components in the coating can also break down dirt and bacteria.\n\nWhile anti-fogging coating has been developed for industrial applications, such as on solar panels, widespread adoption has been hampered by durability issues, said the research team in a press release last week.\n\nFor instance, prior coating could not withstand washing and had to be reapplied regularly due to poor adhesion between the plastic surface and the coating.\n\nFurthermore, it took a long time to apply and was prone to surface contamination by dirt or bacteria, demanding regular cleaning or replacement.\n\nAccording to the researchers, these problems will be greatly reduced with the new coating that can be fabricated and applied quickly, \"taking under an hour\" to apply.\n\nThe team's findings were published last December in Applied Surface Science, the highest-ranked materials science journal internationally.\n\nThe new coating, which is made of a combination of silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide, is applied through a two-step technique.\n\nAll organic matter is first removed from the surface using an oxygen plasma, an ionised gas, to improve adhesion.\n\nA laser is then used to deposit vaporised silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide directly on the surface into a thin, double-layer film.\n\nThis film is expected to last a long time, said Prof Chen, the co-principal investigator of the study.\n\n\"On surveillance cameras under normal conditions, this film can be estimated to last a few months to a year,\" he added.\n\nThe coating has other beneficial properties, such as being anti-reflective.\n\nThe NTU researchers have applied for a patent for the film and are looking to strike up industrial collaborations to take the innovation from the laboratory to market.\n\nDr Thomas Reindl, the deputy chief executive of the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (Seris) at the National University of Singapore, said the new anti-fogging film invented by the NTU team sounds like \"an interesting new method to enhance the self-cleaning of solar panels\".\n\nBut he added that it has to be compared with existing solutions and checked for its compatibility with other components.\n\n\"Seris has tested various anti-soiling methods in the past, and hence we would be more than happy to apply it on actual solar panels to compare the benefits.\n\n\"We also need to see how the new method interacts with the anti-reflective coating, which is a standard feature of modern solar panels,\" said Dr Reindl.\n\nSee more on\n\nNTU\n\nScience", "images": []}

This is an existential issue for us,\" he said.\n\n\"We cannot accept one country attacking another without justification, arguing that its independence was the result of 'historical errors and crazy decisions'.\"\n\n\"Such a rationale would go against the internationally recognised legitimacy and the territorial integrity of many countries, including Singapore,\" Dr Balakrishnan told the House yesterday, setting out Singapore's stance and response to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nWhile Singapore continues to value its good relations with Russia and the Russian people, it cannot accept violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity of another sovereign state, he said.\n\nThat is why the country has strongly condemned Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which has led to Europe's biggest conflict since World War II.\n\nSingapore's assessments and actions are based on clearly enunciated and consistently held principles that are in its own long-term national interests, he noted. Rather than choosing sides, the country upholds its principles.\n\nHe made clear that upholding and standing up for principles on international law \"would not be cost-free\".\n\nDr Balakrishnan said: \"We must expect that our measures will come at some cost and implications on our businesses, citizens and indeed, to Singapore. However, unless we as a country stand up for principles that are the very foundation for the independence and sovereignty of smaller nations, our own right to exist and prosper as a nation may similarly be called into question one day.\"\n\nMinister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said the Ukraine crisis has clouded Singapore's economic outlook, and inflationary pressures are likely to rise.\n\nWhile the impact on Singapore's economy is still to be assessed, he said it is clear that there will be more upward pressure on costs, especially for oil-related items.\n\nGiven that Singapore imports most of its energy needs, the conflict is likely to push up its energy cost, said Mr Gan.\n\nMotorists must expect pump prices to rise, and both businesses and households have to prepare for higher electricity rates. Mr Gan said the crisis will further strain global supply chains, which will cause the prices of certain goods to increase.\n\nIn a Facebook post yesterday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Singapore strongly condemns Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He also noted that the ongoing crisis and Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 hold lessons for Singapore.\n\n\"When treaties and diplomacy fail, we cannot rely on others to protect us.

They deserve nothing less.\"\n\nHis speech comes nearly a year after Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, the PAP's first assistant secretary-general, stepped down as leader of the party's 4G team and designated successor to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\n\nPM Lee had initially hoped to relinquish his current post before he turned 70 on Feb 10 this year, but later said he would stay on to see Singapore through the Covid-19 pandemic. While he has not yet named his successor, the front runners are widely understood to be Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung and Education Minister Chan Chun Sing, who is the PAP's second assistant secretary-general.\n\nIt is up to the entire 4G team to decide who their leader will be.\n\nIn his speech, Mr de Souza noted that Singapore has done well to plan ahead in many policy areas.\n\nBut it has not managed to sort out political succession, he said during the debate on the Budget.\n\n\"We must ensure that we have successive generations of leaders to see these policies to fruition.\"\n\nMr de Souza said Singapore's next prime minister does not need to be the smartest person. But it is essential that he is someone who can bring the team together, he added, illustrating how he and his teammates chose their captain for the national hockey team.\n\nWhile there were four or five who were better players, Mr de Souza said the captain was chosen \"because he could read the game better than any of us, he could gel a team together better than any of us and he understood his opponents and their tactics well\".\n\nHe added: \"The point I am making is that you, the 4G, can choose someone who is not necessarily the smartest. But you need to choose someone who is the best fit to bring together the team.\"\n\nAnother thing to consider is that political succession impacts Singapore's standing among foreign investors, said Mr de Souza, who is a lawyer. He cited how political predictability is taken into consideration by many clients: \"Time and again, my clients have shared that Singapore's predictable political environment gives them confidence to invest their business, human capital and infrastructure (for the) long term in Singapore.\"\n\n\"Germane to that is their understanding of Singapore's political succession planning - and here I am talking about political succession planning within the PAP.\"\n\nIt is also a topic on the minds of backbench MPs, he added, recounting a conversation he had with Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir) on a trip to Morocco in 2019. They had spoken of succession among the 4G leaders. \"Why, because we like to play political chess games? No,\" Mr de Souza said. \"The backbenchers discuss these things between themselves because we want to see Singapore succeed.\"\n\nWould the topic have been more appropriate for a political party conference? No, because the PAP and its succession planning have been organic to Singapore's success story, he observed. \"We have solid leadership now but we must, with utmost imperative, line up the future PM and his or her deputies so that they get the longest runway possible before taking over the controls in the cockpit,\" he said.\n\nGetting succession right will demonstrate Singapore's far-sightedness despite the pandemic, he added. \"We don't need to think variant to variant, day by day, month by month - rather, Singapore plans decade by decade.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nPAP\n\nSingapore politics\n\nPolitics and government", "images": []}

Such a rationale would go against the internationally recognised legitimacy and territorial integrity of many countries, including Singapore.\"\n\nRussia has been building up its military presence along the Ukrainian border over the past several months to exert pressure on the country and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.\n\nNations around the world, including Singapore, have condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Some European countries, such as Germany and Italy, have pledged to send weapons and battle equipment to Ukraine, while others like the United States have hit Russia with sanctions aimed at crippling its economy.\n\nThe minister said the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of all countries, big and small, must be respected.\n\nSingapore must take any violation of these core principles seriously whenever and wherever they occur, and this is why the country has strongly condemned Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, he added.\n\nIt is too easy for a small country to be caught up in the geopolitical games of big powers, he warned.\n\nHe said small countries must avoid becoming sacrificial pawns, vassal states or \"cat's paws\" to be used by one side against the other.\n\nIt is for this reason that Singapore works hard to maintain good relations with all its neighbours and with big powers.\n\nWhen situations arise, Singapore's assessments and actions are based on clearly enunciated and consistently held principles that are in its own long-term national interests. Rather than choosing sides, the country upholds its principles.\n\nBut this will not always be the case, Dr Balakrishnan said. \"There will be occasions when we will have to take a stand, even if it is contrary to one or more powers on the basis of principles as we are doing now.\"\n\nSingapore can draw important lessons from Ukraine's invasion, said the minister, noting that while international law and diplomatic principles are essential, they are not sufficient.\n\nThe ongoing crisis demonstrates how quickly a vulnerable country can be overrun, especially when confronting a larger and more powerful opponent, he said. \"This is the acute reality for all small countries, and Singapore is no exception.\"\n\nSingapore cannot depend on others for protection and must never lose the ability to defend and look after itself, he added.\n\nThe country has thus invested consistently in defence to build up the strength and credibility of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), and maintained national service as a fundamental element.\n\n\"The capability of the SAF must be undergirded by Singaporeans' resolve - the iron determination of our people to fight and die, if need be, to defend what is ours, and our way of life,\" said Dr Balakrishnan.\n\n\"Without such capability and resolve, no amount of diplomacy can save a country.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nRussia\n\nSingapore Parliament", "images": []}

Supply chain disruptions are having an outsized impact on people's purses. There's real concern on the ground that the announcement to raise the GST will lead to price rises across the board,\" he added.\n\n\"In fact, some price rises have already occurred, with speculation that these were in anticipation of a GST hike.\"\n\nThe WP has previously raised other suggested tax measures, such as the proposal by Associate Professor Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) last November to impose a levy of 0.5 per cent to 2 per cent on the wealthiest in Singapore.\n\nMr Singh said the judicious use of progressive tax measures can achieve wider societal goals.\n\nThis year's Budget contained a slew of moves to increase taxes on the personal income, property and luxury vehicles of high earners. But Mr Singh said such measures, which he said have been characterised as a tax on wealth, would have a \"limited impact\".\n\nHe called for the proactive exploration of outright wealth taxes.\n\nMr Singh added that a distinction needed to be made between different types of wealth taxes.\n\n\"We should recognise the legitimate accumulation of wealth through effort and tangible business activity, especially that which creates jobs for Singaporeans. Even as there remains scope for wealth taxes, the values of entrepreneurship and equitable reward for hard work can nonetheless be recognised and even promoted through tax rebates or relief for such individuals,\" he said.\n\n\"However, wealth accumulated through capital appreciation should be dealt with differently and taxed accordingly in the name of a fairer and more inclusive society.\"\n\nMr Singh also reiterated suggestions on raising revenue made by the WP since as far back as in 2018, such as by including a portion of land sales in recurrent revenue, and adjusting the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) framework to allow for recurrent spending to be raised to 60 per cent from the current 50 per cent.\n\nThe NIRC is the largest single source of government revenue. Under its framework, the Government can spend up to half of the long-term expected investment returns generated by Temasek, sovereign wealth fund GIC and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\n\"Our healthcare needs will likely be on an upward trajectory. For the very Singaporeans whose energies contributed to the reserves\u2026 spending for them in their golden years and at their time of need should not even be a question,\" said Mr Singh.\n\nNotwithstanding the WP's disagreement with the GST hike, Mr Singh said he welcomed the formation of a Committee Against Profiteering to address concerns that businesses could use GST as a cover to raise prices.\n\nCommittee chair and Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling had invited Mr Singh to nominate an opposition member to sit on the panel, and the Progress Singapore Party's Non-Constituency MP Hazel Poa has taken up the role, Mr Singh said.\n\nIn his half-hour speech to open an annual marathon debate, he suggested that new Budget measures such as the Small Business Recovery Grant - for those hardest hit by Covid-19 - be expanded to also consider, on a more flexible and case-by-case basis, appeals from businesses that fall outside the eligibility criteria.\n\nMr Singh also urged the Government to move more decisively on the new Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, under which employers who raise the pay of their local lower-wage workers over the next five years will receive co-funding.\n\nThe Government will co-fund 50 per cent of pay increases made this year and next year, 30 per cent of pay increases in 2024 and 2025, and finally, 15 per cent of pay increases in 2026.\n\nMr Singh called on Mr Wong to ensure that Singaporean workers who take home less than $1,300 can rely on the scheme to raise their wages immediately, \"as they already earn very low salaries\".\n\nHe then proposed that the Government remove the newly announced criterion for workers to earn at least $500 a month to qualify for the Workfare Income Supplement scheme - which tops up their incomes and Central Provident Fund savings.\n\nWhile designed to encourage part-timers and casual workers to take up regular, full-time work, this will penalise those with legitimate reasons for not doing so - and they are often the most financially vulnerable workers, said Mr Singh.\n\nHe also called on the Government to reveal more data and details - including in its revenue and expenditure projections for the rest of the decade; how it intends to refine the assessment of Employment Pass applications; and the revenue quantum the increased carbon tax is projected to bring in up to 2030.\n\nOn a larger level, the Government should \"review how it reports on initiatives that were previously announced and whether they met their goals\", said Mr Singh.\n\n\"The new social compact ought to require a report card that goes into far greater detail than the bi-yearly Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review,\" he added.\n\nSee more on\n\nPritam Singh\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nSingapore politics", "images": []}

Arvindren told the court that Phee had failed to keep a proper lookout and maintain a safe braking distance, and collided into the rear of the other bus.\n\nThe impact caused the woman to be flung forward from her seat, and her head and spectacles hit a metal railing. She then realised she was unable to see with her right eye.\n\n\"The victim felt liquid and jelly-like substance dripping from her right eye. She was also bleeding from the right eye and screamed for help,\" said DPP Arvindren.\n\nThe woman underwent four operations between January 2018 and April 2019, and was given a total of 109 days of hospitalisation and medical leave.\n\nShe continues to suffer from sub-optimal vision in her right eye and requires regular management and follow-ups.\n\nThe damage to her optic nerve is permanent.\n\nThe woman filed a police report on Sept 11, 2020, more than 2\u00bd years after the accident.

But I think it's comparable to when your child had a cough, cold or runny nose before the pandemic - you don't take him or her to the emergency department at the first sign of a sniffle or fever.\"\n\nIn its daily Covid-19 update on Sunday, MOH said 57 children under 12 were currently hospitalised with Covid-19. One required oxygen but none was in the intensive care unit. There were 14,064 new local cases, with 1,553 people in hospital. A total of 214 needed supplemental oxygen and 46 required intensive care.\n\nThe ministry added that nearly 222,000 children aged five to 11 have had at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, while another 14,000 have registered to get the jab. There are more than 300,000 children in this age group.\n\nBoth doctors acknowledged that some parents may still have concerns about vaccination. But they stressed that scientific data shows inoculation helps reduce a child's chances of getting infected, as well as the risk of developing symptoms that could require hospitalisation if he or she contracts the virus.\n\nThe Health Sciences Authority said in a safety update last week that Singapore has seen 10 cases of children aged five to 11 with serious side effects after vaccination, out of a total of 238,253 doses administered to this age group as at Jan 31.\n\nVaccination can also help protect others who come into contact with children on a regular basis, said Dr Kam.\n\n\"Children who go to childcare can bring back the infection,\" she added. \"We have seen many cases in KKH where a younger sibling was admitted because he was infected by someone in the household.\"\n\nDr Leow said Covid-19 cannot be compared to other childhood diseases for which there are vaccines but where there is less urgency for parents to consider whether the jabs are needed, because the risk of contracting the coronavirus is currently much higher on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\"While it is still ultimately up to the parents to decide, I think they need to bear in mind that withholding the vaccination is also subjecting the child to the risk of developing severe Covid-19 or its complications,\" she added.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nMinistry of Health\n\nHospitals", "images": []}

Should I wait for him to turn 12 before taking him for vaccination, so he can get the full adult dose?\n\nA:\n\nGiven the current surge in Omicron cases, delaying vaccination may mean that your child could get infected before age 12, Dr Kam said.\n\nAt present, younger children aged five to 11 are given a 10 microgram dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, compared with 30 micrograms for adults.\n\nEven with smaller vaccination doses, children will still produce antibodies, which will protect them against the virus, Dr Kam added. \"I would suggest not to wait, because waiting is like betting against their chances of getting an infection, and I think that is not worth it.\"\n\nQ: What does it mean for children to become severely ill with Covid-19? Does the Omicron variant make any difference to the type of medical conditions they develop?\n\nA:\n\nMost children with Covid-19 do not fall severely ill, and even those who are hospitalised can typically be discharged within three days.\n\nHowever, those with severe Covid-19 may develop ailments such as pneumonia and croup, an inflammation of the voice box and windpipe. Some may also experience seizures or brain infections.\n\nIn such cases, children are normally hospitalised for more than three days.\n\nCroup and seizures are more commonly seen in children these days, compared with last year when the Delta variant was dominant, Dr Leow said.\n\nThere is also the risk of multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which happens two to eight weeks after a child has been infected - even after the body has already cleared the virus, Dr Kam said.\n\nMIS-C is a rare condition in which different body organs - such as the heart, lungs and liver - become inflamed. Local data shows that one in every 1,000 children infected with Covid-19 will develop MIS-C. The condition can be serious, with affected children requiring intensive care.\n\nQ: What symptoms should I look out for if I think my child has Covid-19?\n\nA:\n\nMost people develop a cough, fever and other flu-like symptoms when they contract Covid-19. But it is not uncommon for some to start vomiting or having diarrhoea as well, Dr Kam said.\n\nIf you believe your child has come into close contact with a Covid-19 patient, and is having symptoms such as a fever and slight cough on top of diarrhoea and vomiting, it is advisable to point this out to your doctor, she added.\n\nParents should also test their child for Covid-19 using an antigen rapid test kit.\n\nQ: My child is too young to be vaccinated. Are there any special precautions I should take to keep him safe?\n\nA:\n\nYou should abide by the usual precautions - practise social distancing, wash your hands regularly and wear your mask properly when you are outside the house, Dr Leow said.\n\nAs it tends to be more difficult to get children under five to wear their masks properly and maintain a safe distance from other people, parents should remind them to do so frequently.\n\nThey should also try to keep children who are unwell at home instead of taking them to school, she suggested. This is because the risk of infecting others is higher as young children are often not able to abide by safe distancing measures.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nChildren and youth\n\nHospitals", "images": []}

Oppo was in fourth position with 145 million units shipped, and Vivo was fifth with about 130 million units.\n\nCanalys told The Straits Times that vendors have attempted to mitigate the impact of the ongoing global chip shortage on their bottom line by raising prices.\n\nThe pandemic caused factories to shutter, hampering not just the production of smartphones but also televisions, computers and cars.\n\nA CNBC report in September last year quoted chip firm Advanced Micro Devices' chief executive Lisa Su as saying that the shortage would ease in the second half of this year as supply ramps up.\n\nCar manufacturers including Hyundai Motor and General Motors also shared similar views, Reuters reported last month.\n\nMarket research firm Morningstar reportedly said the shortage would eventually lead to an oversupply in 2024, while semiconductor firm Infineon Technologies said the scarcity might stretch to next year.\n\nCanalys said Singapore's smartphone market last year grew by 2.3 per cent from 2020, with 2.3 million units flying off the shelves.\n\nSamsung was also the top vendor here last year with a market share of 35 per cent, ending Apple's six-year streak of being in pole position.\n\nApple was second last year, followed by Oppo.\n\nSee more on\n\nSmartphones\n\nApple\n\nConsumer electronics\n\nSamsung", "images": []}

There has been a recent spate of cases of beachgoers manhandling and collecting sea creatures at low tide.\n\nMost visitors are cooperative and return the marine wildlife when advised by volunteers to do so, said Mr Lee, adding that the majority of the beachgoers are families exploring the area during public or school holidays.\n\nMore signs have been put up around the intertidal areas to educate visitors on how to interact responsibly with marine wildlife, and NParks will continue to step up these efforts, he added.\n\nThe Ministry of National Development is also discussing - with partners such as the marine conservation community and volunteers - how to manage the number of visitors at intertidal areas in a way that supports nature conservation while keeping these spaces open for public recreation, Mr Lee said. To assess the health of these ecosystems, NParks conducts long-term habitat monitoring in collaboration with academics and volunteers, he added, noting that recent data indicates that Singapore's marine biodiversity is generally in good condition.\n\nThe Government is studying the possibility of strengthening protection for marine organisms under the Wildlife Act. Currently, other than certain rare species such as giant clams, invertebrates are not protected under the Act. The Act, which took effect in 2020, is meant to extend greater protection to Singapore's native wildlife. Anyone found guilty of trapping or selling protected wildlife species without approval can be fined up to $50,000, jailed for two years or both. Over the past five years, no one was prosecuted for the poaching of marine wildlife under the Wildlife Act or its predecessor, the Wild Animals and Birds Act, Mr Lee said.\n\nSee more on\n\nNational Parks Board\n\nParliament", "images": []}

Here are edited excerpts of his speech.\n\nFind out what\u2019s new on\n\nST website and app.\n\nFollow topic:\n\nSingapore foreign policy\n\nPublished\n\nMar 01, 2022, 05:00 AM\n\nWe are witnessing an unprovoked military invasion of a sovereign state as we speak.\n\nWhile Ukraine is far away from us, we are following the crisis with grave concern. Its economic effects can already be felt here, for example, in rising electricity and petrol prices. But these are not the principal reason the situation in Ukraine is important to us.\n\nThe events in Ukraine go to the heart of the fundamental norms of international law and the UN Charter that prohibit the use of force and acts of aggression against another sovereign state. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a clear and gross violation of the international norms and a completely unacceptable precedent.\n\nThis is an existential issue for us. Ukraine is much smaller than Russia, but it is much bigger than Singapore. A world order based on \"might is right\", or where \"the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must\" - such a world order would be profoundly inimical to the security and survival of small states.\n\nWe cannot accept one country attacking another without justification, arguing that its independence was the result of \"historical errors and crazy decisions\". Such a rationale would go against the internationally recognised legitimacy and the territorial integrity of many countries, including Singapore.\n\nThat is why we are a staunch supporter of international law and the principles enshrined in the UN Charter. The sovereignty, the political independence and the territorial integrity of all countries, big and small, must be respected. Singapore must take any violation of these core principles seriously, whenever and wherever it occurs. This is why Singapore has strongly condemned Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine.\n\nIt is heartbreaking to see the heavy casualties and the loss of many innocent lives, resulting from this unjustified attack and act of war. We strongly urge Russia to cease this offensive military action immediately, and to work for a peaceful settlement in accordance with the UN Charter and international law.\n\nIMPORTANT LESSONS\n\nThere are important lessons for us to draw from this current Ukrainian crisis:\n\nFirst, while international law and diplomatic principles are essential, they are not sufficient. The Budapest Memorandum was supposed to guarantee Ukraine's security by three nuclear powers - Russia, the US and the UK.\n\nBut agreements are meaningful only if the parties respect them, and if they can be enforced. The invasion of Ukraine demonstrates how quickly a vulnerable country can be overrun, especially when confronting a larger and more powerful opponent. This is the acute reality for all small countries, and Singapore is no exception.\n\nRussia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 are stark reminders of this. You cannot depend on others to protect your country.\n\nThus, we must never lose the ability to defend and look after ourselves. This is why Singapore has invested consistently to build up a credible and strong SAF (Singapore Armed Forces), and to maintain national service as a fundamental element of our nationhood. The capability of the SAF must be undergirded by Singaporeans' resolve - the iron determination of our people to fight and die, if need be, to defend what is ours and our way of life. Without such capability and resolve, no amount of diplomacy can save a country.\n\nSecond, it is all too easy for a small country to be caught up in the geopolitical games of big powers. Small countries must avoid becoming sacrificial pawns, vassal states or \"cat's paws\" to be used by one side against the other.\n\nIn a speech delivered in 1973, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew shared his agreement with Julius Nyerere, then President of Tanzania, who had said: \"When elephants fight, the grass suffers.\"\n\nThis is why we work hard to maintain good relations with all our neighbours and with the big powers. When situations arise, our assessments and our actions are based on clearly enunciated and consistently held principles that are in our own long-term national interests. Instead of choosing sides, we uphold principles.\n\nConsequently, when we conduct our foreign policy in a coherent and consistent manner, we also become reliable partners for those who operate on the same principles. However, there will be occasions when we will have to take a stand even if it is contrary to one or more powers on the basis of principle - as we are doing now.\n\nThird, as a young nation, it is vital for us to maintain domestic unity and cohesion, bearing in mind how easily internal divisions can be exploited by adversaries, especially in this Internet age and the advent of hybrid warfare.\n\nDividing and weakening an opponent internally, overtly and covertly, has become the standard complement to conventional warfare. Therefore, our domestic politics must stop at our shores.\n\nFourth, safeguarding one's sovereignty and national interests often requires some sacrifice and pain. The Ukrainians are paying the ultimate price for freedom with their lives and livelihoods. The rest of the international community that is taking a stand against naked aggression through sanctions will also have to bear some pain and pay a price.\n\nSingaporeans too must understand that standing up for our national interests may come with some cost. We must be prepared to deal with the consequences, to bear the pain, to help one another, and to stand up together.\n\nWe continue to value our good relations with Russia and the Russian people. However, we cannot accept such violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity of another sovereign state.\n\nWe also participate actively at the United Nations. Three days ago, a draft resolution was presented at the UN Security Council to condemn Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Singapore was one of 82 co-sponsors of this Security Council resolution. As expected, Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, vetoed that resolution. So the resolution was not passed even though 11 of the 15 Security Council members voted in support and the remaining three members, China, India and the UAE, abstained.\n\nThe UN General Assembly will be debating a similar resolution later today. General Assembly resolutions are not subject to veto, but neither are they binding. However, as a responsible member of the international community, Singapore will comply with the spirit and the letter of the UN General Assembly decision.\n\nSingapore has always complied fully with sanctions and decisions of the UN Security Council, but we have rarely acted to impose sanctions on other countries in the absence of binding Security Council decisions or directions.\n\nHowever, given the unprecedented gravity of the Russian attack on Ukraine, and the unsurprising veto by Russia of a draft Security Council resolution, Singapore intends to act in concert with many other like-minded countries to impose appropriate sanctions and restrictions against Russia.\n\nIn particular, we will impose export controls on items that can be used directly as weapons in Ukraine to inflict harm or to subjugate the Ukrainians. We will also block certain Russian banks and financial transactions connected to Russia.\n\nWe must expect that our measures will come at some cost and implications on our businesses, citizens and, indeed, to Singapore. However, unless we as a country stand up for principles that are the very foundation for the independence and sovereignty of smaller nations, our own right to exist and prosper as a nation may similarly be called into question one day.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore foreign policy\n\nRussia\n\nUkraine", "images": []}

The other firm is Accenture.\n\nThe CTO-as-a-Service scheme, announced in February last year, helps SMEs assess their digital readiness and identify their digital needs through a Web portal, and recommends digital solutions eligible for subsidies under the Government's SMEs Go Digital scheme.\n\nSMEs that need more help can tap a pool of IT consultants who can tailor specific tech solutions to meet their needs, if off-the-shelf products and services are not available. These consultants can also offer project management services.\n\nNearly three in four SMEs that used CTO-as-a-Service engaged these consultants, said IMDA.\n\nMany companies that seek help from the scheme do so because they do not know where to start when they want to digitalise, said Ms Eileen Tan, executive director and head of information technology services of Stone Forest.\n\nSome firms use CTO-as-a-Service when trying to digitalise, she said, adding: \"They want a more holistic approach towards digitalisation, not just from the cyber-security perspective, but also from a governance perspective, especially when it comes to data security.\"\n\nAmid more cyber attacks, cyber security and data protection have come into focus as companies go digital during the pandemic.\n\nLatest government figures show that cases of ransomware, in which hackers lock up digital files until a ransom is paid, surged 154 per cent in Singapore between 2019 and 2020.\n\nEligible firms that use the consultants' advisory and project management services for the first time do not need to pay, but are billed for subsequent consultations.\n\nSMEs that use CTO-as-a-Service come from sectors such as construction, food services, food manufacturing, logistics, marine and offshore engineering, professional services, retail, security and wholesale trade, said IMDA.\n\nAsia Excel, a Singapore retailer and distributor of bathroom and kitchen appliances, needed a tech solution for processing the large number of online orders it would get during sales events from e-commerce sites and platforms.\n\nIts managing director Ray Rajagopal said it could get 500 orders during peak sale periods, which could take three days to process. But with the help of a solution recommended through CTO-as-a-Service, the processing time could be cut to just 30 minutes.\n\nThe time savings meant staff could focus on other things such as serving customers. \"We are an SME and do not have an in-house IT department or IT experts. So, definitely, we have to rely on solutions (like those from CTO-as-a-Service),\" said Mr Rajagopal.\n\nMinister of State for Communications and Information Tan Kiat How, who visited Asia Excel in Jurong on Friday, said the scheme was expanding its scope of help.\n\nIn the future, it is expected to help SMEs build digital capabilities in areas such as data analytics and advanced systems such as artificial intelligence, while also meeting cyber-security and data protection needs, he said.\n\n\"We started this CTO-as-a-Service with a number of SMEs and the feedback has been very positive,\" said Mr Tan. \"I encourage SMEs to come on board, check out the services and continue your digital transformation journey.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nDigitalisation", "images": []}

To attack a neighbour for harbouring ambitions to join the European Union, and possibly, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), is outlandish. Moreover, neither decision was imminent, and it was never clear if the latter was at all probable. The world has every right to be deeply concerned at the conflict and escalating tensions initiated by President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine and Moscow's decision to recognise two breakaway regions. Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity must be respected, and the invasion reversed. But thanks to the insecurities that haunt Russia and Mr Putin, Europe now has to confront its first land war in a generation.\n\nThe parties involved are the continent's largest and second-largest by land area. The casualty count has started to climb, and a stream of people fleeing the conflict are gathering at the Polish and other borders, trying to get to safety. Wider repercussions are already coming into view: Germany announced it will raise defence spending by at least a third, and it suspended the opening of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would have transported Russian gas to it. Critically for Russia's long-term considerations, Nato has been galvanised and given a new sense of purpose - Sweden and Finland will now be tempted to seek membership even more assiduously. Without question, there will also be calls for the European Union to accelerate plans to build its own separate defence force. Is this what Mr Putin wanted?\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nRussia\n\nSingapore\n\nUS foreign policy", "images": []}

The increase will bring in about $3.5 billion in revenue annually.\n\nYesterday, Mr Leong said that middle class Singaporeans would have to bear an \"additional\" GST burden of $1.2 billion per year.\n\nAsked by Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) how he obtained this figure, Mr Leong said the Government has previously stated that 60 per cent of GST collected is derived from top earners and foreigners working in Singapore. The remaining 40 per cent of around $3 billion in revenue then works out to $1.2 billion.\n\nBut he acknowledged, in response to a follow-up question from Mr Saktiandi, that his calculation excluded the offsets that Singaporeans would receive under a $6.6 billion Assurance Package and a beefed-up permanent GST Voucher scheme.\n\n\"I presume that the GST vouchers and all the compensation payment will apply only to the lower-income Singaporeans,\" said Mr Leong. \"There are some applying to the middle-income, but the permanent GST Voucher and all that\u2026 only the lower-income.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He derived the figure from what he said was the unutilised half of Net Investment Returns - some $20 billion - plus $10 billion of land sales proceeds being ploughed into the reserves.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nLeong Mun Wai\n\nProgress Singapore Party\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

He was entrapping her in an increasingly popular type of financial scam, she said, one that combines the age-old allure of romance with the newer temptation of overnight cryptocurrency riches.\n\nWithin weeks, Ms Vu, 33, had sent more than US$300,000 (S$407,600) worth of Bitcoin, nearly her entire life savings, to an address that Zhao had told her was connected to an account on the Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange OSL.

But there was no honeymoon, and no crypto windfall. Instead of going into an exchange account, Ms Vu's money went into the scammer's digital wallet, and he vanished.\n\nNow, she is struggling to make sense of what happened. \"I thought I knew him,\" she said. \"Everything was a lie.\"\n\nRomance scams - the term for online scams that involve feigning romantic interest to gain a victim's trust - have increased in the pandemic. So have crypto prices. That has made crypto a useful entry point for criminals looking to part victims from their savings.\n\nAbout 56,000 romance scams, totalling US$139 million in losses, were reported to the United States Federal Trade Commission last year, according to agency data. That is nearly twice as many reports as the agency received the previous year. In a bulletin last fall, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Oregon office warned that crypto dating scams were emerging as a major category of cybercrime, with more than 1,800 reported cases in the first seven months of the year.\n\nExperts believe this particular type of scam originated in China before spreading to the US and Europe. Its Chinese name translates roughly as \"pig butchering\" - a reference to the way that victims are \"fattened up\" with flattery and romance before being scammed.\n\nMr Jan Santiago, the deputy director of the Global Anti-Scam Organisation, a non-profit that represents victims of online cryptocurrency scams, said that unlike typical romance scams - which generally target older, less tech-savvy adults - these scammers appear to be going after younger and more educated women on dating apps like Tinder, Bumble and Hinge.\n\n\"It's mostly millennials who are getting scammed,\" he said.\n\nMs Jane Lee, a researcher at the online fraud-prevention firm Sift, began looking into crypto dating scams last year. She signed up for several popular dating apps and quickly matched with men who tried to offer her investing advice.\n\n\"People are lonely from the pandemic, and crypto is super hot right now,\" she said. \"The combination of the two has really made this a successful scam.\"\n\nMs Lee, whose company works with several dating apps to prevent fraud, said that these scammers typically tried to move the conversation off a dating app and onto WhatsApp - where messages are encrypted and harder for companies or law enforcement agencies to track.\n\nFrom there, the scammer bombards the victim with flirtatious messages until turning the conversation to cryptocurrency. The scammer, posing as a successful crypto trader, offers to show the victim how to invest his or her money for fast, low-risk gains.\n\nThen, Ms Lee said, the scammer helps the victim buy cryptocurrency on a legitimate site, like Coinbase or Crypto.com, and provides instructions for transferring it to a fake cryptocurrency exchange. The victim's money appears on the exchange's website, and he or she starts \"investing\" it in various crypto assets, under the scammer's guidance, before the scammer ultimately absconds with the money.\n\nWhat makes this particular scam so insidious is how much more elaborate it is than the Nigerian prince scams of yore. Some victims have described being directed to realistic-looking websites with charts and tickers showing the prices of various crypto assets. The names and addresses of the fake exchanges are changed frequently, and victims are often allowed to withdraw small amounts of money early on, making them more comfortable with depositing larger sums later.\n\n\"This kind of scam is quite labour-intensive and time-consuming,\" said Mr Santiago, of the Global Anti-Scam Organisation. \"They're very meticulous in their social engineering.\"\n\nCryptocurrencies are particularly useful to scammers, experts say, because of the relative privacy they offer. Bitcoin transactions are publicly visible, but because digital wallets can be set up anonymously, technically sophisticated criminals can obscure the trail of money. And since there is no central bank or deposit insurance to make victims whole, stolen money usually cannot be recovered.\n\nMs Niki Hutchinson, a 24-year-old social media producer from Tennessee, fell victim to a crypto romance scam last year. She was visiting a friend in California when she matched on Hinge with a man named Hao, who said he lived nearby and worked in the clothing business.\n\nThe two continued texting on WhatsApp for more than a month after she returned home. She told Hao that she was adopted from China; he told her that he was Chinese, too, and that he hailed from the same province as her birth family. He started calling her \"sister\" and joking that he was her long-lost brother. (They video-chatted once, she said - but Hao only partly showed his face and hung up quickly.) \"I thought he was shy,\" she said.\n\nMs Hutchinson had just inherited nearly US$300,000 from the sale of her childhood home, after her mother died. Hao suggested that she invest that money in cryptocurrency. \"I want to teach you to invest in cryptocurrency when you are free, bring some changes to your life and bring an extra income to your life,\" he texted her, according to a screenshot of the exchange.\n\nEventually she agreed, sending a small amount of crypto to the wallet address he gave her, which he said was connected to an account on a crypto exchange named ICAC. Then - when the money appeared on ICAC's website - she sent more.\n\nShe could not believe how easy it had been to make money, just by following Hao's advice. Eventually, when she had invested her entire savings, she took out a loan and kept investing more.\n\nIn December, Ms Hutchinson started to get suspicious when she tried to withdraw money from her account. The transaction failed, and a customer service agent for ICAC told her that her account would be frozen unless she paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes. Her chat with Hao went silent. \"I was like, oh, God, what have I done?\" she said.\n\nNow, Ms Hutchinson is trying to pull her life back together. She and her father live in their RV - one of the few assets they have left - and she is working with police in Florida to try to track down her scammer.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nScams\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nCrime\n\nDating/Relationships\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Now, there should be no suspicion on this programme,\" Mr Sharma said.\n\nIndian daily the Hindustan Times reported last week that Washington believes China is behind a disinformation campaign against the pact.\n\nAccording to Nepali media, US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu recently held separate telephone conversations with Nepali politicians, urging them to endorse the MCC pact by yesterday or Washington would \"review its ties with Nepal\".\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry meanwhile indicated that it believes such development cooperation should come with no strings attached.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying questioned why a grant came with an ultimatum.\n\n\"How can anyone accept such a 'gift'? Is it a 'gift' or Pandora's box?\" she said at a regular briefing in Beijing.\n\nThe MCC, created by the US Congress in 2004, offers large grants to support economic growth and reduce poverty, according to Washington.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nNepal\n\nProtests", "images": []}

Mr Muhyiddin quit as prime minister on Aug 15 last year after a group of Umno MPs, including Zahid, withdrew their support for him, costing him his majority in Parliament.\n\nIn the case of Dr Mahathir, he told reporters on Feb 23 that Zahid was looking for ways to get corruption charges against him dropped. The cases against Zahid were instituted after Pakatan Harapan, the rival coalition to Umno-led Barisan Nasional, came to power in May 2018.\n\nDr Mahathir, who was prime minister while Pakatan Harapan was in government, claimed that Zahid visited him at his house along with three others.\n\nZahid has denied these accusations.\n\nHe is facing 47 counts of money laundering, criminal breach of trust and bribery over tens of millions of ringgit belonging to Yayasan Akalbudi, a charitable organisation he founded.\n\nHe is also facing 40 charges of bribery involving more than RM43 million (S$14 million) over a foreign visa system.\n\nZahid told reporters on Sunday that his lawyers have sent letters of demand to Mr Muhyiddin and Dr Mahathir.\n\nHe maintained that he never went to see Mr Muhyiddin with files of court documents.\n\nLawyers representing Zahid, Messrs Shahrul Hamidi & Haziq, issued a statement on Sunday saying that the remarks made by Mr Muhyiddin on Feb 16 were \"unsubstantiated, malicious and defamatory\".

Here are edited excerpts of his speech.\n\nFind out what\u2019s new on\n\nST website and app.\n\nVivian Balakrishnan\n\nFollow topic:\n\nSingapore foreign policy\n\nPublished\n\nMar 01, 2022, 05:00 AM\n\nWe are witnessing an unprovoked military invasion of a sovereign state as we speak.\n\nWhile Ukraine is far away from us, we are following the crisis with grave concern. Its economic effects can already be felt here, for example, in rising electricity and petrol prices. But these are not the principal reason the situation in Ukraine is important to us.\n\nThe events in Ukraine go to the heart of the fundamental norms of international law and\n\nthe UN Charter that prohibit the use of force and acts of aggression against another sovereign state.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine is a clear and gross violation of the international norms and a completely unacceptable precedent.\n\nThis is an existential issue for us. Ukraine is much smaller than Russia, but it is much bigger than Singapore. A world order based on \"might is right\", or where \"the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must\" - such a world order would be profoundly inimical to the security and survival of small states.\n\nWe cannot accept one country attacking another without justification, arguing that its independence was the result of \"historical errors and crazy decisions\". Such a rationale would go against the internationally recognised legitimacy and the territorial integrity of many countries, including Singapore.\n\nThat is why we are a staunch supporter of international law and the principles enshrined in the UN Charter. The sovereignty, the political independence and the territorial integrity of all countries, big and small, must be respected. Singapore must take any violation of these core principles seriously, whenever and wherever it occurs. This is why Singapore has strongly condemned Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine.\n\nIt is heartbreaking to see the heavy casualties and the loss of many innocent lives, resulting from this unjustified attack and act of war. We strongly urge Russia to cease this offensive military action immediately, and to work for a peaceful settlement in accordance with the UN Charter and international law.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The Budapest Memorandum was supposed to guarantee Ukraine's security by three nuclear powers - Russia, the US and the UK.\n\nBut agreements are meaningful only if the parties respect them, and if they can be enforced. The invasion of Ukraine demonstrates how quickly a vulnerable country can be overrun, especially when confronting a larger and more powerful opponent. This is the acute reality for all small countries, and Singapore is no exception.\n\nRussia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 are stark reminders of this. You cannot depend on others to protect your country.\n\nThus, we must never lose the ability to defend and look after ourselves. This is why Singapore has invested consistently to build up a credible and strong SAF (Singapore Armed Forces), and to maintain national service as a fundamental element of our nationhood. The capability of the SAF must be undergirded by Singaporeans' resolve - the iron determination of our people to fight and die, if need be, to defend what is ours and our way of life. Without such capability and resolve, no amount of diplomacy can save a country.\n\nSecond, it is all too easy for a small country to be caught up in the geopolitical games of big powers. Small countries must avoid becoming sacrificial pawns, vassal states or \"cat's paws\" to be used by one side against the other.\n\nIn a speech delivered in 1973, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew shared his agreement with Julius Nyerere, then President of Tanzania, who had said: \"When elephants fight, the grass suffers.\"\n\nThis is why we work hard to maintain good relations with all our neighbours and with the big powers. When situations arise, our assessments and our actions are based on clearly enunciated and consistently held principles that are in our own long-term national interests. Instead of choosing sides, we uphold principles.\n\nConsequently, when we conduct our foreign policy in a coherent and consistent manner, we also become reliable partners for those who operate on the same principles. However, there will be occasions when we will have to take a stand even if it is contrary to one or more powers on the basis of principle - as we are doing now.\n\nThird, as a young nation, it is vital for us to maintain domestic unity and cohesion, bearing in mind how easily internal divisions can be exploited by adversaries, especially in this Internet age and the advent of hybrid warfare.\n\nDividing and weakening an opponent internally, overtly and covertly, has become the standard complement to conventional warfare. Therefore, our domestic politics must stop at our shores.\n\nFourth, safeguarding one's sovereignty and national interests often requires some sacrifice and pain. The Ukrainians are paying the ultimate price for freedom with their lives and livelihoods. The rest of the international community that is taking a stand against naked aggression through sanctions will also have to bear some pain and pay a price.\n\nSingaporeans too must understand that standing up for our national interests may come with some cost. We must be prepared to deal with the consequences, to bear the pain, to help one another, and to stand up together.\n\nWe continue to value our good relations with Russia and the Russian people. However, we cannot accept such violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity of another sovereign state.\n\nWe also participate actively at the United Nations. Three days ago, a draft resolution was presented at the UN Security Council to condemn Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Singapore was one of 82 co-sponsors of this Security Council resolution. As expected, Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, vetoed that resolution. So the resolution was not passed even though 11 of the 15 Security Council members voted in support and the remaining three members, China, India and the UAE, abstained.\n\nThe UN General Assembly will be debating a similar resolution later today. General Assembly resolutions are not subject to veto, but neither are they binding. However, as a responsible member of the international community, Singapore will comply with the spirit and the letter of the UN General Assembly decision.\n\nSingapore has always complied fully with sanctions and decisions of the UN Security Council, but we have rarely acted to impose sanctions on other countries in the absence of binding Security Council decisions or directions.\n\nHowever, given the unprecedented gravity of the Russian attack on Ukraine, and the unsurprising veto by Russia of a draft Security Council resolution, Singapore intends to act in concert with many other like-minded countries to impose appropriate sanctions and restrictions against Russia.\n\nIn particular,\n\nwe will impose export controls on items\n\nthat can be used directly as weapons in Ukraine to inflict harm or to subjugate the Ukrainians.

Dewan Rakyat refers to the Lower House of Parliament while Dewan Negara is the Senate or Upper Chamber.\n\nThe so-called MA63 Bill was passed unanimously on Dec 14 in a rare show of bipartisan unity in Parliament following a prolonged period of instability since the collapse of the PH administration in 2020. It collapsed under the weight of defections in its ranks in early 2020.\n\nThe MA63 Bill was among a number of major reforms in the CSA , all of which the government agreed to undertake in exchange for PH's backing for crucial supply Bills.\n\nImplementation of all the reforms is not expected until the end of July at least.\n\nBowerGroup Asia deputy managing director Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani told The Straits Times politicians from both sides are likely to heed the King's call and not push for elections until the CSA lapses later this year. \"The King has been consistent in his message of preserving political stability for the past two years,\" he said.\n\nBut he also said that the King's remarks will not immediately dampen Umno's ambitions, especially if the party performs exceptionally well in the Johor polls.\n\nThe government led by Datuk Seri Ismail, an Umno vice-president, has a slim four-seat majority in Parliament. Besides his party, his government can now count on the support of former premier Muhyiddin Yassin's Perikatan Nasional coalition, which incidentally is battling the Umno-led Barisan Nasional coalition in Johor.\n\nUmno deputy president Mohamad Hasan yesterday said Umno would push for an early general election regardless of the outcome of the Johor polls, citing the need for political stability.\n\nMr Asrul Hadi said: \"(Umno president Zahid Hamidi's) ability to rally the party's grassroots during Umno's AGM (annual general meeting) will determine if its leaders will push for an early GE.\"\n\nThe Johor election was triggered by Umno after the state government was left with a single-seat majority, after the death of an assemblyman. It comes on the heels of November's Melaka election which BN won by a landslide, securing a two-thirds majority in the assembly. Umno's ally Gabungan Parti Sarawak also romped home in the Sarawak election in December, taking 76 of the 82 seats at stake.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nRoyal families\n\nParliament", "images": []}

A 70-year-old man died on Sunday in Kuala Krai, while a 13-year-old boy was found dead on the same day in Kota Baru.\n\nDatuk Zaki said the boy was believed to have been riding a bicycle with his friends when he skidded and fell into a canal at the village.\n\n\"His friends tried to save him but failed and called nearby villagers for help,\" Datuk Zaki was quoted as saying by national news wire Bernama yesterday.\n\n\"The search operation managed to find the victim around 50m from where he fell.\"\n\nThe floods have displaced more than 11,000 people in Kelantan and over 8,000 in Terengganu.\n\nThis is the third time Malaysia is facing flash floods in a short span of nearly three months.\n\nIn mid-December last year, the country experienced its heaviest rainfall in the last 100 years, which saw eight of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia hit by floods that lasted for almost three weeks. At least 54 people died.\n\nTorrential rain that pummelled Malaysia during the New Year period also caused floods in six peninsular states and Sabah on Jan 2.\n\nTerengganu Parti Keadilan Rakyat Youth deputy leader Wan Muhamad Haikal Wan Ghazali has questioned the state government's unpreparedness in tackling the floods despite warnings from the Meteorological Department.\n\n\"The floods this time were a bit out of the ordinary as they are outside the regular monsoon season. However, it is surprising that there is no readiness by the state government as MetMalaysia had issued a weather forecast since early February saying that the weather in Terengganu is not as usual,\" he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nBesides Terengganu and Kelantan, MetMalaysia had also issued a continuous rain warning for areas such as Pahang, Johor, Kedah, Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. It advised residents in flood-prone and low-lying areas to be alert to the instructions of the authorities.\n\nMr Wan Muhamad said: \"We feel that the state government has been reckless in failing to warn the people of Terengganu to prepare. We also question the governance of the state government, which seems not to be serious in dealing with the issue of floods in the state.\"\n\nKelantan resident Ahmad Sahak, 54, told The Straits Times that he is exhausted with facing the same problem for years.\n\n\"I'm just so tired of having to go through this every year. When will we (Kelantan and Terengganu) ever find the solution to this problem?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am now already in my 50s. How long more do I have to wait before the state government finds a concrete solution to this?\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nFloods", "images": []}

To attack a neighbour for harbouring ambitions to join the European Union, and possibly, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), is outlandish. Moreover, neither decision was imminent, and it was never clear if the latter was at all probable. The world has every right to be deeply concerned at the conflict and escalating tensions initiated by President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine and Moscow's decision\n\nto recognise two breakaway regions.\n\nUkraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity must be respected, and the invasion reversed. But thanks to the insecurities that haunt Russia and Mr Putin, Europe now has to confront its first land war in a generation.\n\nThe parties involved are the continent's largest and second-largest by land area. The casualty count has started to climb, and a stream of people fleeing the conflict are gathering at the Polish and other borders, trying to get to safety. Wider repercussions are already coming into view: Germany announced it will raise defence spending by at least a third, and it\n\nsuspended the opening of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline\n\nthat would have transported Russian gas to it. Critically for Russia's long-term considerations, Nato has been galvanised and given a new sense of purpose - Sweden and Finland will now be tempted to seek membership even more assiduously.

The images released have very low resolution and similar to images seen from other missile launches, and it is not clear what North Korea gained from the test, he added.\n\n\"It does, however, remind us that Kim Jong Un committed to launching a military reconnaissance satellite at the last meeting of the Workers' Party Congress,\" Dr Lewis said. \"In general, it confirms that we should expect a North Korean space launch sooner or later.\"\n\nNorth Korea's push to develop such technology comes as South Korea plans to test a solid-fuel space projectile this month as part of a project to deploy its own military surveillance satellites to monitor the North, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.\n\nThe North Korean rocket fired on Sunday flew to a maximum altitude of around 620km and a range of about 300km, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.\n\nThe test drew international condemnation, and the United States, Britain, France and three other United Nations Security Council members planned to raise the latest launch during a closed-door council meeting yesterday, diplomats said.\n\nPrevious launches of what it says are space rockets have been criticised by the US and its allies as thinly veiled tests of ballistic missile technology.\n\nNorth Korea has previously successfully placed at least two satellites in orbit, the last one in 2016. But neither of those are believed to be working.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nNorth Korea\n\nNuclear weapons\n\nKim Jong Un\n\nDefence and military\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Fold7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nAmidst Currency Volatility, Hedging Matters Now More Than Ever, Especially for Growing Businesses\n\nRead more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Reuters could not independently verify the reports, and a junta spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe National Unity Government (NUG), a shadow government set up by opponents of last year's coup, said some of the children held were under 12 years old and some younger than five, accusing the army of a \"grave violation\" of international law.\n\nA member of the area's People's Defence Force said most had been released by yesterday morning when troops withdrew, but some adults were arrested.\n\n\"We could not fight the troops as they were holding the children,\" said the militia member, who asked not to be identified.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But though some of the factors driving those swings are ageless, climate change is increasing the likelihood of severe downpours.\n\nWater levels in the town of Lismore have not yet reached their expected peak of 14m - but they are already the worst floods the town has experienced.\n\nAcross eastern Australia, flooding has now killed seven people, after a 59-year-old man was swept away by strong currents just outside Brisbane.\n\nMillions of people have been told to stay home and nearly 1,000 schools in Queensland state remain closed because of the floods.\n\nA 70-year-old man miraculously survived after his houseboat, swept along by the raging Brisbane River, collided with a ferry terminal and quickly sank.\n\nMembers of the public were able to rescue the man, with one telling public broadcaster ABC they had linked arms to create a human chain and fished the man from the river unharmed.\n\n\"I don't know how he survived it, to be honest,\" onlooker Matthew Toomey said. Rain began to ease in Brisbane yesterday but the authorities expect the severe weather to continue this week as the \"rain bomb\" continues to travel south along the Australian coast.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, NYTIMES\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nAustralia\n\nFloods\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Fold7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nGet the new iPhone 16 from $44/mth with StarHub\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

However, numbers are climbing daily with around 400 deaths recorded in the past week, with the majority being unvaccinated residents.\n\nHong Kong has a large proportion of unvaccinated elderly despite a recent pick-up in vaccinations.

Around 4,000 people on average die each month in Hong Kong, according to 2020 government figures.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam previously ruled out a citywide lockdown and instead has ordered all 7.4 million residents to be tested this month.

I'm in pain and I cannot lift anything heavy.\"\n\nHis family now relies on their 12-year-old son, who polishes shoes for 70 US cents (95 Singapore cents) a day, for money.\n\nMr Noorudin was among eight people AFP spoke to who had sold a kidney to feed their families or pay off debt - some for as little as US$1,500. It is illegal to sell or buy organs in most developed nations, where donors are usually related to the recipient or are people acting out of altruism.\n\nIn Afghanistan, however, the practice is unregulated.\n\n\"There is no law... to control how the organs can be donated or sold, but the consent of the donor is necessary,\" said Professor Mohammad Wakil Matin, a former top surgeon at a hospital in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.\n\nAfghans desperate for money are usually matched by brokers with wealthy patients, who travel to Herat from across the country - and sometimes even from India and Pakistan.\n\nMs Azyta's family had so little food that two of her three children have recently been treated for malnourishment. She felt she had no choice but to sell an organ, and openly met a broker who matched her with a recipient from the southern province of Nimroz.\n\n\"I sold my kidney for 250,000 Afghanis,\" she said from her small damp room. \"I had to do it. My husband isn't working, we have debts.\"\n\nNow her husband, a daily labourer, is planning on doing the same.\n\nOn the outskirts of Herat lies Sayshanba Bazaar, a village made up of hundreds of people displaced by years of conflict. Known as \"one-kidney village\", dozens of residents have sold their organs after word spread among destitute families of the money to be made.\n\nFrom one family, five brothers sold a kidney each in the last four years, thinking it would save them from poverty.\n\n\"We are still in debt and as poor as we were before,\" said Mr Ghulam Nebi, showing off his scar.\n\nIn developed nations, donors and recipients usually go on to lead full and normal lives, but their after-surgery health is usually closely monitored - and also dependent on a balanced lifestyle and diet. That luxury is often not available to poor Afghans who sell a kidney and still find themselves trapped in poverty - and sometimes in ill health.\n\nMs Shakila, already a mother of two at 19, underwent the procedure shortly before the Taliban seized power, bypassing a broker by searching out a patient at a Herat hospital. \"We had no choice because of hunger,\" she said.\n\nShe sold her kidney for US$1,500 - most of which went to settle the family's debt.\n\nMother-of three Aziza, meanwhile, is waiting for her opportunity after meeting a hospital staff member who is trying to match her with a donor. \"My children roam on the streets begging,\" she told AFP, tears welling up.\n\n\"If I don't sell my kidney, I will be forced to sell my one-year-old daughter.\"\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nAfghanistan\n\nOrgan donation/Transplants\n\nPoverty\n\nTaliban\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nEnjoy a 512GB upgrade & free data roaming on this 5G plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nUpgrade now.

What will happen to the investment tax credits with the changes?\" he asked.\n\n\"As we consider our own implementation steps, I hope we can adopt a 'wait and see' approach - to consider how other countries are implementing this before tailoring our implementation steps in tandem, rather than pioneer an implementation model ahead of the rest of the world.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMNCs\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet it from $36/mth with StarHub\u2019s SIM Only 5G Star Plan.\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Fold7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/mi_mbs_280222.jpg?VersionId=dGYoYevlYRxpDwPqFucdpX3BuiMkOZay", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

More than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure.\n\nMr Wang urged Washington to work with China in the AsiaPacific to build a \"family of openness, inclusiveness, innovation, growth, connectivity and win-win cooperation\", rather than turn the region into one of conflict and confrontation.\n\nThe Shanghai Communique, a document which marked the end of isolation between both countries and was issued during then US President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China, meant that two major powers with different social systems were willing to coexist peacefully, he said.Mr Wang reiterated a call for the US to stop supporting independence for Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province to be reunified, by force if necessary.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Like others, their immediate focus is on survival.\n\n\"These are patients who cannot receive medical treatment at home, they cannot survive without medication, without medical treatment and medical workers,\" chief surgeon Volodymyr Zhovnir told reporters on Monday (Feb 28).\n\nThe biggest hospital of its kind in the country, Ohmatdyt normally has up to 600 patients, but that number is now around 200, he said during a media visit to the state-run clinic in central Kyiv organised by the government.\n\nIn a surgical ward, surgeons and nurses operated on a 13- year-old boy brought in by an ambulance after being wounded in the armed clashes.\n\nSo far four children have been treated for shrapnel and bullet wounds - victims of shelling in and around Kyiv and skirmishes between Russian and Ukrainian forces.

There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nKyiv is girding for worse battles to come as Russian forces approach, and the entrance to the hospital was guarded by heavily armed police during the media visit.\n\nIn the underground bunker, dozens of children and their parents lay on mats, some in need of additional oxygen and others connected to drips.\n\nPatients in intensive care who cannot be moved have been placed in relatively safe areas of the building. Children slept on chairs in reception areas; along one corridor, gold-coloured Orthodox icons were propped up against a railing.\n\nThe focus is also on the security of medical staff.\n\n\"We also must take care of personnel, because if they die or get injured, what do we do, who will treat patients?\" asked Valery Bovkun, a microsurgeon at Ohmatdyt.\n\nZhovnir, the chief surgeon, said the hospital had stockpiled enough medications for a month, but added that it needed food for newborn babies.\n\n\"Of all things we need peace most ... all of this is the tip an iceberg ... people are, for example, asking me where to buy insulin for children, pharmacies are not open.\" And he worried as much about children who were not able to make it to the hospital as those who were stuck there.\n\nThe hospital normally treats six to seven children a day for common complaints such as appendicitis, but that number has dropped dramatically.\n\n\"They could not have vanished, they simply cannot come here,\" he said.\n\nFollow The Straits Times\u2019 live coverage on the Ukraine crisis here.\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nBabies\n\nRussia\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nOwn your new iPhone from just $36/mth with Star Plan.\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Flip7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

The two had to issue criticism of the Kremlin's move since the invasion started.\n\nMacron, who has yet to make his decision to run for re-election official but is widely expected to, was seen as winning the April 24 runoff against all candidates, and would beat Le Pen by 56.5% to 43.5%, according to the poll of 1,500 respondents.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The US military described its passage as routine but Beijing said it was \"provocative\". The White House on Sunday called on China to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut Beijing has largely steered clear of criticising Moscow after Russian President Vladimir Putin and China's leader Xi Jinping announced an enhanced strategic partnership aimed at countering US influence just weeks before the invasion.\n\nUnder long-standing US policy, Washington has only unofficial relations with Taipei and recognises Beijing diplomatically. However, US law requires it to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and the Biden administration has vowed to continue Trump's and Pompeo's policy of stepping up engagement with the island.\n\nRussia's attack on Ukraine\n\nhas given added impetus to a growing debate about the longstanding and controversial US policy of \"strategic ambiguity\", under which Washington refuses to say explicitly whether it will defend Taiwan militarily in the event of Chinese attack.\n\nSome US lawmakers, including the Democratic chairman of the influential House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, have urged greater clarity about the US \"obligation\" to defend Taiwan amid stepped up Chinese military pressure, but proponents of existing policy say this could worsen the risk of conflict.\n\nChina's ambassador to Washington said in January the two super powers could end up in a military conflict if Washington encourages Taiwan's independence.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nTaiwan\n\nUkraine\n\nChina\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Flip7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nAmidst Currency Volatility, Hedging Matters Now More Than Ever, Especially for Growing Businesses\n\nRead more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

In 2021, the Ukraine transit corridor was mainly used for gas going to Slovakia and then to Austria and Italy.\n\nThere are no sanctions so far imposed on Russia's trade in hydrocarbons, although it is possible Moscow could suspend gas sales to Europe in retaliation for sanctions or the conflict in Ukraine could damage supply routes.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But nuclear and hydropower output is expected to drop in 2022 from 2021.\n\nNuclear availability is falling in Belgium, Britain, France and Germany as plants are facing outages as they age or are decommissioned or phased out.\n\nEurope has been to shift away from coal to meet climate targets but some coal plants have been switched back on since mid-2021 because of surging gas prices.\n\nGermany has said it could extend the life of coal or nuclear plants to cut reliance on Russian gas.\n\nIn past crises, countries have also sought to reduce industrial production at certain times, pay back-up generators to switch on supply, order households to curtail energy use or enforce temporary power cuts.\n\nHas supply to Europe been disrupted before?\n\nThe last 15 years have seen several disputes between Russia and Ukraine over gas, mostly to do with prices paid.\n\nIn 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine for one day. In the winter of 2008/2009, Russian supply disruptions rippled across Europe. Russia cut off supplies to Kyiv in 2014 after Moscow annexed Crimea.\n\nUkraine stopped buying Russian gas in November 2015 and has instead imported gas from EU countries, by reversing the flow in some of its pipelines.\n\nGet live updates as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nOil and gas sector\n\nEnergy\n\nST Explains\n\nRussia\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nBuilt for Apple Intelligence.

It is better to raise it in two tranches than two percentage points in one go,\" said Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance and Trade and Industry.\n\nThe GST hike of 7 per cent to 9 per cent will be implemented in two stages, with one percentage point on Jan 1, 2023, and another one percentage point on Jan 1, 2024, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong had announced in his Budget statement on Feb 18.\n\nOf particular concern among MPs who spoke on the subject on Monday was how the tax increase might affect those in the middle-income group, who typically do not qualify for many support measures and will not get as much help, but could see their spending power eroded as prices of utilities, food and other necessities rise.\n\nMPs said\n\nthe $6.6 billion Assurance Package\n\n- meant to help cushion the increase in GST - may help this \"sandwiched generation\" tide over the transition period, but noted that they would need more help to cope with higher living costs after that.\n\nTheir remarks prompted Mr Wong to assure the House that he would give a full response to their \"relevant, important questions\" during his round-up speech on Wednesday (March 2) after all MPs speak.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He mooted raising the salaries of all front-line workers across the board, including healthcare workers and pre-school teachers, to recognise their contributions to society during the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) said workers should be given more training opportunities so that they can upgrade themselves and go on to jobs with higher wages as they progress in their careers.\n\nHe urged the Government, unions and businesses to work together to come up with the most suitable training models for their sectors, and to find the best trainers.\n\nOther MPs like Ms Jessica Tan (East Coast GRC) suggested tweaks to the criteria for determining a person's eligibility for support schemes.\n\nShe noted that using the annual value of someone's place of residence as a criterion for means testing could result in some people not qualifying for support schemes, such as those living with elderly relatives who need care. She said it would be more accurate to refer to the annual value of property a person owned.\n\nEven as the backbencher MPs acknowledged that tax increases were bound to be unpopular, they agreed that raising the GST was a necessary step to take in the face of growing social and healthcare spending.\n\nMany noted that the tax system has become more progressive over the years\u00a0and said the GST increase, along with the offset packages, will further this leftward shift.\n\nMr Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru) underlined that the Government had taken other steps to raise revenue before deciding to increase the GST rate.\n\nHe cited the recent moves to finance long-term infrastructure investments through borrowing, and to transfer some of the foreign reserves managed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to sovereign wealth fund GIC so as to generate more income from the reserves.\n\nHe also pointed to the wealth taxes, as well as an increase in income taxes for earners in the top income brackets, that were introduced in this year's Budget.\n\n\"All these show that our Government has listened carefully to people from all walks of life, balanced our country's needs with the complex global situation, and came up with practical ways to make Singapore better,\" he said.\n\nNominated MP Hoon Hian Teck, who is dean of Singapore Management University's School of Economics, noted that raising revenue through different tax sources can help balance equity with efficiency.\n\nGiving the example of\n\nraising income taxes,\n\nhe said that beyond a certain point, it could result in people working less, leading to the tax base shrinking.\n\nHence, it makes sense to diversify and raise various taxes, such as consumption taxes and wealth taxes, instead of focusing on only one type of tax.\n\nProfessor Hoon added that it makes sense to raise taxes to pay for recurrent spending, so that the national reserves can be saved for use on a rainy day to manage external shocks, as has been done during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnother MP who shared Prof Hoon's sentiment on striking the right balance was Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang).\n\nHe warned: \"If we push the narrative that the wealthy are responsible for driving inequality, we risk provoking resentment and jealousy\u00a0against those who may have accumulated wealth through hard work and sacrifices. This will only further polarise society.\"\n\nSumming up a sentiment expressed by many of the PAP backbenchers who spoke on Monday, Mr Yip said: \"Our current revenue structure is a balanced one, where ultimately, everyone contributes taxes, but those who are richer contribute more.\"\n\nEven as MPs acknowledged the need to raise revenue, Mr Yip also reminded the House that \"doing more for our people doesn't necessarily mean we should spend more\".\n\n\"Instead, we should challenge ourselves and think hard about what we should spend less on,\" he added.\n\nUrging prudence, he suggested that government agencies can cut down on duplication of work, for instance, better coordinating works like the laying of broadband cables, water pipes and electrical cables that involve the digging up of roads so that everything can be done at one go, instead of having the roads dug up time and again.\n\nMr Yip also noted that there was a mentality that if a ministry has surpluses, it means the ministry did not work hard enough, and said that this should change.\n\n\"Ministries should not feel guilty about having excess money to return to the coffers. In fact, the Government should throw a grand challenge - create an award and recognise ministries that best reduce their expenditure, streamline their operations, and cut out non-essential projects,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nGST\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nSave up to $710 with SIM only 5G Star Plan!\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nDon\u2019t miss $1,500 in savings with your Galaxy Z Flip7 pre-order\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/03/01/ac_marketfruits_010322.jpg?VersionId=W2pfrzZH984aY4JJr8XrFtKOHaJNCqnC", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

Healthy industrial investment sales helped drive up DC rates for industrial use by 2.2 per cent on average, after remaining unchanged for several revisions.\n\nThe growth in DC rates for landed and non-landed residential use has tapered following the latest round of cooling measures, but non-landed use has seen a much smaller rise.\n\nThis round, DC rates are up an average of 4.8 per cent for landed residential use, and up just 0.3 per cent for non-landed use. This compared with a 6.3 per cent increase for landed use and a 10.9 per cent jump for non-landed use in the previous revision.\n\nFor landed residential use, the increase in DC rates in all 118 sectors was between 1 per cent and 10 per cent.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

DC rates at most suburban and city fringe areas remained flat, he added.\n\nRecent notable office transactions included the sale of the PIL Building, One George Street and Robinson 112, he said.\n\nDC rates for hotel/hospital use were cut by 0.7 per cent on average, due in part to a lack of tourist arrivals and reduced occupancy rates.\n\nKnight Frank\u00a0head of research\u00a0Leonard Tay\u00a0also cited a lacklustre outcome of the Marina View government land sales site tender, which included a significant hotel component.\n\nHe noted that 25 sectors out of 118 recorded declines in DC rates, with the largest drop of 10 per cent in the Shenton Way, Straits Boulevard, Marina Boulevard and Raffles Quay area.\n\n\"This was probably due to the Marina View site being awarded at $1.5 billion or $1,379 psf ppr in September 2021 to the one sole bidder who had triggered the site launch,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, DC rates remain unchanged for all the other use groups: place of worship/civic and community institution; open space; agriculture; and roads/railways.\n\nSee more on\n\nURA\n\nProperty market/sector\n\nProperty investments\n\nSingapore property\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nBuilt for Apple Intelligence.

That puts them just 20km from the southernmost point of the so-called line of contact, where about 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers are dug into trenches as they hold off Russian forces pressing from the eastern separatist regions mired in conflict since 2014.\n\nRussian forces remained held up in the north around Chernihiv near the border with Belarus, and around the country's second largest city, Kharkiv, where the Ukrainian defence ministry reported intense shelling on Monday. Attempts to strike into Kyiv and seize the government also have been unsuccessful, with Russian forces still stuck 30km from the capital.\n\nMeanwhile, the round of damaging economic sanctions against Russia, including on the central bank, and increase of arms transfers to Kyiv are taking effect.\n\nThe ruble fell 30 per cent in offshore trading on Monday, while the Bank of Russia imposed some capital controls, blocked foreigners from selling securities and more than doubled interest rates to 20 per cent.\n\nRussia retains overwhelming advantages in the field and its identification on Monday of a safe passage corridor from the capital raised fears a much larger assault may be imminent.\n\nStill, the failure to achieve a quick victory against a determined resistance, together with an unexpectedly unified response from Europe and the US, has led to a growing narrative that Putin miscalculated and is lashing out.\n\nPublic consumption\n\nThe US on Sunday had described Putin's nuclear decision as \"escalatory\".\n\nBritish Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace said the move was \"about distracting the world\" from Russia's setbacks in Ukraine and that it made no change to Russia's actual nuclear posture.\n\nThose changes are usually signals designed for opposing defence and intelligence agencies to pick up, according to Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies at Monterey, in California.\n\nSmall changes of alert happen routinely, Lewis said.\n\nWhat makes the Russian move unusual is that for the first time since the 1970s that signal was made on live TV for public consumption.\n\nThe aim, he said, might be to spook Germany in particular into losing its resolve to confront Russia.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz ordered a sharp increase in defence spending just hours before Putin's TV appearance.\n\n\"I think that helps reveal his motivation: He has made a series of misjudgments, about the Ukrainians and Nato, and the West more broadly in its unity,\" Lewis said. \"My guess is that his goal here is to divide Europe.\"\n\nMoscow's arsenal\n\nRussia has just under 4,500 nuclear warheads, according to the Bulletin of Nuclear Scientists. Of those, 1,588 are deployed with the remainder held in reserve.\n\nThose warheads are carried by 336 land-based nuclear missile launchers, 11 nuclear armed submarines and 137 strategic nuclear aircraft, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank.\n\nThe \"special regime\" the Russian leader talked about probably involves a switch from the peacetime sequence for a nuclear launch to a wartime sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based specialist in Russia's strategic forces and senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research.\n\nThat would reduce requirements for firing nuclear missiles to account for the possibility of a first strike.\n\nSuch a change would be harder for outsiders to see than the physical dispersal of additional nuclear-armed submarines and other measures that would come with a major change in alert status.\n\nFollowing up on the threat wouldn't necessarily mean firing a nuclear missile at a Nato country, Podvig said. Other possibilities include the use of a tactical battlefield nuclear weapon to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nOne cause for concern is Russia's strategic doctrine, which now appears to give wide scope for interpretation as to when it can be used in response to a conventional attack.\n\nEqually, Putin could make a conventional challenge to the western security alliance backed by his nuclear threat, aimed at exposing the conditional nature of its Article 5 commitment to collective defence, according to Francois Heisbourg, a former official in the French foreign and defense ministries.\n\n\"We should be very concerned,\" said Heisbourg, now adviser to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London security think tank.\n\nIf Putin's Ukraine gambit succeeds, he will have Russian forces not just on Nato's shared frontiers with Russia and Belarus, but also Ukraine and potentially Moldova, he said.\n\n\"When was the last time analysts thought that Putin was bluffing? It was five days ago,\" Heisbourg said. \"I don't think he does bluffing. He telegraphs what he wants to do.\"\n\nFollow The Straits Times\u2019 live coverage on the Ukraine crisis here.\n\nSee more on\n\nRussia\n\nUkraine\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nNuclear weapons\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Fold7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nOwn a Coffee Machine for $1* with Nespresso Subscription\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/03/01/yu_putin0301.jpg?VersionId=6hA8hap_jMsmoiodzXKGLVBQtgq_RHAk", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

The corresponding figures for non-owner-occupied properties are $1,400 and $19,200, respectively.\n\n\"Based on my analysis, a centrally located condo in Cairnhill that is being leased out as an investment property needs only to raise rents by 2 per cent to offset the higher property tax rates, while that of a luxury development located in Nassim Road, commanding monthly rentals of almost $20,000 a month, needs only to raise rents by 7 per cent to offset the higher property taxes,\" he said, adding that rents in 2021 for private residential properties are already up 10 per cent.\n\nOn the\n\nnew additional registration fee tier for cars,\n\nhe cited how this will add 6 per cent to 7 per cent to the cost of a Bentley Flying Spur, a luxury saloon, adding that this is not a meaningful wealth tax for buyers willing to fork out close to $1 million for a fast-depreciating asset.\n\nMs Foo said that while the amount raised by wealth taxes may not seem large, property-related taxes such as the ABSD have, in fact, contributed significantly to Singapore's revenue base over the years.\n\nLast year, stamp duty collection increased to $6.45 billion, $2.55 billion more than the previous year, representing a 66 per cent rise.\n\nABSD was also further increased with significant hikes in December 2021 in all categories except for first-time local home buyers, Ms Foo noted. The ABSD rate for foreign buyers now sits at 30 per cent.\n\n\"As ABSD targets mainly property investors, this has effectively become a form of wealth tax, apart from acting as a policy measure to cool the property market,\" she said.\n\nShe added: \"While the Government may not consider this a stable form of revenue base, I think investors should not hold out much hope for the ABSD to be lifted, as it is now a significant part of government revenue.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) said the property tax hike might affect older residents who do not draw an income but live in properties that will see higher taxes.\n\n\"These are properties that they may have bought long ago. Upon retirement, they have no income and are burdened with the ever-increasing cost of living and now have to pay higher property tax as well,\" he said, adding that these are residential homes and not investment properties with rental income that can offset the taxes.\n\nHe asked if the Government would consider assisting this group of residents.\n\nSee more on\n\nProperty market/sector\n\nTaxation\n\nSingapore Parliament", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/mi_buildings_280222.jpg?VersionId=t58k52L.GTQtuBsWR.L.gPHzDrxQZdhO", "alt_text": null}]}

The US and European powers have not taken political decisions on these major issues,\" Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh told a weekly news conference.\n\nFrance's foreign ministry said on Monday that it was urgent to conclude the talks this week.\n\nIran's lead nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani, who flew to Teheran last week for\n\nconsultations about the final draft of the deal,\n\nwill on Monday meet the European Union's Enrique Mora, who coordinates the talks in Vienna.\n\nTwo sources close to the talks in Vienna said that Iran had submitted new demands, while continuing to insist on existing ones, including the removal of a US foreign\n\nterrorist organisation (FTO) designation against Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC).\n\n\"Iran's stance after Bagheri's trip to Teheran has become even more uncompromising .... they now insist on removal of sanctions on the IRGC and want to open issues that had already been agreed,\" one of the sources said.\n\nDiplomats said the negotiations have entered a crucial stage, given Iran's uncompromising policy in the talks and the other parties' involvement in the crisis over Ukraine.\n\n\"It is now or never. If they cannot reach a deal this week, the talks will collapse forever,\" said an Iranian diplomat in Teheran.\n\nThe Guards is a powerful faction in Iran that controls a business empire as well as elite armed forces and intelligence services. Dozens of its commanders have high-ranking positions in hardline President Ebrahim Raisi's government.\n\nThe FTO designation of the Guards by Washington in 2019, which was the first time the United States had formally labelled part of another sovereign government as a terrorist group, has caused further problems for Iran's sanction-hit economy.\n\nAlso Teheran insists the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) drop its claims about Teheran's nuclear work, objecting to an assertion by the UN nuclear watchdog last year that Teheran had failed to fully explain the presence of uranium traces found at several undeclared sites.\n\n\"We have answered the agency's questions. But instead of closing the politically-motivated case, they are using it to gain leverage in the talks,\" said an Iranian official in Teheran.\n\nIran's arch foe Israel has pushed for a tough policy if diplomacy fails to rein in Iran's nuclear work. Teheran has warned of a \"crushing\" response if attacked.\n\nIn reaction to then-US President Donald Trump's reimposition of sanctions after ditching the deal in 2018, Teheran has breached nuclear limits of the pact.\n\nSee more on\n\nIran nuclear deal\n\nUS foreign policy\n\nIran\n\nNuclear weapons", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/hziran280222.jpg?VersionId=Bk45Bi0E4tG8N4LEEM4OKYnF8mV5L38w", "alt_text": null}]}

A salary threshold of $3,500 will be introduced for incoming S Pass holders in the sector.\n\nFor older EP and S Pass applicants, their higher salary cut-offs will be raised in tandem. For renewals, the changes will apply a year later - from September 2023.\n\nMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) welcomed the upward adjustments to the qualifying salaries. \"Theoretically, this means that jobs which previously paid between the old and new salary thresholds - which could have gone to a foreign employee previously - will now have to filled by a local,\" he added.\n\nBut Mr Saktiandi asked if the Government would consider further differentiation of sectors beyond just carving out the financial services sector.\n\n\"Different sectors pay vastly different salary scales, and the point at which they require foreign labour or expertise may vary significantly,\" he added.\n\n\"So having a single uniform qualifying salary may also penalise sectors where Singaporeans are less interested in those jobs, while those employers cannot get pass holders to do the jobs.\"\n\nNon-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai said the planned increase for EP qualifying salary is \"too little to be effective\". Instead, he reiterated an earlier call for a standard monthly levy of $1,200 to be imposed on each EP holder to \"ensure fair competition\".\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang GRC) said Singapore has to find a way to wean itself off the heavy reliance on foreign labour, adding that \"the easy availability of foreign workers has depressed our blue-collar workers' wages and it will continue to do so\".\n\n\"To add, these foreign workers are willing to perform labour-intensive jobs which Singaporeans tend to shun,\" she noted.\n\nNominated MP Janet Ang highlighted that many companies in some sectors, such as construction and food and beverage, have participated in recruitment fairs over the past two years, but they have had little success in getting Singaporeans to fill their vacancies.\n\nShe hopes the Government \"can look in sectorial differentiation when implementing the changes to the foreign worker policies, at least for the foreseeable short to medium term\".\n\nMr Edward Chia (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) also said some employers have shared with him their difficulties in hiring Singaporeans, even when they are eager to do so.\n\nThe local workforce is anticipated to shrink in the coming years, a consequence of the country's ageing population and low birth rates, he pointed out.\n\n\"While I agree that we must provide gainful employment for Singaporeans and strengthen the complementary factor with the foreign workforce, we may soon reach or already have reached a point where there is simply not enough of us.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nForeign workers", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/hzworkers2802222.jpg?VersionId=0TGOQOcQAjF1k63GmcN3Fs02x5pdtLuJ", "alt_text": null}]}

Some may be caregivers who do not have the flexibility to take up full-time work. Others may not be able to stand for eight hours a day, for example in a food and beverage setting for various reasons, including their advanced years,\" he said.\n\n\"For such individuals, full-time work can be gruelling.

Colourful, aromatic herbs, as well as flowers and plants that attract fauna are used to rouse the senses of visitors.\n\nStanding planters and looped pathways make the gardens accessible to all, including wheelchair users and the elderly.\n\nMs Kalthom Latiff, parks director at NParks, said: \"We want Singaporeans to feel that they are connected to nature, to have benefited from being immersed in nature in a way that contributes to their health and well-being, such as helping them to destress.\"\n\nShe added: \"The gardens are very important as an avenue to help people with their mental resilience, especially during this pandemic.\"\n\nNParks said four studies it had conducted with research partners found that urban nature contributes positively to the health and well-being of residents.\n\nThey are among the first few studies in the world to show the impact of gardening on mental resilience and the relative importance of different types of urban nature during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe research was done in collaboration with the Department of Psychological Medicine at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS' Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, and the National University Health System's Mind Science Centre.\n\nRetiree Patrick Prakash, 76, who visited the Bedok Reservoir therapeutic garden on Monday, was pleased with the new amenity.\n\nHe said: \"It's a fantastic idea. You can refocus yourself and it makes you feel good if you have a conscious interest in it.\"\n\nThe two new therapeutic gardens, the first in the east, bring the number of therapeutic gardens in Singapore to nine.\n\nThe first therapeutic garden was set up in HortPark in 2016. Last year,\n\nSingapore's largest therapeutic garden opened at Jurong Lake Gardens.\n\nLast November, NParks also announced\n\nan upcoming wellness garden at East Coast Park,\n\nwhile two other therapeutic gardens are set to open this year in Sembawang Park and West Coast park.\n\nNParks aims to have 30 therapeutic gardens by 2030 as part of Singapore's City in Nature vision.\n\nSee more on\n\nNational Parks Board\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nMental health\n\nParks/Nature reserves", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/nf-park-280222.jpg?VersionId=0ZC.oz9wCEzYRRevP6SVkDmtlAF2B.yQ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/mi_theraupeticgrdns_280222.jpg?VersionId=cxU7XnXNgya4dN3PvVePFApvn.Gv5Fg6", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/mi_physiotherapyarea_280222.jpg?VersionId=caz5W7u9jHfQkhv7Kc5RneYVIK8R36Ci", "alt_text": null}]}

This is a full-scale war that will push our country back decades,\" the letter said, adding that the goal of Russia's invasion was \"extermination\".\n\n\"Russia and Belarus do not have the right not only to hold international competitions on their territory, but also to participate in all ITF team and individual tournaments abroad,\" the letter continued.\n\nIn response, the ITF said it had taken \"swift action\" to cancel all events in Russia indefinitely and that no ITF events would be held in Belarus for 2022.\n\n\"This is a fast-evolving situation; we are in active discussion with the ITF tennis family and the ITF board to decide and align around our next course of action,\" it said.\n\n\"We stand united with the Ukraine and are working with the Ukraine Tennis Federation. Right now, our priority is the safety of the tennis players and the security of all those participating in our events.\"\n\nElina Svitolina earlier said she will donate her prize money from WTA tournaments to Ukraine's military and to help with humanitarian efforts.\n\nThe world No. 15 told Eurosport her family and friends in Ukraine were defending the country and that she wanted to help.\n\n\"Really until the very last moment we did not believe that this war would actually start and then everything just happened at night... Everyone is terrified, everyone is heartbroken,\"she said.\n\n\"My family is there. Lots of my friends who didn't leave the country are there. They're fighting for their life, some of them are fighting for our country. It takes a lot of courage and it's unbelievable that some people took weapons in their hands and went to fight for our land.\n\n\"The most painful thing I would say is I feel completely useless because I want to help them. I want to do something for them. Some of my friends are without electricity, without water, without food. They're really struggling.\"\n\nAny restrictions on individual Russian players, while seen as unlikely, would cast doubt on Medvedev's participation at the next Grand Slam, the French Open in May.\n\nAhead of his coronation as world No. 1 Medvedev took to Twitter on Sunday with a plea for peace.\n\n\"Today I want to speak on behalf of every kid in the world,\"he said. \"They all have dreams, their lives are just starting, so many nice experiences to come...\n\n\"That's why I want to ask for peace in the world, for peace between countries. Kids are born with inner trust in the world, they believe so much in everything, in people, in love, in safety, in justice, in their chances in life.\n\n\"Let's be together and show them that's it true, because every kid shouldn't stop dreaming.\"\n\nMedvedev's fellow Russian Andry Rublev, the world No. 7, wrote \"No War Please\" on the lens of a TV camera on his way to winning the Dubai title last week.\n\nAnother Russian, French Open 2021 finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, called for an end to violence and war in a social media post on Monday.\n\n\u201cPersonal ambitions or political motives cannot justify violence,\u201d the 30-year-old said. \u201cThis takes away the future not only from us, but also from our children. Stop the violence, stop the war.\u201d\n\nRussia calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special operation\" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.\n\nFour leading players from Russia and Belarus are on the entry list for next month's prestigious Indian Wells tournament in California. Women's world No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka and No. 16 Victoria Azarenka represent Belarus, which has been a key staging area for the invasion.\n\nSvitolina, who is competing in Monterrey this week ahead of tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami in the United States, said she had endured a tough time mentally but acknowledged that what people were going through back home was worse.\n\n\"So I decided the prize money from my upcoming tournaments here in Mexico and in the States will go to the Ukrainian Army and to humanitarian needs,\" the 27-year-old said. \"So like this, I can help my country. And this, I think is the right thing to do at the moment.

DBS Bank slipped 3.2 per cent, OCBC Bank fell 1.5 per cent and UOB declined by 2.2 per cent.\n\nForeign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, in an unscheduled ministerial statement in Parliament on Monday, said that Singapore\n\nwill act in concert with like-minded countries to impose appropriate sanctions on Russia,\n\nincluding curbs on certain Russian banks and financial transaction connected to Russia.\n\n\"We must expect that our measures will come at some cost and implications on our businesses, citizens and indeed to Singapore,\" Dr Balakrishnan said.\n\nThe Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Gan Kim Yong,\n\nsaid the crisis will further strain global supply chains,\n\nas Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of commodities such as wheat, and metals like nickel and palladium.\n\n\"Supply disruptions for these commodities will raise prices of goods that use these commodities as intermediate input,\" he said.\n\nThe rare move by Singapore to slap sanctions on a country without a United Nations resolution comes after the United States and the European Union ramped up their measures against Russia.\n\nThey have already\n\nblocked some Russian banks from the international Swift transaction messaging system\n\nand frozen the Russian central bank's reserves held in their jurisdictions.\n\nAnalysts said the Western sanctions are making a bad situation worse.\n\nThe Russian attack on Ukraine has already put into question supplies of commodities from oil to wheat, pushing up energy and food prices worldwide.\n\nThe financial sanctions may raise doubts about the health of banks that are heavily exposed to Russian entities and boost speculation about the stability of the global financial system.\n\nBloomberg quoted unnamed sources saying Singapore's top three banks have stopped issuing letters of credit involving Russian energy deals amid uncertainty over the course of sanctions.\n\nSome European banks such as ING, Rabobank, Credit Suisse and Societe\u00a0Generale and two of China's largest state-owned banks - Industrial and\u00a0Commercial Bank of China and Bank of China - have also announced a halt to commodities trade financing for Russian companies.\n\nSuspension of trade financing in a top commodities and banking hub such as Singapore could further worsen the supply of physical cargoes and push energy prices even higher. Brent, the global benchmark of crude oil, on Monday rose as much as 7 per cent to US$105 a barrel.\n\nA spokesman for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said financial institutions in Singapore are aware of the heightened risks, and are taking appropriate measures to manage any legal, reputational and operational risks arising from the sanctions imposed by various jurisdictions.\n\n\"MAS has sent a circular to all financial institutions (FIs) in Singapore, reminding them to manage any risks associated with the situation in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by major jurisdictions.\n\n\"FIs should also continue to stay vigilant to any suspicious transactions or flow of funds, and apply enhanced customer due diligence in higher-risk situations,\" the MAS said.\n\nWith a total asset size of almost US$2 trillion (S$2.72 trillion), the banking sector here is critical to Singapore's role in financing local and regional growth in trade and infrastructure.\n\nIn response to queries by The Straits Times, Ms Koh Ching Ching, head of group brand and communications at OCBC,\u00a0said:\u00a0\"Our business is predominately in Asia and our international branches serve mostly our network of customers. Our exposure to Russian entities is not significant.\"\n\nDBS and UOB gave similar replies.\n\nA UOB spokesman said:\u00a0\"As a bank focused on South-east Asia, UOB has no direct exposure to Russian banks. We have advised a handful of our clients with trade flows affected by potential sanctions to manage down their exposure accordingly.\"\n\nDBS said the bank will comply with all applicable sanctions.\n\n\"Separately, we have minimal direct exposure to Russia, and consistent with our risk management obligations, have adjusted appetite for transactions consuming Russian exposure limits,\" a DBS spokesman said.\n\nMr Nathanael Lin, partner at law firm Rajah and Tann, said the expansion of US, British and EU sanctions against Russia will add uncertainty to the market, and drive up oil and gas prices.

The increase will bring in about $3.5 billion in revenue annually.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Leong said middle-class Singaporeans would have to bear an \"additional\" GST burden of $1.2 billion per year.\n\nAsked by Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) how he obtained this figure, Mr Leong said the Government has previously stated that 60 per cent of GST collected is derived from top earners and foreigners working in Singapore. The remaining 40 per cent of around $3 billion in revenue then works out to $1.2 billion.\n\nBut he acknowledged, in response to a follow-up question from Mr Saktiandi, that his calculation excluded the offsets that Singaporeans would receive under\n\na $6.6 billion Assurance Package and a beefed-up permanent GST Voucher scheme.\n\n\"I presume that the GST vouchers and all the compensation payment will apply only to the lower-income Singaporeans,\" said Mr Leong. \"There are some applying to the middle income, but the permanent GST Voucher and all that\u2026 only the lower income.\"\n\nUnder the Assurance Package, every adult Singaporean will get cash payouts ranging from $700 to $1,600 over five years, delaying the impact of additional GST expenses for most Singaporean households by at least five years.\n\nThe GST Voucher scheme will see around 950,000 Singaporean households getting additional utilities rebates, among other forms of relief.\n\nMr Saktiandi later stressed in his own speech that without taking into consideration such offsets, Mr Leong's statements on the impact of the GST hike were \"neither fair nor an accurate assessment\".\n\nMr Leong also criticised new property tax increases unveiled at the Budget, saying a significant part of the $380 million increase in revenue annually would be borne by \"many Singaporeans living in private properties who are asset-rich but cash-strapped\".\n\nThe personal income tax increase for top earners would raise \"only\" $170 million of additional revenue per year, he said, adding this was less than the\n\nup to $180 million in annual funding the Government is providing for SPH Media Trust over the next five years.\n\nMr Leong said a monthly $1,200 levy on employment pass holders, which he mooted at the last Budget debate as well as parliamentary debates on foreign talent last year, would raise \"almost $3 billion and make the GST hike unnecessary\".\n\nAs to raising taxes to fund the recurring needs of a rapidly ageing population, he said the authorities \"should first control the escalating costs of healthcare by changing the way our healthcare system works\".\n\nAny forecasted large healthcare cost increases could be paid for using \"$30 billion of unutilised revenues annually\", he added.\n\nHe derived the figure from what he said was the unutilised half of Net Investment Returns\u00a0- some $20 billion - plus $10 billion of land sales proceeds being ploughed into the reserves.\n\nMr Leong also pointed to Mr Wong saying that to manage spending growth, the Government has cut the budgets of all ministries and organs of state by 2 per cent since 2017; with a further 1 per cent cut to be applied from financial year 2023.\n\nThis 3 per cent cut on an estimated $102.4 billion Budget this year will result in \"saving $3 billion\" and again, shows that there is no need for the GST hike, he said.\n\n\"We are also against the 'goodie bag' approach as adopted by the Government to convince Singaporeans to accept the GST hike,\" he said. \"Handing out short-term, ad hoc goodies to Singaporeans instead of using permanent schemes will not produce resilient Singaporeans, but dependent Singaporeans.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nLeong Mun Wai\n\nProgress Singapore Party", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/mi_credit_280222.jpg?VersionId=PsU7m6iKG2GcX5_3yuUkLD.FaREpnrfz", "alt_text": null}]}

The excess heat throws Earth's systems out of whack, driving climate change, symptoms of which include rising temperatures and sea levels, as well as more frequent extreme weather events.\n\nIn climate change discourse, there are two key prongs of climate action.\n\nMitigation refers to efforts to reduce emissions, such as initiatives to boost energy efficiency or switch to renewable energy sources, while adaptation strategies are geared at helping communities cope with impacts. This could include building sea walls to keep out the rising sea levels, or developing drainage infrastructure to prevent flooding from bouts of more intense rain.\n\nBut the latest IPCC report - which involved more than 200 authors from different countries, including Singapore - noted that progress on adaptation is uneven, pointing to increasing gaps between action taken and what is needed to deal with the increasing risks.\n\nThese gaps are largest among lower-income populations, it said.\n\nIPCC chairman Hoesung Lee said the latest report - the second of three major ones that will collectively make up the IPCC's sixth assessment report (AR6) - is a dire warning about the consequences of inaction.\n\nHe said: \"It shows that climate change is a grave and mounting threat to our well-being and a healthy planet. Our actions today will shape how people adapt and nature responds to increasing climate risks.\"\n\nClimate change manifestations\n\nThe IPCC carries out assessment reports, or reviews of the latest research on climate science, every six or seven years on behalf of governments. The first assessment report was published in 1990, while the fifth one was published in 2014.\n\nThe assessment reports comprise updates from three working groups of the IPCC - Working Group 1 synthesises the latest on the basic science of climate change, Working Group 2 looks at how these impacts translate to impacts on societies, while Working Group 3 focuses on actions to reduce the amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nThe Working Group 1 report of the AR6 was released last August and focused on indicators of the problem, such as temperatures and rate of sea-level increase. That report had found, among other things, that climate change is widespread, rapid and intensifying with some impacts, such as sea-level rise, now irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years.\n\nThe latest Working Group 2 report highlights the implications of these indicators on societies.\n\n\"This report recognises the interdependence of climate, biodiversity and people and integrates natural, social and economic sciences more strongly than earlier IPCC assessments,\" said the IPCC's Dr Lee. \"It emphasises the urgency of immediate and more ambitious action to address climate risks. Half-measures are no longer an option.\"\n\nFor example, it found that increasing heat and extreme weather are driving wildlife towards the poles, higher latitudes or deeper ocean waters.\n\nThis has repercussions on food security for many communities. For example, the IPCC noted that many Pacific island countries could see their maximum fish catch potential drop by at least 50 per cent by 2100 compared with the period from 1980 to 2000, even if the world makes drastic cuts in the amount of emissions released.\n\nChanges in temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather have also increased the frequency and spread of diseases in wildlife, agriculture, and people.\n\nIn Asia, the IPCC Working Group 2 said that increased frequency of hazards such as heatwaves, floods or drought could increase vector-borne and water-borne diseases, undernutrition, mental disorders and allergic diseases. Higher temperatures could also drive higher infant mortality in the region, it said.\n\nWater shortages, which already plague half the world's population at some point in a year, could become worse due to erratic rainfall patterns, or extreme events such as floods or droughts.\n\nSuch dry conditions could negatively affect agriculture and energy production from hydroelectric power plants, said the report.\n\nNature as a solution\n\nDespite the dire outlook, the report said mankind can still reduce the magnitude of climate impacts on societies by harnessing nature.\n\nClimate change interacts with other global trends, said the scientists, citing the unsustainable use of natural resources, growing urbanisation, social inequalities, losses and damage from extreme events and a pandemic.\n\nIPCC Working Group 2 co-chairman Hans-Otto Portner said healthy ecosystems are more resilient to climate change and provide life-critical services such as food and clean water.\n\n\"By restoring degraded ecosystems and effectively and equitably conserving 30 to 50 per cent of Earth's land, freshwater and ocean habitats, society can benefit from nature's capacity to absorb and store carbon, and we can accelerate progress towards sustainable development,\" he said.\n\nBut there must be adequate finance and political support to achieve this, he added.\n\nWell-planned cities can also reduce risks of urbanisation and climate change.\n\nIPCC Working Group 2 co-chairman Debra Roberts said cities provide opportunities for climate action in the form of green buildings, reliable supplies of clean water and renewable energy, and sustainable transport systems that connect urban and rural areas.\n\nShe added: \"Our assessment clearly shows that tackling all these different challenges involves everyone - governments, the private sector, civil society - working together to prioritise risk reduction, as well as equity and justice, in decision-making and investment.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nClimate change\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nScience\n\nEnvironmental issues", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/mi_flood_280222.jpg?VersionId=BQVeLV1g71E6hNnuwWsDO9gAma3Upgwv", "alt_text": null}]}

There are now seven countries on WHO's list of regulatory authorities operating at maturity levels 3 for different product scopes.\n\nThey include Ghana and Tanzania for medicine\u00a0and vaccines (non-producing).\n\nIndia, Indonesia, Serbia, Thailand and Vietnam are at this level for vaccines (producing).\n\nApart from ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of medical products, regulatory authorities that function well also perform critical functions such as faster authorisation of products and drug safety monitoring after authorisation, said the WHO.\n\n\"Fewer than 30 per cent of the world's medicines regulatory authorities are considered to have the capacity to perform the functions required to ensure medicines, vaccines and other health products work and do not harm patients,\" it said in the release.\n\n\"For that reason, WHO has intensified efforts to bolster the capacity to regulate medical products in all regions and is working to strengthen regulatory networks where the most advanced regulatory authorities can act as lighthouses for regulators with fewer resources or which have not yet reached maturity.\"\n\nIndeed, this rating requires HSA to publish its assessment reports detailing the safety, efficacy and quality of registered medicine\u00a0and vaccines.\n\nHSA said in its media release that other international regulatory agencies can then leverage its publicly available reports to facilitate their review of these products.\n\nHealth Minister Ong Ye Kung said the rating is a remarkable achievement for HSA.\n\n\"It means that HSA is recognised internationally as one of the most trusted and advanced regulators for medicines, contributing to public health outcomes in Singapore, the region and beyond,\" he said in a HSA release.\n\n\"The Singapore public will now have even greater confidence in HSA's assessments, and that they have access to high quality, safe and effective medicines.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nHealth Sciences Authority\n\nWHO\n\nOng Ye Kung", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/mi_hsa_280222.jpg?VersionId=LCbiwGR6SVMvSKyWl3shS66TTAXL9EaY", "alt_text": null}]}

South-east Asia is among the regions of the world hardest hit by climate change, and is especially at risk of losing settlements and infrastructure to sea-level rise, a major new report published on Monday (Feb 28) has shown.\n\n\"With ongoing global warming, today's children in South and South-east Asia will witness increased losses in coastal settlements and infrastructure due to flooding caused by unavoidable sea-level rise, with very high losses in East Asian cities,\" said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\n\nThe report also concluded that if global warming exceeds 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial times, the impacts of climate change could be more severe, and some will be irreversible.\n\n\"Risks for society will increase, including to infrastructure and low-lying coastal settlements,\" said the IPCC report.\n\nBut limiting global warming to the 1.5 deg C threshold will help the world avoid harsher climate impact, scientists say.\n\nSea-level rise expert Benjamin Horton from the Nanyang Technological University's Earth Observatory of Singapore said the greatest effects of sea-level rise will be felt in Asia, due to the number of people living in the continent's low-lying areas.\n\nFor example, mainland China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia\u00a0and Thailand are home to the most people on land that is projected to be below average annual coastal flood levels by 2050, Professor Horton said.\n\n\"Together, those six nations account for roughly 75 per cent of the 300 million people on land facing the same vulnerability at mid-century,\" he added.\n\nThe IPCC report also found that risks to coastal cities and settlements are projected to increase by \"at least one order of magnitude\" by 2100, if there are no significant plans to deal with the crisis.\n\nSea-level rise is not the only threat confronting South-east Asia.\n\nClimate scientist Winston Chow from the Singapore Management University, one of the authors involved in the IPCC report, said Asean has already been exposed to many climate change-related impacts, such as floods, droughts, urban heat as well as biodiversity and habitat losses.\n\n\"These current impacts are projected to worsen in the future, especially when global surface temperatures exceed the 1.5 deg C threshold,\" said Dr Chow.\n\nThe world has already warmed by 1.1 deg C since pre-industrial times.\n\nAt this level of warming, some climate impacts are already locked in and considered close to irreversible in some natural ecosystems, such as the long-term decline of coral reefs in the South China Sea, said Dr Chow.\n\nHe added that a warmer Earth could mean that parts of Asean dependent on water from glacial melt - such as cities along the upper Mekong - will likely have reduced freshwater resources, due to the loss of ice there.\n\nCrop yield could also be reduced if the world gets warmer, and other climate-driven events such as floods, droughts and tropical cyclones could further affect yield,\" said Dr Chow.\n\nIf cities and countries want to reduce such climate risks, then adaptation is essential to minimise future loss and damages, he added.\n\nAdaptation refers to measures that countries can take to reduce the impacts of climate-driven events on societies, while loss and damage is a term used in climate change discussions that refers to climate impacts that societies are currently suffering which cannot be, or have not been, reduced by adaptation efforts.\n\nFor sea-level rise, for example, adaptation measures could include building sea walls or restoring mangroves, since these ecosystems have tangled root systems that can keep pace with sea-level rise to an extent.\n\nOr to reduce flooding in urban areas, an adaptation strategy could include having land-use planning policies that discourage buildings in areas exposed to floods or cyclones, said Dr Chow.\n\nBut the latest IPCC report - which focuses on the impacts of climate change on human societies - had identified large gaps between adaptation action taken and what is needed to deal with the increasing risks.\n\nThese gaps are largest among lower-income populations, it said.\n\nIn Asia, obstacles to greater climate adaptation include fragmented, reactive governance, lack of finances, and inadequate evidence on which actions to prioritise and how to sequence them, said the IPCC.\n\nDr Chow pointed to how unplanned development still occurs in parts of urban Thailand and the Philippines along its rapidly urbanising coastlines. This increases the risks of loss and damages to vulnerable populations, he said.\n\nDespite the challenges, the IPCC said that early adaptation is crucial to help vulnerable communities cope with climate impacts.\n\nThis is because with every degree of warming, climate change impacts get more severe, while the effectiveness of available adaptation options decreases, it said.\n\nThe focus on adaptation in the latest IPCC report adds to global discussions on the issue.\n\nA report published by the United Nations (UN) Environment Programme in November last year found that while there is an increasing number of plans for climate change adaptation, financing and implementation of these initiatives are still lagging.\n\nThat report also estimated that adaptation costs in developing countries are five to 10 times greater than public funds currently available for the programmes.\n\nAdaptation financing was also\u00a0a key point of contention between countries during the annual UN climate change meetings, with developing nations calling on richer countries to provide more funding to help them implement climate adaptation plans.\n\nBut the IPCC stressed in its latest report that to reduce impacts of climate change on societies, adaptation must go hand in hand with efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the main cause of the crisis.\n\n\"Successful adaptation requires urgent, more ambitious and accelerated action and, at the same time, rapid and deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The quicker and farther emissions fall, the more scope there is for people and nature to adapt,\" said the report.\n\nSee more on\n\nAsean\n\nClimate change\n\nEnvironmental issues\n\nSustainable living/development", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/wgt_msiaflood_280222.jpg?VersionId=Qr1Hj6OPxdJ.dA1Qo.AeKysvhWlq374G", "alt_text": null}]}

They deserve nothing less.\"\n\nIt has been nearly a year since Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, PAP's first assistant secretary-general,\n\nstepped down as leader of the party's 4G team\n\nand designated successor to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\n\nPM Lee had initially hoped to relinquish his current post before he turned 70 on Feb 10 this year, but later said he would stay on to see Singapore through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile he has not yet named his successor, front runners for the post are widely understood to be Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung and Education Minister Chan Chun Sing, who is currently the party's second assistant secretary-general.\n\nIt is up to the entire 4G team to decide who their leader will be.\n\nIn his speech, Mr de Souza noted that Singapore has done well to plan ahead in many policy areas.\n\nBut it has not managed to sort out political succession, he told Parliament during the debate on the national Budget.\n\n\"We must ensure that we have successive generations of leaders to see these policies to fruition.\"\n\nMr de Souza said Singapore's next prime minister does not need to be the smartest person. But it is essential that he is someone who can bring the team together, he added, illustrating his point with an example of how he and his teammates chose their captain for the national hockey team.\n\nWhile there were four or five players who were better players, Mr de Souza said the captain was chosen \"because he could read the game better than any of us, he could gel a team together better than any of us and he understood his opponents and their tactics well\".\n\n\"The point I am making is that you, the 4G, can choose someone who is not necessarily the smartest. But you need to choose someone who is the best fit to bring together the team,\" he added.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that political succession impacts Singapore's standing among foreign investors, said Mr de Souza, who is a lawyer.\n\nHe cited how political predictability is taken into consideration by many clients he works with, including multinational corporations.\n\n\"Time and again, my clients have shared that Singapore's predictable political environment gives them confidence to invest their business, human capital and infrastructure (for the) long term in Singapore,\" he said.\n\n\"Germane to that is their understanding of Singapore's political succession planning - and here I am talking about political succession planning within the PAP.\"\n\nAnd it is also a topic on the minds of backbench MPs, he added, recounting a conversation he had with Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir) on a trip to Morocco in 2019. They had spoken of succession among the 4G leaders.\n\n\"Why, because we like to play political chess games? No,\" Mr de Souza said.\n\n\"The backbenchers discuss these things between themselves because we want to see Singapore succeed.\"\n\nWould the topic have been more appropriate for a political party conference, rather than Parliament? No, because the PAP and its succession planning have been organic to Singapore's success story, he observed.\n\n\"We have solid leadership now but we must, with utmost imperative, line up the future PM and his or her deputies so that they get the longest runway possible before taking over the controls in the cockpit,\" Mr de Souza said.\n\nGetting succession right will demonstrate Singapore's far-sightedness despite the pandemic, he added.\n\n\"We don't need to think variant to variant, day by day, month by month - rather, Singapore plans decade by decade.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nPAP\n\nSingapore politics\n\nPolitics and government", "images": []}

As such, total operating cost crept up by 6.6 per cent to $3.3 billion.\n\nOperating profit ended 72.6 per cent higher at $210 million, giving it an operating margin of 5.9 per cent (from 3.8 per cent previously). Net earnings after tax attributable to shareholders was 114 per cent higher at $130.1 million.\n\nFor the year, the group received $84.6 million in government relief, down from $169.3 million in 2020. But even before factoring in the relief, it posted an operating profit of $125.4 million, from a loss of $47.6 million.\n\nNet earnings per share rose by 113.5 per cent to 6 cents. Net asset value per share stood at 124.9 cents, from 122.15 cents.\n\nNet cash and equivalents stood at $919.1 million, versus $742.8 million the year before. Gross gearing fell to 12.7 per cent, from 18 per cent in 2020.\n\nComfortDelGro chief executive Yang Ban Seng said: \"It has been another challenging year but the high global vaccination rate has helped economic recovery through the easing of social restrictions and the reopening of borders.\n\n\"As a transport operator, we have certainly benefited from the increases in economic activity, but we are not out of the woods yet.\"\n\nThe taxi business improved significantly, going from an operating loss of $64.4 million in 2020 to an operating profit of $18.5 million last year as rental discounts lessened and call bookings increased.\n\nThe group said call bookings were now 90 per cent of 2019 levels of around 80,000 per day.\n\nIts public transport business posted a 5.3 per cent rise in operating profit to $130.7 million as more people returned to work and leisure activities rose.\n\nIts inspection and testing services business benefited from a recovery in non-vehicle testing activity, and posted a 15 per cent rise in operating profit to $30.6 million. Its driving centre division saw operating profit rising 73 per cent to $14.9 million, largely because there were Covid-19-related closures in 2020.\n\nDirectors are recommending a final dividend of 2.1 cents per share. Together with an interim dividend of 2.1 cents, this represents a 70 per cent payout of net profit, versus 50 per cent last year. In 2020, there was no interim dividend, while the final dividend was 1.43 cents.\n\nGroup chairman Lim Jit Poh said the group was still aiming to unlock value of its investments in Australia by looking for investment partners. Its move to float its businesses Down Under was aborted last year on the back of a spate of other listings.\n\nMr Lim added that ComfortDelGro was also now looking at expanding into the logistics arena.\n\n\"We've been moving people. Now we want to move goods,\" he said, adding that this would include attendant activities such as warehousing. \"This is likely to be through acquisitions.\"\n\nLast November, the group entered into a joint venture to start a concrete-transporting business in China.\n\nSee more on\n\nComfortDelGro\n\nTaxis\n\nPublic transport", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/mi_cdg_280222.jpg?VersionId=2dfcnV76IjS0PM776mmhEah0RVJGAer1", "alt_text": null}]}

A 70-year-old man died on Sunday in Kuala Krai, while a 13-year-old boy was found dead on the same day in Kota Bharu.\n\nDatuk Zaki said the boy was believed to have been riding a\u00a0bicycle with his friends when he skidded and fell into a canal at the village.\n\n\"His friends tried to save him but failed and called nearby villagers for help,\" Datuk Zaki was quoted as saying by national news wire Bernama on Monday.\n\n\"The search operation managed to find the victim around 50m\u00a0from where he fell.\"\n\nThe floods have displaced more than 11,000 people in Kelantan and over 8,000 in Terengganu.\n\nThis is the third time Malaysia is facing flash floods in a short span of nearly three months.\n\nIn mid-December 2021, the country\n\nexperienced its heaviest rainfall in the last 100 years,\n\nwhich saw eight of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia hit by floods that lasted for almost three weeks.

However, it is surprising that there is no readiness by the state government as MetMalaysia had issued a weather forecast since early February saying that the weather in Terengganu is not as usual,\" he said in a statement on Monday.\n\nBesides Terengganu and Kelantan, MetMalaysia had also issued a continuous rain warning for areas such as Pahang, Johor, Kedah, Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. It advised residents in flood-prone and low-lying areas to be alert to the instructions of the authorities.\n\nMr Wan Muhamad said: \"We feel that the state government has been reckless in failing to warn the people of Terengganu to prepare. We also question the governance of the state government, which seems not to be serious in dealing with the issue of floods in the state.\"\n\nKelantan resident Ahmad Sahak, 54, told The Straits Times that he is exhausted with\u00a0facing the same problem for years.\n\n\"I'm just so tired of having to go through this every year. When will we (Kelantan and Terengganu) ever find the solution to this problem?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am now already in my 50s.

Inflation also rose, and the additional revenue generated by the higher tax was insufficient to justify the hikes, he added.\n\nWhile Singapore's previous GST increase in 2007 did not trigger a recession, Prof Lim said the economy's 1.1 per cent growth rate in 2008 represented a \"sharp drop\" in activity compared with 7.8 per cent the year before.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore noted then that Singapore's economic growth for 2008 had been impacted by the fallout from the global financial crisis, which spread to the real economy worldwide.\n\nThe global economic environment is less favourable today than it was then, Prof Lim said. He cited the International Monetary Fund's forecast of slowing world GDP growth over the next two years -\u00a0from an anticipated 4.4 per cent this year to 2 per cent in 2023 and 1.6 per cent in 2024.\n\n\"A GST hike is also particularly ill-timed because it holds the potential to stoke already-elevated inflation,\" Prof Lim said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

This could generate $3.45 billion, even if small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are allowed to retain their current effective rate of 3 per cent, said Prof Lim.\n\nHe said additional taxes on wealth, including the Government's proposed changes to property tax, could generate $3.7 billion.\n\nReducing the share of reserve interest income that is returned to Singapore's reserves from the current 50 per cent to 40 per cent could generate $4.31 billion while continuing to grow the reserves, albeit at a slower rate, Prof Lim said.\n\nAlso, increasing taxes on gambling, alcohol, tobacco and carbon emissions could generate $3.65 billion, he added.\n\n\"We can, in fact, choose not to raise GST by adjusting some of the other levers available to us,\" Prof Lim said.\n\n\"One could even mix and match among the proposals to craft a revenue mix we can accept.\"\n\nProf Lim said he cannot support the Budget statement because of its \"stubborn reliance on raising the GST\", but he expressed support for other aspects such as the expansion of the Progressive Wage Model to more sectors and the Small Business Recovery Grant, which is targeted at SMEs and sectors that are hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nGST\n\nJamus Lim", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/03/01/ac_gsthike_010322.jpg?VersionId=UCXXrG5RPdD3eLKgOuHAA.f3PL6OYaic", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

He also said that Mr Huang did not take the cash to the Labor meeting.\n\nMr Unsworth declined to comment to Reuters on the ICAC report.\n\nThe NSW Labor boss, who later went to work for Mr Huang, told ICAC he met with Mr Huang to discuss setting up a meeting with the federal Labor leader, but denied a bag of cash was handed over.\n\nPolitical donations in NSW are capped at A$5,000 (S$4,890) and property developers are prohibited as donors.\n\nThe ICAC report found the US$100,000 donation was corruptly hidden under the names of a dozen fake donors. One fake donor took his own life on the eve of being questioned by ICAC, the report said.\n\nMr Huang's company, Yuhu Group, has previously made large legal donations to both sides of politics in Australia.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has recently sought to run a scare campaign about Labor and Chinese political interference just months out from a federal election due in May, prompting a rare statement from Australia's spy boss that he holds no concerns about Labor's candidates.\n\nVisa cancelled on security grounds\n\nIn 2019, as the ICAC conducted its investigation, Mr Huang's Australian visa was cancelled on security grounds and he was prevented from returning to his Sydney home.\n\nMr Huang, whose legal name is Huang Changran, is a resident of Hong Kong, where he is a member of the election committee, an elite group of 1,500 people that select the city's Chief Executive and nearly half of its legislature.\n\nThe body was enlarged from 1,200 to 1,500 members last year as part of an electoral overhaul to ensure only \"patriots administer Hong Kong\", documents from the city's electoral affairs commission show.\n\nMr Huang lives in a luxury, three-storey semi-detached mansion overlooking the sea on the south side of Hong Kong island.\n\nCorporate records show he is still active in business with a string of Hong Kong companies, including corporate filings from February this year.\n\nAustralia's High Court in December ruled the Australian tax office could seek to freeze Mr Huang's worldwide assets, as it sought to recover A$140 million they claim he owes.\n\nA federal Labor senator, Mr Sam Dastyari, was forced to resign in 2017 after warning Mr Huang that Australian intelligence agencies were monitoring his phone calls.\n\nMr Dastyari told the ICAC inquiry that in hindsight, he had \"serious questions about whether or not Huang was, either directly or indirectly, an agent of influence for the Chinese government\".\n\nThe Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) referred to Mr Huang's role as president of the Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China, a United Front group, when recommending the Australian government cancel his permanent resident visa.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nAustralia\n\nBillionaires/Millionaires\n\nCorruption", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/mi_parliamenthouse_280222.jpg?VersionId=Fk3Y234MENakw5rG6j2JQWZRYx2EJDO7", "alt_text": null}]}

Disruptions to palladium supply would affect the semiconductor industry and consequently the wider technology goods market.\n\n\"We are working with our key companies to review their business continuity plans, to minimise disruptions to their business operations,\" Mr Gan said.\n\n\"We must also be prepared for the follow-on impact on trade and investment flows. A protracted conflict will affect business confidence and weigh on global economies, and impact their recovery from the pandemic,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in Parliament, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan had said that Singapore\n\nwill impose appropriate sanctions and restrictions against Russia,\n\nin concert with like-minded countries.\n\nMr Gan said that the conflict in Ukraine is a stark reminder that as a small country and open economy, Singapore is vulnerable to the vagaries of international developments - military conflict, global inflation and supply disruptions, or other trends such as technology and climate change.\n\n\"It is crucial that we strengthen our defences against such external shocks. To do that, we need to build a vibrant, diversified and resilient economy, as well as forge a cohesive and united society,\" he said.\n\nMr Gan, acknowledging questions on whether the Government could shield Singapore from the impact of these external factors, said that given the Republic's open economy, it would not be possible to totally insulate Singapore from the impact of higher global costs.\n\n\"The Government understands the strain that businesses and households are under, and will do our best to help them,\" he said.\n\nTo this end, it has put in place a multi-pronged strategy to address inflation concerns, including measures to manage various cost drivers such as electricity prices, rental costs, and to support businesses in coping with higher costs.\n\nHouseholds, affected by the rise in inflation, especially from higher utilities and grocery bills, will also receive support to manage higher costs of living, Mr Gan said.\n\nFor example, the Household Support Package introduced in Budget 2022\n\nwill help Housing Board households defray the cost of higher electricity bills.\n\nAll Singaporean households will also receive additional Community Development Council vouchers to help them with their daily expenses, and all below the age of 21 will receive a top-up of $200 to their Child Development Account, Edusave Account, or Post-Secondary Education Account to help them with their education needs.\n\nThis is in addition to the wide range of support measures for seniors and low-income families that the Government has enhanced, Mr Gan noted, adding that households that require extra help can also continue to apply for financial assistance.\n\n\"The Government will monitor this inflation situation carefully, and will not hesitate to provide more help should there be a need to,\" he said.\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay\n\nSkip backward 5 seconds\n\nSkip forward 5 seconds\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time\n\n0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration\n\n-:-\n\nLoaded\n\n:\n\n0%\n\nStream Type\n\nLIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently behind live\n\nLIVE\n\nRemaining Time\n\n-\n\n0:00\n\n1x\n\nPlayback Rate\n\n2x\n\n1.75x\n\n1.5x\n\n1.25x\n\n1x\n\n, selected\n\n0.75x\n\n0.5x\n\nChapters\n\nChapters\n\nDescriptions\n\ndescriptions off\n\n, selected\n\nCaptions\n\ncaptions settings\n\n, opens captions settings dialog\n\ncaptions off\n\n, selected\n\nShare\n\nQuality Levels\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

Declassified documents have shown that the US stored nuclear weapons in Okinawa before it reverted to Japanese control in 1972.\n\nThe issue is particularly sensitive for Mr Kishida, who hails from Hiroshima, and has called nuclear disarmament his life's work.

In the show, Seo's character seduces a rich and powerful chief executive, leading him to be embroiled in a 2 trillion won (S$2.26 billion) divorce lawsuit.\n\nSee more on\n\nCelebrities\n\nSouth Korea\n\nActors\n\nK-drama\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet it from $36/mth with StarHub\u2019s SIM Only 5G Star Plan.\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Flip7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

The rapid growth in their use in recent years and their involvement in fraudulent financing and other violations spurred regulators to close loopholes and tighten supervision of the instruments.\n\nFeb 14 was the deadline for comments on a draft revision of interim measures issued in 1997 covering commercial acceptance bills, which enable supply chain businesses to monetise their receivables. The revisions are expected to have a dramatic impact on commercial banks, financial companies and commercial acceptance bill issuers and intermediaries.\n\nThe new measures stress that commercial acceptance bills should be based on real transaction relations and set the maximum maturity of such bills at six months, down from a year. The draft rules would cap the maximum payment of acceptance bills at 15 per cent of the payer's total assets, and the margin deposit for acceptance bills at 10 per cent of the payer's total deposits at the issuing bank.\n\nCommercial acceptance bills are issued by companies that promise to pay a set amount to the bill's holder on a designated date. The bills are usually used for business-to-business payments but also as a form of short-term trade financing. The payee can choose to hold the bill until maturity and receive payment then, or before the maturity date can transfer it to another party or sell it to a bank at a discount and receive the money in advance.\n\nChina's market for commercial acceptance bills expanded 13 per cent in 2021 from the year before, according to the Shanghai Commercial Paper Exchange. Though detailed data is unavailable, industry participants say a significant share of the market is probably financing bills, which have no underlying transactions between the payer and the payee.\n\nTheir main purpose is for companies to obtain funding from banks. Another significant portion of the market is arbitrage bills, in which banks issue acceptance bills to obtain deposits, industry participants said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

The company then pledges the deposit as collateral to issue an acceptance bill, which it sells to the bank at a discount with an assumed interest rate of 3.5 per cent. The business thus would earn 0.5 of a percentage point of interest, and the bank would increase its deposits.\n\nThe bank can also rediscount the commercial bills to other banks to make a smaller profit. In this way, the funds continue circulating within the interbank system.\n\nSuch practice became rampant in the past decade, peaking between the second half of 2018 and early 2019, several bankers familiar with the industry told Caixin. The Baoshang Bank collapse alerted the central bank to the hidden systemic risks in commercial acceptance bills, according to a bank executive who manages acceptance bill business and who participated in the revision of the rules.\n\nBaoshang, which was 89 per cent owned by private conglomerate Tomorrow Holding, was taken under state custody in 2019 amid severe credit risks. The bank was found to have a financial black hole of 220 billion yuan due to massive misappropriation of funds by its largest shareholder.\n\nThe lender relied heavily on the interbank market, where banks borrow from each other and use the funds to bolster liquidity. Before its collapse, Baoshang had only 200 billion yuan of outstanding loans but nearly 300 billion yuan of transactions with more than 700 partners on the interbank market.\n\nA key channel Baoshang used to increase its deposits was trading in arbitrage acceptance bills. The fall of the bank spread the risk to multiple other lenders that had received Baoshang's discounted acceptance bills, according to the executive in charge of his bank's bill business.\n\nAt the peak of trading in arbitrage acceptance bills in 2018 and 2019, several lenders in northeastern China generated about 60 per cent of their deposits in this way, a senior bill industry participant said. The volume of arbitrage bills has declined in the past two years, but the new rules will have a greater impact on those banks that previously issued large amounts of them, the senior bill industry participant said.\n\nAs of the end of November 2021, commercial acceptance bills accounted for 4.51 per cent of the total assets of domestic banks, far below the 15 per cent limit set by the new rules, according to a research report by Citic Securities.\n\nEleven listed banks currently have acceptance bill balance greater than 10 per cent of total assets. Among them, only China Everbright Bank and China Zheshang Bank are large banks. The rest are medium to small city commercial banks and rural commercial banks. Bank of Zhengzhou, Qilu Bank and Zheshang Bank exceed the 15 per cent threshold, making them subject to rectification under the new rules.\n\nIn terms of the ratio of acceptance bill deposit to total deposits, most listed banks are below the 10 per cent cap, and a handful of banks are at 7 per cent-9 per cent, according to a report by BOC International Securities.\n\nIn addition, the new measures clearly stress that commercial acceptance bills must have actual underlying transactions. The proposed rules would increase the penalties for violations.\n\nWhere financial institutions receive discounted acceptance bills from issuers without actual transactions, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) will be empowered under the revised rules to take regulatory measures such as suspending their bill business or imposing administrative penalties. Directors, senior managers and other persons directly responsible for the violations are to be punished, according to the draft rules.\n\nBanks are expected to strengthen reviews of transactions underlying acceptance bills. For example, some companies with low registered capital and large trade volumes that are unable to provide transport documents and warehouse receipts will find it difficult to pass banks' review, said Zhou Haibin, vice-president at Shanghai Purang Financial Services.\n\nBut many of the arbitrage acceptance bills currently in the market are related to big state-owned companies and big publicly traded enterprises with large amounts of trading business, a senior bill business banker said. It will be difficult for banks to tell whether an acceptance bill is for actual transaction payment or for arbitrage, the banker said.\n\nThe new rules set the maximum maturity of commercial acceptance bills at six months, shortened from the current one-year limit. Many large companies generally use longer-maturity acceptance bills to extend the payment periods, forcing suppliers to delay collections. This hurts the interests of medium and micro-sized creditors, analysts at Sinolink Securities Co. said.\n\nIntermediaries face transition\n\nAnother big impact of the new rules will be on intermediaries and brokers that have played an active role in the commercial acceptance bills market.\n\nThe new measures set out clear requirements for the qualification of bill brokerage institutions. They must be licensed financial institutions with active bill businesses and good reputations, with an independent bill brokerage department and sound internal control and management mechanism, professional employees and brokerage channels, and they must strictly separate bill brokerage from their proprietary bill business.\n\nWhen the Shanghai Commercial Paper Exchange officially launched discounted commercial acceptance bill trading in 2019, only five banks - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, China Zheshang Bank and Bank of Jiangsu - were approved by the central bank as pilot banks to conduct bill brokerage.\n\nThose five brokers are not enough, according to market participants, who said they expect more nonbank financial institutions to apply for bill brokerage licenses.\n\nFor years, many unlicensed brokers have been active in the market. Before electronic bills replaced paper bills, banks were reluctant to accept commercial acceptance bills with smaller values, such as 50,000 yuan or 100,000 yuan, due to higher handling costs. Consequently, bill intermediaries emerged. They collected small-value bills from holders and packaged them into larger amounts of as much as 10 million yuan, then sold them to banks to make commissions.\n\nIn another scenario, when banks needed to reach a deposit goal at the end of a month, they would issue acceptance bills and sell them to intermediaries at a deep discount. The intermediaries would then sell the bills at a higher price.\n\nIn the paper bill era, intermediaries could make money easily. A commercial acceptance bill with a face value of 50 million yuan could bring 8 million yuan of profit for intermediaries, an executive at a supply chain financing platform said.\n\nIn the era of paper bills, intermediaries mainly made money due to information asymmetry. In recent years, with the emergence of bill exchanges and online bill trading platforms, the information has become more transparent, and fewer intermediaries directly deal with discounted bills because of smaller profit margins.\n\nNow many intermediaries have transformed into agents for bill trading platforms. When companies need to buy or sell commercial acceptance bills but don't have the resources to do so on the bill platforms themselves, they entrust intermediaries to do it, a person at a bill platform told Caixin.\n\nProblems in supply chain financing\n\nWhat the new rules don't apply to that also pose great risks are many types of alternative credit certificates that function similarly to commercial acceptance bills.\n\nA noteworthy problem is the rapid development of multi-level circulation of receivables on supply chain financing platforms built by core enterprises in recent years. These large companies issue electronic credit certificates to suppliers, mostly mid-size to small businesses. These certificates don't have a standard form and are generally called credit letters in the market.\n\nThey are basically \"IOU\" notes issued by companies, a senior bill expert told Caixin. For example, if a large company doesn't pay suppliers' receivables but issues credit letters to them, the suppliers then can transfer these notes to the supply chain financing platform built by the large company.\n\n\"Small suppliers have to accept such credit letters,\" said the senior bill expert. \"Otherwise, the large companies wouldn't buy products from them.\"\n\nThere are hundreds if not thousands of such platforms across China that trade electronic credit certificates, the head of a major bill trading platform told Caixin.\n\nAt first such platforms were mostly built by central government-owned large enterprises partnering with state-owned banks. Since 2017, after the State Council encouraged the development of online receivables financing and other supply chain financing modes, more and more local state-owned companies and private businesses have built their own platforms.\n\nThese credit certificates and trading platforms have a positive effect on the real economy by providing financing to enterprises, but their rapid growth enables large enterprises to keep using money they owe to small and medium-sized suppliers. The accumulation of receivables and stagnant capital flow are important problems in the real economy, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, said Xiao Xiaohe, dean of Jiuyin Bills Research Institute of Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics.\n\nAs of October 2019, the outstanding accounts receivable of China's industrial enterprises above a designated size stood at 17.46 trillion yuan, accounting for more than 20 per cent of the enterprises' core business revenue, according to an article published in the state-run journal China Finance by Kong Yan, vice president of the Shanghai Commercial Paper Exchange. The ratio was in line with the record high of the early 1990s, when \"triangle debt\" was rampant, the article said. Triangle debt arises when slow sales result in delayed or partial payments and companies end up owing money to each other and to banks.\n\nDue to the natural defects of receivables, the circulation of such credit certificates not only increases the vulnerability of the financial system but also aggravates the plight of small, medium and micro businesses, Kong said.\n\nSuch credit certificates are essentially illegal financing activities, which should be subject to unified supervision and regulation, a senior bill expert said.\n\nIn September 2020, the central bank and eight ministries jointly issued an opinion stepping up regulatory scrutiny of supply chain financing. The opinion called for preventing various forms of risk in relation to supply chain financing, stipulating that core enterprises can't intentionally withhold receivable funds from upstream and downstream suppliers while using affiliate entities to obtain supply chain financing.\n\nIn December 2021, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council released a notice on cleaning up overdue receivables at medium to small companies, banning central government-owned businesses from issuing commercial acceptance bills and supply chain debt certificates with a maturity more than six months.\n\nThis story was originally published by\n\nCaixin Global.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nFinancial services\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Fold7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nAmidst Currency Volatility, Hedging Matters Now More Than Ever, Especially for Growing Businesses\n\nRead more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

About 49 per cent of PHV drivers polled felt they had no choice but to turn to platform work.\n\nThe flexibility on offer is a major draw for platform workers, with 76 per cent of the drivers citing it as a reason why they became PHV drivers.\n\nBut there exists a paradox for full-time platform workers as they may not be able to afford to enjoy this autonomy.\n\nTo earn a good wage, workers have to slog and \"grind\", said the researchers, citing the example of a delivery rider who earned more than $5,000 a month but had to cycle for more than 12 hours a day almost every day to hit that figure.\n\nBefore the pandemic, flexibility meant being able to earn a bigger income and spend more time with loved ones, said research associate Thian Wen Li. But with Covid-19 and changes to incentive structures, it now means volatility and insecurity.\n\nPlatform workers are also at the mercy of others, from opaque algorithms to changing policies, adding further stress to their physical and mental health.\n\nSo even though 57 per cent of those polled said they could tolerate the pressures of being a PHV driver, only about 40 per cent said they were satisfied with the job, and only 20 per cent said their overall quality of life had improved.\n\nAbout 44 per cent said their health had worsened since they started driving.\n\nPlatform workers lack savings and are financially stressed, the researchers found.\n\nAround 62 per cent of drivers surveyed said they did not have enough money set aside to take care of their personal and family needs for the next three to six months if they stopped working.\n\nAbout 50 per cent did not make any voluntary CPF contributions.\n\nThere is also a possible trend of younger, lesser educated workers shunning conventional jobs as they view platform work as ideal.\n\nThe researchers said: \"Our report does not provide insights into other types of similar work. Arguably the conditions for them may be as, or more, difficult.\n\n\"Nonetheless, the precarity that some of our respondents feel forebodes possible work conditions as more technology is developed to facilitate how people work.\n\n\"It is important at this juncture to consider the type of social protections that are necessary,\" they added.\n\nIn a panel discussion later on Monday, Associate Professor Irene Ng from the National University of Singapore\u2019s department of social work said there may be a need to rethink employment legislation in order to cover the increasing number of platform-based and non-standard work arrangements.\n\nBut Professor Danny Quah, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said changing labour laws may be a blunt instrument.\n\n\u201cFor now, we are trying to see whether a fine-tuned adjustment that focuses on the specific characteristics of platform workers is something that might be better for everyone,\u201d said Prof Quah, who is the vice-chairman of an advisory committee set up to strengthen protections for platform workers.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs we think about the dangers and risks of platform work, we need to constantly compare this with other parts of the employment landscape.\u201d\n\nGojek Singapore\u2019s general manager Lien Choong Luen said: \u201cEven if you don\u2019t believe in any altruism, the fact that (companies)\u00a0have longer-term self-interest means that we need to take care of the (platform workers)... It is not adversarial.\u201d\n\nFive ways to provide support\n\nIn a study of workers who rely on jobs from online platforms such as ride-hailing and food delivery apps, researchers from the Institute of Policy Studies have proposed five interventions to support these platform workers.\n\n\u2022 They suggested mandating, or at least incentivising, private-hire vehicle drivers, delivery riders and platform companies to contribute to the Central Provident Fund. This is to help workers save for their healthcare and retirement needs.\n\n\u2022 The researchers proposed implementing a rest period policy for private-hire car drivers who spend long hours on the road. This would involve nudging drivers to rest after driving for a predetermined time, and encouraging them to lead healthier lifestyles.\n\n\u2022 More assistance should be given to help platform workers pivot to new careers, said the researchers. They gave the example of raising awareness of schemes that help workers find work or reskill.\n\n\u2022 The researchers suggested launching a public campaign to educate potential drivers and riders on the realities of platform work.\n\n\u2022 Finally, Singapore's urban infrastructure could be designed to be friendlier and safer for food delivery riders, they added.\n\nThe researchers said it is crucial to recognise that platform workers are a diverse group. Any intervention must take this into account for it to be successful, they added.\n\nSee more on\n\nRide-hailing apps\n\nFood delivery services\n\nSelf-employment\n\nWorker welfare\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Flip7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nOwn a Coffee Machine for $1* with Nespresso Subscription\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Like many attractions around the world, it has been refreshed during the pandemic, with a new roller coaster called the Steel Taipan that was launched last December.\n\nIf you are a thrill seeker - you know, the sort who takes the same roller coaster multiple times - make a beeline for the two spinning seats at the back of the train. Branded the Tailwhip, these seats rotate 360 degrees and are the first of their kind in the world.\n\nEven on a regular seat, the twisty, looping track will knock the air out of your lungs. But add spinning seats with dizzying inversions and the result is a new high.\n\nI stagger off the Tailwhip - with my knees shaking, and delirious with laughter. The exhilaration I feel is similar to what I experience in bungee jumping and skydiving.\n\nIt is well-worth the A$25 (S$24.50) - on top of the park's entry fee of $96.\n\nGet tickets on Klook\n\nas they cost about $10 more at the gate.\n\nIf you prefer your feet on solid ground, head to the wildlife section where you can pet free-roaming kangaroos and peer at a snoozing wombat. Or grab the chance to cuddle a koala, as Queensland is one of three Australian states where this is allowed.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Perhaps that adds to its magic. A journalist from our group ends the ride teary-eyed.\n\nIt is man-made, cheesy fun but I, too, am moved by the soaring soundtrack and the return of travel.\n\nTravel reopens to fanfare\n\nEverywhere we go, this is the sentiment that greets us: You guys are our first international guests after almost two years, say taxi drivers, retail assistants, staff at attractions - all hopeful that more will come.\n\nOn the flight, Scoot chief executive Campbell Wilson tells me he is \"confident of a strong resurgence in demand\" since Australia introduced quarantine-free international travel for vaccinated travellers last month.\n\nIf demand for Scoot's Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) flights from Singapore to Sydney and Melbourne is anything to go by, there is reason for optimism.\n\nMr Wilson says these flights currently average at about 35 per cent passenger load and hit a high of about 65 per cent over the Christmas and New Year period - a vast improvement from a passenger load of about 10 per cent when the pandemic was at its worst.\n\nBesides Scoot, Singapore Airlines and Qantas also run VTL flights to the two cities.\n\nFood and beverage tour operator Kiff & Culture, launched in June last year, is also awaiting the return of tourists.\n\nCo-founder Drew Campbell, 30, was born in Cape Town, South Africa, and has been running Kiff Kombi Tours there since 2016.\n\nAfter shuttling between both countries, he moved back to Australia last year and launched Kiff & Culture with Australian Alex Baker, whom he went to school with near Brisbane, about an hour's drive from Gold Coast. The duo wanted to introduce a similar concept to Australia.\n\nMr Baker, 29, who has lived in India and the Solomon Islands, says: \"When we are abroad, we always want to do what the locals do. We want to showcase this in the scenic regions around where we live.\"\n\nOur\n\nEat & Drink the Gold Coast Experience\n\n(from $203.59) lives up to that promise, whisking us away from the main tourist drag along Surfers Paradise - which Mr Baker admits he visits only \"two or three times a year\" - into the suburb of Burleigh Heads.\n\nThere, we tuck into a seven-course meal at modern Asian restaurant Rick Shores, which boasts floor-to-ceiling windows framing the turquoise surf like a painting.\n\nThe food, too, is no slouch. Moreton bay bug rolls - made with a crustacean similar to crayfish - are crisp and fresh. And everyone at the table marvels at the tenderness of the duck in red curry. We mop up every spicy, hearty drop with rice and smoky-charred roti.\n\nEven on a weekday afternoon, the restaurant is bustling, and so is the beach outside. Surfers trot out into the waves, dogs gambol, sunbathers lounge.\n\nThis is exactly the sort of idyll that has lured Sydneysiders and Melbournites out of the city and to Gold Coast since remote work took hold during the pandemic. New bars and restaurants in the surrounding suburbs sprang up to accommodate.\n\nPeople wanted the Gold Coast lifestyle, says Mr Baker.\n\nIt is good news for the company, whose main clientele has been corporate bookings from Queenslanders so far. \"If we can sell this product to locals, we can definitely appeal to domestic and international travellers,\" he adds.\n\nAnother Burleigh Heads icon is Granddad Jack's Craft Distillery, run by the third- and fourth-generation families of the eponymous Granddad Jack, whose real name was David Goulding.\n\nHis grandson and founder David Ridden, 49, welcomes us with a gin and tonic before launching into the distillery's origin story - how he created it in 2018 to pay homage to his whiskey-swigging grandfather's hard-knock life.\n\nMr Ridden's humour is self-deprecating (\"We have to give you a drink because nobody can listen to me talk for 45 minutes while sober\"), but his tales are captivating.\n\nTwo Pencils Gin, a London dry gin, is named for how Granddad Jack, as a boy, would snap pencils in half and resell them at the horse races to earn some extra cash for the family. And 65 MilesGin, a navy-strength gin at 57 per cent alcohol by volume, is inspired by the distance he used to cycle every weekend as a teenager to work on a sheep farm.\n\nThe gins are delicious, and is there any higher honour than to be remembered in spirits and stories?\n\nMore stories abound at Home of the Arts (Hota), a cultural precinct housing art exhibitions, a cinema and an outdoor performance stage. Its latest addition, the Hota Gallery, opened last May.\n\nThe multi-coloured building is eclectic both inside and out. A summer exhibition called Art Mixtape showcases paintings, sculptures, photos and videos by iconic Australian artists.\n\nNo highfalutin artwork here - the vibe is playful and unfussy. A piece by Michael Lindeman, whose work often contains wry institutional critique, depicts the word cheese in large cartoon letters and surrounds it with mouse traps.\n\n\"Is the whole thing a little cheesy? Or is it a well-placed dig at the ridiculous, often too serious side of contemporary art?\" reads the description.\n\nAdmission is free and The Exhibitionist Bar on the rooftop offers a lovely view of the city. Make a reservation and come at sunset.\n\nClassic experiences\n\nIt would be remiss not to go surfing in a place named Surfers Paradise. Our instructor from Get Wet Surf School shows us the ropes on dry land, then takes us out to The Spit, a popular stretch of beach.\n\nThis crashing surf is worlds apart from the gentle lapping of waves at East Coast Park. Needless to say, I wipe out repeatedly. But countless bruises, abrasions and mouthfuls of water later, and after I finally wobble to my feet and coast to shore, I am hooked.\n\nNever mind my battered limbs or the fact I will wake up sore the next day. I spend the rest of\n\nthe two-hour sessio\n\nn ($59.35) heading back into the surf, struggling to find the sweet spot of balance, chasing the high that comes when I succeed.\n\nJet boating\n\n(from $57.19) is thrilling too and far less strenuous.\n\nWe zip along the coastline, with our skipper alternating between pointing out million-dollar houses and performing sharp turns and high-speed drifting. Despite our ponchos, we emerge soaked to the bone.\n\nAnd it is a treat to\n\nsail in a hot-air balloon\n\n($241.40) over the Gold Coast hinterland, watching the sunrise light up Mount Tamborine and illuminate herds of sheep and cattle below.\n\nAs this is the height of touristy experiences, I am surprised to find no shortage of locals along for the ride. We share a basket with a group of women celebrating their friend's 60th birthday and a couple who drove an hour from Brisbane to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary.\n\nThey are rediscovering their country, just like Singaporeans have been doing for the past two years.\n\nAnd after being home-bound all this while, there is a delicious thrill that comes with bagging deals and brands available abroad.\n\nBudget half a day at outlet mall Harbour Town Gold Coast for some serious shopping. Look for deals on Australian brands such as Lorna Jane (athleisure), Aesop (skincare) and Bonds (intimates).\n\nIf you have deeper pockets, the more upscale Pacific Fair carries both casual and luxury labels. It is also home to a vast selection of food and beverage joints such as Australian chain Betty's Burgers. And bored companions can take a snooze on plush deck chairs sitting by a man-made river.\n\nIt has become trendy to buy experiences, not things. But since travel trends point to longer and less frequent trips these days, my shopping and souvenir haul will take me back under blue Australian skies until I am there once more.\n\n* This trip was sponsored by Klook, Tourism and Events Queensland and Destination Gold Coast.\n\n* Prices are correct as at Feb 28.\n\nSee more on\n\nTravel and leisure\n\nTravel planning\n\nTravelogue\n\nVaccinated Travel Lane/VTL\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Flip7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nCurrency Volatility is Rising: Find Out How to Safeguard Your Business\n\nRead more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Supply chain disruptions are having an outsized impact on people's purses. There's real concern on the ground that the announcement to raise the GST will lead to price rises across the board,\" he added.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Even as there remains scope for wealth taxes, the values of entrepreneurship and equitable reward for hard work can nonetheless be recognised and even promoted through tax rebates or relief for such individuals,\" he explained.\n\n\"However, wealth accumulated through capital appreciation should be dealt with differently and taxed accordingly in the name of a fairer and more inclusive society.\"\n\nMr Singh also reiterated suggestions on\n\nraising revenue made by the WP\n\nsince as far back as in 2018, such as by including a portion of land sales into recurrent revenue, and adjusting the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) framework to allow for recurrent spending to be raised to 60 per cent from the current 50 per cent.\n\nThe NIRC is the largest single source of government revenue. Under its framework, the Government can spend up to half of the long-term expected investment returns generated by Temasek, sovereign wealth fund GIC and the Monetary Authority of Singapore - the three entities tasked to invest Singapore's reserves.\n\n\"Our healthcare needs will likely be on an upward trajectory. For the very Singaporeans whose energies contributed to the reserves\u2026 spending for them in their golden years and at their time of need should not even be a question,\" said Mr Singh.\n\nNotwithstanding the WP's disagreement with the GST hike, the party secretary-general said he welcomed the formation of a Committee Against Profiteering to address concerns that businesses could use GST as a cover to raise prices.\n\nCommittee chair and Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth as well as Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling had invited Mr Singh to nominate an opposition member to sit on the panel, and the Progress Singapore Party's Non-Constituency MP Hazel Poa has taken up the role, Mr Singh revealed.\n\nIn his half-hour speech to open an annual marathon debate, he suggested that new Budget measures such as\n\nthe Small Business Recovery Grant\n\n- for those hardest hit by Covid-19 - be expanded to also consider, on a more flexible and case-by-case basis, appeals from businesses that fall outside the eligibility criteria.\n\nMr Singh also urged the Government to move more decisively on the new Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, under which employers who raise the pay of their local lower-wage workers over the next five years will receive co-funding.\n\nThe Government will\n\nco-fund 50 per cent of pay increases made this year and next year,\n\n30 per cent of pay increases in 2024 and 2025, and finally, 15 per cent of pay increases in 2026.\n\nMr Singh called on Mr Wong to ensure that Singaporean workers who take home less than $1,300 can rely on the scheme to raise their wages immediately, \"as they already earn very low salaries\".\n\nHe then proposed that the Government remove the newly announced criterion for workers to earn at least $500 a month to qualify for the Workfare Income Supplement scheme - which tops up their incomes and Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings.\n\nWhile designed to encourage part-timers and casual workers to take up regular, full-time work, this will penalise those with legitimate reasons for not doing so - and they are often the most financially vulnerable workers, said Mr Singh.\n\nHe also made a series of calls for the Government to reveal more data and details - including in its revenue and expenditure projections for the rest of the decade; how it intends to refine the assessment of employment pass applications; and the revenue quantum the increased carbon tax is projected to bring in up to 2030, among others.\n\nOn a larger level, the Government should \"review how it reports on initiatives that were previously announced and whether they met their goals\", said Mr Singh.\n\n\"The new social compact ought to require a report card that goes into far greater detail than the bi-yearly Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review,\" he added, pointing to Singapore's Industry Transformation Maps and its Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan as examples where more precise information should be made accessible.\n\n\"The outcomes of such initiatives should be a major feature of the new post-pandemic social compact that the Budget seeks to renew between citizens and the Government,\" said Mr Singh.\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay\n\nSkip backward 5 seconds\n\nSkip forward 5 seconds\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time\n\n0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration\n\n-:-\n\nLoaded\n\n:\n\n0.00%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type\n\nLIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently behind live\n\nLIVE\n\nRemaining Time\n\n-\n\n-:-\n\n1x\n\nPlayback Rate\n\n2x\n\n1.75x\n\n1.5x\n\n1.25x\n\n1x\n\n, selected\n\n0.75x\n\n0.5x\n\nChapters\n\nChapters\n\nDescriptions\n\ndescriptions off\n\n, selected\n\nCaptions\n\ncaptions settings\n\n, opens captions settings dialog\n\ncaptions off\n\n, selected\n\nShare\n\nQuality Levels\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nThis video is either unavailable or not supported in this browser\n\nError Code:\n\nMEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED\n\nTechnical details\n        :\n\nNo compatible source was found for this media.\n\nSession ID:\n\n2025-07-15:6b2161f5d3187b0eb68df21c\n\nPlayer Element ID:\n\nvjs_video_3\n\nOK\n\nClose Modal Dialog\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

Two trips involved Teva Raj being picked up from his office in 1 Cluny Road.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Soon Sin took over HEHC's works for a period of three months.\n\nTeva Raj also instructed NParks staff not to issue any notice of infringements to HEHC, as this would cause disruption to the works.\n\nTeva Raj's lawyer, Mr Bernard Sahagar, told the court that NParks had become his client's \"family and passion\". Teva Raj started working there in 1980.\n\nHe argued that Mr Ong and Teva Raj were close friends and, in retrospect, Teva Raj should have been more careful with his interactions.\n\nMr Ong told Teva Raj he made frequent trips to Malaysia and Teva Raj asked if he could go with him, said Mr Sahagar.

All of us are paying the price.\n\nThe cascading crises of recent years have highlighted how women's leadership is more crucial than ever. Women have heroically confronted the Covid-19 pandemic as doctors, nurses, and public health and social care workers.\n\nBut at the same time, women and girls have been the first to lose out on jobs or schooling, taking on more unpaid care work, and facing skyrocketing levels of domestic and cyber abuse and child marriage.\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted even more starkly an age-old truth: the roots of patriarchy run deep. We still live in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture. As a result, in good times or bad, women are more likely to fall into poverty. Their healthcare is sacrificed and their education and opportunities are curtailed.\n\nAs we look to the future, a sustainable and equal recovery for all is only possible if it is a feminist recovery - one that puts progress for girls and women at its centre.\n\nWe need economic progress through targeted investments in women's education, employment, training and decent work. Women should be first in line for the 400 million jobs we are called to create by 2030. We need social progress through investments in social protection systems and the care economy. Such investments yield huge dividends, creating green, sustainable jobs, while supporting members of our societies that need assistance, including children, older people and the sick.\n\nWe need financial progress, to reform a morally bankrupt global financial system, so all countries can invest in a woman-centred economic recovery. This includes debt relief and fairer tax systems that channel some of the massive pockets of wealth around the world to those who need it most.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Developed countries must urgently deliver on their commitments on finance and technical support for a just transition from fossil fuels. The successful, stable economies of the future will be green, gender-inclusive and sustainable.\n\nWe need more women in leadership in government and business, including finance ministers and CEOs, developing and implementing green and socially progressive policies that benefit all their people. We know, for example, that having more women in parliaments is linked with stronger climate commitments and higher levels of investment in healthcare and education.\n\nWe need political progress through targeted measures that ensure women's equal leadership and representation at all levels of political decision-making, through bold gender quotas.\n\nGender inequality is essentially a question of power. Uprooting centuries of patriarchy demands that power is equally shared across every institution, at every level.\n\nAt the United Nations, we have achieved - for the first time in the organisation's history - gender parity in senior management at headquarters and around the world. This has dramatically improved our ability to better reflect and represent the communities we serve.\n\nEvery step of the way, we can take inspiration from women and girls pushing for progress in every sphere and every corner of our globe. Young women climate campaigners are leading global efforts to pressure governments to live up to their commitments.\n\nWomen's rights activists are bravely demanding equality and justice, and building more peaceful societies as peacekeepers, peacemakers and humanitarians in some of the world's trouble zones and beyond.\n\nIn societies where women's rights movements are vibrant, democracies are stronger. When the world invests in expanding opportunities for women and girls, all of humanity wins. As a matter of justice, equality, morality and plain common sense, we need to turn the clock forward on women's rights.\n\nWe need a sustainable, feminist recovery centred around - and driven by - women and girls.\n\nThe writer is secretary-general of the United Nations.

Further reopening the economy will also increase the spending capacity of hundreds of thousands of people returning to their jobs, he added.\n\nOn Feb 27, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases approved placing Metro Manila and nearby provinces, which account for about two-thirds of the country's economy, under alert level 1 effective March 1 as indicators showed that the worst was over for the Omicron-fueled surge noted in late December to January.\n\nUnder alert level 1, all establishments can operate at full capacity, workers can physically go to their offices, and activities and events can be conducted at full-seating capacity even for indoor venues, provided that minimum health standards are followed. This is what the government has described as the \"new normal.\"\n\nAs many areas move to alert level 1, however, there are a number of risks that need to be addressed to prevent another spike in Covid-19 cases which could again trigger debilitating lockdowns.\n\nOf particular concern is the enforcement of health protocols during campaign sorties in the run-up to the May 9 national elections. The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) was reluctant to support the move to alert level 1 due to the risks of another virus surge from election activities, especially with the start of the campaign season for local elective posts on March 25.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya also noted that once the campaign period for local candidates starts, \"it will be much more difficult to enforce the minimum public health standards.\"\n\nThen there's the issue of the inadequacy of public transport when employees return to their workplaces as more business establishments reopen. Ecop's Ortiz-Luis noted that the virus was being spread more by workers going to and from the workplace, than within the workplace itself.\n\nIt is thus incumbent upon businesses to provide a risk-free working environment while ensuring the safe movement of their employees by providing a shuttle service whenever possible. Employers and owners of commercial establishments should strictly enforce compliance with required public health protocols (particularly the wearing of masks, physical distancing, the washing of hands, and avoiding mass gatherings), and actively promote vaccination among their staff and personnel, as well as booster shots for those fully vaccinated.\n\nAs part of the post-pandemic \"new normal,\" employers must consider work-from-anywhere or hybrid work arrangements that would bring higher efficiency and productivity.\n\nThe government, for its part, has the more difficult task of making sure that downgrading to alert level 1 will be safe and sustainable. Political rallies and campaigns must be monitored and sanctions imposed on candidates and their supporters who fail to comply with public health standards. To avoid overcrowding in terminals and inside public utility vehicles, more buses and other for-hire transport should be allowed to ply the streets.\n\nThe Department of Transport and Communications should also put in place an efficient, safe, and reliable public transport system for workers of small companies unable to afford a shuttle service.\n\nMeanwhile, local government units must comply with two new conditions before they can be moved to the lowest alert level: at least 80 per cent of their senior citizens should be fully vaccinated, as should 70 per cent of the eligible population in their communities.\n\nAt the end of the day, sustaining the new normal will require everyone's cooperation and vigilance. Far from being the responsibility only of the government and the private sector, the entire community must do its part to keep the virus under control. We can start with strict compliance with the basic health protocols that have been proven to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nIndividual efforts add up and ensure that people's health remains firmly within their grasp. This is our only assurance that the new normal will be sustainable and last long enough to bring about economic recovery after two difficult years under a pandemic.\n\nThe Philippine Daily Inquirer is a member of The Straits Times media partner Asia News Network, an alliance of 23 news media entities.\n\nSee more on\n\nEditorial Notes\n\nCovid-19\n\nPhilippines\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Flip7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nBuilt for Apple Intelligence.

They are unranked in all the women's categories.\n\nKoh said the BAS will work with different agencies such as Sport Singapore, Singapore Sports Hub, Ministry of Education and People's Association to roll out more 3x3 tournaments \"using different venues and platforms\" to popularise the sport among youth, which would allow it to build a larger pool of talent.\n\nThere are also plans to send the national teams to compete in more tournaments. For example, the men's and women's teams are currently playing friendlies in Malaysia to prepare for the Fiba 3x3 Asia Cup, as well as to beef up their case to participate in the May 12-23 SEA Games.\n\nNational player Delvin Goh is itching for some competitive action as the Asean Basketball League has been suspended since the pandemic.\n\nThe Singapore Slingers forward said: \"Our playing careers are not that long, and we have wasted too much time without being able to compete, so we are craving for competitions like these and having the fans with us and enjoying an intense game together.\n\n\"People should find 3x3 familiar as most of us started playing this way on the streets and the neighbourhood courts. It is a fast-paced and action-packed game, which will definitely attract fans and eventually bring up the level of basketball in Singapore as we learn from Asia's best.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore sports\n\nOlympics\n\nSport Singapore\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Flip7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nCurrency Volatility is Rising: Find Out How to Safeguard Your Business\n\nRead more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

It's really difficult to describe. I feel like the world is coming to an end because how can something like this happen?\"\n\nShe has three children, aged seven, five and three, and has tried to explain to her two older children about the war, while shielding them from the gruesome details about it.\n\nMr Mahesh Rai, her 38-year-old Singaporean husband, who is also a lawyer, has been supporting her through this crisis.

The company also has a growing position in data centres, where its powerful processors help run artificial intelligence software.\n\nThe company, valued at more than US$600 billion (S$816 billion), has its main offices in Santa Clara, California, a short distance from the headquarters of other US chip companies, including Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nGovernments and companies around the world are on the lookout for online attacks following Russia's invasion of the Ukraine.

which is absolutely necessary to take something from impossible to possible\".\n\n\"That may have been one of the greatest moments of my career just now, because my name was called for King Richard sitting next to Venus Williams,\" said Smith, who is the favourite to win his first Oscar in March.\n\nJessica Chastain won best actress for The Eyes Of Tammy Faye, in which she disappeared beneath layers of the eccentric American televangelist's trademark heavy makeup.\n\nWhile her husband Jim Bakker was jailed for defrauding their millions of followers, Faye clashed with fellow evangelists over her acceptance of the LGBTQ community at the height of the Aids epidemic.\n\n\"It was a dream of mine to play Tammy Faye,\" said Chastain.\n\n\"She was a real trailblazer and she wrapped her arms around those who were repeatedly cast aside and she launched herself into decades of LGBTQ love.\"\n\nAriana DeBose bolstered her Oscar frontrunner status by claiming best supporting actress for her role as Anita in director Steven Spielberg's West Side Story remake.\n\nPresumed Oscars best picture frontrunners The Power Of The Dog and Belfast both left the SAG gala empty-handed, blowing the race to the season-capping Academy Awards on March 27 wide open.\n\n'Fighting the fight'\n\nIn the television categories, Squid Game actors Lee Jung-jae and Jung Ho-yeon looked visibly shocked to win best actor and actress in a drama.\n\nBoth South Koreans spoke through a translator before Jung, who played a North Korean defector, switched into English, thanking the Hollywood group for \"open(ing) the door for me\".\n\nLee played a laid-off worker and obsessive gambler.\n\nSquid Game also won the outstanding action performance by a stunt ensemble in a comedy or drama series.\n\nSuccession won the best drama ensemble prize, with star Brian Cox one of many to praise Ukrainian president and former actor Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nCox drew a standing ovation for \"a wonderful comic performer\" as his country resists the \"truly, truly awful\" Russian invasion.\n\nMichael Keaton, who won best actor in a limited series for Dopesick, also praised \"a fellow actor in Zelensky who deserves some credit tonight for fighting the fight\".\n\nKeaton broke down into tears as he dedicated the win to his nephew Michael, one of more than half a million Americans to die of an overdose deaths in the opioid crisis that is the subject of Dopesick.\n\nCapping an excellent night for Apple TV+, the relatively new streamer also won best comedy series prizes for \"Ted Lasso\" and its star Jason Sudeikis.\n\nThe SAG awards - which took place online last year due to Covid-19 - returned to an in-person event on Sunday in Santa Monica, just outside Los Angeles.\n\nAnd the stars did not disappoint on the first big red carpet event of Hollywood's awards season, with Australian actress Cate Blanchett stunning in a low-cut black Armani gown, and Chastain donning a sparkling Dior suit.\n\nEnglish actress Helen Mirren - in a floor-length pink Dolce & Gabbana gown - was honoured with SAG's lifetime achievement award, chalking her Oscar-winning career up to a mantra of \"be on time and don't be an ass\".\n\n\"Thank you S-A-G,\" she said, spelling out each letter, before joking: \"I hate to say the word 'sag' at my age.\"\n\nThe annual In Memoriam montage paid tribute to actors who have died in the past year, including Sidney Poitier, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Ned Beatty and Betty White.\n\nSee more on\n\nAwards and prizes\n\nMovies\n\nTV series\n\nActors\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Flip7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nEnjoy all-inclusive 5Gbps Broadband with WiFi 7 router & more\n\nSign Up\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

The past decade has seen multiple contemporary projects by prominent architects, which have revitalised the city's urban landscape with innovative form and design.\n\nFor a country that is grappling with immigration and national identity issues, the surging cost of living, drug crimes and rise of the far right - apart from the pandemic in the last few years - in some ways, Marseille offers a small peek into French urban society today.\n\nMarseille's ambition is reflected in its contemporary architectural gems while the dynamism of its diverse population bears witness to the hope that perhaps the city, imperfections and all, may one day stand as the vision of French multiculturalism.\n\n1. Musee des civilisations de l'Europe et de la Mediterranee (Mucem)\n\nUnveiled in 2013 when Marseille was designated European Capital of Culture, Mucem aims to celebrate Mediterranean cultures and history.\n\nFrench architects Rudy Ricciotti and Roland Carta's vision of a modern kasbah complete with concrete latticework offers breathtaking views of the port, the sea and Fort Saint-Jean, linked to Mucem by a black reinforced concrete bridge.\n\n2. Villa Mediterranee\n\nFor Villa Mediterranee, Milanese architect Stefano Boeri looked to a sleek aesthetic, free from distracting exterior details, befitting an archive and research centre dedicated to all things Mediterranean.\n\nSitting along the seafront next to Mucem, the structure with a dramatic overhang features an exhibition gallery, an ornamental pool and an underwater conference centre, reinforcing the fact that the sea is central to coastal communities in the Mediterranean.\n\n3. Stade Velodrome\n\nFootball fans need no introduction to OM, Marseille's famed football club. Stade Velodrome, home to OM, is also the second-largest football stadium in France with a capacity of more than 67,000.\n\nIn 2014, French architecture firm SCAU added a milky, sculptural stretched Teflon-coated fibreglass canvas roof to the stadium that is as functional as it is sleek - low maintenance, resistant to rain and the strong, cold Mistral that blows across southern France - providing sun protection and optimising acoustics.\n\n4. La Friche la Belle de Mai (La Friche)\n\nA trendy cultural and urban arts complex repurposed from a 19th-century former tobacco factory over a 12-year period, the architectural highlight at La Friche is the Panorama, a cantilevered white block of a contemporary art space designed by ARM Architecture and opened in 2013, perched precariously on the roof.\n\nThe renovated 8,000 sq m multipurpose rooftop terrace, boasting breathtaking views of Marseille, comes alive especially in the summer with concerts and outdoor cinema screenings.\n\n5. Fonds regionaux d'art contemporain Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (Frac Paca)\n\nJapanese architect Kengo Kuma's take on Frac Paca, Marseille's contemporary art centre in the La Joliette district, plays on negative space and light through its distinctive chequered glass facade. The building aims to connect the museum to Marseille and its people, referencing the city's alleys and plazas, bringing to life novelist Andre Malraux's vision of a museum without walls.\n\n6. Tour CMA CGM\n\nDesigned by the late Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid for Marseille-headquartered shipping giant CMA CGM, the 147m-tall building towers over the city and the commercial port.\n\nIts understated curved facade, with gently converging then diverging fluid lines, has segments differentiated by dark glazing, which not only provides a solar screen, but also allows natural light to filter in without excessive glare.\n\n7. La Marseillaise\n\nWalking distance to the Tour CMA CGM, the latest addition to the Marseille skyline is Pritzker Prize-winning French architect Jean Nouvel's striking gradient blue-white-red-hued office tower, appropriately named La Marseillaise and incorporating eco-friendly features such as a revolutionary air-conditioning system and sustainable materials.\n\nContrary to what most people might think, the colours are chosen not for the French flag, but for Marseille - blue for the sky (and even OM), white for the Calanques and red for the rooftops of the Le Panier district.\n\n8. Vieux Port Pavilion\n\nAt Marseille's Vieux Port (Old Port), you cannot miss the futuristic pavilion conceived by British multidisciplinary practice Foster + Partners.\n\nWhile its canopy of polished steel would not look out of place in a dystopian future, the 46m by 22m shelter has redefined public space without stealing the limelight from the hustle and bustle of the neighbourhood.\n\nA former tax consultant, Soh Wee Ling is a freelance writer and photographer who is back in Singapore after a decade abroad, including five years in Paris.

Such a rationale would go against the internationally recognised legitimacy and territorial integrity of many countries, including Singapore.\"\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine\n\nis the culmination of months-long tensions between the country and neighbouring Russia, with Russian President Vladimir Putin authorising a military operation in eastern Ukraine last Thursday (Feb 24).\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Some European countries, such as Germany and Italy, have pledged to send weapons and battle equipment to Ukraine, while others like the United States\n\nhave hit Russia with sanctions aimed at crippling its economy.\n\nOver the weekend, the US, Britain, Europe and Canada moved to\n\nblock Russia's access to the Swift international payment system.\n\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is a secure messaging system to ensure rapid cross-border payments which has become the principal mechanism to finance international trade.\n\nDr Balakrishan said the sovereignty, political independence and the territorial integrity of all countries, big and small,\u00a0must be respected.\n\nSingapore must take any violation of these core principles seriously whenever and wherever they occur, and this is why the country has strongly condemned Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, he added.\n\nIt is too easy for a small country to be caught up in the geopolitical games of big powers, warned Dr Balakrishnan.\n\nHe said small countries must avoid becoming sacrificial pawns, vassal states or \"cat's paws\" to be used by one side against the other. It is for this reason that Singapore works hard to maintain good relations with all its neighbours and with big powers.\n\nWhen situations arise, Singapore's assessments and actions are based on clearly enunciated and consistently held principles that are in its own long-term national interests. Rather than choosing sides, the country upholds its principles.\n\nBut this will not always be the case, he said. \"There will be occasions when we will have to take a stand, even if it is contrary to one or more powers on the basis of principles as we are doing now.\"\n\nSingapore can draw important lessons from Ukraine\u2019s invasion, said Dr Balakrishnan, noting that while \u00a0international law and diplomatic principles are essential, they are not sufficient.\n\nThe ongoing crisis demonstrates how quickly a vulnerable country can be overrun, especially when confronting a larger and more powerful opponent, he said. \u00a0\u201cThis is the acute reality for all small countries, and Singapore is no exception.\u201d\n\nSingapore cannot depend on others for protection and must never lose the ability to defend and look after itself, added Dr Balakrishnan.\n\nThe country has thus \u00a0invested consistently in defence to build up \u00a0the strength and credibility of the\u00a0Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), and maintained national service as a fundamental element.\n\n\u201cThe capability of the SAF must be undergirded by Singaporeans\u2019 resolve \u2013 the iron determination of our people to fight and die, if need be, to defend what is ours, and our way of life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWithout such capability and resolve, no amount of diplomacy can save a country.\u201d\n\nGet live updates as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\nWatch Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan's full speech in Parliament:\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay\n\nSkip backward 5 seconds\n\nSkip forward 5 seconds\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time\n\n0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration\n\n-:-\n\nLoaded\n\n:\n\n0.00%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type\n\nLIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently behind live\n\nLIVE\n\nRemaining Time\n\n-\n\n-:-\n\n1x\n\nPlayback Rate\n\n2x\n\n1.75x\n\n1.5x\n\n1.25x\n\n1x\n\n, selected\n\n0.75x\n\n0.5x\n\nChapters\n\nChapters\n\nDescriptions\n\ndescriptions off\n\n, selected\n\nCaptions\n\ncaptions settings\n\n, opens captions settings dialog\n\ncaptions off\n\n, selected\n\nShare\n\nQuality Levels\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nThis video is either unavailable or not supported in this browser\n\nError Code:\n\nMEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED\n\nTechnical details\n        :\n\nNo compatible source was found for this media.\n\nSession ID:\n\n2025-07-15:2971f2eba6a1e7222322df59\n\nPlayer Element ID:\n\nvjs_video_3\n\nOK\n\nClose Modal Dialog\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

Get out of here. Don\u2019t believe your commanders. Don\u2019t believe your propagandists. Just save your lives,\u201d Mr Zelensky said in a new address to Russia\u2019s forces, claiming that more than 4,500 Russian soldiers had already lost their lives during the Kremlin\u2019s assault.\n\nHe also\n\nurged the European Union to grant his country \u201cimmediate\u201d membership\n\nunder a special procedure immediately as it defends itself from invasion by Russian forces.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the European Union for the immediate accession of\n\nUkraine via a new special procedure,\u201d the 44-year-old leader said in a video speech shared on social media.\u00a0\u201cOur goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s fair. I am sure we deserve it.\"\n\nHe said 16 children had died during the first four days of Moscow\u2019s assault and another 45 were wounded as he hailed \u201cUkrainian heroes\u201d.\n\nThe UN\u2019s human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Monday that\n\nat least 102 civilians, including seven children, had been killed\n\nbut warned the real numbers were probably far higher.\n\n\u201cUkrainians have shown the world who we are. And Russia has shown what it has become,\u201d Mr Zelensky said.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader \u2013 a former comedian who came to power in 2019 \u2013 released his latest video statement as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators prepared to sit down for their first face-to-face talks since Russian leader Vladimir Putin ordered troops to invade last Thursday.\n\nThe negotiations with Moscow, which Ukraine said\n\nwould be without preconditions, are being held at the Belarusian-Ukrainian border\n\n.\n\nRussian invasion forces seized two small cities in south-eastern\u00a0Ukraine and the area around a nuclear power plant, the Interfax news agency reported on Monday, but ran into stiff resistance elsewhere\u00a0as Moscow\u2019s diplomatic and economic isolation deepened.\n\nHaving launched the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two,\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin put Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent on high alert\n\non Sunday in the face of a barrage of Western-led reprisals for his war on\u00a0Ukraine.\n\nBlasts were heard before dawn on Monday in the capital of Kyiv and in the major city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian authorities said. But Russian ground forces\u2019 attempts to capture major urban centres had been repelled, they added.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry, however, said its forces had taken the towns of Berdyansk and Enerhodar in\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s south-eastern Zaporizhzhya region as well as the area around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, Interfax reported. The plant\u2019s operations continued normally, it said.\n\nUkraine denied that the nuclear plant had fallen into Russian hands, according to the news agency.\n\nAs Western governments mustered more support for sanctions against Moscow, diplomatic manoeuvring continued with the Vatican joining efforts to end the conflict by offering to \u201cfacilitate dialogue\u201d between Russia and\n\nUkraine.\n\nUS President Joe Biden will host a call with allies and partners on Monday to coordinate a united response, the White House said.\n\nThe United States said Mr Putin was escalating the war with \"dangerous rhetoric\" about Russia's nuclear posture, amid signs Russian forces were preparing to besiege major cities in the democratic country of about 44 million people.\n\nA senior US defence official said Russia had fired more than 350 missiles at Ukrainian targets so far, some hitting civilian infrastructure.\n\n\"It appears that they are adopting a siege mentality, which any student of military tactics and strategy will tell you, when you adopt siege tactics, it increases the likelihood of collateral damage,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nMr Zelensky told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson by telephone on Sunday that the next 24 hours would be crucial for Ukraine, a Downing Street spokesperson said.\n\nSo far, the Russian offensive cannot claim any major victories. Russian has not taken any Ukrainian city, does not control Ukraine's airspace, and its troops remained roughly 30km from Kyiv's city centre for a second day, the official said.\n\nRussia calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special operation\" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.\n\nUnprecedented sanctions\n\nWestern-led political, strategic, economic and corporate sanctions were unprecedented in their extent and coordination, and there were further pledges of military support for Ukraine's badly outgunned armed forces.\n\nThe rouble plunged nearly 30 per cent to an all-time low versus the dollar, after Western nations on Saturday unveiled harsh sanctions including blocking some Russian banks from the Swift international payments system.\n\nJapan and South Korea said they would join in the action to block some banks from Swift. South Korea, a major exporter of semiconductors, would also ban exports of strategic items to Russia.\n\nSingapore, a financial and shipping hub, said\n\nit intended to impose sanctions and restrictions on Russia,\n\nThe Straits Times reported.\n\nJapan said was also considering imposing sanctions\n\nagainst some individuals in Belarus, a key staging area for the Russian invasion.\n\nA referendum in Belarus on Sunday approved a new constitution ditching the country's non-nuclear status.\n\nSeveral European subsidiaries of Sberbank Russia, majority owned by the Russian government, were failing or were likely to fail due to reputational cost of the war in Ukraine, the European Central Bank said.\n\nRussia's central bank scrambled to manage the broadening fallout of the sanctions saying it would resume buying gold on the domestic market, launch a repurchase auction with no limits and ease restrictions on banks' open foreign currency positions.\n\nIt also ordered brokers to block attempt by foreigners to sell Russian securities.\n\nThat could complicate plans by the sovereign wealth funds of Norway and Australia, which said they planned to wind down their exposure to Russian-listed companies.\n\nCorporate giants also took action, with British oil major\u00a0BP, the biggest foreign investor in Russia, saying it would abandon its stake in state oil company Rosneft at a cost of up to US$25 billion (S$34 billion).\n\nThe European Union on Sunday decided for the first time in its history\n\nto supply weapons to a country at war,\n\npledging arms including fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\nGermany, which had already\n\nfrozen a planned undersea gas pipeline from Russia,\n\nsaid it would increase defence spending massively, casting off decades of reluctance to match its economic power with military clout.\n\nEU Chief Executive Ursula von der Leyen expressed support for Ukraine's membership in an interview with Euronews, saying\"they are one of us\".\n\nThe EU shut all Russian planes out of its airspace,\n\nas did Canada, forcing Russian airline Aeroflot to cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice. The United States and France urged their citizens to consider leaving Russia immediately.\n\nThe EU also banned the Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik.\n\nIn New York, the UN Security Council convened a rare emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly, or all the United Nations' 193 member states, for Monday.\n\nRolling protests have been held around the world against the invasion, including in Russia, where almost 6,000 people have been detained at anti-war protests since Thursday, the OVD-Info protest monitor said.\n\nTens of thousands of people across Europe marched in protest, including\n\nmore than 100,000 in Berlin.\n\nMeta Platforms said\n\nit had removed a network of about 40 fake accounts,\n\ngroups and pages across Facebook and Instagram that operated from Russia and Ukraine targeting public figures in Ukraine, for violating its rules against coordinated inauthentic behavior.\n\nTwitter said it had also suspended more than a dozen accounts and blocked the sharing of several links for violating its rules against platform manipulation and spam.\n\nGet live updates as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nRussia\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nDefence and military\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nBuy now pay later with 0% interest instalments.\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Flip7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

This will have numerous legal and social ramifications that will play out in the months and years to come.\u201d\n\nDr Tan said he has filed an application to the High Court seeking an order to compel the Cabinet to move a Bill to repeal Section 377A.\n\nMr Ong said: \u201cI am disappointed with the outcome but the ruling does not mean the end of the community\u2019s pursuit for equality.\u201d\n\nHe added that it will take more time before the community finds full recognition and acceptance by policymakers and society.\n\nLGBTQ movement Pink Dot SG said it was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d by the decision.\n\n\u201cThe acknowledgement that Section 377A is unenforceable only in the prosecutorial sense is cold comfort,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nIn arguments before the apex court in January last year, the trio contended that Section 377A, which was enacted in 1938, should be struck down as it violates Article 12 of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law.\n\nThey argued that the law criminalises sex acts only between homosexual men, but not acts between homosexual women or heterosexuals.\n\nThey argued that men were being treated unequally because women cannot be punished for acts of gross indecency.\n\nThey also argued it was absurd to criminalise a particular sexual orientation when scientific evidence shows that sexual orientation cannot be voluntarily changed.\n\nState counsel contended that the highly divisive issue of whether Section 377A should be repealed was for Parliament to decide.\n\nMr Ong was represented by Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, Mr Choong was represented by Senior Counsel Harpreet Singh Nehal, and Dr Tan was represented by Mr M. Ravi.\n\nKey events\n\n2007:\n\nA petition to repeal Section 377A is presented to Parliament. After extensive debates, the law is retained but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says\u00a0it will not be proactively enforced.\n\n2010:\n\nMr Tan Eng Hong files a constitutional challenge against Section 377A. He was charged under the provision for engaging in oral sex with another man in the cubicle of a public toilet. The pair eventually plead guilty to committing an obscene act in a public place.\n\n2012:\n\nGay couple Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee file their own challenge against Section 377A.\n\n2013:\n\nThe High Court dismisses both challenges.\n\n2014:\n\nThe Court of Appeal rules that Section 377A is constitutional.\n\n2018:\n\nVeteran diplomat Tommy Koh encourages the gay community to bring a class action to challenge the constitutionality of Section 377A, after India\u2019s Supreme Court decriminalises consensual gay sex.\n\nDisc jockey Johnson Ong Ming files a fresh constitutional challenge.\n\nFormer Attorneys-General Walter Woon and V.

I'm in pain and I cannot lift anything heavy.\"\n\nHis family now relies on their 12-year-old son for money, who polishes shoes for 70 cents a day.\n\nA kidney for US$1,500\n\nMr Noorudin was among eight people AFP spoke to who had sold a kidney to feed their families or pay off debt - some for as little as US$1,500 (S2,040).\n\nIt is illegal to sell or buy organs in most developed nations, where donors are usually related to the recipient or are people acting out of altruism.\n\nIn Afghanistan, however, the practice is unregulated.\n\n\"There is no law... to control how the organs can be donated or sold, but the consent of the donor is necessary,\" said Professor Mohammad Wakil Matin, a former top surgeon at a hospital in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.\n\nDr Mohamad Bassir Osmani, a surgeon at one of two hospitals where the majority of Herat's transplants are performed, confirmed \"consent\" was the key.\n\n\"We take written consent and a video recording from them - especially from the donor,\" he said, adding hundreds of operations have been performed in Herat over the past five years.\n\n\"We have never investigated where the patient or donor comes from, or how. It's not our job.\"\n\nThe Taliban did not respond to requests by AFP for comment on the practice, but Dr Osmani said the country's new rulers have plans to clamp down on the trade and are forming a committee to regulate it.\n\nAfghans desperate for money are usually matched by brokers with wealthy patients, who travel to Herat from across the country - and sometimes even from India and Pakistan.\n\nThe recipient pays both the hospital fees and the donor.\n\nMs Azyta's family had so little food that two of her three children have recently been treated for malnourishment.\n\nShe felt she had no choice but to sell an organ, and openly met a broker who matched her with a recipient from the southern province of Nimroz.\n\n\"I sold my kidney for 250,000 Afghanis,\" she said from her small damp room.\n\n\"I had to do it. My husband isn't working, we have debts,\" she added.\n\nNow her husband, a daily labourer, is planning on doing the same.\n\n\"People have become poorer,\" he said. \"Many people are selling their kidneys out of desperation.\"\n\n'One-kidney village'\n\nOn the outskirts of Herat lies Sayshanba Bazaar, a village made up of hundreds of people displaced by years of conflict.\n\nKnown as \"one-kidney village\", dozens of residents have sold their organs after word spread among destitute families of the money to be made.\n\nFrom one family, five brothers sold a kidney each in the last four years, thinking it would save them from poverty.\n\n\"We are still in debt and as poor as we were before,\" said Mr Ghulam Nebi, showing off his scar.\n\nIn developed nations, donors and recipients usually go on to lead full and normal lives, but their after-surgery health is usually closely monitored - and also dependent on a balanced lifestyle and diet.\n\nThat luxury is often not available to poor Afghans who sell a kidney and still find themselves trapped in poverty - and sometimes in ill health.\n\nProf Matin said only some donors arranged for follow-up checks.\n\n\"There are no public health facilities to register kidney sellers and donors for regular examinations to check on implications for their health,\" he added.\n\nMs Shakila, already a mother of two at 19, underwent the procedure shortly before the Taliban seized power, bypassing a broker by searching out a patient at a Herat hospital.\n\n\"We had no choice because of hunger,\" she said, made up with black eyeliner with a scarf covering the rest of her face.\n\nShe sold her kidney for US$1,500 - most of which went to settle the family's debt.\n\nMother-of three Aziza, meanwhile, is waiting for her opportunity after meeting a hospital staffer who is trying to match her with a donor.\n\n\"My children roam on the streets begging,\" she told AFP, tears welling.\n\n\"If I don't sell my kidney, I will be forced to sell my one-year-old daughter.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nAfghanistan\n\nOrgan donation/Transplants\n\nPoverty\n\nTaliban\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nHe Chose To Embark On A Career Switch In His 60s!\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Flip7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

That included a season-high eight offensive rebounds.\n\nThe Suns, who still own the best record in the NBA at 49-12, lost back-to-back games for the first time since dropping two on Dec 25 and Dec 27.\n\nDevin Booker led the Suns with 30 points. Cameron Johnson and Deandre Ayton added 23 apiece but Phoenix are clearly still finding their way in their third game since losing All-Star point guard Chris Paul to a broken thumb that could sideline him for the rest of the regular season.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors, chasing the Suns for top spot in the West, could not capitalise, surrendering a 21-point third-quarter lead in a 107-101 loss to the Dallas Mavericks in San Francisco.\n\nOn the eve of his 23rd birthday, Luka Doncic scored 34 points and pulled down 11 rebounds for Dallas, connecting on a pair of key baskets down the stretch and draining the clinching free throws in the waning seconds.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He's a great passer and obviously I've got someone that attracts a lot of attention, too.\n\n\"So you've got to make a decision, do you stay on me or do you stay on him?

Around 300 deaths have been recorded in the past week, with the majority unvaccinated residents.\n\nHong Kong has a large proportion of unvaccinated elderly despite a recent pick-up in vaccinations.\u00a0Many have hesitated to be inoculated due to a fear of side effects and complacency due to the city's success in controlling the virus in 2021.\n\nMedical experts have said the city of 7.4 million residents could see cumulative deaths from the virus potentially rising to around 3,206 by mid-May.\n\nAround 4,000 people on average die each month in Hong Kong, according to 2020 government figures.\n\nHong Kong has\n\nstuck firmly to a dynamic zero coronavirus policy\n\nwhich seeks to curb all outbreaks, like that in mainland China.\u00a0To achieve this, the city has unleashed its toughest measures since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe city has recorded over 171,000 infections in total, with around 160,000 of them since the start of February due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nThe government has in recent days communicated to the public at press conferences that the deaths are mostly among unvaccinated people. Previously, that information was not readily given.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam said mainland Chinese experts had suggested to her administration that they explain \"more clearly the clinical situation of the death cases to the public and boost vaccination among the elderly\", according to a government statement released on Sunday night.\n\nChinese officials have stepped in to bolster Hong Kong's efforts to fight the outbreak after President Xi Jinping told the city's government to make it their \"overriding mission\" to control a worsening Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nHong Kong\n\nHospitals\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nBuilt for Apple Intelligence.

However, we cannot accept such violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity of another sovereign state,\" Dr\u00a0Balakrishnan said.\n\n\"We will continue to work with our Asean and international partners to take a strong stance against the invasion of Ukraine and to end further violence and bloodshed, and to de-escalate tensions.\"\n\nRussia invaded neighbouring Ukraine on Feb 24\n\nafter months of tensions at the border - amassing troops and conducting military exercises. Its actions have been widely condemned by countries around the world.\n\nDr Balakrishnan noted that Singapore was one of 82 co-sponsors of\n\na recent United Nations\u00a0Security Council resolution condemning Russia's aggression\n\nagainst Ukraine.

But we have rarely acted to impose sanctions on other countries in the absence of binding Security Council decisions or directions,\" said Dr Balakrishnan.\n\n\"However, given the unprecedented gravity of the Russian attack on Ukraine, and the unsurprising veto by Russia of a draft Security Council resolution, Singapore intends to act in concert with many other like-minded countries to impose appropriate sanctions and restrictions against Russia.\"\n\nDr Balakrishnan added: \"We must expect that our measures will come at some cost and implications on our businesses, citizens and, indeed, to Singapore. However, unless we as a country stand up for principles that are the very foundation for the independence and sovereignty of smaller nations, our own right to exist and prosper as a nation may similarly be called into question one day.\"\n\nAfter the minister's speech, Mr Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) asked how Singapore can maintain its interests with all parties involved, from the United States to Ukraine, Russia and other countries in Europe, given recent events.\n\nDr Balakrishnan reiterated that Singapore\n\ndoes not take sides, but upholds principles.\n\n\"And in this case, the principles at stake are independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity.\"\n\nThe Republic's foreign policy is consistent, coherent, and \"almost always predictable\", he added, noting that since he became foreign minister seven years ago, he has had to say no on occasion to every superpower.\n\n\"But it has not stopped us from being able to sit at the table, look at each other's eyes, shake hands, explain where and why we differ, and at the same time, pursue areas of cooperation where our interests align and where our principles are shared,\" Dr Balakrishnan said.\n\n\"This is not a new posture. This, in fact, is a posture that we have adopted for every single year since we've been independent, and I am maintaining that tradition.\"\n\nMs Denise Phua (Jalan Besar GRC) asked whether the Government would review ongoing projects and initiatives with the Russian government.\n\nDr Balakrishnan said details of the sanctions are still being worked out, but added that Singapore has \"no quarrel\" with the Russian people.\n\nNoting that Ms Phua was indirectly alluding to the Russian Cultural Centre here, which would also house a Russian Orthodox Church, he said: \"I would imagine that this is a project which, in my own view, should continue, because this goes beyond the politics and the conflict which is going on right now.\"\n\nGet live updates as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\nWatch Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan's full speech in Parliament:\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay\n\nSkip backward 5 seconds\n\nSkip forward 5 seconds\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time\n\n0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration\n\n-:-\n\nLoaded\n\n:\n\n0.00%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type\n\nLIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently behind live\n\nLIVE\n\nRemaining Time\n\n-\n\n-:-\n\n1x\n\nPlayback Rate\n\n2x\n\n1.75x\n\n1.5x\n\n1.25x\n\n1x\n\n, selected\n\n0.75x\n\n0.5x\n\nChapters\n\nChapters\n\nDescriptions\n\ndescriptions off\n\n, selected\n\nCaptions\n\ncaptions settings\n\n, opens captions settings dialog\n\ncaptions off\n\n, selected\n\nShare\n\nQuality Levels\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nThis video is either unavailable or not supported in this browser\n\nError Code:\n\nMEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED\n\nTechnical details\n        :\n\nThe media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.\n\nSession ID:\n\n2025-07-15:1c80f79b1303d3fac789218f\n\nPlayer Element ID:\n\nvjs_video_3\n\nOK\n\nClose Modal Dialog\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

This is enough to power over 144,000 four-room Housing Board flats a year.\n\nTo put that in context, the total installed solar capacity in Singapore in the first quarter of 2020 was 350MWp.\n\n\"Our solar energy project will play a key role in Singapore's energy transition to a low-carbon future and provide customers with wider access to renewable energy,\" said a spokesman for PacificLight.\n\nShe added that since PacificLight commenced operations in 2013, the firm has improved its plant's efficiency, which helps to reduce emissions.\n\n\"We have invested over $5 million in energy-saving initiatives that cut our plant's energy consumption... and reduced carbon emissions by 1.5 per cent,\" the spokesman said, adding that the firm has plans to upgrade its power plant next year to further reduce its emissions.\n\nFinance Minister Lawrence Wong announced earlier this month that the carbon tax rate will be raised to help Singapore meet its enhanced climate change target of having its emissions dwindle to net-zero by or around 2050, instead of in the second half of the century.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But this will go up to $25 in 2024, $45 in 2026, before reaching $50 to $80 per tonne by 2030.\n\nSingapore's carbon tax applies to all facilities producing 25,000 tonnes or more of greenhouse gas emissions in a year. This covers 30 to 40 large emitters such as oil refineries and power-generation plants, which contribute 80 per cent of Singapore's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAs a carbon tax assigns costs to the release of such emissions, it can help to level the playing field between pollutive fossil fuels, which have traditionally been cheaper, and low-carbon options such as renewable energy or carbon capture and storage technologies.\n\nA carbon tax can also spur firms to adopt more energy-efficient practices, which can help to reduce emissions and their carbon tax bill.\n\nBut how effective such a carbon pricing scheme is in spurring change depends on its quantum.\n\nFor instance, the International Energy Agency estimates that the use of carbon capture technologies to take in carbon dioxide from dilute gas streams, such as power generation, could cost between US$40 (S$54) and US$120 for every tonne.\n\nThese technologies are still nascent, but with carbon prices going up, they have been attracting more research attention in recent years as they have the potential to take planet-warming gases out of the atmosphere for storage underground.\n\nOil giants Shell and ExxonMobil told ST they are looking into carbon capture and storage as a way to cut their carbon footprints.\n\nA spokesman for Shell said: \"Tackling climate change is an urgent challenge and Shell is acting on it... Shell has halved our crude processing capacity and production of traditional fuels in Singapore.\"\n\nShe also cited other initiatives that Shell has embarked on to reduce its carbon footprint, such as its efforts to set up a large-scale solar farm on Pulau Semakau, expand its electric vehicle charging network, and invest in biofuel production.\n\nMs Geraldine Chin, chairman and managing director of ExxonMobil Asia Pacific, said that since 2002, the firm has embarked on a series of initiatives that has led to energy efficiency gains of more than 25 per cent, which has helped to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at its Singapore operating facility.\n\n\"We have invested US$10 million in the Singapore Energy Centre, which\u00a0carries out research into lower-carbon energy pathways,\" she added. \"Our team (in Singapore) is working to develop a detailed emissions-reduction road map, as part of the company's ambition to achieve net-zero emissions from its operated assets by 2050.\"\n\nA spokesman for Keppel - which has a subsidiary that partially owns and operates a power-generation plant on Jurong Island - said it is exploring the import of renewable energy to Singapore from Laos.\n\nThe company is also looking into the feasibility of producing green ammonia in Australia for export globally, its spokesman added. Ammonia can be reprocessed to produce hydrogen - a fuel that does not produce carbon dioxide when burned.\n\nA spokesman for the National Climate Change Secretariat said sustainability and global climate action are here to stay.\n\nThe carbon tax is aimed at driving long-term behavioural change in support of Singapore's climate ambition, such as getting businesses to take early action to decarbonise and individuals to change consumption habits and behaviour, she said.\n\n\"This helps to position Singapore to succeed in a low-carbon world.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nClimate change\n\nCarbon tax\n\nFossil fuels\n\nRenewable energy\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Fold7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nWhy businesses need to understand the differences in Chinese Renminbi (CNH vs CNY)\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Cuscaden is a consortium comprising Hotel Properties (HPL), its co-founder and managing director Ong Beng Seng, and two Temasek-linked companies -\u00a0Mapletree and Capitaland.\n\nIn a bourse filing, SPH said it will first hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) at 2.30pm on March 22 to vote on the proposed distribution in-specie of SPH Reit units under the Cuscaden scheme.\n\nA scheme meeting will then follow at 2.45pm for shareholders to vote on the Cuscaden scheme. Both the EGM and scheme meeting will be held via electronic means.\n\nHowever, shareholders must electronically submit their votes to both resolutions by March 19.\n\nUnder the distribution in-specie resolution, more than 50 per cent of the total number of votes cast must approve the distribution in-specie.\n\nUnder the scheme resolution, two thresholds must be met.\n\nFirst,\u00a0more than 50 per cent the number of shareholders (headcount vote), and at least 75 per cent in the value of votes cast, must approve the takeover by Cuscaden.\n\nBoth resolutions must be approved by SPH shareholders for the Cuscaden takeover offer to succeed.\n\nShould shareholders approve both the resolutions (which are inter-conditional), they will then be asked to elect their preferred choice of receiving either all cash or a mix of cash and units in SPH Reits.\n\nThis preference would determine whether a chain offer for SPH Reits is triggered.\n\nIf most shareholders choose cash, Cuscaden's shareholding of the SPH Reits could increase to 30 per cent or more, thus triggering a chain offer for the Reits.\n\nThe exercise, if approved by shareholders, will lead to the privatisation of SPH.\n\nEvercore, the independent financial adviser to the deal, has said that the offer is fair and reasonable, while SPH's independent directors are calling shareholders to vote for the deal.\n\nBut the deal is by no means assured until and unless shareholders vote for it.\n\nMr Christopher Lim, Cuscaden spokesman and HPL group executive director, said his side had been working closely with SPH to bring the Cuscaden scheme to SPH shareholders.\n\n\"Following the despatch of the Cuscaden composite document today and the scheduling of the EGM and scheme meeting on March 22, 2022, we are another step closer to delivering our compelling offer to SPH shareholders,\" he said.\n\n\"If the Cuscaden scheme is approved, SPH shareholders can look forward to realising the value of their investment in SPH. A key feature of the Cuscaden scheme is that it provides flexibility for SPH shareholders, with two consideration options for each SPH shareholder to choose from: either all cash or cash and SPH Reit Units.\"\n\nUpon completion, SPH shareholders will receive their funds in May this year.\n\nMeanwhile, SPH asked its shareholders to submit questions in advance by 1pm on March 5 for the purposes of the Investors' Day or by 2.45pm on March 13 for the purposes of the EGM and scheme meeting.\n\nThe Cuscaden composite document comes on the back of the Feb 9 termination of the Keppel scheme following\n\na fierce battle between Cuscaden and Keppel Corp\n\nfor SPH, which began late last year.\n\nKeppel made an initial offer of $2.351 per share for SPH's non-media assets - comprising 66.8 cents in cash, 0.596 Keppel Reit unit and 0.782 SPH Reit unit per SPH share.\n\nAfter Cuscaden emerged with a competing offer, Keppel raised the cash component of its offer to 86.8 cents per share. The number of Keppel Reit and SPH Reit units remained the same, with Keppel saying this offer was final.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore companies\n\nSingapore Press Holdings\n\nTakeover/Buyout\n\nShareholders", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/dw-sph-cuscaden-220228.jpg?VersionId=z9jWa6L_fcakrjfR5XicmzWE6pFCospG", "alt_text": null}]}

They stood by the roadsides, under a very low sky with bright stars.\n\n\"I am so proud of our people,\" said Ms Oksana Mudryk, the mayor of Khomutyntsi village, about 65km south-west of Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.\n\n\"Our village is so tiny that I was thinking, 'Do we even have anybody to patrol the streets?' I thought maybe three guys at most would come to patrol with me. But in one day after the war started in Kyiv, I have signed up more than 30 people.\"\n\nMost of the attention in the first days of the war has focused on Ukraine's large cities, which are the main targets of Russian troop movements and the scene of pitched street battles and deafening artillery attacks.\n\nBut out in the countryside, a massive grassroots movement is under way in villages like Khomutyntsi as ordinary Ukrainians - farmers, shop owners, day labourers, taxi drivers - take up arms to join a battle that has abruptly upended their lives.\n\nThe mobilisation of civilians to fight against seemingly impossible odds has been one of the distinguishing features of Ukraine's unexpectedly fierce resistance. And though it may end tragically, Ukrainian officials have been pointing to the effort with pride.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

In northern Ukraine, a man knelt briefly in front of a tank. One Ukrainian woman filmed herself on a cellphone taunting a Russian soldier by telling him to put sunflower seeds in his pocket, so that when he died in Ukraine, flowers would grow.\n\nIn Khomutyntsi, the big meadow that stretches along the Postolova River is normally a place of leisure. Villagers fish in the river year-round and swim there in the summer. But this weekend, the whole village gathered in the meadow to build trenches, a checkpoint and underground shelters.\n\nMs Mudryk drove her car on Saturday night to check on her volunteers. She does this several times each night, as patrols keep guard on the roadsides from dusk to dawn.\n\nWhy would the Russian army come to Khomutyntsi, a cluster of one-storey, white-plastered homes, garden plots and dirt roads, with about 400 residents, surrounded by forests and fields? It might seem unlikely. But if Russian troops did arrive, they would not go unnoticed by local people on the watch.\n\n\"I am crying so much as it is very difficult to get used to our new reality,\" Ms Mudryk said. \"But I bow my head in honour to our people. Today, we were asked to bring some help with food to soldiers. In two hours, we loaded a full van of food, just from our village.\"\n\nThere is bravery, but there is also great fear. Standing on the road in the dark, the mayor pointed at a star in the sky that seemed to be behaving strangely, worried it might be a Russian drone over the village.\n\nMr Serhiy Osavoliuk, who signed up for patrol duty, said his wife soon followed suit.\n\n\"My wife, probably thinking of controlling me, signed up as well,\" he said. \"Now we patrol together.\"\n\nThe pair walk about with flashlights, stopping cars and checking who is inside. Usually, it is just local people.\n\nScenes like these are repeated in village after village through the countryside. Hundreds of local people helped build fortifications, bringing big sacks from their houses and filling them with sand.\n\nMany of the civilians doing support work, like Mr Osavoliuk and his wife, are unarmed, although a few have guns or have asked for them. But it seems as if everybody is doing what they can, hoping that even little actions might help.\n\nThe national road agency of Ukraine, for example, issued an order to take down all the road signs - to make it harder for Russian troops to navigate.\n\nOn the road between the towns of Vinnytsia and Kalynivka, the process had already started, bringing one more, strange new scene on the side of familiar roads.\n\nThe sign for the village Pysarivka disappeared in just five minutes. Volodymyr, a road service worker, who is 55 and did not want to provide his last name for safety reasons, said he had been driving around tearing down signs.\n\n\"It is important for them to get lost,\" he said of the Russians.\n\nIn Kalynivka, which is close to a large weapons depot that Russian troops have targeted, local volunteers wove small strips of cloth together to form a camouflage net over their checkpoint. Too many people have been clustering around the spot, they said, making it a potential target. The location they chose is next to a bomb shelter, to hide in if bombs start to fall.\n\n\"We came to help our soldiers,'' said Ms Valentyna Rudenko. \"It is hard to believe it is happening to us.\"\n\nIn some places, as in Hushchyntsi, the volunteer effort encompassed the whole village. About 50 people were piling up logs into makeshift bunkers, as children ran about and women carried out homemade meals.\n\n\"Step away, you might get hurt, that's the job for grown-ups,\" one man told the children hoping to participate.\n\nThe town square near a military recruitment centre in Kalynivka was filled with men with duffel bags, and also their wives and children who came to say goodbye.\n\nThey sat on tree stumps and on their bags or stood in groups joking. Their children grew bored during their fathers' long waits to be issued a gun and receive instructions.\n\nThose who were waiting had already registered and came ready to deploy. But there were also newcomers arriving every minute at the entry gate to the square, asking guards where they should go to register.\n\nAmong them was Mr Volodymyr Varchuk, 67, who rode up on a rundown bicycle.\n\n\"Hey guys, how do I sign up?\" he asked.\n\nSoldiers looked at each other and asked his age. When Varchuk answered, a soldier told him to go away and wait until he is called up. Mr Varchuk left disappointed.\n\n\"The young ones will be sent to fight, but us old ones are those who should guard the town!\" he said.\n\n\"I knew it would happen since 2014. We already had war with Russia. It's obvious they would want to proceed.\"\n\nPeople were running in and out of the recruitment centre, with bags of food, water and clothes. One woman with two sons who looked about 20 took them to a bench and had them sit down. Then she helped them try on the new shoes she had bought for them.\n\nAn older man named Viktor came to say goodbye to his son.\n\n\"My soul is restless,\" he said. \"How would you feel sending your son to the war?\"\n\nGet live updates as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nRussia\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nDefence and military\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Flip7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nSave up to $730 with SIM only 5G Star Plan!\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/ac_villagerskyiv_280222.jpg?VersionId=sgA5IOsLVLjG2Bq7CMpara.ym1Dmhv9_", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nEnvironmental groups said Australia had misled the public and ensured its waste would continue to pollute developing countries, especially in Southeast Asia which has become the main destination for the rich world's waste.\n\n\"Australians were very proud and excited when the government announced its world-first 'waste export ban',\" said Ms Jane Bremmer, plastic advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN).\n\n\"Now we see this was disingenuous and a cynical political announcement as they are rebranding plastic waste exports as fuel.\"\n\nMs Ley's spokesman said the law states that processed plastic can be exported, adding that only \"a small number\" of export licences had been issued.\n\nThe spokesman said there was no available data on how much plastic had been exported as fuel since the ban was introduced or information about where it was sent.\n\nWaste crisis\n\nAustralia's new law bans the export of mixed plastic waste, which could include a hard-to-recycle jumble of items like bags, polystyrene cups and bubble wrap.\n\nIt permits the shipment of plastic waste that has been separated, like bales of drinks bottles that can be sent to recyclers overseas, as well as \"processed\" waste fuels.\n\nAustralia provided US$30 million (S$41 million) in loans to ResourceCo and Cleanaway for a plant to be built in New South Wales that will process 250,000 tonnes of waste a year into fuel for a nearby cement factory and exports to Asia, Ms Ley's spokesman confirmed.\n\nWith only 10 per cent of global plastic waste recycled, burning plastic as a fuel is becoming increasingly popular as a way to get rid of soaring volumes of single-use plastic trash.\n\nPlastic production, a key growth area for the petrochemicals industry, is due to double over the next 20 years.\n\nBig oil companies that make plastic and major brands that use single-use packaging are investing in plastic-to-fuel projects in poor countries like Indonesia, Reuters revealed in a series of investigations last year.\n\nUnited Nations members are holding a summit in Nairobi this week to agree on terms for the first ever plastic pollution treaty, including the role of waste-to-fuel processes.\n\nAustralian Environment Minister Ley said this month that she wants to use the summit to urge other countries to \"follow Australia's lead\" on waste export bans so plastic is \"not shipped offshore where it becomes another country's problem\", according to local media.\n\nBut environmentalists in Southeast Asia said Australia's rebranding of plastic waste as a fuel raised fears that rich countries would agree to a deal to continue exporting pollution to the

Economists had expected a decline of 0.7 per cent.\n\nA separate report by the ministry also showed that retail sales\u00a0fell 1.9 per cent in January from the previous month compared with economists' forecast of a 1.2 per cent decrease. The weakness in sales shows that consumers were less willing to spend than expected amid the country's biggest virus wave.\n\nThe continued decline in output suggests a further delay in Japan's economic recovery, with the outlook further clouded by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the potential fallout for global trade and commodities markets.\n\nWhile the consensus among economists before Monday's data was for Japan to still eke out growth in the first three months of this year, the country is lagging behind its peers in recovering to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nFurther signs of a setback in momentum could spark calls for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to take more action to shore up growth ahead of an election in the summer.\n\nConsidering the fragile state of the economy and the still feeble strength of inflation, the Bank of Japan is also likely to stick with its stimulus measures, despite ongoing speculation\u00a0it may consider adjusting policy as its global peers make hawkish moves.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Nissan Motor's production\u00a0fell by 25 per cent.\n\nWhile the Omicron impact on supply chains should ease in the coming months, the Russian invasion has joined the list of concerns for manufacturers.\n\n\"The rapid spread of Omicron infections and higher commodity prices due to supply problems related to Ukraine risks will probably weigh on output,\" said Bloomberg Economics analysts.\n\nThe coronavirus variant also impacted January retail sales\u00a0as the sudden escalation of virus cases discouraged shoppers from spending. The weak result suggests that\u00a0the hit to consumption from Omicron could be larger than feared.\n\nPolicymakers will also be closely watching to see how Japan's sharply rising energy costs are affecting consumers known for their deflationary mindset. Without a strong recovery in consumer spending this quarter, Goldman Sachs and UBS are among those that expect the economy to shrink.\n\nMr Kishida said on Friday that he will ramp up support for households and businesses to mitigate the impact of surging oil prices. Some economists, including Mr Kazuma Maeda of Barclays, see a good chance of the Prime Minister unveiling another economic package before the election.\n\nStill, Omicron restrictions on activity may be hampering the implementation of existing stimulus measures from Mr Kishida's larger-than-expected economic package announced in November.\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nManufacturing\n\nSupply chains\n\nUkraine\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nSave up to $260 off.\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Fold7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Gold - a haven in times of international tensions - climbed more than 2 per cent.\n\nThe United States and a sweep of European governments agreed to\n\npenalise Russia\u2019s central bank and exclude some Russian banks\u00a0from the Swift messaging system,\n\nwhich\u00a0is used for trillions of dollars worth of global transactions. The intensifying tensions add\u00a0to deep uncertainties for commodities, which have been roiled by Russia\u2019s invasion of its smaller neighbour.\n\n\u201cWe expect the price of consumed commodities that Russia is a key producer of to rally from here,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group wrote in an e-mailed note. \u201cBarring a breakthrough in peace negotiations, we believe this leaves commodity prices having to rally sharply as we see demand destruction as now the only significant remaining balancing mechanism.\u201d\n\nRussian and Ukraine together account for nearly a quarter of global wheat exports and a fifth of corn sales. Russia is a major supplier for a swathe of commodities, including aluminium, nickel, palladium, oil and gas.\n\nTrouble at sea\n\nAs the war intensifies, the risk of logistical turmoil is also rising fast across commodity\u00a0markets, with insurers either refusing to offer cover for vessels sailing into the Black Sea, or demanding huge premiums to do so. Turkey was the biggest single buyer of Russian aluminium in 2020, ahead of China and Japan, according to United Nations\u00a0Comtrade data.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Palladium climbed as much as 7.8 per cent on concerns over potential supply disruptions. Russia produces about 40 per cent of the palladium mined globally. Silver and platinum rose more than 1 per cent.\n\nGold boost\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine has also bolstered gold as investors seek safe havens.

Details of the payment of the dividend will be announced later.\n\nFor the full year, net profit was up 179.4 per cent to a record $686.4 million on strong operating profit growth and significantly lower exceptional losses compared with\u00a0the year before. Revenue was up 31.2 per cent to $47 billion due to higher prices across most products and commodities in 2021.\n\nOlam noted that its reorganisation plan has driven performance across the group. The company had in 2020 said it would reorganise its business into three\u00a0units to unlock long-term value.\n\nThese include Olam Food Ingredients (OFI), which consists of the company's cocoa, coffee, edible nuts, spices and dairy businesses; Olam Global Agri (OGA), which comprises the grains and animal feed, edible oils, rice, cotton and commodity financial services businesses; and Olam International, which will focus on investing in start-ups involved in digital technology and sustainability after OFI and OGA are spun off.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But Asia is \"behind in reopening and recovering\" from Covid-19 restrictions, which grounded much of its traffic over the past two years.\n\nAs at Sunday afternoon, Cathay Pacific Airways, Korean Air, China Eastern Airlines and Air China were still flying over Russia, which makes up about one-eighth of the world's landmass and spans across much of northern Europe and Asia. The country's vast reach makes it difficult for carriers to avoid on many intercontinental routes.\n\nFlying around Russia, as many western airlines had to do for years during the Cold War, can add hours to flight times. The higher cost of fuel, which has spiked since the invasion, makes that extra time in the air even more expensive.\n\nFinnair, which has carved out a niche providing transit passengers from elsewhere in Europe with short flight times to Asia via Helsinki, has perhaps the most to lose of any western carrier.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of 537 long-haul Finnair flights scheduled to and from Helsinki in March are set to start or finish in Asia,\u00a0data from aviation consultancy Cirium shows. Even before the EU's ban, it cancelled some flights to Asia, diverting others to avoid Russian airspace.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Travel to and from China, in particular, has been virtually halted by the\n\ncountry's Covid-19-zero\u00a0policy.\n\nMany carriers have also stopped flights to Hong Kong for the coming weeks due to onerous quarantines for travellers and flight crews.\n\nEuropean airlines may avoid being cut off completely from eastbound travel thanks to global airline alliances like Oneworld and SkyTeam and separate commercial agreements with Asian carriers to reciprocally carry one another's passengers.\n\nSingapore Airlines has the most flights of any carrier scheduled between Europe and Asia in March, according to Cirium data. Many of its itineraries pass to the south of Russia.\n\nFlights by Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Korean Air spend hours over the country on their way to and from destinations like Tokyo and Seoul. With China still mostly closed, European carriers' flights to and from Japan and South Korea will be most affected for now, said former Air France vice-president Henri Hie.\n\nKorean Air said its flights are not currently facing problems, but it has developed contingency plans if Russia shutters its airspace.\n\n\"If the entire Russian airspace is closed, our flights to/from Europe will be impacted,\" a Korean Air spokesman said in an e-mailed response to questions.\n\nAvoiding Russia\n\nJapan Airlines said last week that it was suspending flights to Moscow but continuing to fly over Russia after confirming it was safe to do so.\n\nFor destinations further south, it is easier for carriers to circumvent Russia.\n\nQantas Airways said on Sunday it would reroute its Australia-Britain flights away from Russia. The Australian flag carrier said it was going to use an alternative flight path through the Middle East, adding an hour to flight times. Some trips to Europe already take as much as 17 hours.\n\nIf airspace bans spread to involve carriers from outside Europe, Asian airlines could still be hit hard, Mr Sobie said, because they also fly over Siberia on some routes to North America as well as Europe.\n\nGet live updates as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\nSee more on\n\nAirlines\n\nRussia\n\nUkraine", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/02/28/ac_russiaairline_280222.jpg?VersionId=5BymlBARmyv3fSq_M8s97X7Ll.2A6Y9c", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

US and European stock futures fell, while currencies from the euro to the rand dropped.\n\n\u201cUSD is king, offering liquidity and safe haven attributes,\u201d said Rodrigo Catril, a currency strategist National Australia Bank. \u201cWhen trouble hits the road, you need to look for cover.\u201d\n\nThe fresh Western penalties further isolate commodity-rich Russia from global finance by seeking to prevent its central bank from using foreign reserves to blunt sanctions. They also exclude some Russian lenders from the Swift messaging system that underpins trillions of dollars worth of transactions.\n\nThis drove the Russian rouble down nearly 30 per cent against the dollar, while the euro slumped 0.9 per cent to US$1.1165 on worries about risks for Europe\u2019s economy, which relies heavily on Russian energy.\n\nThe US dollar index, which measures the currency against six peers, gained as much as 0.83 per cent, while the broader MSCI emerging market currency index lost 0.8 per cent.\n\nIn Asia, Singapore\u2019s dollar and South Korea\u2019s won also eased 0.4 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively.

Philippine stocks surged more than 1 per cent after a steep drop last week, while Thai stocks, which sank nearly 2 per cent last week, advanced 0.3 per cent. Singapore\u2019s FTSE Strait Times index, however, fell 1.3 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, signs of funding strains were apparent in major money markets on Monday (Feb 28) as spreads widened for very short-term eurodollar contracts. The gap between future Libor and Fed rates widened for one-month contracts the most since March 2020. March eurodollar contracts dropped relative to June peers, a classic sign of funding stress.\n\nThat comes as Credit Suisse Group warned of how the decision to exclude some Russian banks from Swift could impact money markets as payments are missed and giant overdrafts are made. Strategist Zoltan Pozsar drew comparison with how the Fed had to supply dollars during the height of the pandemic panic in March 2020.\n\nThe Bank of Russia has more than US$630 billion (S$852 billion) in foreign-currency reserves, with most of it held overseas, according to Bloomberg Economics, which plotted out a worst-case scenario where it loses access to everything other than its gold and yuan holdings.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s ex-communication from Swift would isolate Russia financially from the world and could cripple its economy,\u201d Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics, wrote in a note.\n\nSwift is used for trillions of dollars worth of transactions around the globe.\n\n\u201cEurope is bearing the brunt of the invasion\u2019s initial impact, with higher energy costs hurting consumers and the level of sanctions pressuring European growth, with a knock-on effect for US growth prospects,\u201d Scott Glasser, chief investment officer at Clearbridge Investments and investment specialist Jeff Schulze, wrote in a note.\n\nIn other emerging markets, Turkey\u2019s lira shed 0.6 per cent and South Africa\u2019s rand fell 1.4 per cent, hurt by broad risk-off appetite towards emerging market assets.\n\nGlobal markets\n\nThe biggest global securities markets, meanwhile, have been somewhat torn in their response. US and European stock markets witnessed a rebound late last week after initially diving as war broke out. US Treasuries, the world's largest bond market, have been caught between investors' desire for a haven in times of turmoil - which tends to fuel demand for the safest instruments and drive down US yields - and the potential inflationary effects of this conflict, which could put upward pressure on rates.\n\nOne potential concern could be the move to exclude at least some Russian entities from the Swift system. US equities rebounded late on Thursday after President Joe Biden at that stage avoided moves involving the bank messaging system, and then they surged on Friday at a time when Russia said it was willing to hold talks with Kyiv.\n\nIn addition to events on the ground in Ukraine\u00a0and the response of different nations to the situation, investors will be keenly attuned to the impact of rising commodity prices and how central policymakers react. On that front, the key individual is set to be Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to testify before Congress in the coming week.\n\nThe move to ban some Russian lenders from Swift could also have wider effects on global funding markets. The decision could result in missed payments and giant overdrafts within the international banking system and spur the monetary authorities to reactivate daily operations to supply the market with dollars, according to Credit Suisse AG strategist Zoltan Pozsar.\n\nVolatility could amp up on Monday and is already heading for its biggest two-month surge in a year, according to a gauge of cross-asset expectations for price swings in Treasuries, US stocks and global currencies.

Core shipbuilding revenue rose 80 per cent to 8.42 billion yuan.\n\nStill, the group noted that its gross profit margin of 11 per cent in the second half of 2021 was lower than the 26 per cent it registered a year earlier due to progressive construction of shipbuilding contracts that were entered in previous years with lower contract prices. Rising raw material costs and appreciation of the yuan against the United States dollar also hurt margins.\n\nMeanwhile, the group's revenue from its shipping segment increased by 184 million yuan to 551 million yuan in the same period on improved charter rates and an expanded shipping fleet size to 26 vessels. The improved charter rates also boosted gross profit margin\u00a0to 42 per cent, up from 29 per cent a year ago.\n\nThe group's board proposed a final dividend of five cents per share, up from 4.5 cents per share declared a year earlier. The proposed dividend will be subject to shareholders' approval at the upcoming annual general meeting.\n\nFor the full year ended Dec 31, 2021, Yangzijiang's revenue climbed 13 per cent to 16.77 billion yuan. Net profit rose 47 per cent to 3.7 billion yuan, while earnings per share stood at 0.9579 yuan per share, up from 0.6439 yuan per share the previous year.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

The company has an outstanding order book of US$8.5 billion as at Dec 31, 2021.\n\nIt also noted that the International Maritime Organisation has adopted new mandatory measures to cut the carbon intensity of international shipping, which could spur replacement orders as demand for green energy vessels rises.\n\nFurthermore, the group noted that it has obtained pre-clearance from the Singapore Exchange to spin off its investment arm for listing on the exchange's mainboard.\n\nIt noted that the spin-off would allow the group to focus on its core shipbuilding business and could lead to a revaluation of the company as it can then be directly compared with its South Korean and Japanese peers.\n\nYangzijiang executive chairman and chief executive Ren Letian said that the shipbuilding arm, led by a dedicated management team, will \"further strengthen corporate governance and allow the group to focus on building its competitive strengths in shipbuilding following the spin-off\", as well as accelerate the group's\u00a0positioning on environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\n\"We also hope to detach Yangzijiang Shipbuilding from any conglomerate discount, given that both entities will become singularly focused businesses,\" he added.\n\nThe company's shares rose three cents or 2.2 per cent to close at $1.40 on Friday, before the results were released.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore companies\n\nCompany results\n\nMaritime and shipping\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nEnjoy a 512GB upgrade & free data roaming on this 5G plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nFrom payments to performance: How Airwallex fuels Mighty Jaxx's global growth\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

The four-line statement will continue to be used for sole proprietors and partners with revenues exceeding $200,000.\n\nAn estimated 17,000 partners are expected to benefit from easier filing processes and simplified record-keeping requirements in 2022, in addition to 21,000 sole proprietors.\n\nTaxpayers, including sole proprietors and partners, who are required to file an income tax return should do so on Iras' myTax portal between March 1 and April 18.\n\nMore than 90 per cent of taxpayers will be receiving digital bills this year.\n\nIras is also introducing PayNow as a new tax refund mode from July 2022 for taxpayers who are not on the Giro service. Existing tax refund modes include Giro, direct crediting and telegraphic transfer.\n\nThis means that in the case of overpayments or incorrect payments, taxpayers will receive tax refunds into their bank accounts securely and promptly, the authority said.\n\nTaxpayers who need assistance with filing their taxes can contact Iras digitally, such as via e-mail on Iras' myTax portal or through its online virtual assistant, or make an appointment to visit its service centres at least two working days in advance.\n\nThose who have under-declared income or made incorrect expenses or relief claims in previous years should make a voluntary disclosure on Iras' online portal in a timely manner, Iras said.\n\n\"Penalties for voluntary disclosures may be reduced if qualifying conditions are met,\" it said.\n\nThe tax authority also urged taxpayers to be vigilant against phishing scams and to not be deceived by fake SMSes, e-mails and WhatsApp messages.

Austria\u2019s Financial Market Authority imposed a moratorium on Sberbank Europe, which is based in the country.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s warning extended to Sberbank subsidiaries in Croatia and Slovenia. Sberbank\u2019s branches in Slovenia were closed until Wednesday and services temporarily limited to card transactions with a withdrawal limit of 400 euros a day. The Croatian central bank said depositors at Sberbank would be allowed to withdraw just under 1000 euros a day.\n\nSeparately, Deutsche Boerse, the German stock exchange operator, said that it was suspending from trading a number of securities from Russian issuers with immediate effect. The list includes Sberbank and VTB Bank.\n\nCatastrophe\n\nLess than a week after Vladimir Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine, Russia is at risk of succumbing to the biggest financial crisis of his more than two decades in power. Some warned of catastrophic economic damage now that the US and the European Union have agreed to block access to much of the US$630 billion (S$855 billion) Russia\u2019s central bank has built up as a buffer to protect the economy.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that the West is freezing the Central Bank\u2019s reserves,\u201d former Russian prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov wrote on Twitter. \u201cThere is nothing to support the rouble with....Hyperinflation and catastrophe for the economy is not far away.\u201d\n\nThe cost of insuring Russia\u2019s government debt meanwhile rose to a record. For the first time ever, the price of protecting Russia\u2019s debt is no longer being officially quoted in basis points, with protection sellers now demanding payment in advance, signaling perceptions that default might be imminent.\n\nOn Monday credit-default swaps (CDSs) insuring US$10 million of the country\u2019s bonds for five years were quoted at about US$4 million upfront and US$100,000 annually, signaling around 56 per cent likelihood of default, according to ICE Data Services.

I definitely do 'memorise', but not in the way that people do in school.\"\n\nCramming, he believes, is the opposite of actual learning. He decries strategies such as using flashcards - \"you're actually getting worse at geography by doing so, by ignoring what the subject is all about\".\n\nHe says: \"Learning the relationships between things is a million times more useful than cramming names, which far too many people do and which I feel the quiz culture unfortunately incentivises. The same is true about the Singaporean and broader Asian education systems.\"\n\nHe maintains that his interest is not in pure geography, but rather in history, anthropology and comparative linguistics, all of which \"depend on geography and the interactions of people with the world\".\n\n\"Geography alone is boring,\" he says.\n\nHe has a reputation as a conservative buzzer. \"Maybe other people who take more risks have a more refined thought process, but mine is just a single Boolean if-loop,\" he says.\n\nThe Boolean if-loop refers to a data type in coding, in which an \"if\" statement provided can be answered only by \"true\" or \"false\". Similarly, if Mr Zeng is asked a question he can answer, he responds by buzzing.

Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.\n\nDr Goldman said the new CDC guidance was comparable to an \"off-ramp\" from the pandemic, even though new variants could still emerge and the country's health system, and public, is not equipped for another surge in cases.\n\nThe daily average number of coronavirus cases has dropped 63 per cent, and the average number of hospitalisations has dropped 44 per cent in the US over the past 14 days, according to a New York Times database, continuing a steady trend of declining coronavirus numbers nationally.\n\nThe daily average number of deaths is still roughly 1,900 - a 23 per cent drop over the past two weeks - but that is expected to fall further soon because of the lag between hospitalisation and death rates.\n\nThe new CDC guidelines encourage counties to not just use case rates to calculate the risk for communities but also include hospitalisation figures.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Harmon, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement in response to the new recommendations that he would continue to wear a mask \"in most indoor public settings\", and he urged all Americans to do the same.\n\n\"We must remain adaptable and vigilant in confronting this unpredictable virus,\" Dr Harmon said.\n\nThe CDC guidance came after several states, including Illinois, Connecticut and New York, made moves to end or phase out mask mandates.\n\nIn Colorado, Governor Jared Polis said last Friday that the state would end its coronavirus emergency response and that residents had \"earned the right to move beyond the pandemic in your lives\".\n\n\"There is no claiming victory with regards to the virus,\" Mr Polis said.\n\n\"The virus is here and will likely be here for the rest of our lives. But it is time to acknowledge that we have reached a point in Colorado where Coloradans who are fully vaccinated can freely live without undue fear.\"\n\nAlso last Friday, Governor Gavin Newsom of California lifted 19 executive actions related to the pandemic and said another 18 would be lifted on March 31, although its emergency declaration remains in place.\n\nDr Rochelle Walensky, the CDC's director, was asked in a call with reporters last Friday about the timing of the new guidance and how it related to decisions by states to drop restrictions.\n\nShe said that the agency had been planning to shift the metric to hospitalisations for some time and that many state policies \"will coincide with exactly what we are recommending\".\n\nDr Esther Choo, an emergency medicine physician at the Oregon Health and Science University, said on Twitter that making hospitalisations the sole metric \"means allowing a high burden of disease and\u00a0having a delayed response that is slow to have impact on hospitalisations and death\".\n\nDr Goldman, of the Milken Institute, shared the same concern and said the current lull in infections should be used as an opportunity to prepare, including by ensuring that people have access to surgical masks instead of the less-effective cloth masks, and by improving testing resources in communities.\n\n\"The desire to walk away from this cannot just be that we are going to forget about it and fail to prepare for the next one,\" Dr Goldman said.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nUnited States\n\nCoronavirus\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nEnjoy a 512GB upgrade & free data roaming on this 5G plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nWhy Mighty Jaxx needs tech-first financial operations to power its global growth\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Only 1.2 per cent of US vodka imports came from Russia in the first half of 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which tracks such data.\n\nMany Russian-styled vodkas sold in the United States, including Smirnoff, Svedka and Stolichnaya, are actually made in other countries, including in the United States.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Those visiting Stoli's website now see an opening page with a pale blue and yellow dove carrying an olive branch on a white background.\n\nBelow the dove reads a message: \"Stoli Group stands for peace in Europe and in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nRussian Standard vodka, the most popular Russian-made vodka sold in the United States, is distributed by Moscow-based Roust Group and Roust International. It is also sold under the brand name Green Mark Vodka. Reuters was not able to reach a spokesperson late on Sunday.\n\nSome Canadian provinces, including Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, made similar moves last week, ordering provincial liquor stores to stop selling Russian-made brands.\n\nIn Texas, Gov Greg Abbott urged all liquor stores and restaurants in the state to stop serving Russian-made products on a voluntary basis. \"Texas stands with Ukraine,\" he said in a Twitter message.\n\nGet live updates as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nRussia\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Flip7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nExtra $200 off for new lines and port-ins on 5G Device Plan.\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Last week the benchmark hit a more than seven-year high of US$105.79 after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began.\n\nUS West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up US$5.34, or 5.8 per cent, at US$96.93 a barrel, after hitting a high of US$99.10 early in the day. WTI climbed to as much as US$100.54 last week.\n\nRussia accounts for about 10 per cent of global oil supply.\n\n\u201cMoves by the US and Europe to remove certain Russian banks from the Swift system have raised fears of a disruption to supply of some sort in the near term,\u201d said ANZ commodity strategist Daniel Hynes.\n\n\u201cThe risk to supply is the greatest we\u2019ve seen for some time and it comes in a tight market,\u201d he said.\n\nOil supply was already struggling to meet the demand recovery from rebounding economies, and any disruptions to flows from the world\u2019s No. 3 producer could sharply exacerbate the tightness. China and other buyers have paused purchases of Russia\u2019s flagship Urals grade, while some Asian customers are frantically trying to secure more Middle Eastern crude.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

BP also moved to dump its shares in Russian oil giant Rosneft PJSC, taking a financial hit of as much as US$25 billion (S$33.8 billion).\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has roiled markets from energy to metals and grains, heaping more inflationary pressure on a global economy already hit with surging costs.\n\nAgainst this volatile and fast-moving backdrop, Opec+ faces a trickier task than usual when it meets on Wednesday to discuss its supply policy for April. Despite the invasion, the cartel will probably stick to its plan of gradually increasing oil production, according to delegates. The group will also have to take into account the halt of some Iraqi output.\n\nDemand destruction is the only thing that can stop oil shooting higher after additional curbs were unleashed on Russia, according to Goldman Sachs Group. The bank raised its one-month forecast for Brent to US$115 a barrel, from US$95, with significant upside risks on further escalation or longer disruption.\n\nRussia pumped 11.3 million barrels of oil a day in January, according to data from the International Energy Agency. The IEA pledged last week to help ensure global energy security, while India said it would support initiatives to release emergency oil reserves to help calm prices.\n\n\u201cThe surge that we\u2019re seeing today was guaranteed, given the considerable deterioration of the Ukraine situation over the weekend,\u201d said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights. \u201cMarkets should brace for plenty of aftershocks.\u201d\n\nThe surprise move by BP is the latest sign of how far the West is willing to go to punish President Vladimir Putin for the invasion. The oil major has been in Russia for three decades and was staunchly defending its presence there just weeks ago. Norway\u2019s Equinor ASA also said it will stop new investments into its Russian business and start the process of exiting joint ventures.\n\nAdditionally, Societe Generale and Credit Suisse Group stopped financing commodities trading from Russia, according to people familiar with the matter. The two banks, key financiers to commodity trading houses, are no longer providing the money needed to move raw materials such as metals and oil from Russia.\n\nThe UK would support Group of Seven nations setting limits on the amount of Russian oil and gas its members could import \u201cover time,\u201d Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told Sky News on Sunday. Russia\u2019s military \u201cis funded by revenues from oil and gas,\u201d so we want to cut its dependency on them, Ms\u00a0Truss said.\n\nGet live updates as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\nSee more on\n\nOil prices/Crude oil\n\nEmbargoes and economic sanctions\n\nRussia\n\nUkraine\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nSave up to $710 with SIM only 5G Star Plan!\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Fold7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Still, it had so far mainly focused on military targets.\n\nCiting a Russian offensive on the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, the official cited early indications that Russia might be adopting siege tactics.\n\n\"It appears that they are adopting a siege mentality, which any student of military tactics and strategy will tell you, when you adopt siege tactics, it increases the likelihood of collateral damage,\" the official said.\n\nSo far, the Russian offensive cannot claim any major victories. Russian has not taken any Ukrainian city, does not control Ukraine's airspace, and its troops remained roughly 30km\u00a0from Kyiv's city centre for a second day, the official said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But it has rapidly increased the number of forces Moscow has sent into Ukraine in recent days.\n\nNuclear risk\n\nThe Pentagon learnt\u00a0of the heightened Russian alert for its nuclear forces from Mr Putin's televised announcement, the senior US defence official said, instead of from American intelligence sources.\n\nJust after Mr Putin spoke, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the top US commander for Europe, General Tod Wolters, held a pre-scheduled meeting at 8.30am (1330 GMT) at which they discussed the Russian president's decision.\n\nAlthough Washington was still gathering information, Mr Putin's move was troubling, the official said.\n\n\"It's clearly, essentially, putting in play forces that, if there's a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous,\" the official said.\n\nAsked whether the US would continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine following Mr Putin's announcement, the official said: \"That support is going to go forward.\"\n\nMr Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and retired CIA paramilitary officer, said he believed Mr Putin's decision to elevate the alert of his nuclear forces was a reaction to battlefield losses.\n\n\"Russia placing its nuclear forces on alert is incredibly reckless and a clear indication that Putin realises his military is not performing as expected in Ukraine,\" Mr Murloy said.\n\nGet live updates as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nRussia\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Flip7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nWhy businesses need to understand the differences in Chinese Renminbi (CNH vs CNY)\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

He was negative.\n\nWhen the boy threw up and began running a fever, his parents took him to a doctor first thing the next morning, only to be told it was likely to be food poisoning and gave him medication to soothe his tummy and bring down the fever.\n\nThe next day, he was almost back to his normal self and no longer seemed as tired as before.\n\nBut on the fourth day, Madam Ling herself began developing symptoms. \"I was really, really tired; I couldn't sit in front of my computer for long,\" said the 46-year-old, who works in the media industry. \"I couldn't even get myself to do a test for the virus.\"\n\nHer husband had to help administer an antigen rapid test. It was positive.

She had mild symptoms.\n\nShe then packed away the living room mattress and isolated in the master bedroom with her son.\n\nApart from a 38.5 deg C fever and a little cough for two days, the boy was well from the third day.\n\n\"He was pretty much on his own, only needed to feed him and clean him up. Taking care of my son while feeling under the weather wasn't very tough. I tried to cook very simple meals like porridge in the rice cooker.

It is the moment to stand up and to speak out.\n\n\"Might does not make right. Never did. Never will,\" he said.\n\nThe 27-nation EU on Sunday decided for the first time in its history to supply weapons to a country at war. A source told Reuters it would send \u20ac450 million (S$683 million) of weaponry to Ukraine.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Hundreds were stranded in Kyiv on Sunday waiting for trains to take them west, away from the fighting.\n\nThe capital remained in Ukrainian government hands, with President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky rallying his people daily despite Russian shelling of civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe EU shut all Russian planes out of its airspace,\n\nas did Canada, forcing Russian airline Aeroflot to cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice. With flight options dwindling, the United States and France urged their citizens to consider leaving Russia immediately.\n\nThe EU also banned the Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik.\n\nGermany, which had already frozen a planned undersea gas pipeline from Russia, said it would increase defence spending massively, casting off decades of reluctance to match its economic power with military clout.\n\nBritish oil major BP, the biggest foreign investor in Russia, said it was\n\nabandoning its stake in state oil company Rosneft\n\nat a cost of up to US$25 billion (S$34 billion), shrinking its oil and gas reserves in half.\n\n'Not deterrence but threat'\n\nBut Mr Putin, who has\n\ncalled the invasion a \"special operation\",\n\nthrust an alarming new element into play when he ordered Russia's \"deterrence forces\" - which wield nuclear weapons - onto high alert.\n\nHe has justified the invasion by saying \"neo-Nazis\" rule Ukraine and threaten Russia's security - a charge Kyiv and Western governments say is baseless propaganda.\n\nOn Sunday, he cited aggressive statements by Nato leaders and the raft of economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the West.\n\n\"Not only do Western countries take unfriendly measures against our country in the economic dimension - I mean the illegal sanctions that everyone knows about very well - but also the top officials of leading Nato countries allow themselves to make aggressive statements with regards to our country,\" he said on state television.\n\nMr Putin previously referred to his nuclear arsenal in a speech announcing the start of the invasion last Thursday, saying Russia's response to any country that stood in its way would be immediate and carry \"consequences that you have never encountered in your history\".\n\nMr Borrell, at a news conference in Brussels, said Russia had clearly threatened a nuclear attack on countries supporting Ukraine after the invasion. \"We are afraid that Russia is not going to stop in Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nUS Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the UN Security Council: \"This is another escalatory and unnecessary step that threatens us all. It means that President Putin is continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable. We urge Russia to tone down this dangerous rhetoric regarding nuclear weapons.\"\n\nA US defence official said Washington was trying to assess what Mr Putin's announcement meant, but that it increased the danger from any miscalculation.\n\nIn the strongest economic sanctions yet, the US and Europe said last Saturday that they would banish big Russian banks from the main global payments system Swift, and announced other measures to limit Moscow's use of a US$630 billion war chest.\n\nThe president of neutral Switzerland said he\n\nexpected his government to follow the EU on Monday\n\nin sanctioning Russia and freezing Russian assets.\n\nIn New York, the UN Security Council convened a rare emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly, or all the UN's 193 member states, for Monday.\n\nRolling protests have been held around the world against the invasion, including in Russia, which has clamped down hard on them.\n\nAlmost 6,000 people have been detained at anti-war protests since last Thursday, the OVD-Info protest monitor said.\n\nTens of thousands of people across Europe marched in protest, including more than 100,000 in Berlin.\n\nBattle for Kharkiv\n\nA Ukrainian state news agency said that Russian troops had blown up a natural gas pipeline in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, sending a burning cloud into the sky.\n\nSoon after, Russian armour rolled into Kharkiv, in north-west Ukraine, and witnesses reported firing and explosions. But city authorities said the attack had been repelled.\n\nReuters was unable to corroborate the information.\n\nUkrainian forces also appeared to be holding off Russian troops advancing on Kyiv but the Ukrainian armed forces described Sunday as \"a difficult time\" for the military, saying Russian troops \"continue shelling in almost all directions\".\n\nSatellite imagery taken on Sunday and released by the private Maxar Technologies showed a 5km long convoy of Russian ground forces including tanks approximately 64km away heading towards Kyiv. Reuters could not independently verify the images.\n\n\"We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on,\" Mr Zelensky said in the latest of several video messages from the streets of Kyiv.\n\nHe has declined to leave the city and has been marshalling combatants and civilians, many of whom have sought shelter in underground railway stations.\n\nA UN relief agency said more than 368,000 refugees had crossed into neighbouring countries, clogging railways, roads and borders.\n\nAt least 352 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed and 1,684 people have been wounded, Ukraine's Health Ministry said.\n\nA UN agency reported 64 civilian deaths and a Ukrainian presidential adviser said 4,500 Russian soldiers had been killed. Reuters was not able to verify the numbers.\n\n\"The Russian army does not threaten civilians in Ukraine. It is not shelling civilian infrastructure,\" Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the UN Security Council.\n\nMoscow acknowledged that Russian soldiers had been killed and wounded, but said its losses were far lower than those suffered by Ukraine, the Interfax news agency reported. It said Russian attacks had hit 1,067 Ukrainian military sites. Moscow has not released casualty figures.\n\nUkraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, won independence from Moscow in 1991 at the fall of the Soviet Union and has pushed to join the Nato Western military alliance and the EU, goals Russia vehemently opposes.\n\nGermany, which is sending anti-tank weapons, surface-to-air missiles and ammunition to Ukraine, said on Sunday said it would boost defence spending to more than 2 per cent of its economic output in response to the attack, ending its post-WWII\u00a0practice.\n\n\"There could be no other answer to Putin's aggression,\" Chancellor Olaf Scholz told lawmakers.\n\nGet live updates as the Ukraine crisis unfolds.\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nUN\n\nRussia\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nBuilt for Apple Intelligence.

But I think it's comparable to when your child had a cough, cold or runny nose before the pandemic - you don't bring him or her to the emergency department at the first sign of a sniffle or fever.\"\n\nIn\n\nits daily Covid-19 update on Sunday,\n\nMOH said 57 children under 12 were currently hospitalised with Covid-19. One required oxygen but none were in intensive care.\n\nThere were 14,064 new local cases, with 1,553 people in hospital. A total of 214 needed supplemental oxygen and 46 required intensive care.\n\nThe ministry added that nearly 222,000 children aged five to 11 have had at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, while another 14,000 have registered to get the jab. There are more than 300,000 children in this age group.\n\nBoth doctors acknowledged that some parents may still have concerns about vaccination. But they stressed that scientific data shows inoculation helps reduce a child's chances of getting infected, as well as the risk of developing symptoms that could require hospitalisation if he or she contracts the virus.\n\nThe Health Sciences Authority said in a safety update last week that Singapore has seen\n\n10 cases of children aged five to 11 with serious side effects after vaccination,\n\nout of a total of 238,253 doses administered to this age group as at Jan 31.\n\nVaccination can also help protect others who come into contact with children on a regular basis, Dr Kam said.\n\n\"Children who go to childcare can bring back the infection,\" she added. \"We have seen many cases in KKH where a younger sibling was admitted because he was infected by someone in the household.\"\n\nDr Leow said Covid-19 cannot be compared to other childhood diseases which have vaccines but where there is less urgency for parents to consider whether the jabs are needed, because the risk of contracting the coronavirus is currently much higher on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\"While it is still ultimately up to the parents to decide, I think they need to bear in mind that withholding the vaccination is also subjecting the child to the risk of developing severe Covid-19 or its complications,\" she added.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nMinistry of Health\n\nHospitals\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nSave up to $710 with SIM only 5G Star Plan!\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Fold7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

She was 84.\n\nHer son, Jack Krane, said the cause was heart failure.\n\nIn her decades-long career in film and television, Kellerman was best known for her role as the strait-laced but alluring army nurse in MASH, which landed her rave reviews and a Golden Globe Award.\n\nThe film, directed by Robert Altman, broke ground with its irreverence and graphic depiction of a group of hotshot surgeons struggling to save horribly wounded soldiers at an Army surgical unit during the Korean War.\n\nWhen MASH was adapted into the television series M*A*S*H, Kellerman's character was played by Loretta Swit.\n\nKellerman, who was born in Long Beach, California, on June 2, 1937, made her film debut in a 1957 movie called Reform School Girl, in which she had one line.\n\nIn the 1960s, she racked up more than 30 television appearances on shows including The Outer Limits and Star Trek.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

I was always a sophisticated, hard-bitten drunk or the wife being beaten by her husband. But I'm still Hot Lips to everyone.\"\n\nIn addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Claire Kellerman Krane. Another daughter, Hannah Krane, died in 2016.

But the broader political world has been watching closely for any signs that Republicans might be ready to jettison the twice-impeached Trump and elevate newer conservative voices to the national stage ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nIn the hypothetical case that Trump does not run, 61 per cent of respondents said they would back DeSantis in the party's presidential primary, far ahead of ex-secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Donald Trump Jr, each of whom received six per cent support.\n\nTrump received rapt applause Saturday when he addressed CPAC, reprising his false claims of a stolen 2020 election and praising a \"smart\" Vladimir Putin despite the Russian president overseeing a deadly invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

When should I head to the emergency department?\n\nA:\n\nChildren should be taken to the emergency department if they have a persistent fever that lasts more than five days, or have difficulty breathing, both doctors said.\n\nOther warning signs are if the child is eating less than half of what he or she usually does, or is very lethargic - for example, sleeping all the time and showing no interest in play.\n\nYou do not need to take the child to the emergency department the moment he or she tests positive for Covid-19, or is showing flu-like symptoms such as a fever or cough, Dr Leow said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Should I wait for him to turn 12 before taking him for vaccination, so he can get the full adult dose?\n\nA:\n\nGiven the current surge in Omicron cases, delaying vaccination may mean that your child could get infected before age 12, Dr Kam said.\n\nAt present, younger children aged five to 11 are given a 10 microgram dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, compared with 30 micrograms for adults.\n\nEven with smaller vaccination doses, children will still produce antibodies, which will protect them against the virus, Dr Kam added. \"I would suggest not to wait, because waiting is like betting against their chances of getting infection, and I think that is not worth it.\"\n\nQ: What does it mean for children to become severely ill with Covid-19? Does the Omicron variant make any difference to the type of medical conditions they develop?\n\nA:\n\nMost children with Covid-19 do not fall severely ill, and even those who are hospitalised can typically be discharged within three days.\n\nHowever, those with severe Covid-19 may develop ailments such as pneumonia and croup, an inflammation of the voice box and windpipe. Some may also experience seizures or brain infections.\n\nIn such cases, children are normally hospitalised for more than three days.\n\nCroup and seizures are more commonly seen in children these days, compared with last year when the Delta variant was dominant, Dr Leow said.\n\nThere is also the risk of\n\nmulti-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which happens two to eight weeks after a child has been infected\n\n- even after the body has already cleared the virus, Dr Kam said.\n\nMIS-C is a rare condition in which different body organs - such as the heart, lungs and liver - become inflamed. Local data shows that one in every 1,000 children infected with Covid-19 will develop MIS-C. The condition can be serious, with affected children requiring intensive care.\n\nQ: What symptoms should I look out for if I think my child has Covid-19?\n\nA:\n\nMost people develop a cough, fever and other flu-like symptoms when they contract Covid-19. But it is not uncommon for some to start vomiting or having diarrhoea as well, Dr Kam said.\n\nIf you believe your child has come into close contact with a Covid-19 patient, and is having symptoms such as a fever and slight cough on top of diarrhoea and vomiting, it is advisable to point this out to your doctor, she added.\n\nParents should also test their child for Covid-19 using an antigen rapid test kit.\n\nQ: My child is too young to be vaccinated. Are there any special precautions I should take to keep them safe?\n\nA:\n\nYou should abide by the usual precautions - practise social distancing, wash your hands regularly and wear your mask properly when you are outside the house, Dr Leow said.\n\nAs it tends to be more difficult to get children under five to wear their masks properly and maintain a safe distance from other people, parents should remind them to do so frequently.\n\nThey should also try to keep children who are unwell at home instead of taking them to school, she suggested. This is because the risk of infecting others is higher as young children are often not able to abide by safe distancing measures.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nChildren and youth\n\nHospitals\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Flip7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nMarina Bay views, vibrant neighbourhood charm and easy city access: Live next to the rejuvenated Golden Mile Complex\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nHow To Avoid Common Career Planning Mistakes\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

And I think we should all have that,\" she adds.\n\nTo prepare for the role, Chastain - who trained at New York's Juilliard performing arts school - studied Bakker for seven years, poring over hours of recordings to memorise her mannerisms and vocal inflections.\n\nShe also had to put on facial prosthetics and Bakker's trademark heavy make-up and false eyelashes, a process that took four to seven hours each time.\n\n\"It was one of the most extreme transformations I've ever done,\" says Chastain, who is also an executive producer on the film.\n\n\"A lot of people say make-up is a mask, but I think for Tammy Faye, and for a lot of people, it's not a way of covering up who you are, but self-expression.\n\n\"She used make-up to describe how she'd feel inside and it made her feel beautiful. So, for me, it was a celebration of the transformation that she would make, every day, into that world of beauty and wonder.\"\n\nThe film also highlights how Bakker was so much more than the husband who dragged her down.\n\nChastain says: \"She was the ordained minister Jim wasn't. She preached acceptance and compassion and meant it, and that's what I wanted people to see in this film.\n\n\"When everyone turned their backs on people with HIV and Aids, she invited a high-profile gay pastor who had Aids to be on her show.\"\n\nBakker also hosted Christian network shows all day, released 24 albums and \"never got paid for any of it - she gave her money to the church\".\n\nThe actress says: \"And she was never embarrassed. People were drawn to her because she was unique.

State media released two photos showing the Korean peninsula seen from space.\n\nDeveloping a military reconnaissance satellite is among a number of advancements leader Kim Jong Un called for last year, including recently tested hypersonic weapons.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Please donate to help Ukraine or spread the link to donate,\" said one person.\n\nSome also pointed out that Cena's words didn't make sense anyway, given that Peacemaker is a morally ambiguous character, having started as a secondary antagonist in film-maker James Gunn's Suicide Squad movie (2021) before receiving his own spin-off show on HBO Max - where he remains both jingoistic and homicidal.\n\n\"John, this is in poor taste. Also, your character is not the good guy,\" one netizen said.\n\nCena did not directly respond to the backlash. But he did tweet on Saturday night, \"Sometimes, the most productive choice is to rest. Disconnect. Take time off.\"\n\nLast May, Cena caused another fracas on social media - albeit among fans in China - when he referred to Taiwan as a \"country\".

But her husband Ashton Kutcher - who played her love interest Michael Kelso on the American comedy - tweeted \"I stand with Ukraine\" last Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, American actress Hayden Panettiere, 32, who shares a seven-year-old daughter with her ex-fiance, Ukrainian former boxer Wladimir Klitschko, urged her fans to \"stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the people of Ukraine\".\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Bhaskar, a dancer-choreographer who was 14 years her senior. They ran Bhaskar's Academy of Dance, renamed Bhaskar's Arts Academy in 1993, together.\n\nWhile she was trained in classical Indian dance techniques, Mrs Bhaskar was keenly interested in other dance forms.\n\nIn her recollections for the Singapore Memory Project, she said it was \"divinely decided\" that she would come to Singapore to teach and serve.\n\n\"I really liked the multiculturalism that I found here in the 1950s. It was all about respecting each other's cultures, living and performing together. I've been influenced by Chinese and Malay dance, as well as other dance styles like ballet. If I were in India, that wouldn't have happened because I wouldn't even have seen Chinese dance. I came to Singapore and saw the beauty of other cultures,\" she said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

The trio would visit one another's homes in the 1950s and 1960s to learn one another's dance techniques.\n\nZubir Said, who composed the National Anthem, was the Bhaskars' neighbour in Joo Chiat and a frequent collaborator.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic did not stop her from creating new works. She also experimented with creating works for digital media.\n\nShe was present for the launch of the Singapore International Festival of Arts (Sifa) last week, spry and alert, and happy to be commissioned for Ceremonial Enactments, one of the festival's headline productions.\n\nA spokesman for Bhaskar's Arts Academy said: \"We are all shocked with this sudden and unexpected loss. Her dedication to the arts till her final breath is reflective of her life journey.\"\n\nDancer-choreographer-teacher Shantha Ratii, who is in her 60s, took her first dance steps as a five-year-old under Mrs Bhaskar's tutelage. She said of Mrs Bhaskar: \"She's like a mother who holds the hands of a child who takes her first steps. Her work was her oxygen. I don't think she even looked at it as work. She went about it with a smile and so much grace.\"\n\nMr Ivan Heng, 57, founder and artistic director of Wild Rice, said Mrs Bhaskar was in discussions with him to stage a festival tribute to Mr Bhaskar, who died in 2013 from a heart-related illness.\n\nHe said: \"She was constantly innovating and always so curious about what makes Singapore multicultural.

And her inspiration and ideas, her life's work as a dancer, choreographer, teacher, were dedicated to exploring and expressing that soul.\"\n\nMs Sharon Tan, 56, director of the National University of Singapore's Centre for the Arts, said that Mrs Bhaskar had been an inspiration as the centre's longest-serving tutor since 1977.\n\nShe \"grounded the students in the fundamentals of the traditional art form and yet was always up to the challenge of examining current issues and working with new disciplines and new areas of knowledge\", added Ms Tan.\n\n\"She set an example as one who was always curious, always learning and always growing. She will be dearly missed.\"\n\nMr Tan Boon Hui, 50, executive director of Arts House Limited which organises Sifa, expressed his condolences to the family: \"Today Singapore mourns the loss of one of our cultural icons.\"\n\nFestival director Natalie Hennedige, 47, noted that everyone addressed Mrs Bhaskar lovingly as Auntie: \"The legacy of Mrs Santha Bhaskar will continue to kindle our arts scene, reminding us to uphold what she stood for - grace, kindness, dedication and belief in the beauty of the dance.\"\n\nMs Menaka Gopalan, executive director of the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society, said that Mrs Bhaskar's enthusiasm was infectious and her quiet humility was inspiring. \"We shall always miss the bright smile, the gentle encouragement, the creative genius and the gifted artist,\" she said.\n\nMrs Bhaskar leaves behind three children, four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nObituary\n\nPerforming arts\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Fold7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nAmidst Currency Volatility, Hedging Matters Now More Than Ever, Especially for Growing Businesses\n\nRead more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Leading away from the site were bloody footprints.\n\nThe fighting on Saturday, part of a seesaw battle in northern parts of Kyiv, left Russian trucks and a tracked vehicle smouldering on a highway. And it signalled that, though vastly outgunned, Ukraine's army and a growing corps of civilian volunteers are mounting a spirited defence of the capital.\n\nHours after the 4am firefight, the streets - deserted a day earlier - came partly back to life. People stood in lines at ATMs, stocked up on essentials, donated blood or went to sites where guns were handed out. Air raid sirens wailed every hour or so.\n\nWhile military experts say the odds are stacked against them, for now, the combined Ukrainian defence forces have defied expectations by slowing and in some cases halting the Russian army's advance, apparently upsetting Moscow's war plans.\n\nThe change has been swift, for some almost bewilderingly so.\n\nWhat just three days ago had been a bustling, modern European capital, with copious restaurants, bars and cafes, slipped into an eerie war footing faster than seemingly imaginable. Vans and cars with armed men without uniforms careened along the streets. Checkpoints went up seemingly at every stoplight, with men and women in civilian clothes, carrying rifles and stopping cars.\n\n\"When I heard the explosions, I decided that I am ready,\" said Ms Olena Sokolan, a business manager who received a rifle to help defend the capital. \"I am an adult woman, I am healthy and it's my responsibility.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

According to his brothers in arms, Vitaly got in touch and said he was going to blow up the bridge.

This is one for the history books,\" Ms Inger Andersen, head of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), told Agence France-Presse last week.\n\nThe exact scope of the treaty remains to be defined. There are competing proposals being drafted ahead of a three-day UN environment summit starting today in Nairobi. World leaders and environment ministers meeting in person and virtually are expected to kick-start the treaty process by appointing a negotiating committee to finalise the policy details over the next two years. But more than 50 countries, along with scientists, businesses and environment groups, have publicly called for tough new regulations on industry to curb the torrent of plastic entering the environment.\n\nThis could include caps on the production of new plastic - which is made from oil and gas, and forecast to double by 2040 - redesigning products to make recycling easier or less harmful, and phasing out single-use items.\n\nMany countries, including major plastic producers like the United States and China, have expressed general support for a treaty, but stopped short of endorsing any specific measures.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Less than 10 per cent is recycled, with most ending up in landfills or the oceans.\n\nBy some estimates, a garbage truck's worth of plastic is dumped in the sea every minute, choking marine life and befouling coastlines around the globe.

Protect our energy security.\"\n\nThe crux of the industry's argument is that any effort to restrain drilling in America makes a world already reeling from high oil prices more dependent on oil and gas from Russia, a rival and belligerent fossil fuel superpower.\n\nThe industry's demands have focused on reversing steps the Biden administration has taken to start reining in the production of fossil fuels, the main driver of climate change.\n\nThe administration should release permits for drilling on federal lands, the lobby urged, and push ahead with leasing more tracts for offshore oil and development.\n\nThe API, which condemned the invasion, also called on President Joe Biden to accelerate permits for energy infrastructure and to roll back legal and regulatory uncertainty - industry speak for getting rules and lawsuits out of the way.\n\nThe crisis has given the industry \"a great talking point\", said finance professor Kathy Hipple at the MBA in Sustainability programme at Bard College and a research fellow at the Ohio River Valley Institute, a non-profit think-tank that focuses on oil and gas.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

To my mind, that's not resilient,\" she said.\n\nEnvironmental groups criticised the industry's logic. \"It's pretty rich for the oil and gas industry to talk about how reliable fossil fuels are when any big storm that happens, anytime a war pops up, their reliability is thrown into question,\" said Mr Nathaniel Stinnett, founder and executive director of the Environmental Voter Project, a group that mobilises voters in elections.\n\n\"Wars aren't fought over solar energy. You don't see these huge price spikes in clean energy,\" he said.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers began to echo the oil and gas industry's demands. \"It's now clearer than ever what is at stake when anti-American energy policies make us and Europe more dependent on Russian oil and natural gas,\" said Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican and GOP leader of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n\n\"I continue to urge President Biden to restore America's energy dominance. It's our most powerful weapon against Putin,\" she said.\n\nMr Biden's attempts to quell concerns, promising that his administration will do everything it can to secure energy independence and \"limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump\", have fallen on deaf ears.\n\n\"You need to do much more. You need to get your boot off the neck of American energy producers,\" Senator Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican said in a video response.\n\nHe said the administration should, for example, revive the Keystone XL pipeline - the embattled project that would have carried petroleum from Canadian tar sands to Nebraska - and resume issuing drilling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe oil and gas lobby has been less vocal about putting sanctions on Russia's oil and gas capacity itself.\n\nIn fact, even as the US and Western Europe have imposed other economic sanctions and Germany has put Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline on hold, the Biden administration has so far held back on measures that directly affect Russian energy companies, instead focusing on banks as well as government officials and their families.\n\nSome of the industry's biggest drillers, including Shell, BP and Exxon Mobil, are involved in oil and gas projects in Russia.\n\nPolitical science professor and founding director of the Centre for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington Aseem Prakash said continued pressure from the climate community meant Mr Biden was unlikely to backslide on major climate-related decisions, such as his cancelling of the Keystone pipeline.\n\n\"But there could be surreptitious rollbacks, like less aggressive measures in terms of oil or shale leases.

The anti-war coalition is working!\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Twitter post on Saturday.\n\nAccording to a Saturday assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a US non-profit organisation, Russian forces attempted to take Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, as well as Chernihiv close to the border with Belarus, but abandoned that effort and are now heading towards Kyiv.\n\nIn the south, units that poured out of occupied Crimea have abandoned an eastward drive towards Odessa, heading instead towards the eastern city of Mariupol to trap Ukrainian forces dug into the long front lines of the separatist Donbas territories.\n\nOvernight, Russian air attacks hit critical infrastructure including an oil depot and gas pipeline.\n\nUkraine's general staff on Saturday said it had shot down a Russian transport aircraft capable of carrying airborne assault troops or equipment, as well as fighter jets and helicopters, claims that could not be independently verified.\n\nIt also said many Russian vehicles have stalled for lack of fuel.\n\nThe account of progress laid out by the Russian official was more upbeat.\n\nThe official said the main battle formations of the Ukrainian army in the south and east are being encircled and the country's air defences are mostly wiped out, assessments that do not line up with what some military analysts and officials in the US are saying.\n\nThe US estimates Russia has fired 250 cruise and ballistic missiles at airfields, air defence installations and other targets.\n\nIn Kyiv, the goal is not to capture the whole city but to put enough pressure on Mr Zelensky that he either flees or surrenders, the official said.\n\nMuch larger Russian units are forcing their way towards Kyiv.\n\nAfter that, a Russian-backed government-in-waiting will take control and eventually hold elections, the official said.\n\nUkraine would be carved into three parts: The eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk that Mr Putin recently recognised as independent states; a rump Ukraine under de facto Russian control that would pay for its own reconstruction; and the western regions of Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv, which are strongholds of pro-European sentiment that would be left alone.\n\nThe new, shrunken version of Ukraine would have no armed forces of its own. Its air space would, however, become part of the Russian air defence system and there might be a permanent Russian military presence, the official said.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nRussia\n\nUkraine\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nDefence and military\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nEnjoy a 512GB upgrade & free data roaming on this 5G plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nOwn a Coffee Machine for $1* with Nespresso Subscription\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Former Republican president Donald Trump, a climate change sceptic hostile to government regulation of industry, nominated three justices to the nine-member court, giving conservatives a 6-3 majority.\n\n\"Because we have the most conservative Supreme Court that we've had in decades, many of the people from the fossil fuel industry are asking the court to do all kinds of outrageous things to limit EPA authority,\" said Dr Robert Percival, director of the Environmental Law Programme at the University of Maryland.\n\nIn 2015, Democratic president Barack Obama unveiled his Clean Power Plan, which was intended to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal-and gas-burning plants and shifting energy production to clean sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

In either event, given how partisan gridlock (is in Congress) such a ruling would seriously threaten the national government's ability to address some of the nation's most pressing problems including, but not limited to, climate change.\"\n\nSeveral environmental protection groups have submitted their own briefs to the court in support of the EPA.\n\n\"In the absence of sustained efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" a group of climate scientists said, \"the total increase in temperature could surpass (5.6 deg C) - leading to physical and ecological impacts that would be irreversible for thousands of years, if ever.\"\n\n\"It is still possible to mitigate the human and economic costs of climate change if greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants and other sources can be reduced,\" they said. \"But such mitigation will require significant coordination at the federal level.\"\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nCourt trials\n\nEnvironmental issues\n\nClimate change\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Flip7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nOwn a Coffee Machine for $1* with Nespresso Subscription\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Russian forces entered the second-largest city of Kharkiv and blew up a gas pipeline, sparking huge explosions. The city's leaders later said Ukrainian fighters had repulsed the attack.\n\nThe Ukrainian authorities warned that Russia would continue to cause \"man-made disasters\" by assaulting chemical plants and critical infrastructure and asked residents to close their windows and take other safety precautions.\n\nUS officials said most of the more than 150,000 Russian troops which had been stationed around Ukraine were now engaged in battle.\n\nWhile asking citizens to keep fighting, President Volodymyr Zelensky also said he would hold talks without preconditions with Russia at its border with Belarus after he received assurances that \"all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarus territory will remain on the ground during the travel, negotiations and return of the Ukrainian delegation\". Details of exactly when the meeting would take place or who would participate were not immediately clear.\n\nThe United Nations has confirmed at least 240 civilian casualties since the invasion began but the real figures are likely to be considerably higher. Thousands of women and children continued to flee into neighbouring countries, prompting a plea from Pope Francis for humanitarian corridors.\n\nAt least 100,000 people are displaced internally in Ukraine while the numbers crossing into the European Union stood at more than 350,000. EU officials had forecast more than a million refugees in the event of war.\n\nAs Russia pushed ahead with its offensive to overthrow Ukraine's government and recreate its Cold War-era influence, Western nations stepped up commitments to equip the outnumbered Ukrainian forces with weapons and ammunition. The White House has asked Congress to authorise US$6.4 billion (S$8.7 billion) in emergency aid for Ukraine, which would be divided between humanitarian and military aid.\n\nGermany, the largest economy in the European Union, will send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles to Ukraine in a significant reversal of its restrictive arms export policy. \"There could be no other answer to Putin's aggression,\" Chancellor Olaf Scholz said during a special parliamentary session.\n\nItaly will match the pledge made by Germany, while the Czech Republic dispatched a train to Ukraine carrying machine guns, assault rifles and other weaponry. Romania, Poland, Greece and Portugal also announced military aid. Most European nations and Canada also shut their airspace to Russian aircraft.\n\nAlong with the decision to cut off some Russian banks from the Swift messaging service, the US and European nations imposed restrictions on Russia's Central Bank and limited the sale of \"golden passports\" that allow wealthy Russians to become citizens of Western countries. They also beefed up coordination against disinformation and other forms of hybrid warfare.\n\nThe measures are intended to undermine the Kremlin's ability to use its over US$630 billion of central bank reserves to blunt the impact of sanctions.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nUkraine\n\nRussia\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nGermany\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Flip7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nThe complete guide on payments to Chinese suppliers from Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

These include yachts, jets, cars and luxury apartments in the West that belong to Russian billionaires, according to a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the measure.\n\nThe governments also committed to limit the sale of citizenship - known as \"golden passports\" - to sanctioned Russians, which could allow them to skirt financial penalties, and to prevent their children from attending Western universities, the official said.\n\nMany assets are held in complex ownership structures, meaning it could take months or longer for the task force to find them and take them away. But even the threat of seizure could alarm Russian billionaires, many of whom own professional sports teams, travel in superyachts and private planes, and park their fortunes in London and New York real estate.\n\nThe decision is part of a package of sanctions designed to further isolate Russia's economy and financial system after initial penalties failed to persuade President Vladimir Putin to stop his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe US and its partners said the task force would ensure that already-announced sanctions on Russia's elite were applied to their possessions under Western jurisdictions.\n\nEven as the US, Britain and other nations sanctioned more than 100 Russian individuals and entities, assets of the elite mostly remained untouched.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Japan will join this initiative,\" Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said yesterday.\n\nMeasures to cut off some Russian banks from Swift and place restrictions on the Russian central bank's international reserves may fuel more market swings, including a renewed rush to safe-haven assets such as gold and Treasuries, investors said.\n\nHere is more about what the global interbank payment system does and why it matters:\n\nWhat is Swift?\n\nSwift, short for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly.\n\nBanks that connect to the Swift system and establish relationships with other banks can use Swift messages to make payments.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

This allows banks to process high volumes of transactions at speed.\n\nIt has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade.\n\nIn 2020, around 38 million Swift \"FIN messages\" were sent each day over the platform, according to its 2020 annual review. Each year, trillions of dollars are transferred using the system.\n\nWho owns Swift?\n\nFounded in the 1970s, Swift is a cooperative of thousands of member institutions that use the service.\n\nThe Belgium-based service made a profit of \u20ac36 million (S$55 million) in 2020, according to its 2020 annual review. It is run principally as a service to its members.\n\nWhy is a Swift ban so serious?\n\nExcluding Russian banks from Swift restricts the country's access to financial markets across the world.\n\nRussian companies and individuals will find it harder to pay for imports and receive cash for exports, borrow or invest overseas.\n\nRussian banks could use other channels for payments such as phones, messaging apps or e-mail. This would let Russian financial institutions make payments via banks in countries that have not imposed sanctions, but since alternatives are likely to be less efficient and secure, transaction volumes could fall and costs rise.\n\nHow would a Swift ban on Russia affect other countries?\n\nExporters would find selling goods to Russia riskier and more expensive.\n\nRussia is a big buyer of manufactured goods. The Netherlands and Germany are its second and third biggest trading partners, based on World Bank data, although Russia is not a top 10 export market for either country.\n\nChina is Russia's top trading partner.\n\nForeign buyers of Russian goods would also find it more difficult, potentially prompting them to seek alternative suppliers.\n\nBut when it comes to Russian oil and gas, foreign buyers could find it harder to find replacement suppliers. Russia is the main EU supplier of crude oil, natural gas and solid fossil fuels, according to the European Commission.\n\nIs Swift bound by economic sanctions?\n\nSwift is bound by Belgian and EU rules, which would include economic sanctions.\n\nSwift's website said: \"Whilst sanctions are imposed independently in different jurisdictions around the world, Swift cannot arbitrarily choose which jurisdiction's sanction regime to follow.\"\n\nIn March 2012, the EU barred Swift from serving Iranian firms and individuals that had been sanctioned in relation to Teheran's nuclear programme. The list included the central bank and other big banks.\n\nREUTERS\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nRussia\n\nBanks and financial institutions\n\nUkraine\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nEnjoy a 512GB upgrade & free data roaming on this 5G plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nOwn a Coffee Machine for $1* with Nespresso Subscription\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea's charitable foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea.\n\n\"I believe that currently they are in the best position to look after the interests of the club, players, staff, and fans.\"\n\nChelsea chairman Bruce Buck is also the chair of the club's foundation.\n\nWhile Abramovich did not refer to the situation in Ukraine or to the issue of sanctions, the club issued a statement condemning Russia's invasion yesterday.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Chelsea FC's thoughts are with everyone in Ukraine. Everyone at the club is praying for peace,\" the club said.\n\nIt is understood Abramovich took the decision in order to protect the Blues from reputational damage as war rages in Ukraine and also from his close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Telegraph reported the oligarch will remain owner of the club. He has a reported US$14 billion (S$18.9 billion) fortune, and is not looking to sell the European and world champions, who are valued at about \u20ac1.9 billion (S$2.9 billion), according to KPMG.\n\nBlues manager Thomas Tuchel admitted late last week there was uncertainty over Abramovich's future as owner because of the conflict.\n\n\u00a31.5b\n\nFunds provided by Roman Abramovich to Chelsea over the past 19 years.\n\n\"We should not pretend this is not an issue,\" he said. \"The situation in general for me and for my staff, the players, is horrible. Nobody expected this. It's pretty unreal, like I said it's clouding our minds.\"\n\nLast week, using parliamentary privilege, Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran named Abramovich as one of 35 \"key enablers\" to Mr Putin who should be sanctioned.\n\nThe British government on Friday ordered that all British assets of Mr Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov be frozen owing to the hostilities. The British Treasury has also issued financial sanctions notices against the two men, adding them to a list of Russian oligarchs who have already had their property and bank accounts in the country frozen.\n\nWhile Abramovich is not on the list, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has refused to rule out the 55-year-old's inclusion.\n\nLabour MP Chris Bryant has already told the House of Commons that he should be stripped of his rights to own Chelsea.\n\nBritain is a favourite destination for oligarchs and their families, and has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent the flow of their money into the country.\n\nAbramovich has supplied Chelsea with \u00a31.5 billion (S$1.8 billion) worth of funding over the past 19 years.\n\nThey have enjoyed a period of unprecedented success as a result, winning five Premier League titles and two Champions League crowns among a vast haul of silverware since his takeover.\n\nOn his decision to take a more back-seat role, the Chelsea Supporters' Trust (CST) said: \"We note Mr Abramovich's statement and are seeking urgent clarification on what this statement means for the running of Chelsea.\n\n\"The CST board are ready to work with the trustees of the Chelsea Foundation in order to ensure the long-term interests of the club and supporters. We stand with the people of Ukraine.\"\n\nDue to visa issues, Abramovich has rarely been seen at Chelsea in recent years, although he was in Abu Dhabi earlier this month to watch the Blues win the Club World Cup for the first time.\n\nIn the meantime, he has attained both Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, while retaining his Russian passport.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, BLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nChelsea\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nRussia\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Fold7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nAd\n\nFlexible Monthly Plans From $40/month with Nespresso Subscription\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

This is the flexibility we have. We have different options and it is something we will continue to use and develop.\n\n\"We expected it to be tough. I want to congratulate my boys for staying cool and continuing to play their football instead of feeling nervous. They kept playing and eventually scored the three goals to get the win.\"\n\nThe Sailors signed Lopes last year for a league-record transfer fee of $2.9 million from then-Portuguese top-tier club Rio Ave. This season, they paid $2 million in transfer fees for Brazilian centre-back Pedro Henrique while securing free agent Kim Shin-wook on a salary package worth $3 million.\n\nWhile Belgian winger Lestienne joined on a free transfer, his salary at previous club Standard Liege was estimated at \u20ac900,000 (S$1.4 million) annually.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Sahil Suhaimi prodded the ball into the forward's path just outside the box and Bortoluzo unleashed a fierce left-footed drive into the net.\n\nBut the champions were determined to kick off their campaign with a win, especially after last season's runners-up Albirex Niigata suffered a shock 2-0 loss to Tanjong Pagar United on Friday.\n\nThey replied in the 23rd minute, making the most out of South Korean forward Kim's 1.98m frame. A free kick just outside the box from Shahdan Sulaiman found Kim unmarked, and he put away his header for his first league goal of the season to add to his brace in the previous Saturday's Community Shield win over Albirex.\n\nSubstitutes Hafiz, Lopes and Lestienne made the difference in the second half. In the 66th minute, Hafiz was released down the left flank and cut the ball back for the underlapping Iqram Rifqi, who tucked it away to give Sailors the lead.\n\nLestienne then marked his debut with an assist in the 86th minute, finding Lopes in the box during a counter-attack to make it 3-1.\n\nWith coaches allowed to make five changes this year, up from three last season, substitutions will be critical this season, as Hougang found out. Cheetahs coach Clement Teo acknowledged that his side had no answer to the changes Sailors were able to make.\n\nHe said: \"We'll take the positives from the first half, where we played positive football. I feel we could match them today and over the course of the season. But they can bring on players who are really good to change the game.\n\n\"It's tough for us but if teams like Liverpool and Chelsea can lose games, why not Sailors? We can't just give up and so mustn't the other teams. We must change our mindset. We can't compete financially but we can compete tactically.\"\n\nThe Sailors will next face Geylang International at Our Tampines Hub on Friday while Hougang take on Tanjong Pagar at the Jurong East Stadium on Sunday.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Premier League\n\nSingapore football\n\nFootball matches\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Flip7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nOwn a Coffee Machine for $1* with Nespresso Subscription\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.
