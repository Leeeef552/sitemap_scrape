However, Washington is bound by law to help Taiwan defend itself and is its main arms supplier.\n\nDaniel Russel, a predecessor of Stilwell until early in the Trump administration, said the \"Six Assurances\" had been a\"loosely-kept secret\" at best.\n\nHe said the decision to publish them looked like a compromise response to pressure from administration hawks to abandon \"strategic ambiguity\" - a long-standing policy of withholding a clear-cut US commitment to defend Taiwan while still showing sufficient support to deter any Chinese military adventurism.\n\nAmong the assurances made in 1982, but never formally made public, are statements that the United States has not set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan, nor agreed to prior consultation with Beijing on such sales, or to revise the Taiwan Relations Act that underpins US policy towards the island.\n\nThe assurances, Stilwell said, \"endure today.\" Douglas Paal, a former US representative to Taiwan, said the move appeared largely for show.\n\n\"My guess at this time is that Stilwell and the administration want to look tough ... So they are walking close to China's red lines, but remain unwilling to cross them.\"\n\nStilwell said the economic dialogue would \"explore the full spectrum of our economic relationship - semiconductors, healthcare, energy, and beyond, with technology at the core.\"\n\n\"While they may be interrelated, our relationship with Taiwan is not a subset of our bilateral relationship with the PRC,\" he said, referring to mainland China.\n\nMonday's announcements come several months after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, the world's biggest contract chipmaker, announced plans to build a $12 billion factory in Arizona as the Trump administration stepped up efforts to cut back supply chains dependency on China.\n\nTaiwan has been keen to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States, but a large US trade deficit, which Trump has been determined to reduce along with those of other trading partners, including China, has been an obstacle to this.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS foreign policy\n\nTaiwan\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/file7bfxthtqm0heftvi7dt.jpg?VersionId=CpjmqVfauR9CCougoQ3vZ9onBPTSLrO0", "alt_text": null}]}

He has repeatedly threatened to send federal government forces into the west coast city if Mayor Ted Wheeler does not crack down on the protests.\n\n\"Wheeler is incompetent, much like Sleepy Joe Biden,\" Mr Trump tweeted. \"This is not what our great Country wants.

Nonetheless, with our Singapore-China 'fast lane' in place, we hope to facilitate internship exchanges for students very soon, especially with Guangdong, once the implementation agreement on (the scheme) is signed,\" said Mr Ong.\n\nOn aviation, Mr Ong noted that China is the first country with which Singapore launched a \"fast lane\" arrangement for short-term and essential travel. Singapore is the first country in South-east Asia with such an arrangement with China.\n\nOn the sidelines of the meeting, Mr Ong told reporters that the quota of seats on flights under the fast lane arrangement - including 500 seats across two flights per week between Singapore and Guangdong's capital Guangzhou - was \"very underused\".\n\n15\n\nNumber of agreements Singapore firms and their partners signed at the Singapore-Guangdong Collaboration Council meeting yesterday.\n\n\"These are things that we will work on and officials will discuss in the coming months, and we hope we will have good progress,\" he said.\n\nBesides these areas, Mr Ong noted that two bilateral projects - the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City and the Singapore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative - have also made steady progress in the past year.\n\nThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City, and Singapore aims to partner the city in its long-term development in areas such as urban solutions and biomedicine.\n\nFor example, local medical technology start-up Star3D Material Development Company signed a memorandum of understanding with the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City Investment and Development Co to further develop and commercialise the use of dental 3D technology in China.\n\nThe firm, which is based in Singapore and has a factory in Shanghai, aims to set up a joint laboratory and research platform, and introduce projects in the digital dental field, said general manager Chen Baiqun.\n\nThe Singapore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative focuses on three key areas - digital connectivity, innovation and entrepreneurship, and tech talent exchange and development - and promotes greater ease of access to market opportunities in the Greater Bay Area and South-east Asia.\n\nGuangdong, China's most prosperous province, lies at the heart of the Greater Bay Area - a mega economic zone that comprises nine cities in the province, Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nLast year, bilateral trade between Singapore and Guangdong grew 1.9 per cent year on year to reach US$19 billion (S$25.8 billion). In the first half of this year, bilateral trade reached US$8.06 billion.\n\nThere were more than 3,100 Singapore projects in the province as of December last year, with cumulative investments of US$13.1 billion.\n\nBeyond the key cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Singapore businesses have also ventured to new Greater Bay Area cities such as Huizhou, tapping opportunities in sectors like smart city solutions and financial services.\n\nThe businesses include Keppel Data Centres, which is collaborating with China's Country Garden Holdings and Shenzhen Huateng Intelligent Technology to develop the Eco Smart data centre project in Huizhou's Tonghu Smart City.\n\nIt is Keppel's first greenfield data centre development in China, said a Keppel Data Centres spokesman.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nOng Ye Kung\n\nTrade", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_PACHINA01_5926511.jpg?VersionId=zfQlHrvu62Be9uZ.112sv9O.AjSkFy5h", "alt_text": "Guangdong Governor Ma Xingrui (on screen) with Singapore Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung (right), Enterprise Singapore chief executive Png Cheong Boon (on Mr Ong's right) and delegates from Enterprise Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry a"}]}

He also said officers in these agencies should be given more flexibility.\n\n\"I ask for civil servants and officers in statutory boards to be given more authority to exercise discretion,\" he said.\n\nSimilarly, Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang GRC) asked the Government to discard rigidity in policymaking so that the concerns of different groups of Singaporeans can be considered.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Firms must be bigger part of solution\n\nFind out what\u2019s new on\n\nST website and app.\n\nST PHOTO: ALPHONSUS CHERN\n\nFollow topic:\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nPublished\n\nSep 01, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nThe Government, employers and citizens will need to step up to the plate for the Singaporean workforce to hold its own in a competitive and rapidly changing market, said newly elected People's Action Party MP Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang GRC).\n\nBelow are excerpts from her maiden speech in Parliament yesterday:\n\nI believe Singapore can build a lasting competitive advantage by being the nation that learns the fastest.\n\nToday, I will focus on two things we must prioritise to do that. One, investing in our people and two, giving them opportunity...\n\nI believe it's time to go full throttle to help our people quickly acquire job-oriented skills and, crucially, to provide them immediate opportunities to use those skills in meaningful work.\n\nFor this to happen, employers must be a bigger part of the solution. First, they must take greater accountability for their employees' learning.\n\nSecond, they must be willing to give more Singaporeans a chance, and look beyond paper and past experience, instead making their hiring and career progression and retention decisions based on skills...\n\nGoogle launched its new Google Career Certificates programme, a collection of six-month-long courses designed to help participants get qualifications in high-paying, high-growth job fields without attending university...\n\nThe cost of this programme? The IT support certificate costs US$49 (S$67) a month, or US$300 for six months. That's less than what you and I get in SkillsFuture credit...\n\nOf course, we don't know how many of those who complete the Google Certificates programme will actually get jobs as a result, but it does paint what the future could look like: Employers developing their own or collaborating with higher-learning institutes and other partners to offer pre-skilling, upskilling and reskilling opportunities, from apprenticeships and traineeships, to short courses, to reskilling boot camps, along a lifelong learning path where they are able to quickly apply what they learn...\n\nTo increase opportunities for job seekers in particular, we also ask companies to consider if they can hire a little ahead of demand, or to loosen their screening criteria and take a chance on Singaporeans who may not look like the perfect fit in terms of paper qualifications and past industry experience, but have sufficient relevant skills to get in the door and the attitude to learn the rest on the job if they are just given the opportunity.\n\nSome companies will require support to do all this. For example, for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the Government can play a bigger role, creating platforms to train their employees at scale and at speed, while simultaneously helping the SMEs to transform and redesign their jobs where necessary. And of course, the Government is already helping...\n\nBut good policy in itself is not enough.\n\nPeople must also trust the implementation. Trust that they will be given a fair chance. But we also know the best schemes don't always work out for everyone.\n\nWe've met them. We've all met them among our residents, our friends - Singaporeans who don't feel they are being given a fair chance.\n\nThe 50-something PMET who was retrenched when his company was acquired and has gone for countless interviews, only to be told he is \"overqualified\" for the roles.\n\nThe 40-something banker who was first put on no-pay leave and then let go because he was told there was no business need, only to see a foreigner take his place two months later, while he himself is unable to get back into an industry that is supposed to be still growing.\n\nThe 30-something Malay accounts clerk who goes through countless job advertisements and interviews, only to find that many of the jobs are for Mandarin speakers only, as if computers and ledgers can speak only Mandarin.\n\nThe 20-something graduate, a few years out of school, who interviews for jobs that ask for experience, only to be offered a basic pay that he believes can only be called a low-ball offer, lower than what a fresh grad should be making.\n\nIf people get a bad taste that no matter how hard they work, the system is stacked against them, it leads to cynicism.\n\nAnd because we Singaporeans actually have a strong sense of fairness and rooting for the underdog, if people see too many people around them like that, it can lead to polarisation, which only hurts our competitiveness.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nHousing policy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_VNMARIAM_5926422.jpg?VersionId=8rxgpnSCecsIopHnug1Dynzk0SWEXeDY", "alt_text": "ST PHOTO: ALPHONSUS CHERN"}]}

Overall, cases in the state rose last week by more than 2,000, or 104%, according to a Reuters analysis.\n\nIn New York City, once the epicentre of the US outbreak, Mayor Bill de Blasio ruled out a resumption of indoor dining anytime soon for the city's thousands of restaurants.\n\n\"It would take a huge step forward to get to that point,\" de Blasio told a briefing on Monday.\n\nThe economic fallout from the pandemic has left the most populous U.S. city with a budget shortfall of rising costs and depressed revenue, prompting de Blasio to warn that 22,000 jobs may need to be cut.\n\nBut on Monday he said he would suspend layoffs \"on a day-to-day basis\" while municipal union leaders try to convince state lawmakers in Albany to go back into session and authorise the city to borrow several billion dollars in the long-term debt markets.\n\nNew Jersey and New York were the country's two hardest-hit states when the virus began spreading in the United States in the spring, but have since brought their infection rates down to among the nation's lowest.\n\nBy contrast, California, the country's most populous state, reported the most new cases of Covid-19 in August, with nearly 200,000 infections. The level is down from July, when California reported over 262,000 new cases, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nNationally, new cases fell 2 per cent last week, the sixth consecutive week of declines.

He promised that the festival would preserve the \"liveliness of contemporary cinema\".\n\nDespite its scaled-down size with theatre capacity reduced by about half, La Biennale di Venezia takes on greater importance this year due to the cancellation of rival film festivals across the globe, among them the glitzy Cannes Film Festival on the Cote d'Azur in France.\n\nBut just days ahead of the opening, organisers are scrambling to navigate unprecedented territory amid uncertain attendance and last-minute cancellations.\n\nWhereas actors Brad Pitt, Meryl Streep and Scarlett Johansson provided the star firepower at last year's festival, ongoing travel restrictions - especially a travel ban from the United States into Europe - mean that most Hollywood elites will be no-shows, along with actors and directors from China, India and South America.\n\nThose arriving from outside Europe's Schengen zone will have to submit results of a Covid-19 test just before their departure, with a second test carried out in Venice, meaning that some attendees may have to cancel.\n\nEarlier this week, the festival announced that American actor Matt Dillon would be a last-minute substitute on the jury for Romanian director Cristi Puiu.\n\nNo reason was given for Puiu's absence, but industry trade magazines noted he had given a speech earlier last month in which he said it was \"inhumane\" to watch movies with a mask on.\n\nThose confirmed as attending include, among others, British actress Tilda Swinton, Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, US director Oliver Stone and Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen.\n\nThe uncertain line-up of stars and dearth of top names leaves Australian actress Cate Blanchett, president of the jury, to take up the mantle of celebrity - and social activism - at Venice.\n\nShe was the leader of the #MeToo women's march up the red carpet steps at Cannes two years ago that sought to bring attention to the lack of parity and diversity in cinema.\n\nThe presence of Blanchett helps raise such awareness while the festival seeks to stanch criticism levelled in recent years over the glaring lack of women directors in festivals' top line-ups.\n\nThe Oscar-winning headliner told Variety magazine last Thursday that this year's eight women directors in the main competition in Venice is \"a direct response to the positive advances that have been made this year\".\n\nOthers say it is too early to tell whether a page has turned.\n\n\"It's all about being consistent and diligent and believing that women make movies as well as men, and using that in the way you programme,\" said Melissa Silverstein, founder and publisher of Women And Hollywood, which advocates for gender diversity and inclusion in film.\n\nLast year's festival opened under controversy after the inclusion in the line-up of French-Polish director Roman Polanski, who fled the US after his 1977 conviction for rape of a 13-year-old girl.\n\nThere were also only two female directors in the selection. In both 2018 and 2017, only one female director was represented.\n\nBlanchett said more was riding on the jury's decisions this year, given the limited opportunities for film-makers to show their work publicly, due to the coronavirus closures.\n\n\"So, whatever the deliberations the jury will make will be more impactful. I don't take that responsibility or privilege lightly.\"\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nFilm festivals/awards\n\nMovies", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/c2_2.jpg?VersionId=.iswKpy1XVdq6c.TtPaliM2x23ej1cyC", "alt_text": null}]}

He suggested a fair tenancy framework to provide a fair environment where SMEs can thrive, as well as a push for more cross-sector collaboration.\n\n\"Our approach with our workers is that we cannot save every job, but we will look after every worker. Our approach for our SMEs and entrepreneurs should be the same. While we cannot save every business, we should partner every entrepreneur to evolve, help them with a soft landing, provide them with a longer runway and help them restart.\"\n\nDon Wee\n\nChua Chu Kang GRC\n\nMr Wee, a senior vice-president at United Overseas Bank, asked for more to be done to ensure everyone starts from a similar playing field, and suggested setting aside more funds to scale up the KidStart programme, which helps children up till age six from low-income families.\n\nMr Wee also spoke about giving more support to small and medium-sized enterprises, making a constant effort to improve social mobility, and reducing stigmatisation of those with mental health issues.\n\n\"We must still ensure that everyone has a similar playing field to start from, and that should start from as young as pre-school. No system should stop parents from investing in their own children, but any system should attempt to minimise inequalities.\"\n\nGan Siow Huang\n\nMarymount\n\nMinister of State for Education and Manpower\n\nMs Gan, who was deputy chief executive of the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute, said there are calls for companies to rely less on foreigners, but that in order to do so in a sustained way, Singapore needs to increase work productivity to bring down overall demand for labour and also improve its total fertility rate.\n\nShe suggested that sectors less desirable to Singaporeans should transform and redesign their jobs.\n\n\"Our Singaporean core may be limited by the size of our citizen population, but we can be mighty if we differentiate ourselves from others by being identified with the values of openness, multiculturalism and self-determination.\"\n\nMariam Jaafar\n\nSembawang GRC\n\nMs Mariam, a managing director at a consultancy firm, said that while the country pushes for Singaporeans to learn more skills, employers must be more accountable for employees' learning. They must also be willing to give more Singaporeans a chance, looking past paper qualifications and past experience when hiring, and instead focus on skills.\n\nShe said employers can offer pre-skilling, upskilling and reskilling opportunities, as the Government sharpens and scales up schemes for job seekers.\n\n\"If people get a bad taste that no matter how hard they work, the system is stacked against them, it leads to cynicism. And because we Singaporeans actually have a strong sense of fairness and rooting for the underdog, if people see too many people around them like that, it can lead to polarisation, which only hurts our competitiveness.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nMembers of Parliament\n\nEdward Chia\n\nGan Siow Huang", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_VNEDWARDCHIA_5926527.jpg?VersionId=gVIsg0RsP0EjasLGrVQvCzFS8EH8OPei", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_VNDON_5926844.jpg?VersionId=Kw8X0Td_fIhhLWfoHR_jFAiNGu9byGtZ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_VNGAN_5926592.jpg?VersionId=x.1vB82HafI39w.pUZRBIOFoCb1h09HB", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_VNMARIAM44_5926837.jpg?VersionId=U0kJgjCkaRKToz5Ab.xeSxeIrLlXynX0", "alt_text": null}]}

The other bid was from American TV mogul Henry Mauriss, who had not followed up on his verbal agreement to a \u00a3350 million deal after holding discussions with the owner and his close aide Chris Ronnie earlier this year.\n\nPreviously, Ashley had agreed to the \u00a3300 million bid by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which collapsed after the group declined to take up the league's offer of independent arbitration to decide who would own the club.\n\nThe Chronicle also cited sources close to the BN Group who claimed it is trying to get on with its business quietly and are desperate to adhere to Ashley's wish to keep developments out of the press.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Maybe it is a good way to get publicity without having to buy?\"\n\nSince announcing on Aug 15 that it was \"at an advanced stage of negotiations\" with Newcastle, the BN Group and its co-founders had been shrouded in controversy.\n\nOn Aug 22, Reuters reported BN Group head of global marketing and investor relations Nereides Antonio Giamundo de Bourbon as admitting that some publicity photos of the co-founders with former United States president Barack Obama had been photoshopped.\n\nST checks also uncovered a pattern of outlandish and questionable claims in the interviews, press releases and social media accounts of the founders. These range from exaggerations to misinformation.\n\nThe group has since either retracted or deleted press releases that were online, and also locked their website and Instagram account.\n\nBritish sports journalist Liam Kennedy, who first broke the story of the bid in Tyneside newspaper Shields Gazette, told ST he was already sceptical from the start, and felt the deal would not go through.\n\nHe said: \"Newcastle United fans want change - they're desperate for it - but it has to be for the better.

From this point, the foundations of her comfortable family unit begin to crumble as lie after lie is exposed.\n\nGiovanna - smart, sensitive and self-absorbed - is beset both by raging insecurity and a melodramatic teenage conviction that the world revolves around her problems.\n\nHaving spilled a secret, she prays to God to put things back in order, \"because if he didn't, everything would collapse. San Giacomo dei Capri would tumble onto the Vomero and the Vomero onto the entire city, and the entire city would drown in the sea\".\n\nFerrante illustrates the class divide through Giovanna's traversing of Naples. To see Vittoria, she must literally descend from her middle-class home in the highest part of the city to the bleak depths of the Industrial Zone, where the people speak the Neapolitan dialect her father has banned in their house.\n\nHer father escaped the neighbourhood through his intellect, but Vittoria remains entrenched in it. Coarse, magnetic and tempestuous, she works as a cleaner to support the three children of the woman whose husband she stole. To Giovanna, she possesses a \"beauty so unbearable that to consider her ugly became a necessity\".\n\nSex, the driving force that underpins most of the characters' actions, is desirable in the abstract and discomfiting in its physicality. Having chosen to rebel by leaning into the ugliness her father predicted for her, Giovanna chases meaning in man after man - though sex, when she experiences it, proves appallingly banal.\n\nHaving discovered that adulthood is fundamentally adulterous, she learns to weave lies of her own. How much of a woman is the story she tells others of herself?\n\nThis is an especially weighted question from Ferrante, who has insistently aligned her anonymity with her authorship despite attempts to expose her identity.\n\nAs Giovanna warned at the beginning, this is not a story of redemption or anything like closure. It is, however, one of a young woman starting to make meaning of herself.\n\nIf you like this, read:\n\nThe Neapolitan Novels by the same author and translator, beginning with My Brilliant Friend (Europa Editions, 2012, $19.26, available at\n\nbit.ly/GirlHalfFT_EM\n\n), a coming-of-age story about the friendship between Elena and Lila, who grow up in a poor, violent neighbourhood in 1950s Naples.

She introduced him to Tan around May 1999, the court heard.\n\nTan later claimed that she needed money for Mr Lee. On May 11 that year, Mr Tan visited a CPF service centre and filled up an application form to withdraw his entire CPF savings in the Ordinary Account.\n\nMore than $53,000 was then credited into his bank account the following month.\n\nThe DPP added: \"Mr Tan sought Ah Hiang's assistance to withdraw the CPF monies from his... bank account and pass them to the accused. Consequently, Mr Tan entrusted Ah Hiang with his ATM card and personal identification number to make the withdrawals.\n\n\"Mr Tan had enlisted Ah Hiang's help as he was busy with work and had no time to make the withdrawals.\"\n\nMadam Boo then told Mr Tan that she had withdrawn the money and passed it to Tan. By using similar lies, Tan also managed to convince Mr Tan to hand over at least $500 of his salary every month.\n\nMr Tan passed the money to Madam Boo who would then hand a \"substantial portion\" to Tan.\n\nIn 2013, Mr Tan moved in with his niece, Madam Pamela Lim, and her husband. The couple then noticed that Mr Tan would borrow money from them and Madam Lim's mother almost every week.\n\nThis struck them as peculiar since he earned money from his job and did not appear to have any expenses to foot.\n\nMadam Lim also found out from her mother that her uncle had withdrawn all his CPF monies when he turned 55 and the entire sum was gone. Madam Lim and her husband then checked with Mr Tan, the court heard.\n\n\"Mr Tan explained that the accused and Ah Hiang told him something about a failed business investment involving Yeo Hiap Seng, which was taken over by the Government, such that he now needed to make repayments to 'Lao Lee',\" the DPP said, in a reference to Mr Lee.\n\nMadam Lim then lodged a police report on Feb 3, 2014.\n\nDuring the trial, Tan tried to shift the blame to Madam Boo, who had died of heart disease on April 21, 2016, before the trial started. But the DPP noted that in an earlier police statement, Tan admitted that she had cheated Mr Tan. She also admitted in the statement that she needed the money to gamble.\n\nYesterday, the court heard that Tan will be appealing against her conviction and sentence. Her bail has been set at $20,000.\n\n\u2022\n\nAdditional reporting by Dominic Low\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts\n\nCrime", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_VNTAN66_5926818.jpg?VersionId=XGy5xkt6aqsh_VkQXSDPSxRks4Elv3Hs", "alt_text": "Tan Hwee Ngo, 71, had told the victim that the money was for Singapore's late founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew."}]}

After this series, he's the most reliable guy. His shotmaking and his time on awareness plays - he is one of a kind.\"\n\nClippers coach Doc Rivers, whose team have never made it past the West Finals, added: \"You could tell he (Leonard) was the one guy that was used to closing out a series.\n\n\"He was calm, he got us in place. During games, you fall on a set, and we fell on that little elbow set for him. He just took what was there.

The previous government launched talks with the IMF in May, but these stalled amid divisions on the Lebanese side over the scale of losses in the financial system.\n\nMr Adib said a new government must be formed in record time and reforms must be implemented immediately as \"an entry point to an agreement with the IMF\".\n\nHe is tasked with guiding the country through one of the deepest economic crises in its recent history and rebuilding a capital city shattered by a blast last month.\n\nHe replaces Mr Hassan Diab, also an academic, whose short-lived government quit in the aftermath of the massive blast on Aug 4 that levelled the port of Beirut, damaged tens of thousands of homes and killed more than 180 people.\n\nMr Diab was named by the president's party and its allies in the Hizbollah-led alliance, but failed to win the support of fellow Sunni Muslim leaders or enact the economic reforms required to unlock billions of dollars in international aid and secure IMF assistance.\n\nMr Adib has secured broader political backing, which should give him greater chances of success.\n\nHe served as an adviser to then Prime Minister Najib Mikati from 2000 and had been Lebanon's ambassador to Germany since 2013. He has a doctorate in law and political science and taught at the Lebanese University.\n\nAs word of his nomination leaked out on Sunday, it was met with dismay by many Lebanese at the forefront of protests that erupted last October seeking to overthrow an entire ruling class blamed for decades of corruption and mismanagement that bled state coffers dry.\n\n\"This is yet another manoeuvre by the failed regime to refloat itself,\" Mr Samy Gemayel, a parliamentarian who resigned last month, said on Twitter.\n\n\"The mechanism is clear. One decides, a part executes and the other part covers up. This is making a fool of people and prevents change,\" he said.\n\nMr Diab took office in January, promptly defaulted on US$30 billion (S$41 billion) in international debt and turned to the IMF for help in securing some US$10 billion to support wide-ranging reforms.\n\nShackled by years of patronage and sectarianism, and facing significant domestic opposition, Mr Diab's team failed to clinch the IMF deal and was unable to enact reforms in the electricity sector, for instance, or address corruption concerns as required by the international community.\n\nThe blast at the port exacerbated the crisis and is estimated by the World Bank to have caused up to US$4.6 billion in physical damage.\n\nMr Adib will now face the tough task of resuming talks with the IMF, enacting reforms that have eluded successive Cabinets and securing international aid to rebuild the port and neighbourhoods devastated by the blast.\n\nREUTERS, BLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nLebanon\n\nPolitics and government\n\nIMF", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_FDADIB_5926765.jpg?VersionId=ASb_NhWuRRy_IYr_wTLdHGCFxCewoAHJ", "alt_text": null}]}

He listed five areas the WP will focus on:\n\n\u2022 Health, ageing and retirement adequacy;\n\n\u2022 Jobs, businesses and the economy;\n\n\u2022 Education, inequality and the cost of living;\n\n\u2022 Housing, transport and infrastructure; and\n\n\u2022 National sustainability, a broad area about how to ensure Singapore continues to thrive far into the future for successive generations.\n\nMr Singh said his appointment as LO was part of the changes happening in Singapore politics.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the new role after the WP won 10 seats in the July 10 polls - including Sengkang, its second group representation constituency.\n\nYesterday, Mr Singh said the formalising of the LO role has created expectations and there needs to be clarity about \"what the opposition can and cannot do\".\n\nSingaporeans, he added, expect the WP and the opposition in general to play a constructive role in Singapore politics. \"It should advance the interests of all Singaporeans, whether they may be in the majority or minority on any particular issue, without fear or favour,\" he said.\n\nBut with just 10 MPs in Parliament, he said the WP does not have the same resources as the Government and it was important for Singaporeans to take this into account.\n\nAs the LO, he will get the funds to hire three more legislative assistants and one more administrative assistant. All other MPs have one legislative assistant and one secretarial assistant.\n\nBut Mr Singh, who is an MP for Aljunied GRC, said the Government has at its disposal 146,000 full-time officers in the public service, of whom 85,000 are civil servants.\n\nGiven this, the LO's office \"will not have the breadth and depth of the party in government, in coming up with alternative policies\", he said. Nonetheless, the WP will offer meaningful policy alternatives like redundancy insurance, he added.\n\nHe also reiterated his argument that how much the opposition can do also depends on the quantity and quality of information the Government releases.\n\nHe said his party intended to make targeted inquiries of government departments and agencies as information was essential for the crafting of alternative policies.\n\nHe also urged the Government to consider how it can put out more information without being asked, particularly information and indicators benchmarked against other countries. Acknowledging that some data could be sensitive, he said the Government would have to find new ways of dealing with such difficult matters.\n\nMr Singh also clarified his role in relation to the two Progress Singapore Party (PSP) Non-Constituency MPs Hazel Poa and Leong Mun Wai. Similar to other Westminster systems, he said he will not represent all opposition parties as the LO, as the PSP has its own principles and ideology, which are distinct from those of the WP.\n\nHe added that he looked forward to working with the two NCMPs \"where our positions match and are in the best interests of Singaporeans\". He said the WP will set its own standards and chart an independent course, something that it has done over the years in the face of resistance even from \"many personalities in the opposition camp\".\n\nThe WP's position, he said, is that it owes its loyalty to the President, the Republic of Singapore and the people. \"We have proven that we do not oppose the Government for the sake of opposing,\" he added.\n\nIn his 33-minute speech, he also spoke about things in Singapore he said must not change, including the nation's historical position as an open trading nation, the Government's position on defence and foreign policy, and values that have become synonymous with Singapore, like multiracialism and the culture of abhorring corruption. He pledged the WP's support for the Government's position in these areas.\n\nHe also made suggestions about things that should change. Describing Singapore as a \"glass half-full that can be topped up\", he said: \"There is much that is right and which should remain the same. But there is also much that can and should change.\"\n\nAmong his suggestions was the formation of more Select Committees to deal with potentially divisive issues. \"This House and the Government need to reframe the public narrative on our more pressing issues,\" he said.\n\nSumming up, Mr Singh said: \"The WP will seek to play a positive role in the national conversation both in and out of Parliament to leave behind a Singapore our children and future generations can be proud of.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nPritam Singh\n\nLeader of the Opposition", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_YCPRITAM01_5926793.jpg?VersionId=6iNQO2lzKQXoGIQFbGjz6Ge6LXgHH2mw", "alt_text": "Workers' Party chief and Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh listed five areas the WP will focus on: housing, transport and infrastructure; jobs, businesses and the economy; health, ageing and retirement adequacy; education, inequality and the cost"}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_PRITAM01_5927201.jpg?VersionId=LiRLoB7V3RK6esXcCna1PnzI0TF4NFgl", "alt_text": "Workers' Party chief and Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh listed five areas the WP will focus on: housing, transport and infrastructure; jobs, businesses and the economy; health, ageing and retirement adequacy; education, inequality and the cost"}]}

But I have raised various incidents that have happened as a result of the actions of certain people. My point, really, is that these are all very petty and bad politics, and we shouldn't encourage it.\"\n\nIn a statement last night, ELD said it had received more than 220 complaints and pieces of feedback from political parties, as well as members of the public, on election posters and banners during the election. The breaches included posters and banners being within 50m of a polling station and below the 2.2m height requirement.\n\nELD's approach is to get the election agent to rectify the issue within three hours, taking no further action if this is done. This was also the case for the complaints relating to Mr Tan's posters, it said.\n\nMr Tan's allegation that his posters were pulled down from their original height is a serious one, ELD said, adding that it has not received any such report from the WP MP. \"Mr Tan should file a report with ELD so that this can be investigated,\" it said.\n\nIn an earlier speech, Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten) also called for a \"less confrontational political system\" to unite Singapore.\n\nThe recent election showed that politics has divided Singapore, just as it has in other countries, he said.\n\n\"This is not good for us as a nation. The amount of vitriol and hate which I read about during the election campaign saddens me.\"\n\nDuring the election, he said, he received frequent feedback that the Government is arrogant and unwilling to listen, and that its leaders are out of touch and not humble.\n\n\"Rightly or wrongly, there is also the perception that there is bullying and unfair treatment of people who do not agree with our policies.\"\n\nMr Lim urged the Government to be more open to constructive criticism and rational debate.\n\n\"I would submit that the Government must not treat politicians from other parties as enemies... We must assume that they also want the best for Singapore, even if they do not agree with all the government policies.\"\n\nThe ruling party should acknowledge and consider good ideas raised by politicians from other parties, as well as PAP backbenchers, he added.\n\nAt the same time, leaders of other opposition parties should condemn destructive criticisms which \"push falsehood and twist facts out of context\", Mr Lim said.\n\n\"Constructive suggestions build up Singapore.

If they practise unfair hiring, all that happens is that they are stopped from hiring unfairly for two years.\"\n\nEmployers currently only face criminal prosecution if they make false declarations on fair consideration, he noted.\n\nPointing to two recent instances of firms put on a watch list for having a large proportion of foreigners of the same nationality holding PMET jobs - almost three-quarters of PMET jobs at a wealth management firm and two-thirds of PMET jobs at a bank - he said it begs the question of how this could have happened without being detected.\n\n\"Singaporeans may be justified in asking if MOM has tolerated their unfair hiring practices for some time,\" he added.\n\nHe acknowledged that there could be reasons for firms to do so, such as if a bank's customers do not speak any of the languages widely used in Singapore, and that the issue can be complex.\n\nHe also noted that some banks have said they could not find enough Singaporeans with the needed expertise, adding that this could point to gaps in the education and training systems, which must be \"found and plugged as soon as possible\".\n\nNoting that the issue is a hot-button one that often generates \"a lot of heat but very little light\", he said: \"The problem is that we simply do not know enough. And the vacuum has given space for a more toxic conversation to ferment...To this end, more information, and not less, is certainly most helpful.\"\n\nHe urged the Government to set up a Parliamentary Select Committee to look into the limitations of the workforce and the needs of the economy, as well as the realities faced by Singaporean workers competing for jobs and the constraints faced by employers.\n\nMr Singh also suggested that the Ministry of Manpower publish names of recalcitrant employers.\n\n\"We can then understand the operating paradigm of such businesses and how they intend to make the transition to fair hiring practices.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nPritam Singh\n\nForeign professionals\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Half of the participants in such trials receive an experimental vaccine, while the other half are given a placebo.

More recently, Dr Hahn gave a far too optimistic appraisal, during a news conference with Mr Trump, of the effectiveness of convalescent plasma against the virus.

The Fugue that followed was taut and suitably strong.\n\nStravinsky was one of countless composers who greatly admired Mozart. Graf picked Apollo, one of several ballet scores he was commissioned to write for Ballet Russes.\n\nThe ballet centres on Apollo, leader of the muses, who is visited by the muses of dance and song, mime and poetry. Stravinsky drew from baroque, rococo and classical influences in this work, but the music is uniquely his.\n\nVery different playing emerged from the SSO strings, with excellent solos from the four section leaders and a brief, witty solo from Karen Yeo on bass. At times, the playing tended to the romantic, but this piece was a refreshing foil to the intensity of the Adagio and Fugue.\n\nAnother Stravinsky-Mozart pairing made up the virtual second half of the concert.\n\nThe Octet For Winds by Stravinsky is for an unusual ensemble of flute, clarinet, two bassoons, two trumpets, tenor and bass trombones. The composer has written about the use of \"classical\" forms in its three movements - sonata, theme and variations and fugue - and the Octet is regarded as one of his pioneering compositions in neo-classical style.\n\nGraf joined the winds un-masked in this and the following piece.\n\nSeeing so much more of a conductor's expressions may have been a factor, but whatever the case, the SSO winds were fabulous - playing with superb sound, ensemble and style. There was not a weak link among the eight.\n\nA sense of enjoyment could be felt in the second movement, and Li Xin (clarinet) and Liu Chang (bassoon) were sparkling in the final movement fugue.\n\nAs suddenly as the sound opened up in the Octet, it darkened in the closing work, Mozart's Serenade In E Flat, K.375 for winds.\n\nWritten in five movements for two each of oboe, clarinet, bassoon and horn, it has two fast outer movements, two minuets in between and an exquisite slow movement in the middle.\n\nGraf is a master of Mozart, but the contrast in sound and articulation between neo-and \"ur-\" (original) classical seemed too stark. Fortunately, the Serenade picked up with each movement, and there was a rousing finale to the piece.\n\nThe programming for this concert was inspired.\n\nWithin the constraints of player numbers and instrumentation permitted, Graf has selected works that show how the past influences the present and the future; and how music can be so different, yet similar.\n\nThe SSO is finding its feet in this new order of recorded medium, and the Stravinsky Octet was a performance to remember.\n\nSee more on\n\nClassical music\n\nReviews", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a4ba312342cb28d959ba43b8e97d9852c3016ccb307dfc77a8f05e0c12d3f0d", "alt_text": "The pontoon used for the open water venue at the World Aquatics Championships in Sentosa on July 7, 2025."}]}

But over the weekend, it became increasingly clear that they can also be something else: a set of pawns.\n\nThe industry titans have been caught in an escalating tit-for-tat between the United States and China over the sale of the US operations of TikTok, the viral social media app owned by Chinese Internet company ByteDance. The\n\nsale was ordered\n\nin early August by President Donald Trump, who said TikTok posed a national security threat because of its Chinese ties.\n\nFor weeks, China was critical of Mr Trump's order but stayed quiet on what it would do about it. That allowed ByteDance and TikTok to pursue sale talks with potential bidders like Microsoft, Walmart, Oracle and others.\n\nThen over the weekend, Beijing threw the whole process for a loop when it\n\nupdated its export control rules\n\nto include some of TikTok's key technologies - a sign that the Chinese government could exert its authority to delay or scuttle any deal at the last minute.\n\nNow a blockbuster deal that had been set to be completed soon has become far more complicated, according to three people close to the talks. The two groups vying to buy TikTok's US business - one is an alliance between Microsoft and Walmart, and the other is an offer led by Oracle - are discussing how to interpret China's new rules and how to move forward, said the people, who were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nAt the same time, the bidders are honing drafts of their offers and tweaking them as part of the negotiation process, the people said.\n\n\"Certainly this deal and high tech in general is now inherently politicised, and there's no escaping it,\" said Mr Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \"As long as the US and China have such low trust of each other, the way TikTok is being treated, and the way American companies may be treated in China, may become the new normal.\"\n\nHe added, \"We've passed the threshold where we feel confident we're able to mitigate these kinds of risks between each other, and regular companies are being caught in the middle.\"\n\nMs Samm Sacks, a cyberpolicy fellow at the think tank New America, said the Trump administration was likely to counter China's latest move with its own, and that more US companies operating in China could be in an increasingly precarious position. \"This is just the tip of the iceberg,\" she said.\n\nRepresentatives for Microsoft, Oracle and Walmart declined to comment.\n\n\"We are studying the new regulations that were released Friday,\" Mr Erich Andersen, ByteDance's general counsel, said in a statement. \"As with any cross-border transaction, we will follow the applicable laws, which in this case include those of the US and China.\"\n\nIn Washington, China's new export measures were widely seen as a potential poison pill for the TikTok deal. If China does move to block TikTok's sale, that could goad Mr Trump into taking harsher action, further escalating tensions between the US and China.\n\nAlready, the Trump administration has placed sanctions on dozens of Chinese companies in recent weeks over alleged security threats and human rights violations, and it has threatened to take more measures to block Chinese tech companies like Alibaba and Baidu from doing business in the US.\n\nUnder Mr Trump, the sale of Grindr, the gay dating app, to Beijing Kunlun Tech Co, a Chinese company, was unwound.\n\nMr Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser known for his harsh criticism of China, said in an interview on Monday (Aug 31) that it was \"critical\" that Americans not use apps that are made in China because Beijing could use them to surveil, track and potentially even extort Americans.\n\n\"That's really the policy position underlying why we have gone after TikTok and WeChat and there will be others because China, communist China, the Chinese Communist Party, is basically going out around the world trying to acquire technology and influence,\" he said.\n\nOf Mr Trump, he added, \"This country and this president, the strongest president on China in history, is not going to put up with that.\"\n\nMr Navarro said he was not part of the negotiations over TikTok's sale, a deal that was being reviewed by the Treasury Department. The White House referred a request for comment to the Treasury Department, which did not respond.\n\nAssociate Professor Matt Perault from Duke University's Centre on Science and Technology Policy, said that the US and China had politicised other deals in the past, including Qualcomm's attempted acquisition of Dutch company NXP Semiconductors.\n\nIn 2018, Qualcomm terminated that deal after Chinese authorities did not grant antitrust approvals for the acquisition of NXP's China operations.\n\nEven so, Assoc Prof Perault said the TikTok deal stood out because the US is on the eve of an election in which the president has made China a key component of his reelection strategy, and the company involved is one of the strongest competitors to US tech companies in a generation.\n\n\"The politicisation is having an immediate impact,\" Assoc Prof Perault said, adding that the degree of politicisation was \"unique.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nTikTok\n\nUS-China ties\n\nUS-China trade war", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/nz_tiktok_010936.jpg?VersionId=FoLpqNe3LqJyK19BEnGx83ftzs7iknwg", "alt_text": null}]}

We understand that it's a step by step process and we know that things have to settle down first.\n\n\"Two months (of training in small groups) can be quite tedious and boring, but it was beneficial and hopefully we can put whatever we've learnt into our games.\"\n\nWhile no fixed date has been set for the resumption of the league, the FAS is looking at a tentative restart this month. The SPL kicked off on Feb 29 but was officially suspended on March 24 owing to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHougang United coach Clement Teo welcomed the news, but he stressed the importance of sticking to safety measures.\n\n\"It feels (like) we've been training with five in a group for the longest time so this is good news,\" said the 54-year-old.\n\n\"Naturally we're glad, but ultimately we need to be very cautious about this.\"\n\nWhen full training begins, there will be regular breaks to allow players and staff to sanitise their hands and make sure that they are properly hydrated.\n\nWith the exception of goalkeepers, any handling or usage of equipment is to be kept to a minimum.\n\nPhysical contact should be minimised and drills such as those for heading that require players to pick up and toss the ball to another are not encouraged.\n\nChanging rooms and gyms will stay closed and the sharing of personal equipment between players, coaches and officials is not allowed.\n\nAfter five months without any competitive games, Tampines Rovers winger Jordan Webb is ready to get back onto the football pitch.\n\nThe 32-year-old was in his native Canada from April to early July, when he was able to train in groups of 10.\n\nHe resumed training with the Stags in late July after serving his quarantine order.\n\n\"I miss interacting with my teammates, playing actual games and that feeling you have when you win a game,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel excited. We're eager to start playing and doing what we love to do.\"\n\nFans may have to wait even longer to get back into the stadium.\n\nGeylang International supporter Rishi Raja, who has been an Eagles fan for a decade, was thrilled to hear the news but the 31-year-old said he is \"not going to be full of hope that we can go down and watch if it does restart\".\n\nAs SPL teams gear up in the coming weeks for a possible return of league games, Teo admitted that the season would be tough on teams after the long layoff.\n\nHe said: \"Even though we push them on fitness and do many fitness drills, it's when you play games that fitness comes in.\"\n\nBefore the coronavirus-enforced break, Tampines led the nine-team table with nine points from four games. Holders Brunei DPMM were sixth on three points from winning their only game of the season.\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nSingapore football\n\nSingapore Premier League", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_SPTSUP_5927088.jpg?VersionId=euRGIxf3a0jaBpx3gYD5Q1O7hneiJbVx", "alt_text": "Tampines forward Taufik Suparno (right) and defender Irwan Shah having fun during training.

These days, she has become renowned as a celebrity chef in fine-dining circles.\n\nLike a well-curated meal, her half-hour solo recital comprised varied repertoire works, served as tasty morsels on a silver platter.\n\nXu Beihong's 1927 Portrait Of Lim Loh (a pioneer architect and building contractor in colonial Singapore and father of anti-Japanese patriot General Lim Bo Seng) was juxtaposed with the earliest music on the programme, two movements from Johann Sebastian Bach's Unaccompanied Violin Partita No. 3 In E Major.\n\nThe swift and technically challenging Preludio revealed Seah's technique to be still close to impeccable on many fronts.\n\nThis was contrasted with the double-stopping (playing two notes at the same time) and singing tone in the more leisurely paced Loure. It seemed a pity that the popular and jaunty Gavotte had not been included in this selection.\n\nChua Mia Tee's Road Construction Worker (1955) was a sobering study of hard labour and resilience. Witness the emaciated figure, distended veins and withering gaze of its long-suffering subject.\n\nSeah likened this pathos-inducing visage with the outsized demands needed to master Fritz Kreisler's Praeludium & Allegro In The Style Of Pugnani.\n\nShe calmly negotiated the requisite faultless intonation for the slow prelude and then steadfastly withstood the thorny parts of the fast section, which got increasingly hair-raising as the work progressed.\n\nWith the most outwardly virtuosic part of the programme over, Seah brought out her lyrical best for two encore-like pieces, arguably the concert's most touching moments.\n\nThese were chosen as a reflection of the subject of love in Chua's 1957 portrait of his late wife and fellow artist Lee Boon Ngan.\n\nAlthough there was neither piano nor harp accompaniment to back her in Edward Elgar's Salut D'Amour, her gorgeous tone was more than enough to sustain one's interest.\n\nFollowing that, Jules Massenet's Meditation from the opera Thais was delivered with a similar kind of frisson, demonstrating how a simple tune could carry such an impact when played with love and dedication. Such is the measure of a true artist.\n\nSee more on\n\nClassical music\n\nMusic review", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_TLSEAH_5925069.jpg?VersionId=rA8wGFD7jeW1B2Mit8V9PDO190bmQFbJ", "alt_text": "Lynnette Seah in a violin recital as part of the National Gallery Singapore's Art + Live concert series that was held on Facebook Live."}]}

Those who do not meet the criteria can appeal to the authorities, who will assess their eligibility on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSimilarly, Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten) said the policy of pegging social assistance to annual values of properties should be reviewed, even as he agreed that the lower-income and the needy should get more help.\n\nHe pointed out that citizens suffering from loss of income may need help, regardless of their housing type, to pay for family expenses such as medical bills, mortgage instalments or school fees.\n\nThey may also not be able to sell their home during a financial crisis, he added.\n\n\"Why do we have the expectation that people don't deserve help simply because they have bigger homes of a higher annual value? Should we not look at their loss of income? Should we also insist that these people must sell their homes before they get the short-term help specifically targeted at those affected by Covid-19?\" he asked.\n\nMr Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru) said it would be timely for the Government to adjust policies for groups, including retired seniors who are asset-rich but cash-poor, and residents older than 50 who are facing uncertainty in their careers.\n\nDifferent yardsticks can be used to assess eligibility for support schemes, including using a mix of non-housing assets, income and the per capita housing equity of occupants in a house, he suggested.\n\nMr Kwek also suggested that the Government work with the banking and insurance sectors to create reverse mortgage options for private estates, and allow those who are older than 70 to borrow against their housing equity at a reasonable rate.\n\n\"If our people can tap their housing equity effectively, I believe most Singaporeans in the private estates would prefer to stand on their own two feet, instead of relying on government assistance,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nHousing policy\n\nSocial support", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_VNPROPERTY_5926451.jpg?VersionId=0tS_2zei3zgUAwvBU39qYsHlZ17qrb0F", "alt_text": "Mr Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru) suggested that different yardsticks can be used to assess eligibility for support schemes, including using a mix of non-housing assets, income and the per capita housing equity of occupants in a house.

One-third of the lake lies in India and the rest in China, according to the official website of the Ladakh union territory.\n\nA source with knowledge of the matter on the Indian side said Chinese troops were moving to capture a higher vantage point to gain a dominant position on the southern bank of the 135km lake.\n\nThe Indian army, in an official statement, blamed the Chinese side for raising tensions and carrying out \"provocative military movements\".\n\nHowever, a spokesman for the Western Theatre Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), Colonel Zhang Shuili, accused the Indian Army of illegally crossing the border and asked it to withdraw to \"avoid further escalation of the situation\".\n\nIn an official statement, Indian Army spokesman Colonel Aman Anand, said: \"On the night of 29/30 August 2020, PLA troops violated the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements during the ongoing stand-off in eastern Ladakh and carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The Chinese did not release casualty figures after the clash in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh.\n\nMilitary and diplomatic talks between the two are ongoing.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian yesterday said that PLA border troops had never crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and that both sides were engaged in consultations through diplomatic and military channels.\n\nIndia views the current border flare-up as the worst since 1962, when it went to war with China.\n\n\"We have a very large number of Chinese forces and, frankly, we are at a loss,\" Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar told the Hindustan Times. \"I accept there are some differences in perceptions in the LAC. But there is again a clear understanding that neither side will attempt to unilaterally change the status quo.\"\n\nThe border issue has affected the economic relationship between the two Asian giants, with India moving to introduce additional rules for Chinese firms and to restrict their growth in areas such as telecommunications and power. China is India's largest trading partner and bilateral trade hit US$92.68 billion (S$126.1 billion) last year.\n\nMany analysts believe the two countries are still far apart and that the situation remains dangerous.\n\n\"There is heavy deployment on either side. A spark would be detrimental for the situation along the border. I would say this is a very delicate, fragile and volatile situation, which can explode if it is not handled at the highest level,\" said Jawaharlal Nehru University Professor B. R.

There were concerts on the Internet, but mostly of pre-recorded performances. In June, a breakthrough took the form of a live concert by the Concordia Quartet, whose four members performed from different locations for a live Internet audience.\n\nIts parent organisation, re:Sound, has gone several steps further by presenting a live chamber orchestra concert with a full symphony to boot. Twenty-three musicians were gathered into spaces of an Orchard Road location where they performed, socially distanced, wearing headphones and masked (wind players excepted). As they played, the wonders of modern digital technology ensured that their efforts were being appreciated by online viewers.\n\nOne positive outcome of this pandemic has been to witness the sheer ingenuity of people who live for art, want to make good music and share it with others.\n\nThe 50-minute concert opened with English composer Peter Warlock's Capriol Suite (1926) for strings. Its six movements were based on French renaissance dances, brought up to date with modern harmonies and occasional dissonances. The 14 string musicians were separated into four rooms, where they essentially played \"blind\", unable to see the other groups, but able to hear them.\n\nDespite the disadvantage, they produced a clear and homogeneous sound in the opening Basse-Danse soon after leader violinist Edward Tan gave the three-count to begin. The presto 4th movement (Bransles) was followed by the tender Pieds-en-l'air and vigorous Mattachins (Sword Dance), which provided enough contrasts for the suite to close with appropriate plaudits.\n\nThe main event was Mozart's popular Symphony No. 40 In G Minor, with woodwinds and brass thrown into the fray. A division of labour saw these musicians playing in two further rooms, with the pair of bassoons (a husband-and-wife couple) sequestered into a studio just bigger than a broom closet.\n\nThere was no conductor, instead the musicians relied on low strings to begin and for the others to join in. Ensemble could be tighter but, given the circumstances, the results were more than acceptable. Tempos were not overly brisk, with a comfortable pace adopted, surely predetermined in earlier rehearsals. Yet there was still a palpable sense of tension and urgency in the 1 st movement's development.\n\nThe slow 2nd movement did not drag but maintained an unerring course, a sign of an ensemble gaining in confidence.\n\nThe Menuetto was suitably jaunty, but the French horns had hairy moments of intonation in the Trio section.\n\nThe rollicking finale was taken at a fair lick, ensuring a heightened level of excitement, which turned into suspense when the violists disappeared from view.\n\nREVIEW / CONCERT\n\nRE:SOUND IS LIVE\n\nStreamed live on the Internet\n\nLast Friday\n\nTechnical glitch or no, the music surged on regardless to close on an exultant high.\n\nWatch this concert at\n\nbit.ly/2QFWVWx\n\nSee more on\n\nReviews\n\nClassical music", "images": []}

That was the total distance the Majulah Movement team covered in their food deliveries in the past three months, said Ms Ling Quek, 37.\n\nMs Quek, who co-founded the Majulah Movement, said that every kilometre clocked by a runner will raise funds for meals. If the target of 869km is achieved, the beneficiaries would get at least 1,500 meals, which could last for over a month.\n\nMr Lim's team of six runners is targeting to cover at least 300km of the 869km.\n\nMembers of the public who wish to participate have to record their own distances and send a screenshot to the Majulah Movement via Instagram.\n\nMr Lim said he has always wanted to join a cross-country race after being inspired by Canadian athlete and cancer research activist Terry Fox at a young age, and TSP is a race that he has been interested in.\n\nThe virtual format of the race this year will allow participants from around the world to clock as many kilometres as possible within the current record time of 31 hours and 15 minutes for the LA-to-Vegas run.\n\nAlthough he will be running in Singapore, Mr Lim wants to see where his team stands in this global race. His team members are Mr Eugene Teo, 40; Mr Benjamin Lee, 33; Mr Chua Kim Choon, 48; Ms Faye Kwan, 36; and Ms Wendy Chu, 40.\n\nTogether with the overseas participants, the team will start running at 7pm on Saturday, which will be 4am Pacific Daylight Time. The race will end at 2.15am Singapore time on Monday.\n\nIf they run at a consistent pace of six minutes per kilometre with each covering 50km, they will be able to achieve at least 300km in the specified time.\n\nOn getting the public's participation to raise funds for the Majulah Movement, Mr Lim said: \"You don't have to come to East Coast Parkway to run. You can run around your neighbourhood, it doesn't matter where you are, you can contribute to the mileage.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCharities", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_RUN01_5926705.jpg?VersionId=uD9MuXivT5HOfKIBj_0OB78wFv.qEVAZ", "alt_text": "Mr Eugene Lim (centre) will be leading runners (from left) Benjamin Lee, Eugene Teo, Wendy Chu, Chua Kim Choon and Faye Kwan to try to run at least 300km in 31hr 15min this weekend in a relay ultramarathon that is part of The Speed Project in the Uni"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a4ba312342cb28d959ba43b8e97d9852c3016ccb307dfc77a8f05e0c12d3f0d", "alt_text": "The pontoon used for the open water venue at the World Aquatics Championships in Sentosa on July 7, 2025."}]}

This officially marks all of the top white women in pop as problematic.\"\n\nBut the post, which has garnered over 3.8 million likes, has plenty of defenders too, including celebrities of colour like English model Naomi Campbell who showed their backing for Adele with heart emojis and Jamaican flags.\n\nAfrican-American actress Zoe Saldana also showed her support, saying: \"You look right at home,\" in response to Adele's post.\n\nFans of the singer, some of whom identified themselves as Jamaican, also jumped in to say that Adele was appreciating and not appropriating Jamaican and African culture and that it is common to dress up in ethnic-inspired looks for the Notting Hill Carnival.\n\nSee more on\n\nCelebrities\n\nSocial media\n\nRace issues", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/st_20200901_trend01a_5926038_1.jpg?VersionId=UrD3PgZTXHxu66VWEwetM0uLNFwqp3il", "alt_text": null}]}

FICTION\n\nFEAR OF THE GUEST\n\nBy Yihan Sim\n\nMarshall Cavendish/Paperback/192 pages/$19.99/\n\nAvailable here\n\nLifelong learning does not stop in the afterlife.\n\nThe ghosts of Sim's debut novel Fear Of The Guest are also struggling with disruption as younger generations of Singaporeans lose their fear of them. Some have taken to haunting SkillsFuture courses to figure out how to stay relevant.\n\nWhen their grassroots committee meeting is invaded by a malevolent spectre who calls himself the Guest, they realise they have to contend with a whole new brand of fear - one that might wipe out the Singapore they have haunted for so long.\n\nSim, 29, an administrative executive at a local university, confesses she is a \"scaredy cat\". She watches horror movies between the cracks of her fingers and showers with one eye open for weeks afterwards.\n\nSo it may come as a surprise that her first book is of a supernatural bent.\n\nShe says, however: \"It was time for me to reverse the gaze, to look at humans through (the ghosts') eyes. And perhaps this fantasy was also a balm; it diminished the power that fear had on me.\"\n\nFear Of The Guest ranges across the supernatural spectrum, from the Chinese jiangshi (vampire) to the singing female ghost who spooks recruits on Pulau Tekong.\n\nFor Sim, the most terrifying ghost in South-east Asian folklore is the pontianak.\n\n\"I am both fascinated and mortified by how she is the epitome of the 'monstrous feminine', a concept explored in the academic publications of Associate Professor Valerie Wee from the National University of Singapore,\" she says.\n\n\"The pontianak story captures deep-rooted cultural fears of the vengeful female, of unjust deaths, of human greed and its consequences.\"\n\nIn Sim's novel, the pontianak chairs the Grassroots Committee of Ghosts and Monsters. In her downtime, when she is not out haunting, she takes on the elegant appearance of a retired air stewardess.\n\nThe horror genre, says Sim, is essentially the history of human fear and is reflective of xenophobia - a term which draws on the ancient Greek word \"xenos\", which can be translated as \"stranger\", \"foreigner\" or \"guest\".\n\n\"Xenophobia is not unique to Singapore and can be found in every country in the world,\" says Sim. \"It does, however, have local flavours, just like ghost stories.\"\n\n2.

They have 13 points from 13 games, which takes into account a one-point deduction for poor financial management.\n\nIkhsan had made four substitute appearances earlier in the season after recovering from a knee injury and sore throat. Last season, he played in 26 league games, including 10 as a starter, and scored five goals in his debut season in Europe.\n\nHe told The Straits Times yesterday: \"It's nice to get the opportunity to start. I didn't kick off the season well as I was out for six weeks with my injury and illness, so it feels good to be back in the team, score and help the team win three points.\n\n\"When the cross came in, I knew exactly where I was going to put it and from the way I connected, I knew 100 per cent it was going in.

But he played his part on Saturday as he rounded up the scoring by slotting into an empty net in the 4-0 win over Sabah as Terengganu rise to second in the 12-team MSL with 10 points, three behind defending champions Johor Darul Takzim (JDT).\n\nIt was a belated birthday present for Faris, who turned 28 on Aug 24.\n\nHe gleefully described the feeling of playing his first competitive game in more than five months as \"like a kid getting candy\". Before going to Terengganu on Aug 11, he had trained with the Young Lions in Singapore for about three weeks.\n\n5\n\nIkhsan's goal came after five Raufoss appearances in the second-tier Norwegian league this season.\n\nFaris said: \"Training with Young Lions was all about getting back my fitness, and then slowly I got back my touches.

I will not allow Patriot Prayer and armed white supremacists to bring more bloodshed to our streets,\" Ms Brown said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to temporarily sending in state police troopers and officers from neighbouring jurisdictions, the FBI and federal prosecutors will add resources to prosecute criminal offences stemming from protests, Ms Brown said.\n\nNo mention was made of activating the National Guard.

Two of them were found with loaded handguns, while others were carrying knives and rocks, police said.\n\nThe Trump administration in July deployed federal forces to Portland to protect a US courthouse that has been the focus of violent protests and other federal property, drawing criticism that their presence only heightened the unrest. The federal agents were later withdrawn.\n\nSTREET CLASHES AND DEADLY SHOOTING\n\nTensions flared again Saturday night between anti-racism protesters and a large caravan of demonstrators driving through the city's downtown district in pickup trucks waving pro-Trump flags.\n\nVideo on social media showed individuals in the trucks firing paint-balls and spraying chemical irritants at opposing protesters as they rode, while those on the street hurled objects at the trucks and tried to block them.\n\nInvestigators have yet to say whether the fatal shooting had anything to do with those confrontations. Police identified the victim on Monday as Aaron J. Danielson, 39, of Portland, who died from a gunshot wound to the chest.\n\nPatriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson, speaking to local radio, described Mr Danielson as a \"very gentle, very courageous\" person whom he had never seen become violent or even angry.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what you believe in politically ... if you knew him as a person, you would never hurt him,\" Mr Gibson said.\n\nAnother associate, identified in a YouTube interview as Mr Chandler Pappas, said he was with Mr Danielson when they were confronted by assailants on the street.\n\n\"They hunted us down. They recognised our Patriot Prayer hats,\" Mr Pappas said. Afterward, he recounted, \"The shooter took off running.\"\n\nMr Pappas said there was no precipitating incident. \"The two of us alone, away from the rest of the Trump rally with all the trucks and all the other noise going on - I think they isolated us and they thought they could get away with it,\" Mr Pappas said, adding that neither he nor Mr Danielson were armed.\n\nMr Luke Carrillo, a longtime friend and business partner, told reporters Mr Danielson was a \"proud American\" but \"was not a radical, not a racist, not a fascist.\" And he called for all parties in Portland to \"renounce any further acts of violence.\"\n\nMr Trump has seized on civil disturbances in cities such as Portland and Kenosha, blaming state and local Democratic leaders, as he amps up his calls for law and order ahead of the Nov 3 election.\n\n\"Portland is a mess, and it has been for many years.

Hence he suspects that it was a drop-in anchor, a type of fastener which secures the duct to the concrete, that became loose.\n\nIn response to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for the Building and Construction Authority said that a professional engineer has been appointed to investigate the incident, along with other ducts in the cinema.\n\nRectification measures will be recommended depending on the findings, and these will be carried out by the building owner, she added.\n\nSee more on\n\nBCA/Building and Construction Authority\n\nBuildings\n\nCinemas", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/rk_nexxinemahall_010920.jpg?VersionId=1frXUEDIG616DbIglb1sRCicRrcTQbEP", "alt_text": null}]}

But Covid-19 put paid to the festival and the show is going digital instead.\n\nIt will be screened on a pay-as-you-wish basis on the Zoom video platform on Friday and Saturday. Each show will be followed by a question-and-answer session with the performers.\n\nAsked about how she dealt with the challenges of restaging, the veteran actress says: \"In life, there is one thing that never changes and that is 'change'. So, the current circumstance has gifted us a chance to respond to this 'law' in life. Now, it is as if I have been walking and suddenly I need to drive.\n\n\"I still journey, but the views on the way are all different and I am discovering new things from experiencing, responding and connecting to each moment of the journey. I am processing new experiences and reflecting on previous experiences.\"\n\nDreamtalk, a physical theatre piece unfolding in a house where a guardian keeps watch over a young dreamer, is a collaboration between Ang and theatre studies honours graduate Ranice Tay.\n\nAng, who was a member of the renowned Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards and co-founder of Theatre OX, directed Tay for a theatre studies production.\n\nShe says collaborating with her former student is also a way for her to learn: \"Mr Kuo Pao Kun says you need to start from practice. That's why he chose the name Practice Theatre for his group. You learn from doing.\"\n\nTay, 23, says working with her mentor is \"a period of time I cannot trade for anything else\".\n\nShe is appreciative of the CFA's support for her practice as theatre performance, which has been brewing for a year. \"(I have) the space, the resources to help me develop work that nourishes my soul.\"\n\nVIEW IT /DREAMTALK\n\nWHERE:\n\nZoom WHEN: Friday, 10.59pm; and Saturday, 2.59 and 7.59pm\n\nADMISSION:\n\n$10 to $15 from Sistic\n\nINFO:\n\nwww.sistic.com.sg/events/zldt0920\n\nMs Mary Loh, 60, the CFA's senior associate director, says such exchanges between practitioners and students are what she wants to encourage with her programming.\n\nWhile the festival has been scuppered, some of the shows will go to the ExxonMobil Campus Concerts while Dreamtalk and another production Blindspot, an NUS Chinese drama about a girl whose mother is going blind, are going digital.\n\nMs Loh notes that the experience has been an \"incredibly steep learning curve\" for the team.\n\nBut there is a silver lining as Dreamtalk can now reach Ang's audiences around the world. The Friday show is scheduled for the odd time of 10.59pm, Ms Loh says.\n\n\"The reason for the strange timing is because the performers are capturing that moment between wakefulness into sleep, into a special time of consciousness.\n\n\"Besides that, Gey Pin's online audiences are also in the United States and Europe and the timing allows us to accommodate them.\"\n\nAng says going digital has also opened up new vistas for her as a practitioner: \"And now there is a huge spatial interrelation between the creative team and the audience. There is something of a third, or fourth space; a hybrid, in-between, semi-public space, through a digital version of a live performance.\n\n\"All these, we hope to evoke the imaginative world and the perspectives from the inner child in each of us.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nTheatre/plays\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/st_20200901_sfdreamlz6m_5924894.jpg?VersionId=AoQUarb5IM7jCvkRmEFkvK61VErWLV7_", "alt_text": "Veteran theatre performer Ang Gey Pin (top, left) and her former student Ranice Tay (top, right) will collaborate in Dreamtalk (above), a physical theatre piece where a guardian watches over a young dreamer."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/st_20200901_sfdream_5924887.jpg?VersionId=0KDPgyXfBwr7uAsZ2lyIdUcLv89XVnaH", "alt_text": "Veteran theatre performer Ang Gey Pin (top, left) and her former student Ranice Tay (top, right) will collaborate in Dreamtalk (above), a physical theatre piece where a guardian watches over a young dreamer."}]}

In this regard, we must uphold our pillar of meritocracy. There must be fairness and equal treatment and assessment of workers, which is also a fundamental International Labour Organisation commitment,\" he said.\n\nSingapore has announced two increases this year in the salary threshold for EP holders. The second was announced last Thursday and will start from today for new applications, raising the threshold to $4,500, from $3,900.\n\nFor the first time, the ministry set a higher bar for the financial services sector, with the minimum qualifying salary for new applicants going up to $5,000 from Dec 1.\n\nThe changes affect pass renewals from May next year.\n\nMr Tay said that since the announcement, union leaders and professionals, managers and executives (PMEs) have told him they worry employers would merely raise the salaries or repackage the compensation and benefits of foreign professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) to meet the rules, and retain them.\n\nSingaporean staff performing similar or the same jobs as the foreign PMETs may not get a similar pay hike, resulting in \"serious parity issues\", he added.\n\nHe pledged that unions would watch closely the actions of unionised companies, and encouraged workers in non-unionised companies to be union members to get better protection.\n\nStrengthening the Singaporean core of PMETs must be addressed at all levels of the hierarchy, he said.\n\nSome large companies with deep pockets, he noted, may hire more Singaporeans at junior levels to make the firm look better in terms of the proportion of locals it employs.\n\nThe hiring culture and mindsets need to be changed across the board, he added.\n\nAmong other things, Mr Tay, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Education, also suggested the Government impose mandatory audits and penalties on companies that do not improve over time, such as removing preferential tax rates or not awarding them public sector contracts.\n\nHe stressed that NTUC is not advocating for closed-door policies. But with some 1,200 firms on the FCF watch list, it is clear that market failure exists in the current employment framework, he said.\n\n\"A healthy dose of market intervention is essential to ensure fair play,\" he said, adding that this also fosters a sense of belonging and identity among Singaporeans.\n\nHe was among more than 10 MPs who spoke on the hot button issue during yesterday's debate.\n\nMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) urged the Government to require companies to publish the selection criteria for jobs, not just the job vacancy itself. In doing so, the criteria can be scrutinised.\n\nLike Mr Tay, she suggested implementing a dependency ratio or quota for EP holders in companies, with different ceilings and salary levels for different sectors, and to make sure senior managers are accountable for the hiring of these EP holders.\n\nMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) suggested the Government expand the Capability Transfer Programme to nudge companies to set targets for firms to transfer skills and knowledge from foreign to local workers. This programme subsidises the cost of bringing in trainers from abroad to equip local workers with skills and knowledge.\n\nMs Jessica Tan (East Coast GRC), speaking from her personal experience in working for two foreign multinationals for almost 30 years, said working with foreigners can help Singaporeans develop themselves and scale up large projects.\n\nThis, however, hinges on fair employment practices, she stressed, adding that employers must also have clear development plans to grow the Singaporean core and build a pipeline of locals to fill senior roles.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nPatrick Tay\n\nForeign professionals\n\nForeign workers", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_CORE01_5926759.jpg?VersionId=ff4ViSYSkSrQGl_m5Me_EFJS3rEsDt_H", "alt_text": "Explaining his suggestion to further increase the minimum qualifying salaries for Employment Pass holders in infocomm technology and professional services, labour MP Patrick Tay said these sectors generally have more companies on the Fair Considerati"}]}

Pritam's maiden speech as Leader of the Opposition\n\nWorkers' Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh, who was appointed Leader of the Opposition after his party won an unprecedented 10 seats in Parliament at the recent general election, used the longer time - 40 minutes - he has been allocated to delve into the opposition's role in debating policies in Parliament.\n\nIn his 33-minute speech, Mr Singh said he and his WP colleagues will have to work extra hard. \"We will have to ask ourselves tough questions before critiquing government policy, chief of which is what would we do if we were in charge.\"\n\nBut, he added, there must be clarity about \"what the opposition can and cannot do\". With 10 MPs, the WP falls far short of the resources available to the Government, he said, and it is important for Singaporeans to take this into account when forming their expectations of the opposition.\n\nWhile the WP will not form a shadow Cabinet owing to a lack of resources, he announced that it will organise itself to scrutinise policies in five areas important to Singaporeans.\n\nThey are: health, ageing and retirement adequacy; jobs, businesses and the economy; education, inequality and the cost of living; housing, transport and infrastructure; and national sustainability, a broad area about how to ensure Singapore continues to thrive far into the future for successive generations.\n\n2. DPM Heng Swee Keat thanks retired MPs\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat carved out time from a wide-ranging speech to pay tribute to MPs who have retired, including former prime minister Goh Chok Tong and former WP chief Low Thia Khiang.\n\nMr Heng recalled that Mr Goh's advice to him, during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, left a lasting impression on him, and it continues to guide his work during the pandemic. He was then managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), while Mr Goh was then its chairman.\n\nBanks around the world were in trouble, and MAS had to make a momentous decision on whether to seek the President's approval for a $150 billion guarantee on all bank deposits backed up by Singapore's past reserves, Mr Heng said.\n\n\"I was glad to have his wise counsel. Mr Goh taught us that we must face difficult decisions head-on. It was a lesson that stayed with me,\" added DPM Heng, who thanked his former bosses at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) as well, namely former MTI minister Lim Hng Kiang and former transport minister Khaw Boon Wan, who was MTI's permanent secretary when DPM Heng was with the ministry.\n\nHe also gave a special mention to Mr Low, who had been an opposition MP from 1991 until this year, when he retired from politics.\n\n\"He's a fiery speaker at election rallies, but when it comes to the crunch, when our national interest is at stake, he stands together with the Government,\" said the DPM, adding that Mr Low has deep convictions about language, culture and heritage, and the long-term success of Singapore.\n\n\"When I last spoke to him, he told me he was very happy playing with his grandchild. I am glad he has recovered from his fall and wish him good health.\"\n\n3. Dennis Tan, Murali Pillai debate election incidents\n\nThe heat of the July general election may have cooled but it seems to have left an imprint on WP's Mr Dennis Tan (Hougang) and the People's Action Party's Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok).\n\nBoth crossed swords over Singapore's political culture as they revisited two incidents that allegedly took place in Mr Tan's single-member constituency during the polls.\n\nOne involved two complaints to the Elections Department (ELD) about posters WP put up that were said to be below the minimum required height, Mr Tan said. A resident later told him she had seen PAP representatives pulling his posters below the original height.\n\nOn another occasion, the PAP team planted party flags in front of his banners, Mr Tan said. But, he added, it would be unwise for the WP to do likewise in areas where the PAP is the incumbent, lest a tit-for-tat culture manifests and creates a divisive political culture.\n\nTo this, Mr Murali asked if Mr Tan would accept that the ELD would deal with such complaints in an even-handed way, and questioned the basis of his suggestion that the PAP would use the power of incumbency against opponents in an unfair way.\n\nMr Tan said he was not suggesting the PAP was using the power of its incumbency to do those things. Rather, the incidents demonstrate \"very petty and bad politics\" that should not be encouraged, he added. He also acknowledged the ELD had been even-handed in handling the complaints.\n\n4. Getting to grips with parliamentary business\n\nParliamentary processes are complicated and can trip up newbies, and even old-timers.\n\nShortly after Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng concluded his speech, WP chief Pritam Singh raised his hand, seeking clarification. But Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin failed to see it. Perhaps the three hours of speeches from MPs had given him some food for thought. He absent-mindedly called for a 15-minute break.\n\nWhen the House resumed business, Mr Tan was quick to rectify his error, but not without a touch of humour: \"Apologies, I missed your hand. I must have been too hungry just now,\" he quipped.\n\nMr Singh shrugged it off: \"It's okay, Mr Speaker, thank you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Tan delivered his maiden speech without a hitch as he peppered it with anecdotes and Chinese idioms to illustrate how businesses will be supported to adapt to new challenges sparked by the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nBut in an exchange with the Leader of the Opposition, he seemed to be hungry for more - questions, that is.\n\nAfter responding to Mr Singh twice, he continued to stay seated in the front row, unaware that the exchange was over.\n\nEducation Minister Lawrence Wong, sitting four seats to his left, came to the rescue. He caught his eye, nodded and indicated he could return to his seat in the second row. Dr Tan hastily stood up, masked himself up and moved back to his seat.\n\n5. Working towards a common goal\n\nSpeaker Tan Chuan-Jin, WP chief Pritam Singh and Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade GRC) share a common love for football, although they support different teams in the English Premier League.\n\nPerhaps inevitably, it provided inspiration for Mr Seah when he spoke of how political discourse and debate should take place without leading to polarisation and division.\n\n\"Having played football with both of you, I can say that Pritam - you're the best player among the three of us, by far,\" Mr Seah said with a grin, drawing laughter from the House.\n\nWhen they were in the Singapore Armed Forces, they held different ranks, Mr Seah noted. Mr Tan held the high rank of brigadier-general while \"many ranks below that\" were Mr Singh, a major, and Mr Seah, a captain.\n\nTheir common experiences and interests, despite some differences, have a parallel in how MPs of different political stripes can continue to find a common purpose and remain united when discussing issues in the House, Mr Seah pointed out.\n\n\"We all have different vocations but in our own ways, we all love our country. And we want to make lives better for all. So, too, my aspiration for Singapore: Our unity must lie in the small things - care for each other, love for the family, fighting for the person next to you.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nSingapore politicians", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/hzparl0831h.jpg?VersionId=QNjXYmI6V0XQt9VvrV0TwySa0E2xR7TV", "alt_text": null}]}

Otherwise, change will cause a rupture in society as we have seen elsewhere.\"\n\nMr Heng gave the assurance that the Government will adapt social safety nets to sustain the promise of progress for every Singaporean.\n\nA job remains the best form of welfare, he said, adding that the Government will continue to invest in people and match them to new opportunities to bring out the best in them.\n\nAt the same time, social spending has tripled over the last 15 years. This will rise as the population ages.\n\nThe shift to \"gig economy\" jobs, for instance, means Singapore's support for self-employed persons must evolve, even as work to uplift lower-wage workers continues.\n\nWhile the Government will keep an open mind to proposed ideas, such as a minimum wage, universal basic income and unemployment insurance, people must recognise there are no magic bullets, he said. Each of these ideas has its merits but also unintended effects, he added, cautioning against looking for \"what may appear to be costless solutions\".\n\n\"Somehow, someone else will have to pay for these schemes. There are trade-offs,\" he said. \"If we want higher social spending, taxes will have to go up. Or it will mean spending more at the expense of future generations, like what many countries are doing by raising debt.\"\n\nWhile social safety nets will be strengthened, this must be done in a way that reinforces - not undermines - individual effort, he added.\n\nThis should be funded equitably and sustainably, and strengthen people's capacity to both succeed and help others succeed, he said.\n\n\"A social safety net cannot become a set of shackles. It should not hold down those who started with less. It should not create dependency, such that people who get fish for today, never learn how to fish for food tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nMr Heng said a well-designed social safety net protects the vulnerable, invests in human and societal capital, and provides a means for those who fall down to bounce back.\n\n\"It supports every generation to have aspirations and dreams, and for everyone to ask: What more can we do for one another?\"\n\nHe was also glad that amid the pandemic, many have stepped up to support others. He cited the Masks Sewn With Love project, where volunteers sewed over 100,000 masks for vulnerable families.\n\nHow well Singapore emerges from the present crisis depends on its ability to adapt while holding true to its values, said Mr Heng.\n\n\"We are both a city state and a global metropolis - maintaining this 'dual identity' will not be easy,\" he said. \"But as long as we are clear about our values and what holds us together, it will be a source of strength that opens up new opportunities.\"\n\nHe emphasised the Government's commitment to building deeper partnerships with citizens, citing the Singapore Together movement launched last year to harness diverse ideas and shape a shared future.\n\nHe shared how his fellow East Coast GRC MPs recently engaged Ms Samantha Thian and a group of volunteers who regularly clean the beach at East Coast Park, and followed up with them last Saturday via video chat to discuss ways to create a more sustainable Singapore. \"I am very impressed by their passion and commitment (and) we agreed to work together to turn their good ideas into action,\" said Mr Heng.\n\nSuch partnerships foster a culture of respect and expand the common space, strengthening Singapore's capacity to adapt, he noted.\n\n\"We want to build on these efforts too, as we recover from Covid-19,\" he said, adding that this was why the Emerging Stronger Conversations have been convened to give Singaporeans a shared opportunity to reflect on their Covid-19 experience and articulate how they can take Singapore forward together.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nHeng Swee Keat\n\nCovid-19\n\nPolitics and government", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_YLHENG01_5926505.jpg?VersionId=8jEmAjmtx0CdiHn0nnNG6xEPL8OMH7OI", "alt_text": "Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat (left) and fellow East Coast GRC MP Tan Kiat How (second from left) engaging Ms Samantha Thian and fellow volunteers who regularly clean the beach at East Coast Park.

American author Brit Bennett's second novel hinges on the disparate lives of the Vignes sisters - identical, light-skinned twins who grow up in Mallard, Louisiana, a fictional town of people of colour in the Jim Crow-era south, where darkness equals trouble and locals pride themselves on the fairness of their skin.\n\nNot black, but not white either, they are \"fair and blonde and redheaded, the darkest ones no swarthier than a Greek\", and with every generation they strive to create \"a more perfect Negro. Each generation lighter than the one before\".\n\nLightness does not save the twins' father, who is lynched before their young eyes by violent, angry white men jealous of his business acumen.\n\nThe senselessness of this trauma and the colourism of the town drive the twins, at 16, to run away from Mallard in 1954 and start new lives in New Orleans.\n\nFrom there, their lives and their stories diverge, \"splitting as evenly as their shared egg. Stella became white and Desiree married the darkest man she could find\".\n\nWith creamy skin, hazel eyes and wavy hair, the twins can pass as white, which means that anyone who does not know their racial history would never think otherwise.\n\nWhen Stella takes a job as an office secretary, a job exclusive to white women, she decides to abandon her home town, her mother and her twin without warning, and pursue a life of safety and privilege as a white woman full-time.\n\nDesiree moves to Washington D.C. and marries Sam, a black man who becomes abusive. The story opens with Desiree's return to Mallard, 14 years after running away, now with her \"blueblack\" daughter Jude in tow.\n\nDespite her clear intelligence and athletic talents, Jude is bullied and ostracised throughout her childhood because of how black she is.\n\nWhen she eventually leaves Mallard for Los Angeles on a track scholarship, she falls in love with Reese, a transgender man who started life as Therese. Together, they subtly tease apart the nature of identity - how much of our identity is innate, how much is choice and how much of it is created by or for us?\n\nThough the parallels of gender determinism and racial identity are interesting, Bennett does not flesh the connections out.\n\nHaving a transgender character in the novel reads like an attempt to placate calls for diversity of representation in literature and is a distraction from the juicier ideological foundation of the novel, which is the performative nature of racial identity and the absurdity of racism.\n\nThe most interesting and heart-wrenching scenes in the book belong to Stella, who has married a blue-blooded white man from New England and moved to a wealthy gated community in the Brentwood suburb of Los Angeles.\n\nActing as white throughout her adult life has hollowed her out. She is numb, reserved and constantly afraid of being found out.\n\nWhen a black family moves in across the street, it is Stella who vocally opposes their arrival at a community meeting, because she is scared they will recognise her for who she is - not white - and ruin her perfect life with her husband and blonde, blue-eyed daughter.\n\nAs she fights for survival, she eventually befriends the new neighbours, and the novel is kept afloat by the moral reckoning she experiences while epitomising and challenging the internalised oppression of white supremacy.\n\nThe Vanishing Half comes alive in these emotional and intellectual interrogations of race, colour and identity.\n\nIf only Desiree had received the same narrative treatment. We never learn why she married \"the blackest man she could find\" or what life was like for her when she returned to Mallard with a deeply black child.\n\nNevertheless, Bennett is a skilled writer who keeps the pages turning, and a book like The Vanishing Half will engender desperately needed conversations in America and around the world.\n\nIf you like this, read:\n\nAmericanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Anchor Books , 2014, $19.80, available at\n\nbit.ly/Americanah_CNA\n\n).

People are flooding to the technology companies they think will do well regardless of the pandemic,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer, Independent Advisor Alliance. \"The US just passed 6 million cases, a further reminder that the pandemic is here to stay until we do something about it. Clearly it has an impact on all businesses but some are more pandemic resistant,\" he said.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 223.82 points, or 0.78%, to close at 28,430.05, the S&P 500 lost 7.7 points, or 0.22%, to 3,500.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 79.82 points, or 0.68%, to 11,775.46.\n\nTechnology, then healthcare and utilities stocks were the biggest percentage gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors while energy was the biggest percentage decliner.\n\nWith the S&P reaching 3.8% above its pre-crisis record during the session, Mona Mahajan, senior US investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors in New York, said investors were showing some caution by favoring technology as they looked warily at US and overseas Covid-19 numbers.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Its top two boosts for Monday were from Apple Inc and Tesla Inc after their stock splits. While the splits did not provide a fundamental reason to buy the stocks, Mahajan noted that the lower prices may be making the momentum stocks more attractive to some retail investors.\n\nFor the month the S&P showed a gain of 7.01%, its biggest advance for August since 1986 when it rose 7.1% that month.\n\nThe three main indexes showed their fifth straight monthly rise following March lows, even as economic data pointed to an uneven recovery from the steep downturn.\n\nFor the S&P, this was its longest winning steak on a monthly basis since a six-month run from April to September 2018. And the benchmark's 35.6% gain since April marked the strongest five-month run for the S&P since 1938, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nApple ended the day 3.4% higher at $129.04 while Tesla closed up 12.6% at $498.32.

That, he argued, was the best way to serve the interests of Singaporeans.\n\n\"Our starting point is that our economic strategies must serve the interests of Singaporeans,\" he said.\n\nThat is why manpower policies, such as on Employment Passes, are being adapted to ensure that the interests of Singaporeans are upheld in the face of economic disruption. But he warned against the temptation to turn inwards.\n\n\"The best way is to ensure that this little red dot - with no natural resources of any kind, but with a determined, hard-working, forward-looking people - remains useful and relevant to the world,\" said Mr Heng.\n\n\"We do this by keeping our economy vibrant and competitive, so that Singaporeans and other people choose to be here, to invest and do business, thereby creating good jobs and opportunities for all of us.\"\n\nThe Government will redouble its efforts to ensure that Singapore workers will be armed with the skills to grab the opportunities that come their way, helping them achieve their fullest potential, Mr Heng added.\n\nSome of the key points in Mr Heng's speech - adapting to change and strengthening the Singapore core of the workforce - were also themes that dominated discussion on day one of the debate in the House.\n\nTaking up the theme, labour MPs made plain that discrimination against local workers will not be tolerated.\n\nMr Patrick Tay (Pioneer), who delivered the opening address for the debate, called on the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to consider further raising the minimum qualifying salaries for Employment Pass (EP) holders for two sectors, infocomm technology and professional services. His call came days after the Government announced the second rise in salary thresholds of EP holders this year.\n\nMr Tay, who is an assistant secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, also urged the Government to consider tougher measures such as an EP quota.\n\nMinister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng emphasised that Singapore \"will not allow companies to practise wanton discrimination against our local talent\", and that MOM has been stepping up its surveillance and enforcement.\n\nBut he cautioned against curtailing manpower supply through measures like a quota system, which he said is not a long-term solution.\n\nWorkers' Party chief Pritam Singh called on the Government to go further, such as with an anti-discrimination law that will penalise egregious employers.\n\nDelivering his maiden speech\n\nas Singapore's first formally designated Leader of the Opposition, Mr Singh also charged that the lack of information on a complex issue like foreign manpower numbers has created \"a vacuum (that) has given space for a more toxic conversation to ferment\".\n\nReiterating his call for more data, Mr Singh said how much the opposition can do depends on the quantity and quality of information the Government puts out. He also urged the Government to \"put out more information without being asked to\".\n\nBoth People's Action Party and opposition MPs also touched on President Halimah Yacob's point in her speech last week that Singapore must evolve its politics, and the need to find a way to deliver effective government while accommodating the growing diversity of views here.\n\nLeader of the House Indranee Rajah cautioned against greater diversity of views and more robust debates in Parliament leading to greater polarisation among Singaporeans.\n\n\"Experience elsewhere shows that unity in diversity is not an assured outcome,\" she said. \"Our goal should be to harness this diversity of views in a constructive manner, so that we can as a Parliament better serve the interests of Singaporeans and Singapore.\"\n\nDPM Heng put it this way: \"This House must fulfil its duty, to articulate and debate policy options, to build a better life for our people, and to advance Singapore's place in the world. This is the mandate that has been entrusted to us by Singaporeans.\n\n\"I trust that all of us, whether in Government or the opposition, will share this common sense of mission, to serve in the best interests of Singaporeans and Singapore.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nHeng Swee Keat\n\nPritam Singh\n\nPolitics and government", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_YLWRAP01A_5926663.jpg?VersionId=i.IxN963YtytEB8jQhCEhw2zeO3a9VmV", "alt_text": "Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat speaking yesterday at the start of a week-long debate on the President's Address.

As of July, the Government and tripartite partners have helped 25,000 people link up with new opportunities, she said. Of the remaining places available, there are over 47,000 jobs, 16,000 traineeships and more than 10,000 training places, she added.\n\nAcknowledging the heightened sense of anxiety among Singaporeans about job security, Ms Gan said: \"In circumstances where retrenchment is unavoidable, and an employer has to choose between a foreigner and a Singaporean, I urge the employer to lean towards keeping the Singaporean.\n\n\"In short, if employers must retrench, retain the Singaporean over the foreigner.\"\n\nThis should be done for jobs like engineers and IT professionals. This first category of jobs are those Singaporeans want to and can do, but for which foreigners are needed during periods of economic growth to help meet demand, she said.\n\nFor the second category of jobs, in essential services such as construction and cleaning - which are not so popular with Singaporeans despite efforts to transform them - the aim should be to reduce the reliance on foreigners through job redesign and technology adoption.\n\nFor instance, the construction sector has created new and higher-skilled jobs through Design for Manufacturing and Assembly, which requires more production managers, quality assurance personnel, and logistics and supply chain planners, now that construction work has shifted offsite to automated production facilities, said Ms Gan.\n\nFor the third category of jobs, in global and regional companies that require global teams and certain professionals with highly specialised skills, the aim is to have Singaporeans as part of diverse teams. The Government also wants such companies to groom local talent so that Singaporeans have a fair shot at senior and top management positions, said Ms Gan.\n\nShe cited the experience of Ms Tan Chee Wei, 46, vice-president of human resources for the Asian region at energy giant Shell, who rose through the ranks from a human resources generalist over the last 18 years. In between, she spent a few years in London as a global HR adviser and also took on regional roles in organisational development and talent management.\n\nMs Gan said that to reduce the nation's reliance on foreigners in a sustained way, work productivity must be increased to bring down the overall demand for labour as the population ages. The total fertility rate also needs to rise such that a critical mass of Singaporeans is maintained in the labour force.\n\nShe also spoke about the importance of investing in building up skills so that the local workforce will be adaptive and skilled in diverse fields, and remain highly employable in the face of disruption.\n\nMs Gan said the Government will do its best to ensure fair opportunities for Singaporeans to get jobs, and support Singaporeans in acquiring skills.\n\nShe said: \"We will spare no effort to strengthen the Singaporean core, and walk the journey with every Singaporean. Because our people are our only asset, and every Singaporean counts.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nGan Siow Huang\n\nEmployment", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/md-gan-3108.jpg?VersionId=3KfQl9QrmMySW6z8G_hgwcEWdWya.SQ9", "alt_text": null}]}

After all, her home on the 21st floor in Crawford Lane overlooks the historic and colourful district of Kampong Glam.\n\nThe 35-year-old can also see the windows of her parents' five-room HDB flat, just a street away in North Bridge Road.\n\n\"There's a running joke in my family that my parents can wave a flag at their window when dinner is ready and we'll just walk over,\" said Ms Ang, who is an only child.\n\nFive years ago, Ms Ang and her husband Gary Lim, 39, who works as a director of photography, had specifically searched for resale units within walking distance of her parents' flat, where she grew up.\n\nNow that she is working from home, the decision to live near her parents, who are in their 60s, has paid off, she said. She goes to their place an average of four times a week, sometimes for a meal and other times just to chat.\n\n\"This area feels very much like home to me. As much as it has seen me grow up, I have also witnessed the change and development in this neighbourhood. I cannot imagine living anywhere else,\" she said.\n\nFor Ms Ang and many other Singaporeans, their homes have taken on added significance amid the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMost have never spent as much time in their homes as they have in the past few months, in line with the authorities urging people to work from home where possible.\n\nMs Ang said that growing up, she never imagined the quaint neighbourhood of Kampong Glam, now a thriving arts and cultural district, would become as popular as it is today.\n\nTo live, work and play in the bustling cultural district where there is a blend of old and new is \"pretty amazing\", she said.\n\n\"At the neighbourhood shops, everyone knows everyone because they've been there for ages. A few streets away, you also get the hipster cafes,\" she added.\n\nOne of her fondest childhood memories is following her grandmother to the nearby wet market in North Bridge Road to buy groceries. These days, she still visits the same market.\n\n\"It has been upgraded over the years, but what's nice is that the character of the place is still intact, and the same community still goes there,\" she said.\n\nCapture snapshots of HDB life to win cameras, cash\n\nTo celebrate its 60th anniversary, the Housing Board has partnered Singapore Press Holdings' Photonico platform to trace Singapore's public housing journey through photos.\n\nTitled \"Shapes of Home\", the photo contest invites members of the public to share what home means to them in either of two categories:\n\n\u2022 Green and distinctive HDB designs and architecture\n\n\u2022 Heartland moments, which include vibrant heartland life, moments in and around homes\n\nHOW TO JOIN:\n\n\u2022 Submit your photos on the\n\nPhotonico website\n\n\u2022 Post them publicly on Instagram with the hashtag #ShapesOfHome\n\nPRIZES FOR 'SHAPES OF HOME' CONTEST:\n\n\u2022 1st prize: Canon EOS 90D with 18-135mm kit lens (worth $2,379)\n\n\u2022 2nd prize: Sony RX100 VII (worth $1,649)\n\n\u2022 3rd prize: GoPro Hero 8 with accessories (worth $750)\n\n\u2022 10 merit awards: $400 cash each\n\nPRIZES FOR #SHAPESOFHOME INSTAGRAM CONTEST:\n\n\u2022 1st prize: Samsung S20+ (worth $1,498)\n\n\u2022 10 Instagram merit awards: $200 cash each\n\nCLOSING DATE:\n\n\u2022 Submissions close on Oct 16\n\nThe mix of old and new in the upcoming town of Bidadari is also what drew Mr Sathiyasivan Balakrishnan, a 31-year-old customer service officer, to apply for a Build-To-Order (BTO) flat there almost five years ago.\n\nHe and his wife Durgashini Sathiyasivan, 28, a civil servant, are eagerly waiting to move into their three-room flat early next year. It is currently being renovated.\n\nThe couple now live with Mr Sathiyasivan's mother in St George's Road in Boon Keng, where he has been living since he was 19.\n\nThey had opted for the mature estate of Bidadari for their first home because they wanted to live in a central location with established amenities such as eateries.\n\n\"For festivals such as the Chinatown and Little India light-ups, or the Ramadan bazaar in Geylang Serai, we'll be more likely to go because it's just a short bus ride away,\" said Mr Sathiyasivan.\n\n\"Potong Pasir, which is just opposite our future house, has an old-school charm to it which we like as well,\" he added.\n\nStories such as Ms Ang's and Mr Sathiyasivan's have been among the fruits of HDB's labour over the last six decades.\n\nIn 1960, amid a severe housing shortage, the HDB was established to build many flats quickly and cost-effectively. These early flats were simple and utilitarian, while the towns had basic facilities.\n\nSince then, the HDB has continued to build homes to cater to Singaporeans' evolving needs and aspirations. Around 1.2 million flats have been built so far.\n\nGreening efforts have been stepped up, with landscaped spaces incorporated throughout every housing development, along with smart and sustainable features in new towns such as Tengah.\n\nOlder towns have also been systematically upgraded through various HDB programmes - such as the Home Improvement Programme and the Remaking Our Heartland programme.\n\nOver 80 per cent of Singaporeans live in HDB flats, and nine out of 10 own their homes.\n\nIn celebration of its 60th anniversary this year, the HDB has partnered Singapore Press Holdings' Photonico platform in a project - titled \"\n\nShapes of Home\n\n\" - to trace the evolution of Singapore's public housing journey.\n\nMembers of the public are invited to take part in a photo contest to share what home means to them.\n\nWinning entries will be published in The Straits Times and on the Photonico website.\n\nST will also run a series of 10 Big Picture pages every Wednesday and Saturday, starting this Saturday, with archive photographs showcasing life in HDB estates.\n\nThe HDB said: \"Through the years, 'home' has also transcended beyond the physical four walls, into the heartland, estates and towns.

Companies will not be allowed to practise wanton discrimination against local workers, Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng said yesterday.\n\nHe told Parliament that Ministry of Manpower officers are working \"doubly hard\" on this front, and have been stepping up their scrutiny and enforcement actions.\n\nThe Government will give Singaporean job seekers a stronger boost \"by working with businesses to give more serious consideration to Singaporeans when hiring, especially those who are wiling to adjust their expectations and adapt\", he added.\n\nBusinesses are also expected to strive harder to strengthen their Singaporean core, he said in his maiden speech in the House.\n\nBut he reassured employers that Singapore will not turn away global talents and investments, as skilled foreign workers allow it to remain globally competitive and provide learning opportunities for citizens.\n\nDr Tan, who is also a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Trade and Industry, made these points as he pledged to support two key groups of workers - young graduates and mature workers - whom he said had a \"growing concentration of disengaged Singaporeans\".\n\n\"We must always remember that our workers are the heart of our economy, and we must help our workforce to emerge stronger from this crisis,\" he said.\n\nMature workers are \"near and dear\" to him, Dr Tan, 55, added. \"Our mature workers in their 40s and 50s have contributed a good part of their lives to our economy,\" he said. They possess \"a significant treasure of experiential knowledge and practice wisdom that cannot be replaced by or gleaned from academic pursuits or qualifications\".\n\nAs they strive to prepare for new job roles, employers should consider them fairly and offer them good opportunities for improvement and progression, he added.\n\nAs for young graduates, Dr Tan said he has received feedback that they are worried about, among other things, getting a job in the current labour market. His message: \"Although you may seem to have been dealt a difficult starting hand, we will do all we can to ensure that your generation will still flourish and fulfil your potential.\"\n\nHe also urged all job seekers, regardless of age and background, to be realistic in their expectations and to keep an open mind about available opportunities.\n\nTo continue to do well and thrive, Singapore must be exceptional, he said.\n\n\"Exceptional in our dreams and aspirations, exceptional in our execution and implementation, and most important of all, exceptional in the way we care for one another and carry one another.\"\n\nResponding to a question from Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh on whether stepping up action entailed raising the budget for the anti-discrimination watchdog Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (Tafep), Dr Tan said the ministry is looking at beefing up resources to scrutinise unfair hiring practices.\n\nAs for whether the ministry was still seeing errant or uncooperative employers in spite of the Fair Consideration Framework, introduced in 2014 to ensure fair hiring for Singaporeans, Dr Tan said that besides monitoring such firms, MOM will work with them to understand how they had too many foreign workers.\n\n\"That is the kind of engagement I was alluding to. Suffice to say, today we have stepped up, we are all working very hard to make sure that the companies work with the relevant authorities to ensure that fair hiring, non-discriminatory practices are more prevalent,\" he added.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nHeng Swee Keat", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_GRADS01_5926947.jpg?VersionId=.XjftSVAjrfM_IsX0uYXyzBFBTWVyV4i", "alt_text": "Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng pledged to support two key groups of workers - young graduates and mature workers."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_HIRE01_5926621.jpg?VersionId=Hw_ZPZx6nv7K4hfCTjxGNlfT4Jw8xAWd", "alt_text": "Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng pledged to support two key groups of workers - young graduates and mature workers."}]}

Critics of the new legislation say it has pushed the former British colony onto a more authoritarian path following months of sometimes violent democracy protests last year.\n\nMr Daniel Wong, chief executive of Midland IC&I, said: \"Foreign investors are still absent. I spoke to two foreign funds recently who said they won't consider Hong Kong at the moment because the political risks are relatively high now.\"\n\nIn July, state-owned China Mobile and a consortium led by major Chinese developer Vanke bought one land parcel each for HK$5.6 billion and HK$3.7 billion, respectively. They were the first Chinese companies to win public tenders since January.\n\nColliers says it expects mainland capital will become \"the next wave of demand\" in the Hong Kong leasing and investment markets, supported by cross-border financial initiatives in stock and wealth management, and the city's large capital pool for fund-raising.\n\nChina called on its biggest state firms to take a more active role in Hong Kong, including stepping up investment and asserting more control of companies to help cool last year's political crisis, Reuters reported last year.\n\nIt is unclear, however, whether the latest spike in investment is being driven by Beijing because while some of the buyers are government-backed, many of them are private investors.\n\nBut the city recorded a plunge in deal volume amid the unrest and the pandemic, and has yet to witness a rise in mainland investments comparable to a few years ago.\n\nColliers said in a recent note: \"There are early signs of mainland Chinese demand returning.\"\n\nChinese investment accounted for 39 per cent of total commercial real estate transactions in Hong Kong so far this year, up from 19 per cent for the whole of last year, Colliers said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nHong Kong\n\nProperty prices", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_BIZHKPROP01_5926216.jpg?VersionId=.nYr6Ks116QZaM3d4uZaXg9SFzxinFPt", "alt_text": "Commercial buildings in Hong Kong's Central district.

Take an even more integrated and coordinated approach to economic transformation.\n\nThe Republic's economy has multiple stakeholders, and tripartism - the Government, businesses and the labour movement working together - has been a tremendous source of strength in the system.\n\nBut there is room for greater collaboration, said Mr Heng, citing the Netherlands and its \"triple helix\" model where government, businesses and academia work together to build knowledge, test prototypes, and scale innovation.\n\n\"Singapore can build on our tripartite partnership, to be a test-bed that creates deeper linkages with an expanded set of stakeholders - including our education and research institutions, our community groups, and interested partners from around the world,\" said Mr Heng. This can create good jobs for Singaporeans and new opportunities for entrepreneurs, he added.\n\n2. Redouble efforts to develop everyone to their fullest potential, so that people can take on new opportunities and flourish in their chosen pursuits.\n\nMr Heng, who is also Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies and Finance Minister, said: \"We need a holistic approach for this that spans the lifetime of individuals, from birth to pre-school, to schools, all the way to lifelong learning as part of SkillsFuture.\"\n\nHe noted that half a million people took part in SkillsFuture programmes last year.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Strengthen Singapore's path-finding capacity to find new bright spots amid economic disruption.\n\nOn the Emerging Stronger Taskforce, which was set up four months ago to identify and seize new opportunities in emerging trends, Mr Heng said: \"The ideas being explored are promising. They range from environmental sustainability to smart commerce, supply chain digitalisation, and the use of robotics. These can create new growth markets for our businesses and good jobs for Singaporeans.\"\n\nMany hawkers and small businesses islandwide are going digital, Mr Heng added, citing a fruit seller known as \"Ah Boy\" who operates a stall in the market at Block 58 New Upper Changi Road. The hawker also sells his fruits online and takes orders through text messaging service WhatsApp.\n\nIn addition, Singapore will invest in incubating and accelerating start-ups, and supporting established companies to expand their research and development to build competitive strengths, he said.\n\n4. Find new ways to be a vital node with rich and deep interconnections with the rest of the world.\n\nBeing open is Singapore's strength and opportunity as a small city state, said Mr Heng. \"We cannot take for granted that, in a post-Covid-19 world, we can continue to be the same kind of hub that we used to be. We must, therefore, forge new forms of connections, such as digital economy agreements, while deepening our linkages with regional markets to ride on Asia's potential,\" he said.\n\nMr Heng also emphasised the need for Singapore to remain open to investment and talent from around the world, as he acknowledged that many Singaporeans are anxious about their livelihoods.\n\n\"Our starting point is that our economic strategies must serve the interests of Singaporeans,\" he said, adding that the foreign investments attracted must create meaningful jobs for Singaporeans and strengthen the country's corporate ecosystem, and Singaporeans must receive fair consideration.\n\nHe said manpower policies are being adapted to changing circumstances to ensure that Singaporeans' interests are upheld, but Singapore must resist the temptation to turn inwards. \"We cannot close ourselves to the world, or make foreigners unwelcome in our society.\"\n\nThe best way to serve Singaporeans' interests, he added, is to ensure Singapore remains useful and relevant to the world by keeping its economy vibrant and competitive.\n\nIt must also continue to develop its people fully, to have the confidence to seize new opportunities post-Covid-19, including by working with partners from around the world.\n\nAcknowledging labour MP Patrick Tay's suggestion to refresh and relook the Industry Transformation Maps' strategies to address future challenges, Mr Heng said Singapore should enhance the linkages between what it does to develop its people and job creation, in the form of skills maps, job redesign, and reskilling workers to take on new job opportunities.\n\n\"In particular, we must also make a deliberate effort to develop Singaporeans for leadership roles in companies, so that they can take Singapore forward. Singapore, as a regional operational headquarters, has what it takes. Singaporeans, in a multiracial, multi-religious, multicultural environment, can connect with people all around us and build deep linkages with our friends in the region,\" he added.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nHeng Swee Keat\n\nSingapore economy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a4ba312342cb28d959ba43b8e97d9852c3016ccb307dfc77a8f05e0c12d3f0d", "alt_text": "The pontoon used for the open water venue at the World Aquatics Championships in Sentosa on July 7, 2025."}]}

This would need a lot more effort and time to contain, he warned.\n\nAs the country experiments with relaxing some border restrictions, there is an even greater need for each individual to keep his guard up and maintain discipline over mask wearing, safe distancing and limiting large gatherings, he stressed.\n\nAn uptick of community cases locally could also see other countries making it harder for Singaporeans to travel, Prof Fisher noted.\n\nThere are signs that it may not be all smooth sailing ahead if people do not stay vigilant, he said, pointing to the sight of crowded malls.\n\n\"It's important to not build crowds as that setting could see a super-spreading event. There are so many people and safe distancing is not possible. Of course, our numbers remain good, but what makes increasing numbers is the bad behaviour such as crowding and the lack of safe distancing.\"\n\nWith phase two, which started on June 19, extending beyond two months, it is also important that Singaporeans do not become too greedy in wanting a quicker pace of easing of restrictions, Prof Fisher said. \"Nothing has changed, the virus is still there and we are still vulnerable. People should be pleased that our numbers are low and we have good freedoms.\"\n\nThe relaxation of rules also depends on factors beyond the sheer number of people in a group, said Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.\n\nThings like the size of a space, the proximity of people in it, the level of ventilation, and if there will be eating, loud conversation or singing, all play a role in determining the level of risk, he noted.\n\nIt is hard to capture every nuance in a general rule, he mused.\n\n\"So the tension in increasing the social group size to more than five is the need to second-guess how people will behave once the change comes. People are complicated, much more so than viruses are,\" he noted.\n\nNonetheless, despite the persistence of community cases, Singapore remains in a good position, Prof Cook said.\n\n\"The two most important things that we should avoid exceeding are our intensive care unit capacity, and the capacity of our contact tracing teams. At the current level of transmission, neither is an immediate threat.\"\n\nWith Covid-19 being a new normal that everyone needs to adapt to, being able to deal with some level of fatigue would be critical, the experts noted.\n\n\"The reality is, until we are able to go about our daily lives without having to wear a mask or to worry about safe distancing and SafeEntry, there will always be a degree of fatigue that one will feel, and it is something we must tackle collectively to avoid a resurgence in the community,\" Prof Teo said.\n\nOne silver lining of the family cluster would be to see it as a test of the overall system, from tracing and testing to isolating contacts.\n\n\"If the system kicks in efficiently, we should see perhaps a few more linked cases emerge during the quarantine period, and subsequently the chain terminates,\" said Prof Teo.\n\nLISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/rk_singaporeans_310820.jpg?VersionId=9FFsuHlFRMmtdcrwGEMbsLbH.iCFkur_", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a4ba312342cb28d959ba43b8e97d9852c3016ccb307dfc77a8f05e0c12d3f0d", "alt_text": "The pontoon used for the open water venue at the World Aquatics Championships in Sentosa on July 7, 2025."}]}

Rates for industry use decreased by 0.9 per cent.\n\nThese smaller declines show that residential and industrial properties have been relatively more resilient during the pandemic, said Ms Song.\n\nMND revises the rates on March 1 and Sept 1 each year, in consultation with the taxman's chief valuer.\n\nRates remain unchanged for landed residential, place of worship/civic and community institution uses as well as for three other land-use groups: nature reserves; agricultural land; drains, roads, railways and cemeteries.\n\nMs Tay said the DC cuts reflect the wary approach being taken by firms now: \"Most businesses are likely staying cautious on their space requirements and hence continue to weigh on both rents and prices in the coming quarters.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of National Development\n\nURA\n\nProperty market/sector\n\nLand planning/Land sales", "images": []}

It measures 1.2m by 1.6m, and is 2.4m high.\n\nAfter any gaps between the entrance and the system are sealed, a Hepa filter unit at the top of the system is powered up to create a negative pressure environment within the patient's room, so that contaminated air from the room will not escape.\n\nThe chamber has two doors, one at the entrance of the ward and one inside the ward.\n\nWhen the inside door opens, contaminated air flows into the chamber and through the Hepa filter, and clean air re-enters the room.\n\nThe 70kg system takes an hour to set up and was installed at SGH's Medical ICU in July.\n\nThe collapsible SG-Sparc can also be fixed to single-and multiple-bed wards.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Measuring 3.8m by 1.6m and with a height of 2m, the system prevents droplets from escaping the room while surgical operations, including aerosol-generating procedures, are performed on infectious patients.\n\nThe 150kg chamber takes two hours to set up. One system has been installed in an operating theatre in SGH.\n\nThe two systems were developed by anaesthesiologists from SGH, in collaboration with local biomedical incubator The Biofactory. The project was funded by SingHealth Duke-NUS' Urgent Covid-19 Research Fund, with contribution from The Biofactory.\n\nCompared with existing systems, SG-Sparc has a combination of advanced features such as contactless sensors and a higher rate of air filtration, which makes it the first of its kind, said Dr Mavis Teo, a consultant at SGH's department of anaesthesiology.\n\nIn a room fitted with the system, the air can be filtered up to 300 times an hour, compared with an operating theatre where the air is filtered 12 times an hour.\n\nThe inventions come at a time when existing numbers of isolation rooms abroad are insufficient to support the Covid-19 surge. It is also costly and time-consuming to build isolation rooms.\n\nAn SG-Sparc system costs half as much as renovating an ICU room to turn it into an isolation room, said Mr Gabriel Tan, The Biofactory's programme director.\n\nSaid Dr Teo, who is the project's co-investigator: \"We have seen how hospitals in Italy, in the UK and US - all quite well-developed countries - struggled when they ran out of negative pressure isolation rooms during the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\n\n\"It got us thinking if there is a way for us to very quickly and temporarily convert existing patient rooms, especially ICU rooms, to care for infectious patients when the need arises,\" she added.\n\nMr Tan said SG-Sparc has received strong interest from local and overseas hospitals.\n\nLISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nA*Star/Agency for Science, Technology and Research\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/af_entering-icu_310820.jpg?VersionId=1I5qvm6mylrkts0kn_o2iSf62DL5vYJ5", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a4ba312342cb28d959ba43b8e97d9852c3016ccb307dfc77a8f05e0c12d3f0d", "alt_text": "The pontoon used for the open water venue at the World Aquatics Championships in Sentosa on July 7, 2025."}]}

It could well be that many WTO members want to wait until after the (Nov 3 US) election, hoping that the administration changes\".\n\nMr Azevedo's surprise announcement in May that he would end his second WTO term 12 months early forced the organisation to speed up its usually lengthy process of selecting a new leader.\n\nThree Africans, two Europeans, two Asians and one Latin American quickly threw their hats in the ring.\n\nThe WTO is due next month to begin three rounds of consultations - dubbed \"confessionals\" - in which all member states confidentially voice their preferences, gradually whittling down the list. The process, based on consensus, is expected to last until mid-November.\n\nBut soaring international tensions and growing politicisation of picks to head UN agencies and other international organisations could trip up the tentative timeline.\n\nMembers failed last month to pick an acting chief from among four deputy directors - usually a straightforward process.\n\nBrussels and Washington butted heads over whether German Karl Brauner or American Alan Wolff should get the job, in what observers say was unprecedented politicisation of an administrative decision.\n\nMs Elvire Fabry, a researcher at the Jacques Delors Institute, said that \"the US veto\" of widely-backed Mr Brauner was first and foremost linked to President Donald Trump's wish to \"increase the power play towards the European Union... ahead of the election\".\n\n\"Making such a concession, even for an interim (chief), would have been too much for him,\" she said, adding that Washington might also expect the interim period \"to be longer than predicted, and does not want to allow a European to settle into the position\".\n\nA Western trade diplomat who asked not to be named said there was concern over how far some might be willing to go to prevail.\n\nMr Sebastien Jean, head of the French research centre Cepii, said: \"It is difficult to measure the harmful power the US is exerting on this process, to know how far they can and want to go to interfere and disrupt things.\"\n\nHe added: \"I think that is the great unknown. There is a feeling that the US will probably remain fairly passive and show little good will until Nov 3.\"\n\nSome think the wait could last until Jan 20, when the next US president is sworn in, before things will move forward.\n\nMany say the process has never been so politicised, and some suggest the organisation might be forced to ditch its long-held policy of consensus and ask members to vote. That would mark a big shift.\n\nIn 1999, when members were unable to unanimously choose who should be given four years at the helm, they opted to hand the two top picks a three-year mandate each instead of resorting to a vote.\n\nBut Prof Elsig said such a decision would be unfortunate in the current climate. \"Someone with a short three-year tenure might likely be perceived as a lame duck from the beginning,\" he said.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nWorld Trade Organisation\n\nEconomic affairs", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/ST_20200901_WTO01_5926408.jpg?VersionId=EOW_6Kdb_hOphTcFvpjLsiZ79AlbkU6R", "alt_text": "Mr Roberto Azevedo's announcement in May that he would end his second WTO term 12 months early forced the organisation to speed up its process of selecting a new leader.

One is sheer size. Ant's giant offering may skew comparisons with 1999, particularly if it surpasses Saudi Aramco's US$29 billion IPO last year as the largest in history.\n\nThe past year has featured an unusual number of first-time share sales on Hong Kong or mainland bourses by Chinese companies already listed abroad, fearing a backlash from an increasingly belligerent Trump administration. They include Alibaba, JD.com and top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International.\n\nThe rise of the hyper-local ChiNext and Star markets in China has also inflated this year's pipeline. Punters on the mainland have gobbled up loss-making debutantes like never before - triggering first-day rallies of over 2,000 per cent in some cases - partly because they believe Beijing will offer financial and other forms of aid for a Chinese tech sector seen as essential given the Trump administration's curbs on trade.\n\nFinally, the unknown extent of the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic has led some companies to rethink their capital needs or speed up plans.\n\nAirbnb, which was previously seen as a candidate for a direct listing, said last month it filed for a traditional IPO. Last week, on Monday alone, four biomedical companies, four blank-cheque companies and five software companies, including Unity Software, filed to go public.\n\n\"The year has been really busy for equity capital markets deals so far despite all the headline news,\" said Bank of America co-head of equity capital markets for Asia-Pacific Tucker Highfield.\n\n\"We expect to see strong IPO markets to the end of year as investors continue to look for higher returns.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nIPO\n\nStock market\n\nHong Kong", "images": []}

Coming from behind is a bit of a risk, but I found my way through the barrier and I came with a lot of speed.\"\n\nEwan was proud to win again on the biggest stage, a year after taking three stage victories on his first participation in the Tour. \"I'm so happy to get another win and then prove last year was no fluke.

DBS Bank's CET1 ratio stood at 13.7 per cent as of the second quarter, OCBC Bank at 14.2 per cent and United Overseas Bank (UOB) at 14 per cent.\n\nFitch Ratings said such targets will be \"inconsistent with current scoring\" if there is no credible plan to restore them \"within a reasonable horizon\".\n\n\"The capital score is likely to be lowered should the banks sustain CET1 ratios well below 14 per cent without a credible plan to rebuild them to around 14 per cent within the next couple of years.\"\n\nIt did note that the Monetary Authority of Singapore's call for banks to cap dividends for this year will \"go some way\" in helping them maintain capital ratios at a level \"commensurate with risk\" for the year.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

In turn, credit migration is likely to have an impact on their capital ratios.\n\nIn the second quarter, all three banks recorded a sharp dive in earnings as benchmark rates collapsed and the trio lifted provisions. DBS' net profit fell 22 per cent to $1.2 billion, OCBC's slumped 40 per cent to $730 million, while UOB's tumbled 40 per cent to $703 million.\n\nNet interest margin (NIM) compression started late last year, with a big drop in the second quarter as the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor) fell significantly.\n\n\"We expect continued margin compression due to the lag effect of Sibor reduction, which will pressure revenues for 2020. We believe margins are likely to be flat in 2021,\" said Fitch Ratings.\n\nNIM in the second quarter stood at 1.62 per cent for DBS, 1.6 per cent for OCBC and 1.48 per cent for UOB.\n\nThe agency said there may be some residual lag from falling benchmark rates, although banks are likely to price new loans higher, given the potentially higher incremental risk, less competition in the market and potentially tighter liquidity. Banks have also been cutting deposit rates to lift margins.\n\nFitch Ratings has projected for non-performing loan (NPL) ratios to peak at a little over 3 per cent next year for the trio. As they continue to build buffers in the second quarter, all three have kept to their earlier guidance from the first quarter. Second-quarter NPL ratios remained steady at 1.6 per cent for OCBC and UOB, and at 1.5 per cent for DBS.\n\n\"Regulatory relief has generally held NPLs stable (so far this year),\" said the agency.\n\nBut it warned that the full extent of the pandemic's impact may be reflected only in next year's NPL ratios, as debt repayment moratoria offered to borrowers will delay much impaired-loans recognition.\n\nThat said, the banks are expected to continue to book significant general provisions this year. \"We give the Singapore banks benefit for their high leverage ratios,\" Fitch Ratings said.\n\n\"We expect all three... to continue to generate profits throughout the downturn, with the trough being in 2020.\"\n\nTHE BUSINESS TIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nBanks and financial institutions\n\nCredit ratings", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a4ba312342cb28d959ba43b8e97d9852c3016ccb307dfc77a8f05e0c12d3f0d", "alt_text": "The pontoon used for the open water venue at the World Aquatics Championships in Sentosa on July 7, 2025."}]}

Health Agency chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has said they have little proven effect and could lead to a false sense of security among wearers.\n\nBut health agency director-general Johan Carlson told a press conference on Aug 18 that there may be situations - such as doctor and dentist visits and on public transport - where face mask recommendations could be issued.\n\nSweden's death toll relative to its population has far outstripped those of its neighbours although it remains lower than in some European countries that adopted strict lockdowns such as Britain and Spain.\n\nSee more on\n\nSweden\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/file7b6rjp4apow1057bmn3b.jpg?VersionId=1xdPoYs.lVt3ck4yFofubIjyglZ6zYZn", "alt_text": null}]}

PRITAM SINGH'S MAIDEN SPEECH AS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION\n\nWorkers' Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh, who was appointed Leader of the Opposition after his party won an unprecedented 10 seats in Parliament at the recent general election, used the longer time - 40 minutes - he has been allocated to delve into the opposition's role in debating policies in Parliament.\n\nIn his 33-minute speech, Mr Singh said he and his WP colleagues will have to work extra hard. \" We will have to ask ourselves tough questions before critiquing government policy. The chief of which is, what would we do if we were in charge.\"\n\nBut, he added, there must be clarity about \"what the opposition can and cannot do\".\n\nWith 10 MPs in Parliament, the WP falls far short of the resources available to the Government, he said, and it was important for Singaporeans to take this into account when forming their expectations of the opposition.\n\nWhile the WP will not form a shadow Cabinet owing to a lack of resources, he announced\n\nthat it will organise itself to scrutinise policies in five areas important to Singaporeans.\n\nThe five areas are: health, ageing and retirement adequacy; jobs, businesses and the economy; education, inequality and the cost of living; housing, transport and infrastructure; and national sustainability, a broad area about how to ensure Singapore continues to thrive far into the future for successive generations.\n\n2. DPM HENG SWEE KEAT THANKS RETIRED MPs\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat carved out time from a wide-ranging speech to pay tribute to MPs who have retired, including\n\nformer prime minister Goh Chok Tong\n\nand\n\nformer WP chief Low Thia Khiang.\n\nMr Heng recalled that Mr Goh's advice to him during the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 left a lasting impression on him, and it continues to guide his work during the pandemic.\n\nHe was then managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), while Mr Goh was then its chairman. Then, banks around the world were in trouble, and MAS had to make a momentous decision on whether to seek the President's approval for a $150 billion guarantee on all bank deposits backed up by Singapore's past reserves, Mr Heng said.\n\n\"I was glad to have his wise counsel. Mr Goh taught us that we must face difficult decisions head-on. It was a lesson that stayed with me,\" added DPM Heng, who thanked his former bosses at the Ministry of Trade and Industry as well, namely\n\nformer trade and industry minister Lim Hng Kiang\n\nand\n\nformer transport minister Khaw Boon Wan,\n\nwho was MTI's permanent secretary when DPM Heng was with the ministry.\n\nHe also gave a special mention to Mr Low, who had been an opposition MP since 1991 until this year,\n\nwhen he retired from politics.\n\n\"He's a fiery speaker at election rallies, but when it comes to the crunch, when our national interest is at stake, he stands together with the Government,\" said the DPM, adding that Mr Low has deep convictions about language, culture and heritage, and the long-term success of Singapore. \"When I last spoke to him, he told me he was very happy playing with his grandchild. I am glad he has recovered from his fall and wish him good health.\"\n\n3. DENNIS TAN, MURALI PILLAI DEBATE ELECTION MISDEMEANOURS\n\nThe heat of the July general election may have cooled but it seems to have left an imprint on WP's Mr Dennis Tan (Hougang) and PAP's Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok).\n\nBoth\n\ncrossed swords over Singapore's political culture\n\non Monday (Aug 31) as they revisited two incidents that allegedly took place in Mr Tan's single-member constituency during the polls.\n\nOne involved two complaints being made to the Elections Department (ELD) about posters WP had put up that were said to be below the minimum required height, Mr Tan told the House.\n\nA resident subsequently informed him that she had seen PAP representatives pulling his posters below the original height.\n\nOn another occasion, the PAP team planted party flags in front of his banners, blocking their contents, Mr Tan said.\n\nBut, he added, it would be unwise for the WP to do likewise in constituencies where the PAP are the incumbents, lest a tit-for-tat culture manifests itself and create a divisive political culture.\n\nTo this, Mr Murali asked if Mr Tan would accept that the ELD would deal with such complaints in an even-handed way, and questioned the basis of his suggestion that the PAP would use the power of incumbency against opponents in an unfair way.\n\nMr Tan said he was not suggesting the PAP was using the power of its incumbency to do those things. Rather, the incidents demonstrate \"very petty and bad politics\" that should not be encouraged, he added.\n\nHe also acknowledged that the ELD had been even-handed in handling the complaints.\n\n4. GETTING TO GRIPS WITH PARLIAMENTARY BUSINESS\n\nParliamentary processes are complicated and can trip up newbies, even old-timers.\n\nShortly after Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng concluded his speech on Monday (Aug 16), WP chief Pritam Singh raised his hand, seeking clarification.\n\nBut Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin failed to see it. Perhaps, the three hours of speeches from MPs had given him some food for thought? He absent-mindedly called for a 15-minute break.\n\nWhen the House resumed business, Mr Tan was quick to rectify his error, but not without a touch of humour. \"Apologies, I missed your hand. I must have been too hungry just now,\" he quipped. Mr Singh shrugged it off: \"It's okay, Mr Speaker, thank you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Tan delivered his maiden speech without a hitch as he peppered it with anecdotes and Chinese idioms to illustrate how businesses will be supported to adapt to new challenges sparked by the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nBut in an exchange with the Leader of the Opposition, he seems to be hungry for more - questions, that is.\n\nAfter responding to Mr Singh twice, he continued to stay seated on the front row, unaware that the exchange was over.\n\nEducation Minister Lawrence Wong, sitting four seats to his left, came to the rescue. He caught his eye, nodded and indicated he could return to his seat in the second row. Dr Tan hastily stood up, masked himself up and moved back to his seat.\n\n5. WORKING TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL\n\nSpeaker Tan Chuan-Jin, WP chief Pritam Singh and Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade GRC) share a common love for football, although they support different teams in the English Premier League .\n\nPerhaps inevitable, it provided inspiration for Mr Seah when he spoke of how political discourse and debate should take place without leading to polarisation and division.\n\n\"Having played football with both of you, I can say that Pritam - you're the best player among the three of us, by far,\" Mr Seah said with a grin, drawing laughter from the House.\n\nWhen they were in the Singapore Armed Forces, they held different ranks, Mr Seah noted. Mr Tan held the high rank of brigadier-general, while \"many ranks below that\" were Mr Singh, a major, and Mr Seah, a captain.\n\nTheir common experiences and interests despite some differences are a parallel to how MPs of different political stripes can continue to find a common purpose and remain united when discussing issues in the House, Mr Seah pointed out.\n\n\"We all have different vocations but in our own ways, we all love our country. And we want to make lives better for all. So too my aspiration for Singapore: our unity must lie in the small things - care for each other, love for the family, fighting for the person next to you.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nPoliticians\n\nPritam Singh\n\nPAP\n\nLeader of the Opposition", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/hzparl0831h.jpg?VersionId=QNjXYmI6V0XQt9VvrV0TwySa0E2xR7TV", "alt_text": null}]}

Including Lukashenko himself atop the list was a prod at other European countries, which have so far been reluctant to back measures against him personally.\n\nMr Lukashenko, an ally of Moscow, denies electoral fraud and has said the protesters are backed from abroad.\n\n\"We said that we need peaceful dialogue and agreement between the regime and society, but we see that the regime is not ready for that,\" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said. \"We see that we need to move forward and to show an example to other countries.\"\n\nThe European Union has been working on its own list of individuals in Belarus to target with similar sanctions, expected to exclude Mr Lukashenko. Western countries have mostly been cautious, wary of provoking an intervention from Russia.\n\nThe three small Baltic states are all members of the EU and NATO, and Lithuania and Latvia border Belarus. Lithuania has been hosting Belarusian opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled there after the election her supporters say she won.\n\nMs Tsikhanouskaya will speak to the UN Security Council on Friday at Estonia's invitation, her spokesman said.\n\nThree weeks into a mass demonstration movement that has peaked on the weekends, tens of thousands of protesters again took to the streets in central Minsk on Sunday, seeking to keep up pressure on Mr Lukashenko to resign. At least 140 people were detained, Russia's RIA news agency reported, citing the Belarusian Interior Ministry.\n\nMr Lukashenko has threatened to cut off European transit routes across his country in retaliation against any sanctions. Goods from landlocked Belarus account for almost a third of Lithuania's rail traffic and port volume, and Belarus is also a major overland route for European goods bound for Russia.\n\nBelarus is Russia's closest ally among former Soviet states, and its territory is integral to Moscow's European defence strategy.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has invited Mr Lukashenko to Moscow, a sign of Kremlin support. The two countries' foreign ministers will hold talks on Wednesday in Moscow.\n\nLast week, the Kremlin announced it had set up a reserve force able to intervene in Belarus, though it did not see a need for such intervention so far. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated on Monday that Moscow still sees no need for action.\n\nThe German foreign ministry said it had summoned the Belarusian ambassador on Monday in response to the detention of foreign journalists in Belarus.\n\nDuring the three weeks of protests, Mr Lukashenko has lost the support of a range of public figures from writers and actors to sportsmen. The burly former boss of a collective farm, he has taken to appearing on television brandishing a Kalashnikov and calling the protesters \"rats\".\n\nOn Monday, the Catholic Church in Belarus, which has criticised the harsh treatment of protesters by the security forces, said its head, Mr Tadeush Kondrusevich, had been barred from re-entering the country after a trip to Poland.

So, I probably did 38 of them managing a lot.\"\n\nTeams normally opt to make as few pitstops as possible because running slower on track to manage their tyres costs them less time.\n\nThere is also the risk that drivers come out behind slower runners, which because of the aerodynamic characteristics of modern Formula One cars can be difficult to pass.\n\n\"You need to have two to three stop races, I think that mixes the order up, it mixes the strategy up,\" said Verstappen's Red Bull team boss Christian Horner.\n\n\"Pretty much everyone elected to take a one-stop strategy (at Spa). That's never going to produce an exciting grand prix.\"\n\nFormula One tyre supplier Pirelli said driver feedback was taken into account when developing tyres, although balancing often competing and contradictory demands can be difficult.\n\nThis year's specification for tyres, first introduced in 2019, is set to be carried over into next season.\n\nPirelli's first chance to make changes will come in 2022 with the introduction of 18-inch wheels.\n\n\"We cannot have 100 per cent grip and 100 per cent consistency and no degradation and all of that,\" said Pirelli's racing head Mario Isola, responding to Hamilton's calls for tyres that are grippy and durable.\n\n\"I know drivers like the grip, I know drivers are asking for an ideal tyre.

I hope the ruling party can start to accept that.\"\n\nMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok) asked if Mr Tan would accept that the ELD would deal with such complaints in an even-handed way. \"And if he accepts that, what's the basis of him suggesting that the PAP would use the power of incumbency against opponents in an unfair way?\"\n\nResponding, Mr Tan said his party's volunteers rectified the issues with the posters after each complaint was made. He added that it would have been \"unthinkable\" for him to have WP flags planted around coffee shops in the single-member constituency of Fengshan, where he contested in the 2015 general election. He did not have similar negative experiences with the PAP's team in that area, he added.\n\n\"My point really is that having seen what happened recently, if this is going to be a precedent that is set by the PAP, perhaps the team in Hougang, then really it raises the wider question of where do you draw the line with this kind of behaviour?\" Mr Tan asked. \"We have to move beyond this.\"\n\nHe added: \"To answer the question: Yes, the ELD was even-handed in handling the complaints.\"\n\nMr Murali responded that his other question - on Mr Tan's basis for suggesting the PAP uses its incumbency against opponents - had not yet been answered.\n\nReplying, Mr Tan said: \"I'm not suggesting the PAP is using the power of its incumbency to do those things. But I have raised various incidents that have happened as a result of the actions of certain people.\n\n\"My point really is that these are all very petty and bad politics, and we shouldn't encourage it.\"\n\nIn a statement on Monday night, the ELD said it had received more than 220 complaints and pieces of feedback from political parties, as well as members of the public, on election posters and banners during the election. The breaches included posters and banners being within 50m of a polling station and below the 2.2m height requirement.\n\nELD's approach is to get the election agent to rectify the issue within three hours, taking no further action if this is done. This was also the case for the complaints relating to Mr Tan's posters, it said.\n\nMr Tan's allegation that his posters were pulled down from their original height is a serious one, ELD said, adding that it has not received any such report from the WP MP.\n\n\"Mr Tan should file a report with ELD so that this can be investigated,\" it said.\n\nIn an earlier speech, Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten) called for a \"less confrontational political system\" to unite Singapore.\n\nThe recent general election showed that politics has divided Singapore, just as it has in other countries, the PAP MP said.\n\n\"This is not good for us as a nation. The amount of vitriol and hate which I read about during the election campaign saddens me.\"\n\nDuring the election, he said he received frequent feedback that the Government is arrogant and unwilling to listen, and that its leaders are out of touch and not humble.\n\n\"Rightly or wrongly, there is also the perception is that there is bullying and unfair treatment of people who do not agree with our policies,\" he added.\n\nMr Lim urged the Government to be more open to constructive criticisms and rational debate.\n\n\"I would submit that the Government must not treat politicians from other parties as enemies. They too are fellow Singaporeans. We must assume that they also want the best for Singapore even if they do not agree with all the Government policies.\"\n\nThe ruling party should acknowledge and consider good ideas raised by politicians from other parties, as well as PAP backbenchers, he added.\n\nAt the same time, leaders of other opposition parties should condemn destructive criticisms which \"push falsehood and twist facts out of context\", Mr Lim said.\n\n\"Constructive suggestions build up Singapore,\" he said. \"Destructive untruths will bring down our country because it instils hatred against fair and decent leaders.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nDennis Tan\n\nHougang\n\nPAP\n\nMurali Pillai", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/hzparl0831e.jpg?VersionId=FnKle0edgnZ237RyNM5qybvBe0vwwdMF", "alt_text": null}]}

Of the remaining places available, there are over 47,000 jobs, 16,000 traineeships, and more than 10,000 training places, she added.\n\nAcknowledging the\n\nheightened sense of anxiety among Singaporeans about job security,\n\nMs Gan said: \"In circumstances where retrenchment is unavoidable, and an employer has to choose between a foreigner and a Singaporean, I urge the employer to lean towards keeping the Singaporean.\n\n\"In short, if employers must retrench, retain the Singaporean over the foreigner.\"\n\nThis should be done for jobs like engineers and IT professionals. This first category of jobs are those Singaporeans want to and can do, but for which foreigners are needed during periods of economic growth to help meet demand, she said.\n\nFor a second category of jobs, in essential services such as construction and cleaning - which are not so popular with Singaporeans despite efforts to transform them - foreign workers will be needed to complement the local workforce, said Ms Gan.\n\nThe aim, she added, should be to reduce the reliance on foreigners through job redesign and technology adoption.\n\nFor instance, the construction sector has created new and higher-skilled jobs through Design for Manufacturing and Assembly, which requires more production managers, quality assurance personnel, and logistics and supply chain planners, now that construction work has shifted offsite to automated production facilities, said Ms Gan.\n\nFor the third category of jobs, in global and regional companies that require global teams and certain professionals with highly specialised skills, the aim is to have Singaporeans as part of diverse teams, she added.\n\nThe Government also wants such companies to groom local talent so that Singaporeans have a fair shot at senior and top management positions, said Ms Gan.\n\nShe cited the experience of Ms Tan Chee Wei, vice-president of human resources for the Asian region at energy giant Shell, who rose through the ranks from a human resources generalist over the last 18 years.\n\nThe 46-year-old Singaporean spent a few years in London as a global HR adviser and also took on regional roles in organisational development and talent management, before being promoted to vice-president this year, said Ms Gan.\n\nWith\n\nrising unemployment amid the Covid-19 pandemic,\n\nthe Ministry of Manpower has had to tighten the foreign work-pass policy and work more closely with employers and unions to uphold fair hiring and retrenchment. This is even as Singapore needs to stay open and provide businesses with access to global expertise and talent, said Ms Gan.\n\nTo reduce the nation's reliance on foreigners in a sustained way, work productivity must be increased to bring down the overall demand for labour as the population ages, she added.\n\nMs Gan said that last year, about 63 per cent of the citizen population were between 20 and 64 years old, or working age. In 10 years, this is projected to drop to about 56 per cent.\n\nThe total fertility rate also needs to rise such that a critical mass of Singaporeans is maintained in the labour force, she added.\n\nMs Gan also touched on the importance of investing in building up skills so that the local workforce will be adaptive and skilled in diverse fields, and remain highly employable in the face of disruption.\n\nGoing for training now could also help displaced Singaporeans have a better chance to get a new job when the economy recovers, she added.\n\nMs Gan said there is a need for Singaporeans to differentiate themselves from others by being identified with the values of openness, multiculturalism and self-determination.\n\nMs Gan concluded her speech with a Chinese phrase on the duty of a government to protect the people from \"wind and rain\", and said the Government will do its best to ensure fair opportunities for Singaporeans to get jobs, and support Singaporeans in acquiring skills.\n\nShe said: \"We will spare no effort to strengthen the Singaporean core, and walk the journey with every Singaporean. Because our people are our only asset, and every Singaporean counts.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nGan Siow Huang\n\nEmployment\n\nRetrenchment", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/md-gan-3108.jpg?VersionId=3KfQl9QrmMySW6z8G_hgwcEWdWya.SQ9", "alt_text": null}]}

The profile of these patients is similar to that of those who were infected by the same bacterium in a 2015 outbreak caused by eating raw freshwater fish.\n\n1. WHAT IS GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS BACTERIA (GBS)?\n\nIt is a bacterium commonly found in the gut and urinary tract of about 15 to 30 per cent of adults without causing any disease. But it may occasionally cause infections of the skin, joints, heart and brain. It can lead to meningitis, which is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n\nHaving chronic conditions such as diabetes puts people at a higher risk of getting infected.\n\n2. WHY IS GBS IN THE NEWS NOW?\n\nThere were 50 GBS cases reported by public hospitals in July - twice the average monthly figure of 25 from Jan to June this year.\n\nOf these 50 GBS cases, 18 were infected by a particularly potent strain of GBS, ST283, up from an average of four cases a month from April to June.\n\nWhile most patients have recovered, one has died from unrelated causes.\n\n3. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 2015 GBS OUTBREAK?\n\nThe GBS outbreak that killed two people here was the largest of its kind in the world. While GBS is described as normally harmless, there were\n\n360 cases in the 2015 outbreak.\n\nOf those infected, 160 had been infected by ST283 and suffered fever, joint infection and meningitis.\n\nThe 2015 outbreak was also the first time that food-borne transmission to people was proven, said Dr Hsu Li Yang who was then at the National University Hospital.\n\nAlthough the GBS outbreak occurred here, researchers from Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research confirmed that the ST283 strain was a regional threat \"not unique to Singapore\".\n\nThey announced in July last year that this GBS variant had caused disease in people and freshwater fish in South-east Asia for over two decades.\n\n4. WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS YEAR?\n\nGBS ST283 had not been detected in fish samples as at last Sunday, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA).\n\nThe samples taken were part of routine SFA testing between May last year and August this year.\n\nNone of the food stalls\n\nvisited by patients who recently contracted GBS had sold raw fish dishes, the authorities added.\n\nAbout 150 of the 360 cases reported in 2015 were linked to the consumption of raw freshwater fish common in Chinese cooking. These included toman, also known as snakehead fish; song, also known as Asian bighead carp; and tilapia.\n\nThe National Environment Agency then\n\nbanned the use of all freshwater fish in ready-to-eat raw fish dishes\n\nin December 2015.\n\nHealth Ministry medical services director Kenneth Mak noted in a circular distributed within the medical community last Friday (Aug 28) that most of the 18 people infected by GBS ST283 in July were aged 65 years and above, who developed septicaemia or bacteraemia, commonly known as blood poisoning.\n\nTwo of most serious cases of GBS infection reported in 2015 were under 65. One was a 50-year-old man who\n\nlost all his limbs to the disease,\n\nwhile the other was 52-year-old man who\n\nfell into a coma for two weeks\n\nand lost his hearing.\n\n5. ARE SOME PEOPLE MORE PRONE TO INFECTION?\n\nIn general, newborns and people with poorer immunity, such as those with diabetes, cancer and HIV, are usually more vulnerable to the infection, say doctors. But the cases in 2015 affected both young adults and the old.\n\nTraditionally, GBS infections have been associated with pregnancy as mothers who are carriers of the bacterium may pass them to their babies during birth.\n\n6. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS AND HOW CAN THEY BE TREATED?\n\nThe most common symptom is a fever, said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.\n\nIt is important to recognise and address it early, added Dr Leong, noting that it can be treated with common antibiotics such as penicillin.\n\nOther more serious symptoms include infection of the joints, brain, lungs and other soft tissue. The kind of symptoms a person has depends on the site of the bacterial infection.\n\n7. HOW CAN I PROTECT MYSELF?\n\nPrecautionary measures include washing your hands and kitchen utensils well before handling food, which should then be cooked thoroughly.\n\nUsing separate sets of knives and cutting boards for preparing raw and cooked food is also recommended.\n\nLISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of Health", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/hzgbs0831a.jpg?VersionId=b8a_klNN6bbLOAJYyYZjXOyvY7aSpkEv", "alt_text": null}]}

Modified viruses that cannot replicate on their own and so will not cause infection can be used as vectors to carry genes from the target virus into human cells to induce an immune response against that virus.\n\nAd5 vectors were tested in early gene therapy, which aims to install a missing gene or replace a mutated or damaged one. They were largely abandoned after an 18-year-old died in 1999 from an immune system overreaction after receiving a large dose during a gene therapy trial.\n\nSome researchers believe the strong immune response that caused problems with gene therapy makes these vectors well suited to vaccines, where much lower doses are used and a protective immune response is the objective.\n\nHAVE AD5 VECTORS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST?\n\nAt McMaster University in Canada, Dr Graham and collaborators developed a variety of Ad5 vectors, including for a rabies vaccine used on wild raccoons in the province of Ontario.\n\nHe and other researchers began developing an Ad5-based vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003 and published preclinical data. It was set aside when that pandemic ended.\n\nIn 2011, CanSino licensed an experimental tuberculosis vaccine based on Ad5 from McMaster researchers.\n\nThe Chinese company's focus later shifted to an Ad5-based Ebola vaccine at the request of the Chinese military, according to Dr Thomas Evans, current chief scientific officer at Vaccitech, who was involved with the tuberculosis project. The Ebola vaccine was approved for military use in 2017.\n\nRussia's Gamaleya Research Institute, which\n\ndeveloped Russia's coronavirus vaccine,\n\nalso used the Ad5 platform to develop an Ebola vaccine, which they said has been administered to about 2,100 people.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT USING AD5 VECTORS?\n\nIn addition to the Ad5-based Covid-19 vaccines, an inhaled version of the experimental tuberculosis vaccine is still under development at McMaster, Dr Zhou Xing told Reuters. His team is also in the early stages of developing an inhaled Covid-19 vaccine, testing Ad5 and another vector based on a chimpanzee adenovirus.\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nVaccines", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/yq-fluvacc-31082024.jpg?VersionId=wXJpPwN9WC7T18xvXQrGtDBk..Yq2vxZ", "alt_text": null}]}

And then I started to write words around it and it turned out I have a lot of things to say, and the medium of comics really gave me an avenue to say them.\"\n\nWeng, 37, has had her debut book Sweet Time published by Drawn & Quarterly, the Canada-based company renowned for publishing cartoonists such as Chris Ware, Kate Beaton and Chester Brown.\n\nIn 2018, it published Nick Drnaso's Sabrina, the first graphic novel to be longlisted for the Man Booker Prize.\n\n\"It was surreal,\" says Weng. \"It was like being invited to a party by a group of musicians you listened to when you were growing up.\"\n\nSweet Time, which charts Weng's work from when she was 25 to her early 30s, is a collection of colourful stories and scenes, some whimsical, many melancholy.\n\nA couple wander down the street towards a fantastical house full of birds. Argentina Diaries is a series of travel snapshots: a dead dog lying by the highway, a juggler performing for drivers at a stop light, a jacaranda tree in bloom.\n\n\"I'm lost,\" reads the caption of a painting of a traffic junction. \"'Get down at this stop,' my gut says. And, I found, I was exactly where I ought to be.\"\n\nWeng has been creating comics since 2006. She studied painting at what was then Lasalle-SIA College of the Arts, but upon graduation, baulked at seeking representation at galleries.\n\n\"I've never felt comfortable with that whole environment,\" she says. \"I've always felt like making art and sharing it with as many people as I can makes a lot more sense than to sell it exclusively at ridiculous prices.\"\n\nInstead, she worked as a waitress and made art in her down time. She liked how methodical waitressing was, she says, and how it kept her body in motion. At the cafe she worked at, the owners let her put her paintings up on the walls.\n\nSeven years in and frustrated that she could not find an avenue to publish her work, she was considering giving up on comics.\n\nThen she went to Buenos Aires for a residency. There, she met an artist whom she had been friends with online for years and who invited her to join Chicks On Comics, a collective for female cartoonists.\n\n\"I saw how having your own tribe helps you, as an artist, feel less alone in your craft,\" she says.\n\nWeng, who also sews and holds art workshops for children, has another graphic novel under consideration for publication, based on her matrilineal line. It depicts scenes from the women in this line, from her great-grandmother to her imaginary future daughter, each aged 15.\n\n\"I feel my work can come across as (feminine), that people will look at it and go, 'Whoa, that's so emotional.' I think that sometimes 'That's so emotional' is almost like a bracket, 'that's so female'.\n\n\"But I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me whether you see it as female or not. As an artist, I just want to focus on making my work, without having it clouded by any external noise.\"\n\n\u2022 Sweet Time ($41.45) is\n\navailable here\n\n\u2022 Weng's other work is\n\navailable at this website\n\nSee more on\n\nBooks\n\nComics\n\nGraphic novels", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/md-ohcomic1-3108.jpg?VersionId=lwM7Z2ykio8rRBRmTcAdEEk_Mavwa9v7", "alt_text": null}]}

American author Brit Bennett's second novel hinges on the disparate lives of the Vignes sisters - identical, light-skinned twins who grow up in Mallard, Louisiana, a fictional town of people of colour in the Jim Crow-era south, where darkness equals trouble and locals pride themselves on the fairness of their skin.\n\nNot black, but not white either, they are \"fair and blonde and redheaded, the darkest ones no swarthier than a Greek\", and with every generation they strive to create \"a more perfect Negro. Each generation lighter than the one before\".\n\nLightness does not save the twins' father, who is lynched before their young eyes by violent, angry white men jealous of his business acumen.\n\nThe senselessness of this trauma and the colourism of the town drive the twins, at 16, to run away from Mallard in 1954 and start new lives in New Orleans.\n\nFrom there, their lives and their stories diverge, \"splitting as evenly as their shared egg. Stella became white and Desiree married the darkest man she could find\".\n\nWith creamy skin, hazel eyes and wavy hair, the twins can pass as white, which means that anyone who does not know their racial history would never think otherwise.\n\nWhen Stella takes a job as an office secretary, a job exclusive to white women, she decides to abandon her home town, her mother and her twin without warning, and pursue a life of safety and privilege as a white woman full-time.\n\nDesiree moves to Washington D.C. and marries Sam, a black man who becomes abusive. The story opens with Desiree's return to Mallard, 14 years after running away, now with her \"blueblack\" daughter Jude in tow.\n\nDespite her clear intelligence and athletic talents, Jude is bullied and ostracised throughout her childhood because of how black she is.\n\nWhen she eventually leaves Mallard for Los Angeles on a track scholarship, she falls in love with Reese, a transgender man who started life as Therese. Together, they subtly tease apart the nature of identity - how much of our identity is innate, how much is choice and how much of it is created by or for us?\n\nThough the parallels of gender determinism and racial identity are interesting, Bennett does not flesh the connections out.\n\nHaving a transgender character in the novel reads like an attempt to placate calls for diversity of representation in literature and is a distraction from the juicier ideological foundation of the novel, which is the performative nature of racial identity and the absurdity of racism.\n\nThe most interesting and heart-wrenching scenes in the book belong to Stella, who has married a blue-blooded white man from New England and moved to a wealthy gated community in the Brentwood suburb of Los Angeles.\n\nActing as white throughout her adult life has hollowed her out. She is numb, reserved and constantly afraid of being found out.\n\nWhen a black family moves in across the street, it is Stella who vocally opposes their arrival at a community meeting, because she is scared they will recognise her for who she is - not white - and ruin her perfect life with her husband and blonde, blue-eyed daughter.\n\nAs she fights for survival, she eventually befriends the new neighbours, and the novel is kept afloat by the moral reckoning she experiences while epitomising and challenging the internalised oppression of white supremacy.\n\nThe Vanishing Half comes alive in these emotional and intellectual interrogations of race, colour and identity.\n\nIf only Desiree had received the same narrative treatment. We never learn why she married \"the blackest man she could find\" or what life was like for her when she returned to Mallard with a deeply black child.\n\nNevertheless, Bennett is a skilled writer who keeps the pages turning, and a book like The Vanishing Half will engender desperately needed conversations in America and around the world.\n\nIf you like this, read: Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Anchor Books , 2014, $19.80, available at bit.ly/Americanah_CNA). Ifemelu and Obinze meet and fall in love in military-ruled Nigeria. Ifemelu leaves the constraints of home for America, only to experience, for the first time, what it means to be black, while Obinze endures the dangerous life of an undocumented immigrant in post 9-11 London. How will they reconnect with each other and their homeland when they return 15 years later?\n\nSee more on\n\nBook review\n\nBooks\n\nReviews\n\nFiction", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/yq-c8-30082020.jpg?VersionId=QySgbLLm7XSt2UlSHkN8SLkCyOeU1G8m", "alt_text": null}]}

Could this result in higher income taxes for many Singaporeans and those who work here for example? Yes. But the benefits will go beyond mere financial help for those who need it,\" he said.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nSocial support\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

One is sheer size. Ant's giant offering may skew comparisons with 1999, particularly if it surpasses Saudi Aramco's US$29 billion IPO last year as the largest in history.\n\nThe past year has featured an unusual number of first-time share sales on Hong Kong or mainland bourses by Chinese companies already listed abroad, fearing a backlash from an increasingly belligerent Trump administration. They include Alibaba, JD.com and top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International.\n\nThe rise of the hyper-local ChiNext and Star markets in China has also inflated this year's pipeline. Punters on the mainland have gobbled up loss-making debutantes like never before - triggering first-day rallies of over 2,000 per cent in some cases - partly because they believe Beijing will offer financial and other forms of aid for a Chinese tech sector seen as essential given the Trump administration's curbs on trade.\n\nFinally, the unknown extent of the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic has led some companies to rethink their capital needs or speed up plans. Airbnb, which was previously seen as a candidate for a direct listing, said last month it filed for a traditional initial public offering. Last week, on Monday alone, four biomedical companies, four blank-check companies and five software companies, including Unity Software, filed to go public.\n\n\"The year has been really busy for equity capital markets deals so far despite all the headline news,\" said Bank of America co-head of equity capital markets for Asia-Pacific Tucker Highfield.\n\n\"We expect to see strong IPO markets to the end of year as investors continue to look for higher returns.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nIPO\n\nHong Kong", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/yq-antgroup-31082024.jpg?VersionId=grPtxjjCMKidbdFA5NMSXSi519n.YbW8", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a4ba312342cb28d959ba43b8e97d9852c3016ccb307dfc77a8f05e0c12d3f0d", "alt_text": "The pontoon used for the open water venue at the World Aquatics Championships in Sentosa on July 7, 2025."}]}

He has a doctorate in law and political science and taught at the Lebanese University.\n\nAs word of his nomination leaked out on Sunday, it was met with dismay by many Lebanese at the forefront of protests that erupted in October and sought to overthrow an entire ruling class blamed for decades of corruption and mismanagement that bled state coffers dry. The uprising brought down the government of Saad Hariri.\n\n\"This is yet another manoeuvre by the failed regime to re-float itself,\" Mr Samy Gemayel, a parliamentarian who resigned earlier this month, said on Twitter. \"The mechanism is clear. One decides, a part executes and the other part covers up. This is making a fool of people and prevents change.\"\n\nMr Diab took office in January, promptly defaulting on US$30 billion (S$41 billion) in international debt and turning to the IMF for help in securing some US$10 billion to support wide-ranging reforms.\n\nShackled by years of patronage and sectarianism, and facing significant domestic opposition, Mr Diab's team failed to clinch the IMF deal and was unable to enact reforms in the electricity sector, for instance, or address corruption concerns as required by the international community.\n\nThe blast at the port exacerbated the crisis which is estimated by the World Bank to have caused as much as US$4.6 billion in physical damage.\n\nMr Adib will face the tough task of resuming talks with the IMF, enacting reforms that have eluded successive cabinets and securing international aid to rebuild the port and neighbourhoods devastated by the blast.\n\nSee more on\n\nLebanon\n\nPolitics and government\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

In this monthly feature, The Straits Times lines up six hot-off-the-press home-grown books for readers to dive into\n\n1. FICTION\n\nFEAR OF THE GUEST\n\nBy Yihan Sim\n\nMarshall Cavendish/ Paperback/ 192 pages/ $19.99/\n\nAvailable here\n\nLifelong learning does not stop in the afterlife.\n\nThe ghosts of Sim's debut novel Fear Of The Guest are also struggling with disruption as younger generations of Singaporeans lose their fear of them. Some have taken to haunting SkillsFuture courses to figure out how to stay relevant.\n\nWhen their grassroots committee meeting is invaded by a malevolent spectre who calls himself the Guest, they realise they have to contend with a whole new brand of fear - one that might wipe out the Singapore they have haunted for so long.\n\nSim, 29, an administrative executive at a local university, confesses she is a \"scaredy cat\". She watches horror movies between the cracks of her fingers and showers with one eye open for weeks afterwards.\n\nSo it may come as a surprise that her first book is of a supernatural bent.\n\nShe says, however: \"It was time for me to reverse the gaze, to look at humans through (the ghosts') eyes. And perhaps this fantasy was also a balm; it diminished the power that fear had on me.\"\n\nFear Of The Guest ranges across the supernatural spectrum, from the Chinese jiangshi (vampire) to the singing female ghost who spooks recruits on Pulau Tekong.\n\nFor Sim, the most terrifying ghost in South-east Asian folklore is the pontianak.\n\n\"I am both fascinated and mortified by how she is the epitome of the 'monstrous feminine', a concept explored in the academic publications of Associate Professor Valerie Wee from the National University of Singapore,\" she says.\n\n\"The pontianak story captures deep-rooted cultural fears of the vengeful female, of unjust deaths, of human greed and its consequences.\"\n\nIn Sim's novel, the pontianak chairs the Grassroots Committee of Ghosts and Monsters. In her downtime, when she is not out haunting, she takes on the elegant appearance of a retired air stewardess.\n\nThe horror genre, says Sim, is essentially the history of human fear and is reflective of xenophobia - a term which draws on the ancient Greek word \"xenos\", which can be translated as \"stranger\", \"foreigner\" or \"guest\".\n\n\"Xenophobia is not unique to Singapore and can be found in every country in the world,\" she says. \"It does, however, have local flavours, just like ghost stories.\"\n\n2. POETRY\n\nANIMAL SEASON\n\nBy Cyril Wong, illustrated by Speak Cryptic\n\nMath Paper Press/ Paperback/ 72 pages/ $10 before GST/ Available at BooksActually\n\nIn this chapbook, Wong questions, confronts and subverts Aesop's fables, positing that the histories and myths so familiar to society leave much to be desired in a world that seems to lack meaning or grand design.\n\n3. NON-FICTION\n\nVOYAGEURS, EXPLORATEURS ET SCIENTIFIQUES\n\nEdited by Martyn E. Y. Low, Kate Pocklington and Wan F. A. Jusoh\n\nLee Kong Chian Natural History Museum/ E-book/ 398 pages/ Free/\n\nAvailable here\n\nWhen Sir Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapore in 1819, two French naturalists, Alfred Duvaucel and Pierre Medard Diard, disembarked with him.\n\nThus began France's two centuries of involvement in Singapore's natural history, documented in this book, a combined effort between the Lee Kong Chian and the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris.\n\n4. NON-FICTION\n\nA HISTORY OF MODERN SINGAPORE, 1819-2005\n\nBy C. M. Turnbull/ NUS Press/ Paperback/ 761 pages/ $25.68/\n\nAvailable here\n\nThis new edition of Turnbull's seminal one-volume history, first published in 1977 and last revised in 2009, is presented in a more affordable format for students and teachers. It traces Singapore's colonial experience from the arrival of the British in 1819 to the new millennium.\n\n5. THEATRE\n\nBLACK WATERS, PINK SANDS\n\nBy Ng Yi-Sheng\n\nMath Paper Press/ Paperback/ 250 pages/ $15 before GST/ Available at BooksActually\n\nIn this volume are the annotated scripts of two lecture-performances by Ng that explore alternative histories of Singapore.\n\nAyer Hitam: A Black History Of Singapore, created with Sharon Frese and Irfan Kasban for the 2019 last year's M1 Singapore Fringe Festival, sheds light on the ignored history of the African diaspora in Singapore.\n\nDesert Blooms: The Dawn Of Queer Singapore Theatre traces the early canon of queer theatre in Singapore from 1985 to 1995.\n\nPerformed last year at Centre 42, it interviews pioneer theatre-makers and analyses works such as Russell Heng's Lest The Demons Get To Me, Eleanor Wong's Mergers And Accusations, and G. Selvanathan's Akka against the historical background of the HIV/Aids crisis, club raids and early activism in that decade.\n\n6. COMICS\n\nMR TINO\n\nBy Russell Molina, illustrated by Ian Sta Maria\n\nEpigram Books/ Paperback/ 144 pages/ $20.22/\n\nAvailable here\n\nIn the latest of Epigram's new editions of South-east Asian graphic novels, Filipino author Molina tells the tale of sundry store owner, Mr Tino, 66, who discovers he has superhuman strength when he saves his dementia-stricken wife from being hit by a truck.\n\nAs he comes to terms with his new powers, he gets involved in investigating the mysterious disappearances of children in his neighbourhood.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Shelf\n\nBooks\n\nSingapore books", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/01/af_sg-shelf_010920.jpg?VersionId=RZ36dG_Upu3595L55J2GDiAmbiSqWUMM", "alt_text": null}]}

It was important to me,\" said a tearful Alaphilippe, whose father Jo passed away in June.\n\nFormer soldier Alaphilippe began punching towards the sky as he turned to see just how close behind him the on-rushing peloton was to overtaking his escaping trio on the Promenade des Anglais finish line.\n\nThe set-up of the second stage was eerily close to how Alaphilippe stole away from the peloton last year on day three to Epernay and eventually led the Tour for 14 days before wilting on the penultimate stage to finish fifth overall.\n\nNo Frenchman has won the Tour de France since 1985.\n\n\"I really wanted to try something and I had nothing to lose,\" said Deceuninck-Quick Step's leader.\n\n\"It really hurt me, I was digging deep at the end there,\" said Alaphilippe.\n\n\"It's a great pride and responsibility and I will defend this honour day by day, I won't be giving it up tomorrow that's for sure,\" he promised.\n\nJumbo-Visma may, however, be furious at the circumstances accompanying the win.\n\nShortly after Alaphilippe's attack, Team Ineos' Michal Kwiatkowski somehow backed into Jumbo co-captain Tom Dumoulin and knocked him to the floor.\n\nThe former Giro winner dusted himself off as Kwiatkowski apologised profusely, but the team were slow to react.\n\nThe Dutch outfit had been leading the head of the peloton all day, but suddenly they slowed down and abandoned their pursuit of Alaphilippe, who had the Swiss Marc Hirschi and Yates for company on their tense 15-minute dash to the line where they never led by more than 30 seconds.\n\nMitchelton-Scott rider Yates has recently signed for British team Ineos.\n\nHe has a track record at the Tour after a fourth-placed finish in 2016 when he won the best young rider white jersey.\n\n\"In the end I was never going to win the sprint, but to come third on Stage 2, I'm pretty happy with that,\" said Yates.\n\nDefending champion Egan Bernal of Colombia said he felt like the Tour was in full swing.\n\n\"I'm happy to be racing like this, that was a real Tour stage and I really enjoyed it,\" said the 23-year-old Ineos leader who had a slightly rusty build-up to the race.\n\nThe man who started the day in yellow, Norway's Alexander Kristoff, who won Saturday's crash-marred opening stage, finished way off the pace as one of the heaviest set men in the peloton had to go over two Category 1 mountains.\n\nHe will, however, embark on Monday's Stage 3 in the green sprint jersey.\n\n\"I didn't want to hurt my chances of winning a sprint later in the tour by pushing too hard in the hills,\" he explained.\n\nThe climb was doubly difficult for several of the peloton, nursing nasty knocks from stage one.\n\nIt looked like French contender Thibaut Pinot would withdraw at one stage before he rallied \"hurting all over\" to finish with the main pack.\n\nSee more on\n\nTour de France\n\nCycling - Sport", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/yq-julianalap-31082024.jpg?VersionId=jzyifiNfMZwbM9WzG_V.KeBAkWlQg4Zq", "alt_text": null}]}

They employ harmless viruses as \"vectors\" to ferry genes from the target virus - in this case the coronavirus - into human cells, prompting an immune response to fight the actual virus.\n\nBut many people already have antibodies against Ad5, which could cause the immune system to attack the vector instead of responding to the coronavirus, making these vaccines less effective.\n\nSeveral researchers have chosen alternative adenoviruses or delivery mechanisms.\n\nOxford University and AstraZeneca based their Covid-19 vaccine on a chimpanzee adenovirus, avoiding the Ad5 issue. Johnson & Johnson's candidate uses Ad26, a comparatively rare strain.\n\nDr Zhou Xing, from Canada's McMaster University, worked with CanSino on its first Ad5-based vaccine, for tuberculosis, in 2011. His team is developing an inhaled Ad5 Covid-19 vaccine, theorising it could circumvent pre-existing immunity issues.\n\n\"The Oxford vaccine candidate has quite an advantage\" over the injected CanSino vaccine, he said.\n\nDr Xing also worries that high doses of the Ad5 vector in the CanSino vaccine could induce fever, fueling vaccine scepticism.\n\n\"I think they will get good immunity in people that don't have antibodies to the vaccine, but a lot of people do,\" said Dr Hildegund Ertl, director of the Wistar Institute Vaccine Centre in Philadelphia.\n\nIn China and the United States, about 40 per cent of people have high levels of antibodies from prior Ad5 exposure. In Africa, it could be has high as 80 per cent, experts said.\n\nHIV RISK\n\nSome scientists also worry an Ad5-based vaccine could increase chances of contracting HIV.\n\nIn a 2004 trial of a Merck & Co Ad5-based HIV vaccine, people with pre-existing immunity became more, not less, susceptible to the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nResearchers, including top US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci, in a 2015 paper, said the side effect was likely unique to HIV vaccines. But they cautioned that HIV incidence should be monitored during and after trials of all Ad5-based vaccines in at-risk populations.\n\n\"I would be worried about the use of those vaccines in any country or any population that was at risk of HIV, and I put our country as one of them,\" said Dr Larry Corey, co-leader of the US Coronavirus Vaccine Prevention Network, who was a lead researcher on the Merck trial.\n\nGamaleya's vaccine will be administered in two doses: The first based on Ad26, similar to J&J's candidate, and the second on Ad5.\n\nProfessor Alexander Gintsburg, Gamaleya's director, has said the two-vector approach addresses the immunity issue.\n\nDr Ertl said it might work well enough in individuals who have been exposed to one of the two adenoviruses.\n\nMany experts expressed scepticism about the Russian vaccine after the government declared its intention to give it to high-risk groups in October without data from large pivotal trials.\n\n\"Demonstrating safety and efficacy of a vaccine is very important,\" said Dr Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J's Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nOften, he noted, large-scale trials \"do not give the result that is expected or required.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nVaccines", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/ctvaccine3108.jpg?VersionId=MJ1znhlzx6uu..sUms.4kA99_h0zrUB4", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a4ba312342cb28d959ba43b8e97d9852c3016ccb307dfc77a8f05e0c12d3f0d", "alt_text": "The pontoon used for the open water venue at the World Aquatics Championships in Sentosa on July 7, 2025."}]}

They have 13 points from 13 games, which takes into account a one-point deduction for poor financial management.\n\nIkhsan had made four substitute appearances earlier in the season after recovering from a knee injury and sore throat. Last season, he played in 26 league games, including 10 as a starter, and scored five goals in his debut season in Europe.\n\nHe told The Straits Times on Monday: \"It's nice to get the opportunity to start. I didn't kick off the season well as I was out for six weeks with my injury and illness, so it feels good to be back in the team, score and help the team win three points.\n\n\"When the cross came in, I knew exactly where I was going to put it and from the way I connected, I knew 100 per cent it was going in.

But he played his part on Saturday as he rounded up the scoring by slotting into an empty net in the 4-0 win over Sabah as Terengganu rise to second in the 12-team MSL with 10 points, three behind champions Johor Darul Takzim.\n\nIt was a belated birthday celebration for Faris, who turned 28 on Aug 24.\n\nHe gleefully described the feeling of playing his first competitive game in more than five months as \"like a kid getting candy\". Before going to Terengganu on Aug 11, he had trained with the Young Lions in Singapore for about three weeks.\n\nFaris said: \"Training with Young Lions was all about getting back my fitness, and then slowly I got back my touches. It was not really difficult as I was already working out at home during the circuit breaker.\n\n\"Perhaps I'm a little rusty on the pitch, and still lacking in terms of the agility and sharp turns, but I'm definitely getting there.\n\n\"We have some really promising young players and a smart and tactical coach who wants football to be played on the ground. It fits my style of football and I'm looking forward to a good season with Terengganu.\"\n\nDefender Safuwan Baharudin also contributed a clean sheet as his eighth-placed Selangor side were held to a goalless draw by PJ City.\n\nTwo other Singaporeans ply their trade for MSL teams but did not play last weekend as JDT skipper Hariss Harun is still recovering from knee surgery, while Kedah defender Shakir Hamzah was serving a one-match suspension.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore football\n\nNorway\n\nMalaysia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/yq-fandiik-31082024.jpg?VersionId=CgyxFPgkeq4.hb3lafHBjfsJeCUxozz6", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a4ba312342cb28d959ba43b8e97d9852c3016ccb307dfc77a8f05e0c12d3f0d", "alt_text": "The pontoon used for the open water venue at the World Aquatics Championships in Sentosa on July 7, 2025."}]}

She introduced him to Tan around May 1999, the court heard.\n\nTan later claimed that she needed money for Mr Lee.\n\nOn May 11 that year, Mr Tan visited a CPF service centre and filled up an application form to withdraw his entire CPF savings in the Ordinary Account.\n\nMore than $53,000 was then credited into his bank account the following month.\n\nThe DPP added: \"Mr Tan sought Ah Hiang's assistance to withdraw the CPF monies from his... bank account and pass them to the accused. Consequently, Mr Tan entrusted Ah Hiang with his ATM card and personal identification number to make the withdrawals.\n\n\"Mr Tan had enlisted Ah Hiang's help as he was busy with work and had no time to make the withdrawals.\"\n\nMadam Boo then told Mr Tan that she withdrew the money and passed it to Tan.\n\n\"Mr Tan further confirmed that to date, he never got back any of the CPF savings that he had withdrawn in 1999,\" said the prosecutor.\n\nBy using similar lies, Tan also managed to convince Mr Tan to hand over at least $500 of his salary every month.\n\nMr Tan passed the money to Madam Boo, who would then hand a \"substantial portion\" to Tan.\n\nIn 2013, Mr Tan moved in with his niece, Madam Pamela Lim, and her husband.\n\nThe couple then noticed that Mr Tan would borrow money from them and Madam Lim's mother almost every week.\n\nThis struck them as peculiar since he earned money from his jobs and did not appear to have any expenses to foot.\n\nMadam Lim also found out from her mother that her uncle had withdrawn all his CPF monies when he turned 55 and that the entire sum was gone.\n\nMadam Lim and her husband then checked with Mr Tan, the court heard.\n\n\"Mr Tan explained that the accused and Ah Hiang told him something about a failed business investment involving Yeo Hiap Seng, which was taken over by the government, such that he now needed to make repayments to 'Lao Lee',\" the DPP said, in a reference to Mr Lee.\n\nMadam Lim then lodged a police report on Feb 3, 2014.\n\nDuring the trial, Tan tried to shift the blame to Madam Boo, who had died of heart disease on April 21, 2016, before the trial started.\n\nBut the DPP noted that in an earlier police statement, Tan admitted that she had cheated Mr Tan.\n\nShe also admitted in the statement that she needed the money to gamble.\n\nOn Monday, the court heard that Tan will be appealing against her conviction and sentence. Her bail has been set at $20,000.\n\nFor each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.\n\nAdditional reporting by Dominic Low\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts\n\nCrime", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/yq-thweeh-31082024.jpg?VersionId=aNaog0MzdVsmcD_rqqhZcfW_zGPESRPY", "alt_text": null}]}

Really, they unmoor her.\n\n\"But I slipped away,\" she says, \"and am still slipping away, within these lines that are intended to give me a story... nobody, not even the one who at this moment is writing, knows if it contains the right thread for a story or is merely a snarled confusion of suffering, without redemption.\"\n\nFew authors are as elusive yet unflinchingly, unerringly evocative as Ferrante, the pseudonymous author of the Neapolitan Novels (2012 to 2015), which took the world by storm with their depiction of a complex female friendship.\n\nIn The Lying Life Of Adults, she returns once more to the grit of Naples, and to the snarls and splinters of female adolescence.\n\nWhat Giovanna's father actually says is that she is beginning to resemble her aunt Vittoria, a woman in whom \"ugliness and spite were combined to perfection\" and who has allegedly poisoned the rest of his family against him.\n\nIn Giovanna's impressionable teenage mind, her father's words fix themselves as prophecy: She is destined to become what he despises.\n\nBut now she is obsessed with finding out more about this unwanted future, so she seeks out Vittoria. From this point, the foundations of her comfortable family unit begin to crumble as lie after lie is exposed.\n\nGiovanna - smart, sensitive and self-absorbed - is beset both by raging insecurity and a melodramatic teenage conviction that the world revolves around her problems.\n\nHaving spilled a secret, she prays to God to put things back in order, \"because if he didn't, everything would collapse. San Giacomo dei Capri would tumble onto the Vomero and the Vomero onto the entire city, and the entire city would drown in the sea\".\n\nFerrante illustrates the class divide through Giovanna's traversing of Naples. To see Vittoria, she must literally descend from her middle-class home in the highest part of the city to the bleak depths of the Industrial Zone, where the people speak the Neapolitan dialect her father has banned in their house.\n\nHer father escaped the neighbourhood through his intellect, but Vittoria remains entrenched in it. Coarse, magnetic and tempestuous, she works as a cleaner to support the three children of the woman whose husband she stole. To Giovanna, she possesses a \"beauty so unbearable that to consider her ugly became a necessity\".\n\nSex, the driving force that underpins most of the characters' actions, is desirable in the abstract and discomfiting in its physicality. Having chosen to rebel by leaning into the ugliness her father predicted for her, Giovanna chases meaning in man after man - though sex, when she experiences it, proves appallingly banal.\n\nHaving discovered that adulthood is fundamentally adulterous, she learns to weave lies of her own. How much of a woman is the story she tells others of herself?\n\nThis is an especially weighted question from Ferrante, who has insistently aligned her anonymity with her authorship despite attempts to expose her identity.\n\nAs Giovanna warned at the beginning, this is not a story of redemption or anything like closure. It is, however, one of a young woman starting to make meaning of herself.\n\nIf you like this, read: The Neapolitan Novels by the same author and translator, beginning with My Brilliant Friend (Europa Editions, 2012, $19.26, available at bit.ly/GirlHalfFT_EM), a coming-of-age story about the friendship between Elena and Lila, who grow up in a poor, violent neighbourhood in 1950s Naples.

Second, I will talk about things that must not change. And third, I will suggest some things that should change.\"\n\nOn his appointment to the new role of LO, Mr Singh said it was a sign of changes happening in Singapore politics, and that it had created expectations among the Government and the people.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\n\nhad announced that Mr Singh would be accorded the new role\n\nafter the WP won 10 seats in the July 10 polls, including Sengkang, its second group representation constituency.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament on Monday, Mr Singh said: \"My personal expectation is that my Workers' Party colleagues and I will have to work extra hard. We will have to ask ourselves tough questions before critiquing government policy. The chief of which is, what would we do if we were in charge.\"\n\nEven then, he said there must be clarity about \"what the opposition can and cannot do\".\n\nWith just 10 MPs in Parliament, the WP falls far short of the resources available to the Government, Mr Singh said, and it was important for Singaporeans to take this into account when forming their expectations of the opposition.\n\nAs the LO, Mr Singh\n\nwill get to hire three more legislative assistants and one more secretarial assistant.\n\nAll other backbench MPs can hire one legislative assistant and one secretarial assistant.\n\nHowever, he added that the Government has at its disposal 146,000 full-time officers in the public service, of which 85,000 are civil servants.\n\nGiven this, the LO's office \"will not have the breadth and depth of the party in government in coming up with alternative policies\", he said.\n\nHe also reiterated his argument that how much the opposition can do also depends on the quantity and quality of information the Government releases.\n\nSaid Mr Singh: \"We intend to make targeted inquiries of government departments and public agencies as such information is essential for crafting alternative policies. On its part, the Government should consider how it can put out more information without being asked to, particularly information and indicators benchmarked against other countries.\"\n\nHe said based on his assessment, Singaporeans expect the WP and the opposition in general to play a constructive role in Singapore politics, which should advance everyone's interests, regardless of their position on specific issues.\n\nMr Singh also said the WP will set its own standards and chart an independent course. \"The Workers' Party has always taken the position that when it is in the opposition, it owes its loyalty to the President, the Republic of Singapore and the people,\" he said.\n\nIn his speech, which lasted for 33 minutes, Mr Singh also spoke about things in Singapore which he said must not change, including the nation's historical position as a trading nation, the Government's position on defence and foreign policy, and values which have become synonymous with Singapore, such as multiracialism and the culture of abhorring corruption.\n\nDescribing Singapore as a \"glass half-full that can be topped up\", Mr Singh also said there are things in the country that should change, which he believed would improve governance.\n\nThese include the formation of more select committees to deal with certain issues that can be divisive, as well as a change in how Singapore manages and accommodates foreigners in the economy.\n\nAlso up for change is a shift in how the work of tradesmen are valued and also greater help for those who need it most, he added.\n\nSumming up, Mr Singh said: \"However Singapore pivots or evolves in the years to come, I believe a reasoned conversation before choices and decisions are made or not made will be critical.\n\n\"The Workers' Party will seek to play a positive role in the national conversation both in and out of Parliament to leave behind a Singapore, our children and future generations can be proud of.\"\n\nLISTEN TO BIG STORY PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nPritam Singh\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nWorkers' Party", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/hzpritam0831a.jpg?VersionId=9nktSJ3yGBp0q2uwGb22v7GU9fNi.UuZ", "alt_text": null}]}

Those who do not meet the criteria can appeal to the authorities, which will assess their eligibility on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSimilarly, Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten) said the policy of pegging social assistance to annual values of properties should be reviewed even as he agreed that the lower-income and the needy should get more help.\n\nHe pointed out that citizens suffering from loss of income may need help regardless of their housing type to pay for family expenses such as medical bills, mortgage instalments or school fees.\n\nThey may also not be able to sell their home during a financial crisis, he added.\n\n\"Why do we have the expectation that people don't deserve help simply because they have bigger homes? Should we not look at their loss of income? Should we also insist that these people must sell their homes before they get the short-term help specifically targeted at those affected by Covid-19?\" he asked.\n\nMr Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru) said it would be timely for the Government to rethink its compact with citizens living in private estates, in the light of the pandemic.\n\nHe acknowledged that private estate residents have benefited from the ample opportunities offered in Singapore. But, he added, they have funded the lion's share of the country's tax revenue while consuming a limited amount of government aid.\n\n\"This is the right balance. As economic winners of our society, it is appropriate that they contribute to help the rest of Singapore move along.\"\n\nPolicies, however, may need to be adjusted for groups, including retired seniors who are asset-rich but cash-poor, and residents older than 50 who are facing uncertainty in their careers, he said.\n\nDifferent yardsticks can be used to assess eligibility for support schemes, he added.\n\nHis proposals include using a combination of non-housing assets, income and the per capita housing equity of occupants in a house.\n\nMore schemes can also be created to help private estate residents who are asset-rich but cash-poor to better tap their housing equity, he added.\n\nMr Kwek suggested that the Government work actively with the banking and insurance sectors to create reverse mortgage options for private estates, and allow those who are older than 70 to borrow against their housing equity at a reasonable rate.\n\nThis can help residents who are opposed to selling their home because they do not want to be uprooted from a neighbourhood they have grown accustomed to.\n\nIt can also help older seniors who are not financially savvy enough to navigate the tricky global economic waters, he added.\n\nWhile banks may have reservations about offering reverse mortgage to older seniors, the Government can explore mandating banks to allow residents to borrow against their housing equity if residents have given someone a Lasting Power of Attorney, said Mr Kwek.\n\nThis will ensure that a bank will have someone to work with, without resorting to expensive legal remedies in the event that the home owner falls ill or becomes mentally incapacitated.\n\n\"If our people can tap their housing equity effectively, I believe most Singaporeans in the private estates would prefer to stand on their own two feet, instead of relying on government assistance,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nPolitics and government\n\nHousing policy\n\nSocial support", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/hzhousing0831.jpg?VersionId=r9oXwRYvxkeC0tOJZJjHxf4Ce2A_9iqA", "alt_text": null}]}

They have also been stepping up their scrutiny and enforcement actions against those who blatantly practise it.\n\nDr Tan further said the Government will give Singaporean jobseekers a stronger boost \"by working with businesses to give more serious consideration to Singaporeans when hiring, especially those who are wiling to adjust their expectations and adapt\".\n\nAt the same time, businesses in Singapore are expected to strive harder in strengthening their Singaporean core, he said in his maiden speech in Parliament.\n\nBut he reassured employers that Singapore will not turn away global talents and investments, as skilled foreign workers allow them to remain globally competitive and provide learning opportunities for Singaporeans.\n\nDr Tan made these points as he pledged to support two key groups of workers - young graduates and mature workers - whom he said had a \"growing concentration of disengaged Singaporeans\".\n\nDr Tan, who is also Second Minister for Trade and Industry as well as Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, was speaking on the first day of the debate on the President's Address.\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis,\n\nwhich he described as \"unquestionably the worst crisis in a generation\", has accelerated changes to Singapore's economy, and highlighted the need to be flexible in pivoting to new areas of opportunity and different ways of operating, he said.\n\n\"We must always remember that our workers are the heart of our economy, and we must help our workforce to emerge stronger from this crisis,\" he said, reiterating the Government's promise to help every worker, even if not every job can be saved.\n\nMature workers are \"near and dear\" to him, Dr Tan said, as at 55, he is also in their age group. \"Our mature workers in their 40s and 50s have contributed a good part of their lives to our economy so far.\"\n\nMost of them continue to be willing and able to contribute to the economy for many more years to come, he noted.\n\nBut even before the pandemic struck, many were already worrying about their job security, and adapting to the way technology has transformed their work.\n\nMature workers possess \"a significant treasure of experiential knowledge and practice wisdom that cannot be replaced by or gleaned from academic pursuits or qualifications\", he said.\n\nAs they strive to prepare themselves for new job roles, employers should also consider them fairly and offer them good opportunities for improvement and progression, he added.\n\n\"Meritocracy is a foundational principle of Singapore society, and we must demonstrate this to the world by taking a stand against employers that discriminate against workers based on nationality, age, gender or other factors that are irrelevant to the job.\"\n\nAs for young graduates, Dr Tan said he has received feedback that they are worried about getting a job in the current labour market, and how their aspirations and career trajectories may be affected.\n\n\"We are working very hard to keep our young workers engaged and inspired as they embark on their journeys into the working world amidst this crisis.\n\n\"I wish to assure our young Singaporeans that although you may seem to have been dealt a difficult starting hand, we will do all we can to ensure that your generation will still flourish and fulfil your potential.\"\n\nHe also urged all job seekers, regardless of age and background, to be realistic in their expectations amid the difficult economic climate, and keep an open mind about the available opportunities.\n\nOutlining the Government's support for employers, he said it is crucial to develop a strong Singapore core of enterprises that can grow and compete internationally.\n\nTo succeed, Singapore must find new ways to innovate and transform, he added.\n\n\"Not just to incubate these new ideas, but developing generations of Singaporeans that can put those ideas into action and commercialise them with strong intellectual property protection and validation by our government agencies.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nEmployment\n\nTan See Leng", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/yq-officegen-31082024_0.jpg?VersionId=KYDzLnd5DIKh_2emyZjLcdGd0M2eQ1BA", "alt_text": null}]}

Nonetheless, with our Singapore-China fast lane in place, we hope to facilitate internship exchanges for students very soon, especially with Guangdong, once the implementation agreement on (the scheme) is signed,\" said Mr Ong.\n\nOn aviation, Mr Ong noted that China was the first country with which Singapore launched a \"fast lane\" arrangement for short-term and essential travel. Singapore is the first country in South-east Asia with such an arrangement with China.\n\nOn the sidelines of the meeting, Mr Ong told reporters that the quota of seats on flights under the fast lane arrangement - including 500 seats across two flights per week between Singapore and Guangdong's capital Guangzhou - was \"very underused\".\n\n\"These are things that we will work on and officials will discuss in the coming months, and we hope we will have good progress,\" he said.\n\nBesides these areas, Mr Ong noted that two bilateral projects - the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City and the Singapore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative - have also made steady progress in the past year.\n\nThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City, and Singapore aims to partner the city in its long-term development in areas such as urban solutions and biomedicine.\n\nFor example, local medical technology start-up Star3D Material Development Company signed a memorandum of understanding with the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City Investment and Development Co to further develop and commercialise the use of dental 3D technology in China.\n\nThe firm, which isbased in Singapore and has a factory in Shanghai, aims to set up a joint laboratory and research platform, and introduce projects in the digital dental field, said general manager Chen Baiqun.\n\nThe Singapore-China (Shenzhen) Smart City Initiative focuses on three key areas - digital connectivity, innovation and entrepreneurship and tech talent exchange and development - and promotes greater ease of access to market opportunities in the Greater Bay Area and South-east Asia.\n\nGuangdong, China's most prosperous province, lies at the heart of the Greater Bay Area - a mega economic zone that includes nine cities in the province, Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nIn 2019, bilateral trade between Singapore and Guangdong grew 1.9 per cent year-on-year to reach US$19 billion (S$25.8 billion). In the first half of 2020, bilateral trade reached US$8.06 billion.\n\nThere were more than 3,100 Singapore projects in the province as of December last year, with cumulative investments of US$13.1 billion.\n\nBeyond the key cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Singapore businesses have also ventured to new Greater Bay Area cities such as Huizhou, tapping on opportunities in sectors like smart city solutions and financial services.\n\nThe businesses include Keppel Data Centres, which is collaborating with China's Country Garden Holdings and Shenzhen Huateng Intelligent Technology to develop the Eco Smart data centre project in Huizhou's Tonghu Smart City.\n\nIt is Keppel's first greenfield data centre development in China, said a Keppel Data Centres spokesman.\n\nNational power grid operator SP Group has also entered into a joint venture agreement with the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City Investment and Development Co to establish a company focused on district cooling, heating and integrated energy projects in Guangzhou. The project is SP Group's first foray into southern China.\n\nMr Stanley Huang, group chief executive officer of SP Group, said: \"Together, we aim to enable customers in China to enjoy a sustainable, low-carbon future.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nOng Ye Kung\n\nTrade", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/yq-ongyk-31082024.jpg?VersionId=TJd.9vWDglpN2btqV9MB7Aw_7hTWVUcg", "alt_text": null}]}

It measures 1.2m by 1.6m, and is 2.4m high.\n\nAfter any gaps between the entrance and the system are sealed, a Hepa filter unit at the top of the system is powered up to create a negative pressure environment within the patient's room, so that infectious droplets and air from the room cannot seep outside into the corridors.\n\nThe chamber has two doors, one at the entrance of the ward and one inside the ward, facing the patient. When the inside door opens for medical staff to enter or leave the room, contaminated air flows into the chamber and through the Hepa filter, so that clean air re-enters the room.\n\nThe 70kg system takes an hour to set up and was installed at SGH's Medical ICU in July. One more of the same type will be added to the Medical ICU soon.\n\nThe collapsible SG-Sparc can also be fixed to single- and multiple-bed wards with infectious diseases patients. The size of the system is customisable, and each takes two weeks to fabricate.\n\nThe other SG-Sparc system, used in operating theatres, is larger to allow an ICU bed, ventilator and medical staff to pass through. Measuring 3.8m by 1.6m and with a height of 2m, the system prevents droplets from escaping the room while surgical operations, including aerosol-generating procedures, are performed on infectious patients.\n\nThe 150kg chamber takes two hours to set up. One system has been installed in an operating theatre in SGH.\n\nThe two systems were developed by anaesthesiologists from SGH, in collaboration with local biomedical incubator The Biofactory. The project was funded by SingHealth Duke-NUS' Urgent Covid-19 Research Fund, with contribution from The Biofactory.\n\nCompared to existing systems, SG-Sparc has a combination of advanced features such as contactless sensors and a higher rate of air filtration, which makes it the first of its kind, said Dr Mavis Teo, a consultant at SGH's Department of Anaesthesiology.\n\nIn a room fitted with the system, the air can be filtered up to 300 times an hour, compared to an operating theatre where the air is filtered 12 times an hour. Medical staff can open the system's doors by waving at the sensor without touching it.\n\nThe inventions come at a time when existing numbers of isolation rooms abroad are insufficient to support the\n\nCovid-19 surge.\n\nIt is also costly and time-consuming to build isolation rooms.\n\nAn SG-Sparc system costs half as much as renovating an ICU room into an isolation room, said Mr Gabriel Tan, The Biofactory's programme director.\n\nSaid Dr Teo, who is the project's co-investigator: \"We have seen how hospitals in Italy, in the UK and USA - all quite well-developed countries - struggled when they ran out of negative pressure isolation rooms during the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\n\n\"It got us thinking if there is a way for us to very quickly and temporarily convert existing patient rooms, especially ICU rooms, to care for infectious patients when the need arises,\" she added.\n\nSG-Sparc has received strong interest from local and overseas hospitals, said Mr Tan.\n\nTo ensure and test the system's ability to contain viruses, scientists from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology released live non-pathogenic viruses into a simulated patient room installed with SG-Sparc. No microbes escaped from the room.\n\nSG-Sparc is the third collaboration between SGH and The Biofactory, after SG-Safe, a foldable swab test system, and SG-Safer, an isolation X-ray booth.\n\nSee more on\n\nA*Star/Agency for Science, Technology and Research\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/af_entering-icu_310820.jpg?VersionId=1I5qvm6mylrkts0kn_o2iSf62DL5vYJ5", "alt_text": null}]}

This can create good jobs for Singaporeans and new opportunities for entrepreneurs, he added.\n\nSecond, Singapore must redouble its efforts to develop everyone to his fullest potential, so that its people can take on new opportunities and flourish in their chosen pursuits, said Mr Heng, who is also Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies and Finance Minister.\n\n\"We need a holistic approach for this that spans the lifetime of individuals, from birth to pre-school to schools, all the way to lifelong learning as part of SkillsFuture,\" he said, noting that workers are embracing upskilling, with about half a million people\n\ntaking part in SkillsFuture programmes in 2019.\n\nThe country has to explore new possibilities for developing its people fully, Mr Heng emphasised, highlighting that the National Research Foundation is supporting research programmes that address the broader goal of enhancing human potential through measures during pregnancy and childhood, including nutrition, parenting and learning.\n\nThird, Singapore must strengthen its path-finding capacity to find new bright spots amid economic disruption, Mr Heng said, pointing to\n\nthe Emerging Stronger Taskforce\n\nthat was set up four months ago to identify and seize new opportunities in emerging trends.\n\n\"The ideas being explored are promising. They range from environmental sustainability to smart commerce, supply chain digitalisation and the use of robotics. These can create new growth markets for our businesses and good jobs for Singaporeans,\" he added.\n\nFor example, many hawkers and small businesses islandwide are going digital, Mr Heng said, citing a fruit seller known as \"Ah Boy\" who operates a stall in the market and food centre at Block 58 New Upper Changi Road. In addition to the physical stall, the hawker also sells his fruits online and takes orders through text messaging service Whatsapp, he added.\n\nIn addition, Singapore will invest in incubating and accelerating start-ups, and supporting established companies to expand their research and development to build competitive strengths, Mr Heng said.\n\n\"Such a vibrant innovation ecosystem will build up our path-finding capabilities.\"\n\nFourth, the Republic must find new ways to be a vital node with rich and deep interconnections with the rest of the world, Mr Heng said, noting that being open is its strength and opportunity given its position as a small city-state.\n\n\"We cannot take for granted that, in a post-Covid-19 world, we can continue to be the same kind of hub that we used to be. We must therefore forge new forms of connections, such as digital economy agreements, while deepening our linkages with regional markets to ride on Asia's potential,\" he added.\n\nMr Heng also emphasised the need for Singapore to remain open to investment and talent from around the world, acknowledging that many Singaporeans are anxious about their livelihoods.\n\n\"Our starting point is that our economic strategies must serve the interests of Singaporeans,\" he said, adding that the foreign investments attracted must create meaningful jobs for Singaporeans and strengthen the country's corporate ecosystem, and Singaporeans must receive fair consideration in the workplace.\n\nManpower policies are being adapted to changing circumstances to ensure that Singaporeans' interests are upheld, Mr Heng said, but Singapore must resist the temptation to turn inwards.\n\n\"We cannot close ourselves to the world, or make foreigners unwelcome in our society.\"\n\nThe best way to serve the interests of Singaporeans, he said, is to ensure that Singapore remains useful and relevant to the world by keeping its economy vibrant and competitive, so that Singaporeans and other people choose to be here to invest and do business, thereby creating good jobs and opportunities for all.\n\nSingapore must also continue to develop its people fully to have the confidence to seize new opportunities post-Covid-19, including by working with partners from around the world.\n\nResponding to labour MP Patrick Tay's suggestion to refresh and relook the Industry Transformation Maps to address the challenges ahead, Mr Heng said that Singapore should enhance the linkages between what it does to develop its people and job creation, in the form of skills maps, job redesign and reskilling workers to take on new job opportunities.\n\n\"In particular, we must also make a deliberate effort to develop Singaporeans for leadership roles in companies, so that they can take Singapore forward. Singapore, as a regional operational headquarters, has what it takes. Singaporeans, in a multiracial, multi-religious, multicultural environment, can connect with people all around us and build deep linkages with our friends in the region,\" he added.\n\nAs Singapore adapts to a changing world, it needs to stay true to its values, such as its sense of unity as a people and its composition as a multicultural society, Mr Heng said.\n\n\"We must stay true to our value to the world as an oasis of harmony in this fractious world.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nHeng Swee Keat\n\nSingapore economy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/af_hsk-speech_310820.jpg?VersionId=ikKFSxAHia2FR.44wqJ_BL1zefZ5Z5ha", "alt_text": null}]}

Some projections show that by the end of the year, Covid-19 will cause more people to die each day from hunger than from virus infections.\n\nWhat makes the situation unmatched: The massive spike is happening at a time of enormous global food surpluses. And it's happening in every part of the world, with new levels of food insecurity forecast for countries that used to have relative stability.\n\nIn Queens, New York, the lines snaking around a food bank are eight hours long as people wait for a box of supplies that might last them a week, while farmers in California are plowing over lettuce and fruit is rotting on trees in Washington.\n\nIn Uganda, bananas and tomatoes are piling up in open-air markets, and even nearly give-away prices aren't low enough for out-of-work buyers. Supplies of rice and meat were left floating at ports earlier this year after logistical jams in the Philippines, China and Nigeria. And in South America, Venezuela is teetering on the brink of famine.\n\n\"We'll see the scars of this crisis for generations,\" said Ms Mariana Chilton, director of the Centre for Hunger-Free Communities at Drexel University. \"In 2120, we'll still be talking about this crisis.\"\n\nCovid-19 has exposed some of the world's deepest inequalities. It's also a determining force in who gets to eat and who doesn't, underscoring global social divides as the richest keep enjoying a breakneck pace of wealth accumulation.\n\nMillions of people have been thrown out of work and don't have enough money to feed their families, despite the trillions in government stimulus that's helped send global equities to all-time highs.\n\nOn top of the economic malaise, lockdowns and broken supply chains have also created a serious problem for food distribution. The sudden shift away from restaurant eating, which in places like the US used to account for more than half of dining, means farmers have been dumping milk and smashing eggs, with no easy means to redirect their production to either grocery stores or those in need.\n\nMr Don Cameron of Terranova Ranch in California took a hit of about US$55,000 (S$74,700) this year on his cabbage crop. Almost half the loss - US$24,000 - came because Mr Cameron decided to donate to local food banks after demand from his usual customers dried up.\n\nHe had to pay for the labour needed to do the harvesting and truck loading. He even needed to cover the cost of some bins and pallets to get supplies moved. It would've been a lot cheaper to just let the crops rot in the field.\n\n\"We know other parts of the country need what we have here. But the infrastructure has not been set up, as far as I'm aware, to allow that. There are times when there is food available and it's because of logistics that it doesn't find a home,\" said Mr Cameron, who still ended up destroying about 50,000 tons of the crop since nearby food banks \"can only take so much cabbage.\"\n\nInitial United Nations forecasts show that in a worst-case scenario, about a tenth of the world's population won't have enough to eat this year. The impact will go beyond just hunger as millions more are also likely to experience other forms of food insecurity, including not being able to afford healthy diets, which can lead to malnutrition and obesity.\n\nThe effects will be long lasting. Even in its best-case projections, the UN predicts that hunger will be greater over the next decade than forecast before the pandemic. By 2030, the number of undernourished people could reach as high as 909 million, compared with a pre-Covid scenario of about 841 million.\n\nThe current crisis is one of the \"rarest of times\" with both physical and economic limitations to access food, said Mr Arif Husain, chief economist with the UN's World Food Programme.\n\nBy the end of the year, as many as 12,000 people could die a day from hunger linked to Covid-19, potentially more than those perishing from the virus itself, charity Oxfam International estimates. That's calculated based on a more than 80 per cent jump for those facing crisis-level hunger.\n\nProjections for increased malnutrition also have a profound human toll. It can weaken the immune system, limit mobility and even impair brain functioning. Children who experience malnutrition early in life can see its impact well into adulthood.\n\n\"Even the mildest forms of food insecurity have lifelong consequences,\" said Ms Chilton of the Centre for Hunger-Free Communities.\n\nProblems with physical and cognitive development in children and adolescents can hamper the chances of staying in school or getting a job, continuing a cycle of poverty.\n\nGovernment programmes, food charities and aid organisations have mobilised across the globe, but the need far outstrips their reach. The UN's WFP aid group alone needs a record US$13 billion for the year to deliver food in 83 countries, and at the start of the second half faced a shortfall of US$4.9 billion to meet the goal.\n\nHunger can spark seismic shifts in the political landscape. Going back to the days of the French Revolution, food insecurity has sent people into the streets demanding better conditions. Surging food prices were part of the economic crisis that helped fuel recent protests in Lebanon and demonstrations over shortages erupted in Chile earlier this year.\n\nDeep-seated inequalities along gender and racial lines also correspond to disproportionate impacts from hunger. In the US, for example, Black Americans are two-and-a half times as likely as their White counterparts to have low or very low access to enough food for an active and healthy life. Globally, women are 10 per cent more likely to be food insecure than men.\n\n\"We have to make sure that we're addressing gender inequality - if the international community is not doing that, we will fail to avoid the worst of the hunger crisis,\" said Ms Tonya Rawe, a director at hunger relief and advocacy group Care.\n\nData from the UN show that throughout the world, there are more than enough calories available to meet every individual's needs. But even in the US, the richest country in the world, almost 2 per cent of the population, or more than 5 million people, can't afford a healthy diet (one that protects against all forms of malnutrition).\n\nMore than 3 million Americans can't afford to even meet basic energy needs. In India, 78 per cent of people can't afford healthy diets - that's more than 1 billion people. Those figures don't even take into account the pandemic and its lasting effects.\n\nCosts and logistics prevent food surpluses from being easily shifted to areas without. That's the dilemma faced by potato farmers in Belgium. When freezers filled during the pandemic, most of their spuds weren't fit for food banks or grocers.\n\nThe main variety that's grown to meet demand from places like the country's famous fry shops get black and blue spots after just a few days, said Mr Romain Cools of industry group Belgapom. Sales to supermarkets quickly stopped after complaints, and a bulk of the region's 750,000-ton surplus was instead used for animal feed or biogas.\n\n\"It's hard to take surplus milk in Wisconsin and get it to people in Malawi - it's just not realistic or practical,\" said geography Professor William Moseley from Macalester College who serves on a global food-security panel.\n\nDespite the abundant supplies, food is growing more expensive because of bungled supply chains and currency devaluations. Costs are up in parts of Africa and the Middle East and they're also rising in developed countries, with Europeans and Americans paying extra to stock their fridges.\n\nEven within major food-producing countries, being able to afford groceries is never a given.\n\nLatin America, an agriculturally rich region that exports food to the world, is leading this year's surge in hunger, according to the UN's WFP.\n\nIn Brazil, a huge cash-distribution programme has helped millions and driven poverty rates to historic lows. But that hasn't met all the need. In the country's north-east, Mr Eder Saulo de Melo worked as a guard at parties until the virus arrived.\n\nWith events suspended, he hasn't been paid in months. He's been locked out of the emergency cash programme and the 130 reais (S$32.78) he gets in regular monthly aid goes to energy, water and gas bills, leaving little to feed his three children. Baskets of non-perishables, vegetables, bread and eggs from a non-governmental organisation are the family's main sustenance.\n\n\"I needed to stop buying fruit and meat,\" he said. \"Instead of a slice of chicken, I buy offal to make a soup.\" The hunger estimates for this year have a \"high degree of uncertainty,\" and the disease's devastation is largely unknown, the UN cautioned about its figures.\n\nThe UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation began tracking global hunger in the mid-1970s. Current data can't be compared past 2000 given revisions in methodology, said Mr Carlo Cafiero, team leader for food security statistics.\n\nBut general trends can be observed, and they show that hunger moved lower over the past several decades until a recent reversal started in 2015, spurred by by climate change and conflicts.\n\nThe increases in the last few years are nothing like what is forecast now - even the best-case of the UN's tentative scenarios would see hunger surge in 2020 more than the past five years combined.\n\nAnd when looking at other notable periods of need in the world, such as the Great Depression, the level of food surplus that exists today is without comparison thanks to the advent of modern agriculture, which has seen crop yields explode.\n\n\"It's impossible to look at the situation and not think we have a problem,\" said Mr Nate Mook, chief executive officer of food-relief group World Central Kitchen. \"This pandemic has really exposed the cracks in the system and where it starts to break down.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nNutrition and diet\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/af_queens-food-bank_310820.jpg?VersionId=k.5TEhdyCLyp93wqDI9FY7d13Ylm28Zc", "alt_text": null}]}

Smoke from the fires also badly degraded air quality throughout the region, adding to health hazards already posed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhile CalFire said more than 60,000 residents remained displaced throughout the fire zone as of Sunday morning, Ms McMorrow said \"quite a few\" evacuation orders and warnings were being lifted.\n\nMeteorologists said the recent spate of dry lightning, the heaviest seen in California in more than a decade, was linked to the same atmospheric high-pressure system that caused a lengthy heat wave, which in turn further desiccated dense, fire-prone vegetation across the state.\n\nScientists point to lengthy droughts and longer-than-normal stretches of extreme heat as evidence of climate change that has steadily intensified and prolonged wildfire season in California and across the Western United States in recent years.\n\nClimatologist Zach Zobel said California is on track to overtake the nearly 2 million acres burned in 2018, when the state suffered its deadliest wildfire in history, as well as the most acreage burned on record gong back to 1987.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nFires", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/af_firefighters_310820.jpg?VersionId=TwhBHX5XGwimiZS3W5NuiUDq9AXwLnG2", "alt_text": null}]}

These range from exaggerations to misinformation.\n\nThe group has either retracted or deleted press releases that were online, and also locked their website and Instagram account.\n\nBritish sports journalist Liam Kennedy, who first broke the story of the bid in Tyneside newspaper Shields Gazette, told ST he was already sceptical at the start, and felt the deal would not go through.\n\nHe said: \"There is a real air of unprofessionalism about the way they've gone about things, even going as far to send out a statement with the contact details of each one of the investors detailed in it.

It should not hold down those who started with less. It should not create dependency, such that people who get fish for today never learn how to fish for food tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\"It should not breed an entitled class who ask: What more can you do for me?\"\n\nMr Heng said a well-designed social safety net protects the vulnerable, invests in human and societal capital, and provides a means for those who fall down to bounce back.\n\n\"It gives hope and builds confidence. It believes in people and lifts the human spirit,\" he added. \"It supports every generation to have aspirations and dreams, and for everyone to ask: \"What more can we do for one another?\"\n\nMr Heng was also glad that amid the pandemic, many have stepped up to support others. He cited\n\nthe Masks Sewn With Love project,\n\nwhich saw volunteers sew over 100,000 masks for vulnerable families.\n\nHow well Singapore emerges from the present crisis depends on its ability to adapt while holding true to its values, said Mr Heng, who added the country's premium resides in its ability to work with like-minded partners to build a better world, both for Singaporeans and people around the world.\n\n\"We are both a city-state and a global metropolis, maintaining this \"dual identity\" will not be easy,\" he said. \"But as long as we are clear about our values and what holds us together, it will be a source of strength that opens up new opportunities.\"\n\nMr Heng emphasised the Government's commitment to building deeper partnerships with Singaporeans, citing\n\nthe Singapore Together movement\n\nthat it launched last June to harness diverse ideas and work with people to shape a shared future.\n\nHe shared how his fellow East Coast GRC MPs recently engaged Ms Samantha Thian and a group of volunteers who regularly\n\nclean the beach at East Coast Park,\n\nand followed up with them last Saturday via videochat to discuss ways to create a more sustainable Singapore.\n\n\"I am very impressed by their passion and commitment (and) we agreed to work together to turn their good ideas into action,\" said Mr Heng.\n\nSuch partnerships help foster a culture of respect and expand the common space, strengthening Singapore's capacity to change together, he noted.\n\n\"We want to build on these efforts too, as we recover from Covid-19,\" he said, adding that this was why\n\nthe Emerging Stronger Conversations\n\nhave been convened to give Singaporeans a shared opportunity to reflect on their Covid-19 experience and articulate how they can take Singapore forward together.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Parliament\n\nPresident's Addendum\n\nHeng Swee Keat\n\nPolitics and government\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Fold7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nAndie Chen urged by fellow actors not to feel discouraged after Best Actor loss\n\nFormer NCT member Taeil sentenced to 3\u00bd years for rape\n\nAd\n\nExtra $200 off for new lines and port-ins on 5G Device Plan.\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

There is a feeling that the United States will probably remain fairly passive and show little good will until November 3,\" he said.\n\nSome think the wait could last until Jan 20, when the next US president is sworn in, before things will move forward.\n\nMany say the process has never been so politicised, and some suggest the organisation might be forced to ditch its long-held policy of consensus and ask members to vote.\n\nThat would mark a big shift. In 1999, when members were unable to unanimously choose who should be given four years at the helm, they opted to hand the two top picks a three-year mandate each instead of resorting to a vote.\n\nBut Prof Elsig said such a decision would be unfortunate in the current climate.\n\n\"Someone with a short three-year tenure might likely be perceived as a lame duck from the beginning.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nWorld Trade Organisation\n\nTrade", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/31/rk_robertoazevedo_310820.jpg?VersionId=cYxog_BomxjQEaHulPpd3Af8odUt03EO", "alt_text": null}]}
