Last year, the force said, there were 26 reported cases of its front-line officers being abused, up from 23 the previous year. The figure has been increasing since 2016, when 20 cases were reported.\n\nIn its statement yesterday, the SCDF also addressed privacy concerns, saying that in certain situations, like maternity cases, paramedics will stop recording on the devices.\n\nThere are also plans to include live-streaming capabilities in the cameras, which will allow doctors off-site to give medical advice to paramedics attending to complex cases on the ground, if necessary.\n\n26\n\nNumber of reported cases last year of SCDF's front-line officers being abused, up from 23 the previous year.\n\nThe director of the SCDF's medical department, Assistant Commissioner Yazid Abdullah, said the body-worn cameras are part of efforts to enhance emergency ambulance operations and improve patient outcomes. \"At the same time, we have put in place robust control measures to regulate the use of the (devices) and the recorded data,\" he added.\n\nFor instance, only authorised personnel will be allowed to collect, store and use the data. Any access to the data will be logged to enable audit checks. It will also be encrypted for added security.\n\nIn addition, SCDF will ensure that the data is deleted after 90 days from the date of recording, unless there is a reason to retain it, such as for police investigations.\n\n\"Any officer who misuses the body-worn cameras or data will be dealt with severely,\"said the SCDF.\n\nPublic concern over privacy is understandable, especially in the wake of incidents like the SingHealth cyber attack and Monday's revelation by the Health Ministry that the data of 14,200 people with HIV had been stolen and leaked online, said lawyer Bryan Tan.\n\nMr Tan, who specialises in technology law and data protection, said given the nature of emergency medical calls, some footage might capture intimate moments and in private places.\n\n\"We do expect that SCDF will train its paramedics on how to use the devices and tell them when they should or should not use them.\"\n\nAs more agencies explore the use of body-worn cameras to help in work processes and improve service and efficiency, they have to be aware of the risks, he said.\n\n\"With every new tech element we introduce, there is additional risk.

The reimbursement was to be made by the end of last month.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had\n\ninitially wanted to scrap the HSR\n\nas part of a review of his country's mega projects, in a bid to trim a RM1 trillion (S$329 billion) national debt.\n\nHowever, a deal was negotiated to\n\nsuspend the project instead\n\nas a cancellation would have entailed a high amount of compensation under the HSR agreement signed between the two countries.\n\nWith the delay, the HSR express service will start running only on Jan 1, 2031, instead of Dec 31, 2026, as planned initially.\n\nThe 350km HSR link would cut travelling time between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to 90 minutes, compared with more than four hours by car.\n\nTransport Minister Khaw Boon Wan told Parliament last October that the abortive costs include contract breakage costs, which Singapore has to pay to contractors for terminating ongoing projects, and to wind down operations.\n\nFor ongoing excavation works, for example, the excavations must be back-filled for the site to be safe, and re-excavated when the project resumes, thus increasing costs, Mr Khaw said.\n\nUp to the end of May last year,\n\nSingapore had spent more than $250 million to implement the HSR project\n\n, which included costs for consultancies to design the civil infrastructure, costs for manpower and costs for land acquisition.\n\nMore than $6 million in costs was incurred in June, another sum of more than $6 million in July, and at least $40 million is projected to have been spent from August to the end of last year.\n\nMr Khaw has said that Singapore can recover value for some of the expenditure, even if the HSR project does not proceed.\n\n\"But a significant amount which has been spent will be completely wasted expenditure if the project does not proceed,\" he told Parliament last July.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore-KL high speed rail\n\nSingapore-Malaysia ties\n\nRailways", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/bp_batu_pahat_010219_22_0.jpg?VersionId=G9eJQy5eB4GJCHpjaHb5FAllzigDthNd", "alt_text": null}]}

A special method will be used to layer the pavement and raise the runway height in 10cm increments.\n\nThe project is expected to require at least about three years to complete.\n\nThe ministry has opened discussions with Kansai Airports, the airport's operating firm, and will begin work to elevate the runway as early as fiscal year 2019.\n\nThe runway is currently about 3m above sea level. Construction will be carried out mainly at night so as not to obstruct the operation of aircraft. The height will be gradually increased using damage-resistant asphalt. The ministry plans to first work on the seawalls before raising the runway and taxiways, and then resume work to elevate the seawalls.\n\nKansai Airport is located on a man-made island, a rarity in other countries. The airport has gradually sunk since it opened in 1994. The airport's runways and taxiways were paved several times and raised by about 20cm, along with other structures, from 2007 to 2008.\n\nThe upcoming project will be the first large-scale undertaking to raise the runway by a metre.\n\nIt has been noted that the seawalls need to be elevated because the first island - one of two airport islands originally constructed - sinks about 6cm per year. However, the height of seawalls surrounding runways must be limited so that airplanes can safely land and take off. For that reason, the runways and other structures must be elevated at the same time as the seawalls. Raising the runway alone is expected to cost several billion yen, a cost that had discouraged the undertaking of it.\n\nBut the transport ministry determined that drastic measures must be taken to raise the height of the runway and seawalls, as operations on the first island were suspended for about 10 days due to the flooding from the typhoon last autumn that generated waves more than 5m high, the highest ever recorded in Japan.\n\nDisaster prevention measures appropriated for the airport are estimated to be 54 billion yen (S$667.7 million). However, the sum could drastically increase due to the work to raise the runway, taxiways and other structures.\n\nThe ministry's study panel, set up following the flooding last autumn, has noted the importance of raising the seawalls to prevent flooding, among other measures. It is possible that such techniques will be used at other offshore airports potentially vulnerable to high waves.\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nAirports\n\nFloods", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/bp_kansai_airport_010219_37.jpg?VersionId=ELkQXFKV690Qk.XpUdR1eX8zPbjZzPIP", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/bp_kansai_airport_010219_36.jpg?VersionId=qfGQVs4hpBjckigquIKjivEqJ_KRQEaR", "alt_text": null}]}

Hezbollah chose the new health minister.\n\nSome Lebanese bond prices jumped to their highest level since August in response to the news, and celebratory fireworks burst over Beirut shortly after the deal was announced.\n\nHariri must now deliver on promises to rein in public spending to address the dire state finances with reforms that could unlock billions of dollars in pledged aid and loans for infrastructure investment.\n\nIn a statement read from the presidential palace, Hariri apologised to the people of Lebanon for the time it had taken to form the government and noted that they were \"living in concern\"over the economy.\n\nThe time for \"painkillers\" was over, he said.\n\n\"No one can put their head in the sand any more... All the problems are known and the causes of the corruption and waste and administrative deficiency are also known,\" he said.\n\n\"The solution is with a clear programme and bold reforms... and developing laws that cannot be delayed.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, he said the new government would be forced to \"take difficult decisions\" to reduce spending.\n\nConcerns have grown over the state of the economy and government finances. Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil - who retained his post - warned last month that Lebanon was in an economic crisis that has \"started to turn into a financial one\".\n\nLebanon's public debt is one of the highest in the world set against the size of its economy, and it has suffered low growth for years for reasons including regional turmoil.\n\nGebran Bassil, a political ally of Hezbollah who is the son-in-law of President Michel Aoun and leads the political party he founded, remained foreign minister.\n\nThe defence portfolio, significant partly due to major US military aid, went to another Aoun loyalist, Elias Bou Saab.\n\nHariri nominated Rayya Hassan, a former finance minister, to the post of interior minister. She is one of four women in this cabinet, compared with only one in the last cabinet.\n\nWhile not a Hezbollah member, Health Minister Jamil Jabak's appointment has been seen as a signal of its determination to exercise more direct sway over government after playing marginal roles in past cabinets.\n\nThe ministry has the fourth-biggest budget in the state.\n\nHezbollah, which is designated as a terrorist group by Washington and has come under fresh US sanctions, also has two other cabinet seats.\n\nThe anti-Hezbollah Lebanese Forces party, which nearly doubled its number of MPs last May, has ceded ground at least twice in the negotiations, enabling the government to be formed.\n\nTOUGH REFORMS\n\nHezbollah together with groups and individuals that support its possession of weapons, won more than 70 of parliament's 128 seats in the May election.\n\nHariri lost more than a third of his lawmakers but kept his status as the leading Sunni and so returns as premier for the third time. The post is reserved for his sect under Lebanon's sectarian system of rule.\n\nThe last big hurdle was a dispute over how Hezbollah's Sunni allies should be represented in Cabinet, resolved by the inclusion of Hassan Mrad, the son of the pro-Hezbollah and pro-Damascus MP Abdul Rahim Mrad.\n\nWhile Lebanon's economy and financial system have shown resilience during previous periods of political paralysis, investor concerns have been reflected of late in bond prices.\n\nJason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Markets in London, said the government would need to show it was able to implement tough reforms.\n\n\"It's taken them nine months to put together a government, let alone how long it will take to agree on the very harsh fiscal consolidation that would be needed to put the debt position on a firmer footing,\" he said.\n\nThe formation of the government is the third boost for Lebanese bonds in two weeks. They rose last week when Qatar said it was investing US$500 million (S$670 million) in them, and again when Saudi Arabia said it would support continue supporting Lebanon.\n\nSee more on\n\nLebanon\n\nPolitics and government", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/07334248.jpg?VersionId=FczTdLmWwqtpVicrzIgBkeZJWU8QTwUM", "alt_text": null}]}

But he noted that organisations here were working hard to make such vehicles a reality by 2022, when driverless shuttles will be tested in three areas - Punggol, Tengah and the Jurong Innovation District - for residents on their daily commute.\n\nPermanent Secretary for Transport Loh Ngai Seng, who chairs Carts, said he hoped that TR 68 will \"guide industry players in the safe and effective deployment of autonomous vehicles in Singapore\".\n\nSee more on\n\nSelf-driving vehicles\n\nEnterprise Singapore\n\nLTA", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/ST_20190201_AV01_4594500.jpg?VersionId=xjyTWZjXflom0VH3CFXI.1FraH5FsCuP", "alt_text": "A self-driving car by start-up nuTonomy.

PHOTO: HIROSHIMA PREFECTURE\n\nJoshua Wong\n\nPublished\n\nFeb 01, 2019, 04:00 AM\n\nJapan boasts towering skyscrapers and bustling metropolises like Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka. But the country is also home to beautiful gardens, rich heritage sites and age-old temples.\n\nIn the Chugoku region, at the southwestern tip of Honshu, you can explore some of these attractions. Enjoy a slower pace of life away from the big cities, and take your time to discover iconic historical and cultural landmarks off the beaten track.\n\nHere are four that you should not miss.\n\n1. Korakuen Garden\n\nLocated in Okayama city adjoining Okayama Castle, this is considered to be one of Japan's three best landscape gardens (along with Kenrokuen in Kanazawa and Kairakuen in Mito). It was awarded three stars in the Michelin Green Guide Japan.\n\nBuilt in 1700 by the local feudal lord, the garden preserves much of its original design and incorporates rice fields, tea gardens, and groves of cherry, plum and maple trees within its extensive grounds.\n\nFeaturing a large pond, streams, walking paths and a hill that functions as a lookout point, Korakuen fulfills all the classic elements of a landscape garden. You can also enjoy beautiful vistas of Okayama Castle from various spots in the garden.\n\nWhen you visit, be sure to drop by the crane aviary near the main entrance. While the birds are usually kept caged, they are occasionally let out from November to February on some Sundays and national holidays.\n\nKorakuen Garden is located a short 10 to 15-minute walk away from Shiroshita tram stop, three stops from Okayama JR station.\n\nBonus itinerary: Kurashiki.\n\nLocated a quick 35-minute drive away from Okayama, Kurashiki boasts a quaint historical quarter that you can explore, complete with a scenic canal and traditional Japanese architecture.

Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine\n\nAlso known as Izumo Oyashiro, this is one of the oldest, most famous and most important Shinto shrines in Japan. Located in the city of Izumo, in Shimane Prefecture, it is popular with both Japanese and international tourists.\n\nOkuninushi-no-Okami, the deity enshrined at Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine, is said to govern the realm of the gods. According to legend, all of Japan's deities (\n\nkami\n\n) gather at the shrine during the 10th month of the lunar calendar every year to hold meetings with him and with each other. The place is especially popular with young women who make wishes for romance.\n\nThe shrine boasts Japan's largest\n\nshimenawa\n\n, or Shinto straw rope, measuring 13.5m in length.\n\nShimenawa\n\ndemarcate the boundary between sacred and secular spaces, and can be found at other holy sites across the country.\n\nAs you walk around, you will find various cute rabbit statuettes, due to a myth that the shrine's\n\nkami\n\nhelped rabbits in the past. There are notice boards with QR codes on all four sides of the main hall, allowing you to learn more about the history of the place and the myths surrounding it.\n\nFrom Izumoshi JR station, visitors can take a bus to the entrance of Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine.\n\nYou can also take the Ichibata Electric Railway from Dentetsu Izumoshi station - which is located next to JR Izumoshi station - to Izumo Taishya-mae Station.\n\nBonus itinerary: Tsuwano.\n\nA small, beautiful town nestled in the mountains of Shimane Prefecture, Tsuwano is home to a variety of traditional crafts like sake brewing and washi paper making, as well as exquisitely preserved homes from the samurai era.\n\nIt is dotted with shrines and temples, including a 19th-century Catholic church with tatami mats for pews (rebuilt in the 20th century), and boasts a canal filled with hundreds of carp that you can feed.\n\nVisit\n\nwww.kankou-shimane.com/en/\n\nfor more information on things to do in Shimane Prefecture.\n\n3. Unrinji Temple\n\nColloquially known as the Cat Temple, this place is dedicated to all things feline. Perched on a hillside in rural Yamaguchi Prefecture, the temple has a 400-year history, but has only recently become a tourist attraction. It was built in honour of a cat who showed immense loyalty to its samurai master.\n\nCat lovers will find much to delight them - the place is filled with cat memorabilia and trinkets of all kinds, including a row of full-face cat helmets that you can try on.\n\nThe temple is run by a friendly Buddhist monk, who welcomes visitors with a smile. You can draw a cat on a wooden template and write a wish on the other side - this will be hung up in the foyer. You can also purchase various lucky charms and cat-related souvenirs.\n\nIf you keep your eyes open, you might even spot a real cat wandering around the premises.\n\nBonus itinerary: Hagi Seaside Market.\n\nLocated a 30-minute drive from Unrinji Temple, this seafood emporium in the style of a traditional Japanese public market has 17 stalls selling locally caught fresh fish, seafood and other marine products.

Itsukushima Shrine\n\nWith an iconic vermilion torii (a traditional Japanese gate which symbolically marks the divide between the sacred and the mundane), this is one of Japan's National Treasures and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also one of the Three Views of Japan - a list of Japan's most celebrated scenic sights compiled by the 17th-century scholar Hayashi Gaho.\n\nLocated on Miyajima Island a short ferry ride away from Miyajimaguchi, the shrine is situated on the shoreline, where tides rise and fall. During low tide, you can walk out to the torii 200m from the entrance to marvel at it up close, while at high tide the gate appears to be floating on the water, providing for scenic and memorable photos.\n\nItsukushima Shrine is a complex of various buildings that are built over water. Apart from the main shrine and torii, you can also enjoy the vivid craftsmanship of the Marodo Shrine, which you will pass as you enter.\n\nYou will also see Japan's only Noh stage constructed over water as well as the vibrant vermilion East and West corridor, a popular spot for photoshoots, which connects Itsukushima to Marodo.\n\nAfterwards, explore Miyajima's Omotesando shopping street for a taste of freshly grilled oysters or delicious momiji manju (maple leaf-shaped castella cakes with red bean filling) - the island's speciality.\n\nYou can take a ferry to Miyajima from Miyajimaguchi ferry terminal, a short walk away from Miyajimaguchi JR station.\n\nBonus itinerary: Okunoshima.\n\nAlso known as Rabbit Island due to the approximately 700 wild rabbits that roam its shores, Okunoshima is a favourite tourist destination for the young and old alike.

Court documents do not reveal details about Sim.\n\nLer is also accused of being in possession of a syringe - a utensil intended for the administration of a controlled drug - in the lobby of the Conrad Centennial Singapore hotel at around 4.15pm on March 2 last year.\n\nAbout an hour later, he allegedly failed to provide his urine sample at the Central Narcotics Bureau office in New Bridge Road.\n\nThere is no indication in court documents that he was arrested that day.\n\nLer will appear in court for these drug-related charges on May 29.\n\nOn Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) revealed that more than 14,200 people living with HIV had their confidential information, including contact details and medical information, leaked online by an American man, Mikhy Farrera Brochez.\n\nBrochez' partner was Ler, who used to head MOH's National Public Health Unit (NPHU).\n\nLer is also facing charges under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) related to the leak. The date for the OSA case has not been fixed.\n\nCourt documents for the OSA case show thatthe doctor had access to a registry, which contained the names of people who tested HIV-positive in Singapore prior to February 2012.\n\nHe is said to have saved the information on a thumbdrive while working at the NPHU.\n\nHe allegedly failed to \"take reasonable care\" of the information by \"failing to retain possession\" of the thumbdrive between March 2012 and May 23, 2016.\n\nIn addition to court appearances for the OSA case and the drug-related charges, Ler has a hearing coming up next month.\n\nHe is appealing against a 2018 conviction and a sentence of two years in jail for abetting Brochez to commit cheating, as well as for giving false information to the police and MOH.\n\nLer, who does not have HIV, had submitted his own blood sample in place of his HIV-positive boyfriend's to help him get an Employment Pass here.\n\nFollowing a trial, District Judge Luke Tan found Ler guilty of helping Brochez to deceive the Ministry of Manpower into issuing him an Employment Pass in March 2008 and allowing him to keep the pass in November 2013 after red flags were raised.\n\nLer was also found guilty in September last year of lying to MOH in December 2013 and the police in January 2014, when he was questioned about a second blood test.\n\nDuring his trial, Ler claimed he had given these statements under duress. His various allegations were rejected by Judge Tan.\n\nAmong other things, Ler said that while he was being questioned, an officer burst into the room, flung medical records on the table and shouted at him to \"stop playing games\". This was refuted by the relevant officers.\n\nThe judge found it hard to believe Ler, who had flip-flopped in his testimony regarding the identity of the officer who was allegedly hostile towards him.\n\nFor the trial last year, Ler had engaged defence lawyer Amarjit Singh Sidhu, whom he later discharged.\n\nSpeaking to The Straits Times yesterday, the lawyer from Amarjit Sidhu Law Practice said: \"He discharged me on the first day of his trial to run his own case. I believe he is still not represented by a lawyer now.\"\n\nEven though Ler remains a doctor for now, his certificate to practise medicine in Singapore expired at the end of last year and has not been renewed.\n\nBrochez, 34, was sentenced to 28 months in jail in 2017 for offences that included cheating, lying to a public servant, possessing drugs and using forged educational certificates.\n\nHe was deported after completing his sentence.\n\nSEE\n\nEDITORIAL & OPINION\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts\n\nCrime", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/nm-hivleak-0102.jpg?VersionId=e219QGy7120JiONv6ovCiGD0Ee5ja2Aa", "alt_text": null}]}

Commanders answer for the training and safety of their men. To do so, commanders have to be fully committed and personally and intimately involved in their unit's training, operations and safety,\" he said.\n\nLt-Gen Ong said he, as well as the army, air force and navy chiefs and commanders at all levels, will make more visits to SAF units to ensure training is safe.\n\nThe defence chief added that a lower training tempo - referring to the duration, frequency and intensity of training activities - will allow SAF units to review their training programmes comprehensively to reduce the safety risk for servicemen.\n\nNo details were given on when the new IGO will be set up, its size and composition, or who will head it.\n\nThe army, navy and air force have their own safety inspectorates headed by full colonels that report to their respective service chiefs.\n\nThe Straits Times understands that the new IGO will perform an additional level of audits and checks, as well as promote safety education, beyond what the inspectorates now do in each service.\n\nDefence analyst Ho Shu Huang of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies said the new IGO could reflect an acknowledgement that there are still gaps in safety that need to be closed, even if the safety regime is generally robust.\n\n\"There may have, unfortunately, been areas which were overlooked, and the Inspector-General's job is to ensure complete and absolute compliance.

But it said details of negotiations were confidential.\n\nEmirates and Rolls-Royce declined to comment.\n\nEmirates announced the deal for up to 36 aircraft worth as much as US$16 billion (S$21 billion) at list prices a year ago, throwing a lifeline to the programme's roughly 3,000 workers and securing its future for at least another decade.\n\nThe airline is an ardent supporter of the jet, which was designed with luxury features like bars and showers.\n\nBut sales of four-engined planes are tumbling as many airlines switch to smaller twin-engined jets like the A350 and Boeing 777 due to improvements in range and efficiency.\n\nA year-long impasse between Emirates and Rolls-Royce over shortfalls in fuel savings has so far blocked the order.\n\nAirbus is trying to broker a complex workaround which could see Emirates take smaller jets also powered by Rolls-Royce while it tries to secure homes for as many A380s as possible, with British Airways recently expressing interest.\n\nAirbus has dangled the prospect of closing A380 production before, and industry sources say such manoeuvres can be a negotiating tactic to force the feuding parties to agree.\n\nBut time is running out for the A380 with few airlines willing to spend the sums invested by Emirates, which has made it a backbone of its global network alongside the Boeing 777.\n\nThe production line is \"untenable\", a senior industry source said A decision by Emirates to order the A350 would offer a respite for Airbus and its main engine partner Rolls-Royce after the Gulf carrier axed an order for the A350 in 2014.\n\nAirbus and Rolls are keen to maintain a foothold with the Gulf carrier and prevent Boeing filling the gap with more of its General Electric-powered 777s.\n\nSee more on\n\nAirlines\n\nAviation/Aerospace sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/bahrain-airshow-162344.jpg?VersionId=SEXxy61IYvPVJvaYoMweA22uIdaaGvhp", "alt_text": null}]}

This training is to equip my team with additional skills and tools for a more holistic approach to serving our prospective students,\" says Mr Andrew Chew, Director, Marketing at JCU Singapore.\n\nThe Student Recruitment team is trained to facilitate in several different areas. First, they guide prospective students through a self-assessment, identifying their proficiencies and weaknesses, as well as what they enjoy and do not enjoy doing.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Some students actually dislike doing the things they are highly proficient at - and sometimes do not even realise it.\n\nNext, the team explores potential job and career options with the students, usually by sharing stories of alumni experiences - particularly useful for more unique majors such as environmental science.\n\nOnce they have helped students get a better sense of their personal motivation and values, the team then identifies industries and programmes that would be the best fit for them.\n\nThe role is not unlike detective work. One particular prospective student approached Mr Chan with the intent of enrolling in a Master's degree to facilitate her switch either to human resources or a managerial role.\n\nIn getting her to share about her current job, Mr Chan helped her identify the skills she was proficient at, as well as those she was lacking in but enjoyed using. In the process, he discovered that she had experience in the hotel industry, a major part of which was conducting in-house training.\n\nMutually, they concluded that she would be better off completing a training and facilitation certification, before making a switch into a human resources role that specialised in training and development. Contrary to what she believed, she could afford to get her Master's degree later.\n\nIn most universities, this role often falls into the purview of the career services team. However, JCU Singapore's Associate Director Student Recruitment, Ms Cassandra Lee is quick to emphasise that her team is not meant to replace career services, but to work in tandem with them.\n\n\"By helping prospective students choose the most suitable course of study to enrol into, the career services team can build on what my team has done, rather than trying to help a student decide on the best career options only after they have enrolled,\" she says.\n\nThe likelihood of students switching courses or majors halfway through the programme is thus reduced. This saves them time and money, as doing so halfway through their university studies might end up delaying their graduation.\n\n\"I really support this initiative by the university,\" Mr Chan says. \"It signals to us that JCU wants us to find the empathy to say that I am sorry, what we have on offer may not be the best fit for your personal values or career aspirations.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nBranded content\n\nSKILLS OF TOMORROW", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/30/jcu-careercoaching1resized_-_by_ted_chen.jpg?VersionId=Ak8y3Eb65FxIzAG8_AbHDhkXrkV66SlK", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

The Europeans have promised to help companies do business with Iran as long as it abides by the deal.\n\n\"It is a political act,\" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters after a meeting of European Union counterparts in Bucharest. \"It is a gesture to protect European companies.\"\n\nWashington says that although Iran has met the terms, the accord was too generous, failing to rein in Iran's ballistic missile programme or curb its regional meddling.\n\nNew US sanctions have largely succeeded in persuading European companies to abandon business with Iran, and Washington said on Thursday (Jan 31) that it did not expect the EU effort, known as the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), to change that.\n\n\"We do not expect the SPV will in any way impact our maximum economic pressure campaign,\" a US State Department spokeswoman said.\n\nThe European trade vehicle was conceived as a way to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods. However, those ambitions have been toned down, with diplomats saying that, realistically, it will be used only for smaller trade, for example of humanitarian products or food.\n\n\"It won't change things dramatically, but it's an important political message to Iran to show that we are determined to save the JCPOA (Iran deal) and also to the United States to show we defend our interests despite their extraterritorial sanctions,\" one European diplomat said.\n\nThe EU has spent months preparing the system and it will take several months more to become operational.\n\nBritain's Jeremy Hunt said the three countries were working closely with Teheran to finalise arrangements: \"Registration is a big step, but there is still more work to be done,\" he said.\n\nRELATIONS WORSENING\n\nThe Instrument In Support Of Trade Exchanges, or INSTEX, is registered in France and will be headed by German banker Per Fischer, a former Commerzbank director. The three European powers are shareholders and hope other states will join later, although a senior German official said this was not imminent.\n\nIranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said the mechanism was a good first step.\n\nThe European powers must now establish a budget for INSTEX and define its rules. Iran must also set up a mirror company.\n\n\"It seems that Iran should set up the same system inside Iran to organise rial transactions for Iranian companies,\"Mr Araqchi was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.\n\nThe US Embassy in Germany said it did not expect INSTEX to blunt its effort to pile economic pressure on Teheran.\n\nEven as European powers and the EU have worked to preserve the nuclear deal, relations with Teheran have been worsening. The EU this month imposed its first sanctions on Iran since the nuclear pact, in response to the ballistic missile tests and assassination plots on European soil.\n\nIn a symbolic move, the EU added two Iranian individuals and an Iranian intelligence unit to its terrorist list.\n\nThe three big European powers are also assessing whether to push for new sanctions on Iran over its missile programme, diplomats told Reuters.\n\n\"We are clear; this commitment does not in any way preclude us from addressing Iran's hostile and destabilising activities,\" Mr Hunt said.\n\nSee more on\n\nEU\n\nIran\n\nTrade", "images": []}

Some three million Venezuelans have left the country.\n\n'VIOLATION' OF NORMS\n\nAs it seeks to shore up support for Mr Guaido, the administration of US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on state-run oil firm PDVSA on Monday, aimed at severely curbing Venezuela's crucial crude exports.\n\nA United Nations human rights expert denounced the sanctions, saying they would compound a grave humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"Coercion, whether military or economic, must never be used to seek a change in government in a sovereign state,\" said Mr Idriss Jazairy, a UN special rapporteur studying the negative impact of sanctions.\n\n\"The use of sanctions by outside powers to overthrow an elected government is in violation of all norms of international law,\" he said in a statement in Geneva.\n\nThe European Union agreed on Thursday to lead an international contact group with South American nations to help resolve Venezuela's political crisis by seeking new elections, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said.\n\nThe group, which will include Britain, France, Germany, Bolivia and Ecuador, will end after 90 days if no progress is made, and stands ready to consider more economic sanctions on Mr Maduro's government.\n\n\"We have targeted sanctions in place and further... sanctions might be considered by the ministers,\" Ms Mogherini, the EU's top diplomat, told reporters after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Bucharest.\n\nEarlier, the European Parliament recognised Mr Guaido as de facto head of state, a largely symbolic move. But lawmakers urged the EU's 28 governments to consider him \"the only legitimate interim president\" until there were \"new free, transparent and credible presidential elections\".\n\nOIL TUSSLE\n\nIn the tussle over oil, Mr Guaido worked this week with Washington to wrest control of PDVSA's US subsidiary Citgo from its board. Citgo and Mr Maduro's government responded by ordering dozens of Citgo's expatriate staff in the United States to return to Caracas by the end of February, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nPDVSA has said it will pursue legal efforts to block a Citgo takeover.\n\nOil production in Venezuela continued to decline in January, according to a Reuters survey. The country's oil output fell to 1.17 million barrels a day, down from 1.2 million bpd.\n\nThe country's ports are becoming bottlenecked, with about 25 tankers holding about 18 million barrels of crude oil - more than two weeks of the country's production - off the coast.\n\nUS sanctions prevent buyers such as Valero and Chevron from paying for oil into accounts that can be accessed by Mr Maduro, leaving the tankers stranded.\n\nPDVSA is also unable to pay for gasoline and other fuels that it is trying to import for domestic use or to blend with its heavy crude to make it marketable for global sale. That, too, is adding to the tanker traffic.\n\nSee more on\n\nVenezuela\n\nPolitics and government", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/2019-01-31t185635z_702450532_rc1555dc6ef0_rtrmadp_3_venezuela-politics.jpg?VersionId=m1blgvGXxUlzHttQhjyP2zxjT2D.xEnC", "alt_text": null}]}

Leong Weng Cheou, who roped in four friends for the scam, received over $77,000 of this amount.\n\nLeong, 46, pleaded guilty in court yesterday to 18 counts of forgery and 12 cheating charges. The court heard that 105 other similar charges will be taken into consideration during sentencing. He committed his offences in 2015 and 2016.\n\nSpring Singapore, an agency aimed at helping Singapore enterprises grow, is now known as Enterprise SG, the court heard.\n\nWhile working for Spring Singapore, his duties included assessing applications and claims for the Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV). Each voucher worth $5,000 was given to small and medium-sized enterprises to encourage them to develop their capabilities in five categories - innovation, productivity, human resource, financial management and solutions.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew said the ICV scheme operated on a \"reimbursement basis\".\n\nApplications were submitted online for Spring Singapore's approval to buy an item or service from a \"solution provider\", he added. Each application must be accompanied by documents, including a quotation from the vendor.\n\nOnce approved, an applicant could make the purchase before submitting a claim for disbursement, with supporting invoice and proof of payment. Applicants would receive their disbursements after the claim was approved.\n\nIn 2015, Leong hatched a plan to defraud the agency by using false documents to deceive it into disbursing money to shell business entities. He roped four Singaporean friends - Lionel Wong Yong Jun, 35, Soh Eng Luan, 38, Mary Heah Hwee Hoong, 41, and Wong Ping Ling, 44 - into the scam.\n\nThe DPP said: \"To carry out the plan, Leong engaged in four separate conspiracies with each of his four friends to register multiple shell business entities and forge supporting documents for the sole purpose of submitting fictitious ICV applications and claims to obtain the ICV moneys.\n\n\"There were... 31 successful fraudulent claims which amounted to $154,999.63, which Spring was deceived into paying out.\"\n\nIn late 2017, Leong had a meeting with his four friends as he knew that Spring Singapore's auditing processes would eventually uncover the ruse. The court heard that Soh later consulted a lawyer and lodged a police report, admitting that she had conspired with Leong to cheat Spring Singapore.\n\nLeong, who is represented by defence lawyer T.M. Sinnadurai, is expected to be sentenced on Feb 21.\n\nFor each cheating charge, he can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. The cases involving his four friends are still pending.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts\n\nCrime", "images": []}

Her long neon yellow-green nails were on display as she clutched her demure black purse, despite the icy weather.\n\nThe star, whose real name is Belcalis Almanzar, is due to appear again in court on April 4.\n\nOn Aug 29, Cardi B was in the Angels Strip Club in Queens when her group reportedly lobbed bottles, chairs and a hookah smoking device, which police said bruised a female employee in the legs.\n\nIn October, police charged her with one count of assault and two counts of reckless endangerment over the incident.\n\nUS media reports say she allegedly ordered an attack on two sisters working at the club because one of them slept with her husband, the rapper Offset. In December, she said she and Offset had separated.\n\nPrior to Thursday's minutes-long court appearance, rumors were swirling that the pair were back together.\n\n\"We're working things out, baby,\" she told a throng of journalists as she swooped out of the courtroom.\n\nThe couple secretly married in September 2017 and their daughter, Kulture, was born in July.\n\nCardi B is one of US music's hottest stars thanks to the runaway success of her song Bodak Yellow, which touches on her past life as a stripper.\n\nShe is no stranger to controversy - she was involved in a fracas with fellow rapper Nicki Minaj at New York Fashion Week in September, later taking to Instagram to say that the older Minaj had questioned her parenting skills.\n\nAt the Grammys in February, Cardi B will vie for two of the most prestigious awards - Album and Record of the Year.\n\nSee more on\n\nMusic\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/us-entertainment-music-cardib-court-153617.jpg?VersionId=DfE0NPMOCYYI3tXhldDDQhhlND9A1bsB", "alt_text": null}]}

Such arrangements will be barred under the new policy.\n\nIndustry sources have said the new rules will force the big e-sellers to change their business structures, and will raise compliance costs.\n\nAmazon India told Reuters it was \"committed to remaining compliant to all the laws of the land\", adding that all sellers make their own independent decisions of what to list and when.\n\nExclusive deals with sellers will be discontinued, the two sources said.\n\nIt is unclear how long the disruption will last. Would-be buyers of Echo speakers on Amazon India saw a message reading: \"We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock.\" The impact of the changes on Flipkart was not clear. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a letter to India's industries department in January, Flipkart chief executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy said the rules required the company to assess \"all elements\" of its business operations and risked causing \"significant customer disruption\".\n\nSee more on\n\nIndia\n\nAmazon\n\nE-commerce", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/bp_amazon_010219_34.jpg?VersionId=WZkEKwK5wbxUP_PuDAFbwjganGPUB62u", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

I think, when President Xi and myself meet, every point will be agreed to,\" said Mr Trump.\n\n\"We're going to have a great trade deal with China if it all works out\u2026it's going to be great for both countries -- not just us, not just them,\" he added.\n\nBeijing too struck an upbeat tone on the outcome of the two-day talks,\n\nnoting that negotiators had discussed a range of issues, but focused on the trade imbalance, intellectual property rights protection, and the implementation mechanism of any eventual deal reached.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The purchase of United States products by China from our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and businesses is a critical part of the negotiations,\" said the White House.\n\nMr Trump zeroed in on China's commitment to buy five million tons of American soybeans a day, which Mr Liu said had already begun.\n\n\"That's a tremendous purchase, which will take place now. And our farmers are going to be very happy,\" said Mr Trump.\n\nHe said that the case of Huawei, whose chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou has been charged with bank fraud and other crimes, had not been discussed yet but would be at some point.\n\n\"Actually, as big as it might seem, it's very small compared to the overall deal, but that will be discussed,\" he said when asked by a reporter.\n\nAt the same meeting, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told reporters that among the most important issues discussed had been \"enforcement, enforcement, enforcement\".\n\n\"Both sides agree this agreement is worth nothing -- if we can get an agreement, it's worth nothing without enforcement,\" he said.\n\nHe said that he and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be going to Beijing in early February to continue negotiations, adding that both sides are already more or less in constant negotiation \"with a brief pause for the Chinese New Year\".\n\nSaid Mr Lighthizer: \"At this point, it's impossible for me to predict success, but we are in a place that, if things work, it could happen.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nChina\n\nTrade\n\nTariffs", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/07334685.jpg?VersionId=dePQCbncO6jeEU9TANJrKVWuTBhrIn.q", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

Property owners and mall developers, however, hold the key to the success or failure of the rejuvenation efforts, they added.\n\nThe Land Transport Authority said it is exploring the pedestrianisation of a section of Dhoby Ghaut, and further study is required before finalising the details.\n\nThe proposed road closure would involve the stretch between Buyong and Handy roads, or the Istana and the junction before The Cathay.\n\nNanyang Technological University senior research fellow Gopinath Menon said traffic would be affected, but its effects would be manageable as the section proposed for pedestrianisation does not affect access to buildings in the area such as Plaza Singapura.\n\nTurning the opposite street, Penang Road, into a two-way road and diverting traffic there can work, though he said that a lane should remain open to buses as \"having these huge buses make turns becomes very messy\".\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But developers were largely not enticed, citing high costs, among other concerns.\n\n2007:\n\nA tie-up between the Singapore Tourism Board and Orchard Road Business Association to encourage late-night shopping saw some malls and retailers open until 11pm on the last Friday of the month. It ended three years later amid declining participation.\n\n2009:\n\nA $40 million facelift involved the widening of pavements in front of Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria and Ngee Ann City and other improvements to the street.\n\n2014:\n\nA monthly pedestrian night saw the stretch between Scotts and Bideford roads closed to traffic from 6pm to 11pm. It ended in 2016 as the costs were unsustainable and it did little to boost retail sales.\n\n2017:\n\nPlans were announced to revitalise Orchard Road, including the possibility of reclaiming a lane of traffic to expand pedestrian spaces, the use of state land for ad hoc events and the building of a permanent structure to showcase local designers. The Grange Road open-air carpark has been used for several events, while Design Orchard opened last week.\n\n2017:\n\nA Shibuya-style scramble crossing was trialled at the junction of Cairnhill and Orchard roads, allowing pedestrians to cross the road diagonally. The month-long trial took place on weekends and public holidays from December, but was not continued.\n\nA previous six-month trial at the Bideford-Orchard junction took place 11 years earlier, producing similar results.\n\n\"There are already existing green spaces though, and no one goes there. Unless they create a lot of amenities and attractions for people to go to, it will be one big empty park,\" he added.\n\nAmong the confirmed plans for the 2.4km Orchard Road is having different offerings between the Tanglin, Somerset, Orchard and Dhoby Ghaut areas.\n\nBut stakeholders have said that\n\nlandlords and retailers must play their part\n\nin the transformation inside the malls.\n\nThe Singapore Retail Association (SRA) said it agrees that more than infrastructure improvements are needed. This year's Great Singapore Sale, which it organises, will be revamped and promote local designers and talents, said SRA president R. Dhinakaran.\n\nA leading retailer with dozens of shops in Orchard Road who declined to be named said that while malls must be willing to compromise on rental income to support lifestyle offerings from young entrepreneurs, there may be roadblocks as most malls on the shopping belt are under real estate investment trusts, which are driven to maximise profits.\n\nOrchard Road developers and mall managers were mostly mum on their plans to participate in rejuvenation efforts or align their tenant mixes with the themes of the sub-precincts. Wisma Atria, Ngee Ann City, The Centrepoint, Tanglin Mall, The Cathay and the Cathay Cineleisure Orchard mall, 313@\n\nSomerset and Plaza Singapura declined to comment or did not respond by press time.\n\nFar East Organization's chief operating officer for its retail business group Mavis Seow said that its Orchard Central mall already caters to the younger crowd in the area, while Orchard Turn Developments said that Ion Orchard is working closely with associations and government organisations.\n\nOrchard Road saw some 7.3 million tourist visits in 2017, up from 6.4 million in 2013.\n\nSee more on\n\nOrchard Road\n\nRoad closures\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nUpgrade now.

The death toll rose from a previous 12 after at least nine more people in Chicago were reported to have died from cold-related injuries, according to Dr Stathis Poulakidas at the city's John H Stroger Jr Hospital.\n\nA University of Iowa student was found dead on campus of possible exposure early on Wednesday, according to university officials. The wind chill at the time police found Gerald Belz, 18, was minus 46 deg C, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHomeless and displaced people were particularly at risk, with Chicago and other cities setting up warming shelters. But many toughed it out in encampments or vacant buildings. A 60-year-old woman found dead in an abandoned house in Lorain, Ohio, was believed to have died of hypothermia, Lorain county coroner Stephen Evans said.\n\n\"There's just no way if you're not near a heat source that you can survive for very long out in weather like this,\" Mr Evans told the Chronicle-Telegram newspaper.\n\nIt has been more than 20 years since a similar Arctic blast covered a swathe of the Midwest and Northeast, according to the weather service.\n\nMore than 30 record lows were shattered across the Midwest. Cotton, Minnesota, had the lowest national temperature recorded early on Thursday at minus 48 deg C before the weather warmed up, the weather service reported.\n\nUS homes and businesses used record amounts of natural gas for heating on Wednesday, according to preliminary results from financial data provider Refinitiv.\n\nIn Detroit, General Motors Co suspended operations at 11 Michigan plants after a utility made an emergency appeal to conserve natural gas. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also cancelled a shift on Thursday at two of its plants.\n\nRelatively balmier weather was on the horizon. By the weekend, Chicago was expected to bask in snow-melting highs around 10 deg C or lower, along with other parts of the Midwest, the weather service said.\n\nIn Washington, where the low hit minus 12 deg C and was expected to peak at only minus 4 deg C, a small crowd of tourists braved the cold to take pictures outside the White House.\n\n\"We're from a hot country...

Then why have kids in the first place?!... Please, if you think you don't have the means, there are these things called condoms and birth control. They're cheaper than raising a child.\"\n\nShe has since been counselled by her school and volunteered to leave on Jan 22, and later clarified that her remarks were not directed at parents who have been trying to help their children.\n\nMr Ong, in his post, noted that Singapore's primary school system is designed to teach children to start reading and writing from Primary 1.\n\nFor this reason, the focus in Ministry of Education (MOE) kindergartens is on listening and speaking.\n\n\"But as parents, it is natural to want to prepare our children well for school, which is why many of our kids can already read when they enter Primary 1. Research also shows that it is good for a child's development if they hear more words when they are young,\" said Mr Ong.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

The hospital could not confirm this detail but told The Post that Smollett was not currently a patient.\n\n\"Given the severity of the allegations, we are taking this investigation very seriously and treating it as a possible hate crime,\" police said.\n\nSmollett told detectives his attackers said \"something to the effect of 'this is MAGA country',\" an apparent reference to President Trump's enduring \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan, during the assault.\n\nPolice spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the initial police report did not reference those comments, but the actor recalled the information in a follow-up interview with detectives.\n\nGuglielmi said Smollett still had a thin, white rope around his neck when officers first made contact with him around 2.40am, roughly 40 minutes after the alleged assault. He also confirmed that the FBI is investigating a threatening letter that was sent to Smollett on Jan 22 at the Fox studio in Chicago.\n\nThe FBI has not yet responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post.\n\nFox released a statement on Tuesday in support of the actor.\n\n'VICIOUS' ATTACK\n\n\"We are deeply saddened and outraged to learn that a member of our EMPIRE family, Jussie Smollett, was viciously attacked last night. We send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice. The entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate - and especially against one of our own.\"\n\nSmollett's publicist did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.\n\nSmollett began his career as a child actor with his siblings, who include actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. He is best known for playing Jamal Lyon on Empire. The character is a gay R&B musician who has faced homophobic criticism from his mogul father.\n\nThe character struggled with his sexuality before coming out in a buzzed-about Season 1 episode. The plot development led to widespread speculation about Smollett's sexuality.\n\nA month later, Smollett appeared on the TV show Ellen, when he confirmed he is gay.\n\n\"It was really important to me to make sure that it got across that there is no closet, there's never been a closet that I've been in,\" he told TV host Ellen DeGeneres. \"I don't have a closet. But I have a home and that is my responsibility to protect that home. So that's why I choose not to talk about my personal life. But there is, without a doubt, no closet I've ever been in. And I just wanted to make that clear.\"\n\nHe more directly addressed his sexuality in a 2016 interview with Out magazine. Though Smollett said he was open to falling in love with anyone, he identifies as a gay man.\n\n\"I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I am a gay man. I don't know how many times I have to say that,\" he told the magazine.\n\nAs news of his attack spread Tuesday, Smollett received statements of support from LGBTQ advocacy organisations he has worked with over the years.\n\n\"Jussie is a true champion for LGBTQ people and is beloved by the community and allies around the world,\" GLAAD said in a statement.\n\n\"This shocking attack on our friend and tremendous advocate Jussie Smollett is, unfortunately, not an isolated incident,\" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign.\n\n\"There is an alarming epidemic of hate violence in our country that disproportionately targets Black people, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities - and particularly those living at the intersections of multiple identities.\"\n\nLast year, the FBI said there was a 17 per cent increase in hate crimes in 2017 - the third consecutive year such crimes increased. Of the 7,175 hate crimes reported by United States law enforcement agencies, 2,013 incidents targeted black Americans. 1,130 hate crimes involved people who were targeted based on their sexual orientation.\n\nMessages of support from fans and fellow celebrities for Smollett poured out on Twitter as the news unfolded.\n\nTerrence Howard, the star of Empire, appeared on Good Morning America on Wednesday morning, where he said Smollett was improving, though it was difficult.\n\n\"I heard he's getting better. You know, he's angry,\" Howard said. \"But I know Jussie. Jussie's anger will dissipate and he will forgive these people for what they did. But he won't, and we cannot, forget their actions. They have to be forgiven because it was done out of ignorance.\"\n\nHoward also praised Smollett, saying, \"Jussie's the one that starts singing when everybody's in a bad mood. He's the one that cheers everybody up.\"\n\nEmpire co-star Vivica A. Fox tweeted in all caps: \"IM SO ANGRY AND HURT ABOUT THIS! THIS MUST STOP!! SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE! PRAYERS UP TO U NEPHEW!\"\n\nLee Daniels, who co-created Empire with Danny Strong, posted a heartfelt and expletive-laden video on Instagram.\n\n\"It's taken me a minute to come to social media about this, because Jussie, you are my son,\" Daniels said. \"You didn't deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck... You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that. It starts at home. It starts at home, yo. We have to love each other regardless of what sexual orientation we are. Because it shows we are united on a united front.\"\n\nStrong, meanwhile, wrote that he is \"deeply horrified and saddened by the racist and homophobic attacks.\"\n\nSmollett \"is a kind and profoundly talented soul whom I respect with all my heart. The terror of racism and homophobia has no place in our society, it is the most indecent way to live,\" Strong tweeted.\n\n\"Whoever did this, do not forget that you are nothing but hate filled cowards while Jussie's talent and activism will continue to shine a bright light on to the world for decades to come.\"\n\n\"We ALL have a responsibility to rise up against the ignorance and hate out there. If you know who did this... REPORT THEM TO THE POLICE,\" tweeted Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes.\n\nGrey's Anatomy actress Caterina Scorsone sent \"love and healing\" to the actor: \"We must tirelessly teach our children about the dignity and sacredness of each and every human being so that this kind of insanity ends. Hate destroys us from within. Teach them to love. It's on us.\"\n\nDemocratic Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker both weighed in on Twitter, calling the assault a \"modern-day lynching\".\n\n\"No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin,\" tweeted Harris.\n\n\"We must confront this hate.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nTelevision\n\nActors\n\nUS news", "images": []}

We need to have coaches that have been plying their trade not included in the sport,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to make sure that criteria is met and, when it is met, hopefully full reinstatement.\"\n\nIn the meantime, in what Coe said was \"very important philosophical position\" for him, Russian athletes would continue to be able to compete internationally under \"neutral status\" once they fulfilled certain criteria.\n\nCoe said the progress made in the fight against doping had also seen results in reassuring existing and potential sponsors and he looked forward to announcing new partners soon.\n\nThe chief organiser of the 2012 London Olympics was also looking forward to getting into the business of reviving the presentation of the sport, a process which started with an IAAF innovation workshop in London last week.\n\nCoe said market research showed that fans wanted a better broadcast and Internet experience, and improvements in stadiums.\n\n\"The next stage of the journey is making us relevant, making us fun, exciting in the world of young people,\" he said.\n\nThere would probably be changes to the elite Diamond League series from 2020, he said, and attempts to re-engage retired Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt with the sport he dominated for a decade.\n\n\"I can't think of any competitor, barring Muhammad Ali, that has connected with people so well so of course we want him involved,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Coe said he was not \"cavalier\" about the doping problem, he believes the IAAF congress that meets in Doha in September for the presidential election is overseeing a \"significantly safer\" sport than in years past.\n\n\"One positive test is too many, but the systems that we have available to us are 20, 30, 40 times safer than they were 10, 15, 20 years ago and certainly when I was competing,\" Coe said.\n\nSee more on\n\nAthletics\n\nDoping", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/yq-sebcole-31012019.jpg?VersionId=lXvpVIQy9JIBQfTBqaqusC_J3CF.9KbN", "alt_text": null}]}

They are Deeja Cosmetic Sun cream, Deeja Cosmetic Dream cream, RDL Babyface Whitening Cream Night Cream 5 in 1 and RDL Face Off Fade-Out Cream Day Cream 5 in 1.\n\nAll five were tested and found to contain undeclared potent ingredients such as hydroquinone, a skin-lightening agent prohibited in over-the-counter skincare cosmetic products, as well as mercury, a toxic metal.\n\nHSA warned that long-term exposure to high amounts of mercury could cause serious health risks, including damage to the kidneys, digestive and nervous systems. It said hydroquinone is a prescription-only medicine and should be used only under medical supervision. Inappropriate use could result in rashes, skin redness, tingling and burning of skin.\n\nThe three Deeja creams, which falsely claimed to be \"made and specially formulated from 100 per cent natural ingredients\", are part of the Deeja Cosmetic box set sold on local online platforms.\n\nThe RDL creams were imported by Arklife Distributors and sold in retail outlets. HSA has directed Arklife Distributors to stop the sale of these creams and recall the affected products from retail outlets.

bloc of countries.\n\nBut in cleaving London from the EU, Brexit is expected to restrict the EU work of British staff.\n\n\"We'll be ready for our European clients on day one,\" said a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase.\n\nYELLOW-VEST FALLOUT?\n\nThe group of workers being transferred from London includes traders and sales staff and banks have also been hiring new employees on the continent, sources said.\n\nThat banks are sticking with plans to expand in Paris is a sign financial giants have not been too unnerved by the so-called \"yellow vest\" protests that have gained international notoriety following clashes with French police.\n\nThe yellow vest protest \"does not change our plans,\" JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon said earlier this month in a conference call with journalists. \"The real issue is whether there will be a hard Brexit or not.\"\n\nSome banks have made arrangements to allow staff to commute to London over an interim period because of family commitments before the transfer is permanent.\n\nUntil now, transfers of banking professionals have been limited because the finance sector hopes Britain and Brussels can agree on a two-year period of transition.\n\nBut sources familiar with the banks said the number of relocations could rise in if there were a hardening of positions between now and the end of February and banks concluded the differences were irreconcilable.\n\n\"We still don't believe it will be (a hard Brexit) because it will be very difficult for both Britain and the EU so we expect a transitional withdrawal agreement,\" said JPMorgan's Dimon.\n\nBut as March 29 draws closer many experts are growing more concerned about a worst-case scenario feared by Brussels, London and beyond.\n\nThe risk of a Brexit without an agreement \"has increased,\" warned European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nLarge US banks have prepared for such a worst-case scenario to ensure the banking system remains functional, banking sources said.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who called Brexit an \"unprecedented event,\" said this week the US central bank had been working with US financial institutions that operate in Britain and the EU.\n\n\"We've been monitoring the Brexit situation very carefully for a long time,\" Powell said.\n\n\"We have worked with those institutions alongside UK and EU regulators to assure ourselves that those firms have plans and...all the things they will need to deal with the full range of Brexit outcomes.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited

Advance estimates put growth at 3.3 per cent last year, down from 3.6 per cent in 2017.\n\nMOM data shows that the typical Singaporean in full-time work earned more last year, with median income - including employer contributions to the Central Provident Fund - rising 3.3 per cent year on year to $4,183 as of June. But the pace of growth slowed from the 5.9 per cent seen in 2017.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah said the slower income growth is consistent with the slower pace of economic expansion, and both are expected to be lower this year. MOM noted in its report that year-on-year income changes are prone to fluctuations because data is captured from a sample survey.\n\nReal median income actually grew over the last five years, at an average of 3.6 per cent per year, higher than the 1.7 per cent per year in the previous five years. Over the same period, real income of Singaporeans at the 20th percentile - those earning lower wages - grew at an even faster pace, at an average of 4.3 per cent per year.\n\nIn terms of employment, the workforce grew by 39,300 last year, excluding foreign domestic workers. Of these additional workers, 28,400 were Singaporeans or permanent residents, while 10,900 were foreigners.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

The number of workers in construction and manufacturing fell for the third and fifth consecutive year, respectively.\n\nCIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said the growth in the service sector was due to improving external demand in the first half of last year, which lifted more service industries beyond logistics and finance.\n\n\"But I expect hiring this year to be more selective as businesses watch their costs amid the uncertain environment,\" he said.\n\nThe annual average unemployment rate fell to 2.1 per cent last year from 2.2 per cent in 2017.\n\nThe rates were 3 per cent for Singaporeans and 2.9 per cent for residents, down from 3.3 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.\n\nAlso, fewer workers were laid off last year as the economy continued to expand. A total of 11,020 workers were retrenched in 2018, down from 14,720 in 2017 and a peak of 19,170 in 2016.\n\nHowever, MOM noted in a statement that labour market trends from September to December last year were mixed, with a slight uptick in unemployment rates compared with the third quarter of 2018. It expects local workforce growth to remain modest going forward.\n\nNational Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay, a labour MP, said the labour market figures for the first half of the year should be watched closely, given global trade tensions and technological advances.\n\n\"I expect to see more companies doing more restrategisation, reorganisation and mergers and acquisitions, which may result in retrenchments,\" he said.\n\nSEE\n\nBUSINESS\n\nSee more on\n\nLabour market\n\nEmployment\n\nMinistry of Manpower", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/02/01/ST_20190201_VNRAFFLES2_4594133.jpg?VersionId=mdAa_QTarxAhNjDDeXnzpkQt6K2Mt3hD", "alt_text": "The typical Singaporean in full-time work earned more last year, with median income - including employer contributions to the Central Provident Fund - rising 3.3 per cent year on year to $4,183 as of June, according to data from the Ministry of Manpo"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

Huawei representatives declared that they complied with relevant standards,\" spokesman Jiri Ovcacek said on Twitter.\n\nZeman, who has long promoted close cooperation with Beijing and has publicly backed Huawei, also plans to meet its chief executive when he visits China in April, Ovcacek said.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nEU\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/2019-01-30t124229z_274262751_rc17512dd100_rtrmadp_3_usa-china-huawei-tech-czech.jpg?VersionId=FJGEX8qS7F466ftmuYHNu2p1RvKS3A9t", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority had said it is investigating the matter after receiving feedback that the python was mishandled.\n\nIn his Facebook post, Mr Hurst said Tuesday's situation was \"highly volatile and unpredictable\" and required his workers to react quickly. \"When the snake attempted to evade containment, not restraining the reptile by any means available could have had disastrous consequences in this busy and populated area.\"\n\nHe also defended his employee's decision to step on the python, saying \"a foot is no different to a hand being used in an attempt to restrain a powerful animal... In fact, the human leg is stronger than the arm for this\".\n\nHe added that the manager of the team that tackled the python was trained in snake-handling at the Singapore Zoo.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

That's why a man got bitten. If you have a snake hook, as they did, and are trained, no one should get bitten.\"\n\nPointing out that workers in the zoo or the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres) have never resorted to using their feet to capture a snake, Mr Subaraj said the Anticimex staff showed a lack of training and knowledge.\n\nAcres deputy chief executive Kalai Vanan said the area should have been cordoned off and people kept further away from the reptile.\n\nWildlife experts said the snake was likely hunting for food when it unexpectedly emerged from the drainage system connected to a nearby canal. Snakes, which are shy, tend to slither around in drainage systems to stay hidden from people, Nature Trekker founder Ben Lee said.\n\nCo-founder of the Herpetological Society of Singapore Sankar Ananthanarayanan said reticulated pythons are highly adaptable to urbanised environments.\n\nTheir presence in urban areas helps ensure \"sewers don't get overrun with rats\", he added. \"Pythons are often thought of as pests, but in truth, they are more like biological pest control.\"\n\nThe experts also said pest control firms should not be called in to handle snakes. People should call Acres and give information on the snake, such as its length, thickness and colour or markings.\n\nSee more on\n\nWildlife\n\nAnimals\n\nConservation/Preservation\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nExtra $200 off for new lines and port-ins on 5G Device Plan.\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nFormer NCT member Taeil sentenced to 3\u00bd years for rape\n\nCuomo to stay in New York mayoral race despite losing Democratic primary\n\nAd\n\nDon\u2019t miss $1,500 in savings with your Galaxy Z Fold7 pre-order\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

That experience spurred her to help people in need.\n\n\"Being part of a middle-income family trying to cope, I saw our struggles growing up. We had no financial assistance then and had to pay for the hospitalisation and rehabilitation of my brother along with our daily expenses. Because of that, I want to help other families,\" said the 30-year-old, who has two children of her own now.\n\nThe Islamic law and jurisprudence graduate from Al-Azhar University in Egypt, who has worked with organisations such as community self-help group Mendaki and educational institution Simply Islam, joined the Social Service Institute last year to do a part-time course for a diploma in social service. She is now a community engagement executive with the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis).\n\n\"Graduates from religious backgrounds like me usually pursue teaching. But I see social work can also complement my religious background,\" she said.\n\nYesterday, Ms Liyana and six other students received the Muis Social Work Study Award during the Madrasah Teachers Symposium at Suntec Convention Centre.\n\nThe award is for students of social work and social service studies who, upon graduation, contribute to the development of the Muslim community, said Muis chief executive Esa Masood in his opening speech.\n\nLast year, Muis said it had set aside $150,000 until 2020 for the award. Bursary distributing organisation Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud administers the funds.

That was the highest since 1972/73, the period for which the data are comparable, the newspaper reported, citing documents it had reviewed. It did not give a figure for 1972/73.\n\nBut the government think-tank NITI Aayog said the report was only a draft and that a final version would be published in March. It denied unemployment was widespread in India, whose economy is one of the fastest growing in the world.\n\n\"You can't be growing annually at 7.2 per cent and saying that there are no jobs being created in the economy,\" NITI Aayog Chief Executive Amitabh Kant said at a press conference.\n\n\"To my mind, the problem is that there's a lack of good-quality jobs, and that's what we need to focus on. There's a wages problem, and there's a very big informal sector in India's economy.\"\n\nHe said the country was creating more than 7 million jobs a year, enough for \"new entrants\" joining the workforce.\n\nMr Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party who the polls show is closing in on Mr Modi's lead in the election due by May, said the job report showed \"a national disaster\".\n\nIndia's economy has been expanding by 7 per cent plus annually - the fastest pace among major economies - bit uneven growth has meant that there are not enough new jobs to keep pace.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It was intended to increase the share of domestic manufacturing from 17 per cent of gross domestic product to about 25 per cent and create jobs for an estimated 1.2 million youth entering the market.\n\nInstead, the report showed 18.7 per cent of urban males aged 15-29 were without work, and the jobless rate for urban females the same age was 27.2 per cent.\n\nWorse, the labour force participation rate - the proportion of population working or seeking jobs - declined to 36.9 per cent in 2017/18 from 39.5 per cent in 2011/12, the report said. The comparable rate for the United States was 63.1 per cent in December.\n\nThe NITI Aayog said the government needed more quarterly data to publish a \"comparable\" jobs report.\n\nBut Mr P.C. Mohanan, who on Monday resigned as the head of the government-funded National Statistical Commission, said the standalone report for the last fiscal year should have been published.\n\n\"There's no link between this and the quarterly data,\" Mr Mohanan told Reuters. \"This report was released for approval because this is a standalone report and it does not require any additional verification with any sources.\n\nCRISIS EVERYWHERE\n\nAssociate Professor Himanshu from the New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University and who specialises on development economics, said that the jobs crisis was everywhere to see.\n\n\"News and data like thousands of PhDs applying for waiter jobs in Mumbai or millions applying for just a thousand jobs in Gujarat or 10 million applying for a small number of jobs in railways,\" he said.\n\n\"I mean, these kind of examples are everywhere,\" he said, pointing to street protests by caste and other interest groups seeking quotas for government jobs.\n\nThe data provides the first comprehensive assessment of India's employment since Mr Modi's decision in November 2016 to withdraw most of the country's banknotes from circulation overnight.\n\nAfter the chaotic launch of a national sales tax in July 2017, hundreds of thousands have lost jobs in small businesses.\n\nThe government declined to confirm or deny the findings contained in the report.\n\n\"We have not released the report. I do not want to comment on it,\" Mr Pravin Srivastava, India's chief statistician, told Reuters.\n\nBut he said the report was not final and would be released after a review.\n\nThe gloomy jobs data could be awkward for Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist government to explain with a general election looming and opinion polls already showing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party\n\nunlikely to keep its parliamentary majority\n\n.\n\n\"It's a very, very serious issue, and that is the reason why the government didn't want this data to come out in the public domain,\" said former finance minister Yashwant Sinha.\n\nA report released by the All India Manufacturers'Organisation said last month 3.5 million jobs had been lost since 2016, mainly due to demonetisation and rising working costs after the launch of the national tax.\n\nSome sociologists say that there are instances of a correlation between high unemployment and an increase in criminal behaviour.\n\n\"The anti-social activities, they have risen in many places.

The study reported 117 episodes during the 2017-18 academic year, up from 112 the year before.\n\n\"We are disheartened that the strategies we have employed have not achieved the results we had intended,\" said Ms Elizabeth Van Winkle, executive director of one of the Pentagon offices that looks into sexual assault.\n\nThe report rekindles attention on a problem that has poisoned the military as more women join the armed services. The increase in sexual assaults, as reported by the service academies, is similar to what is happening in the military as a whole, and comes at the same time.\n\nThe difference between the officially reported cases and the numbers that surfaced as a result of the anonymous survey is an explicit acknowledgment that many young men and women who are assaulted at military academies still remain silent about the crime.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Former Defence Secretary James Mattis had ordered academy leaders to focus on programmes emphasising responsible alcohol consumption and the reporting of sexual assault episodes.\n\n\"Our cadets and midshipmen must be role models if they're to lead the world's finest fighting force,\" Mr James Stewart, who is performing the duties of undersecretary of defence for personnel and readiness, said in a statement.\n\n\"This year's report demonstrates that there is more work to be done to meet this goal.\"\n\nFor the first time, the survey asked about alcohol use. It found that close to one-third of male students and 15 per cent of female students said they drank heavily.\n\nThe latest report comes two years after the Marine Corps was rocked by disclosures that an all-male, invitation-only group on Facebook called Marines United shared thousands of nude and other private photos of female Marines.\n\nThe survey found that 16.5 per cent of female cadets at West Point experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2017-18, compared with 10.2 per cent in 2015-16.\n\nThe continued increase of the numbers, despite adverse publicity in recent years, drew a sharp rebuke that the Pentagon was not taking the issue seriously.\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand said the unreported cases were \"a clear sign\" that sexual assault victims did not \"feel confident in the military's ability to adjudicate and prosecute these crimes without retaliation\".\n\n\"The answer to this scourge can't be the same answer we get every year of 'give us more time',\" Ms Gillibrand, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.\n\n\"We must stand up for survivors and fight sexual assault in the military with everything that we have.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nPentagon\n\nDefence and military\n\nSex offences\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nDon\u2019t miss $1,500 in savings with your Galaxy Z Flip7 pre-order\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nAndie Chen urged by fellow actors not to feel discouraged after Best Actor loss\n\n\u2018The news really shocked me\u2019: Singer JJ Lin on being diagnosed with a heart condition in 2024\n\nAd\n\nOwn a Coffee Machine for $1* with Nespresso Subscription\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Very comprehensive transaction.\"\n\nThe Chinese delegation has proposed to the US that Mr Trump meet Mr Xi in the tropical Chinese city of Hainan after his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in late February, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people briefed on the matter.\n\nThe White House did not immediately comment on the report.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Tariffs on China increase to 25% on March 1st, so all working hard to complete by that date!\"\n\nDeadline: March 1\n\nCabinet-level officials, led by Liu, who is Xi's top economic adviser, and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, met in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House on Wednesday with only a month left to reach a deal.\n\nDetails of the closed-door talks were scant with official statements seen as unlikely before they conclude on Thursday. A spokeswoman for the trade representative's office declined comment on the discussions.\n\nWhile a breakthrough deal is seen as unlikely from this round of negotiations, the White House has said a concluding statement will be released on the progress they've made on core issues such as Chinese technology transfers and intellectual property practices, market access and Beijing's pledge to buy more American goods.\n\nStocks in Asia and Europe advanced on Thursday, following gains in the US on Wednesday. The S&P 500 reached the highest since Dec 6, after the Federal Reserve said it will be \"patient\" on any future interest-rate moves.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday expressed concern that prolonged negotiations could cause further uncertainty for investors.\n\n\"The concern is a longer drawn-out set of negotiations, which could result in sapping business. Uncertainty is not the friend of business,\" Powell said in response to a question during a press conference.\n\nAccording to a person familiar with the meeting agenda, Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were scheduled to give opening remarks at the talks Wednesday morning. Officials also met Tuesday to hammer out preparatory work for the negotiations, but there was no report of progress on structural issues, people familiar with the talks said.\n\nUnless a deal is reached by March 1, the US has threatened to raise tariffs on\n\nUS$200 billion worth of Chinese products\n\nto 25 per cent from 10 per cent.\n\nAdministration officials and other people familiar with the state of play say the two sides remain far apart on key issues, with the US side still engaged in an internal debate over how to proceed and ill-prepared for this week's meetings.\n\nThe US's unveiling this week of criminal charges against Chinese corporate giant Huawei Technologies Co. isn't helping the mood.\n\nThe last round of US-China talks led by Deputy USTR Jeffrey Gerrish in Beijing earlier this month, ended with no progress on IP practices and technology transfer issues, which are the US's main concerns in the trade war that has roiled financial markets for months.\n\nChina did offer at that meeting to go on a six-year buying spree to ramp up imports from the US, which was met with scepticism from The Trump administration.\n\nIn a sign that Beijing is serious about addressing US complaints, Chinese lawmakers this week completed a second review of a new law that is aimed at protecting the IP of foreign investors and banning forced technology transfers. But US business groups said the draft law will not address the real regulatory issues of concern where forced technology transfer is occurring in the Chinese system.\n\nAnother longstanding concern with Chinese laws is the breadth and scope of the national security review, the US Chamber of Commerce, AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai said in comments submitted on the bill.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nTrump this month said that China's slumping economy gave the country no choice but to make serious commitments.\n\n\"China posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to US trade tensions and new policies,\" Trump said Jan 21. \"Makes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!\"\n\nBut the impact of Trump's trade policy is also being felt by the US. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office on Monday said it expected that Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum, and Chinese goods would cut the US's real gross domestic product by at least 0.1 per cent on average through 2029. It also predicted overall US GDP growth would slow to 2.3 per cent this year, 1.7 per cent in 2020, and 1.6 per cent in 2021.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS-China ties\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTrade", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/yq-dtrump-31012019.jpg?VersionId=Cd08oUX9KmOsg_It.rCaYgoetI..IRva", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

Visits are by appointment only.\n\nShrouded in secrecy, the compound has stirred unease among local residents, fuelled conspiracy theories and sparked concerns in the Trump administration about its true purpose, according to interviews with dozens of residents, current and former Argentine government officials, US officials, satellite and astronomy specialists and legal experts.\n\nThe station's stated aim is peaceful space observation and exploration and, according to Chinese media, it played a key role in China's landing of a spacecraft on the dark side of the moon in January.\n\nBut the remote 200ha compound operates with little oversight by the Argentine authorities, according to hundreds of pages of Argentine government documents obtained by Reuters and reviewed by international law experts.\n\nPresident Mauricio Macri's former foreign minister, Ms Susana Malcorra, said in an interview that Argentina has no physical oversight of the station's operations.\n\nIn 2016, she revised the China space station deal to include a stipulation it be for civilian use only.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The Patagonian station is managed by the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General (CLTC), which reports to the PLA's Strategic Support Force.\n\nBeijing insists its space programme is for peaceful purposes and its Foreign Ministry in a statement stressed the Argentine station is for civilian use only. It said the station was open to the public and media.\n\n\"The suspicions of some individuals have ulterior motives,\"the ministry said.\n\nAsked how it ensures the station is not used for military purposes, Argentina's space agency CONAE said the agreement between the two countries stated their commitment to \"peaceful use\" of the project.\n\nIt said radio emissions from the station were also monitored, but radio astronomy experts said the Chinese could easily hide illicit data in these transmissions or add encrypted channels to the frequencies agreed upon with Argentina.\n\nCONAE also said it had no staff permanently based at the station, but they made \"periodic\" trips there.\n\nSPYING CONCERNS\n\nThe United States has long been worried about what it sees as China's strategy to \"militarise\" space, according to one US official, who added there was reason to be sceptical of Beijing's insistence that the Argentine base was strictly for exploration.\n\nOther US officials who spoke to Reuters expressed similar concerns.\n\n\"The Patagonia ground station, agreed to in secret by a corrupt and financially vulnerable government a decade ago, is another example of opaque and predatory Chinese dealings that undermine the sovereignty of host nations,\" said Mr Garrett Marquis, spokesman for the White House National Security Council.\n\nSome radio astronomy experts said US concerns were overblown and the station was probably as advertised - a scientific venture with Argentina - even if its 35-metre diameter dish could eavesdrop on foreign satellites.\n\nDr Tony Beasley, director of the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory, said the station could, in theory, \"listen\" to other governments' satellites, potentially picking up sensitive data.\n\nBut that kind of listening could be done with far less sophisticated equipment.\n\n\"Anyone can do that. I can do that with a dish in my back yard, basically,\" Dr Beasley said. \"I don't know that there's anything particularly sinister or troubling about any part of China's space radio network in Argentina.\"\n\nArgentine officials have defended the Chinese station, saying the agreement with China is similar to one signed with the European Space Agency, which built a station in a neighbouring province.\n\nBoth have 50-year, tax-free leases. Argentine scientists in theory have access to 10 per cent of the antenna time at both stations.\n\nThe law experts who reviewed the documents said there is one notable difference: ESA is a civilian agency.\n\n\"All of the ESA governments play by democratic rules,\" Mr Uriburu said. \"The party is not the state. But that's not the case in China. The party is the state.\"\n\nIn the United States, Nasa, like the ESA, is a civilian agency, while the US military has its own space command for military or national security missions.\n\nIn some instances, Nasa and the military have collaborated, said Dr Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics.\n\n\"The line does blur sometimes,\" he said. \"But that's very much the exception.\"\n\nBLACK BOX\n\nIn Las Lajas, a town of 7,000 people located about 40 minutes drive from the station, the antenna is a source of bewilderment and suspicion.\n\n\"These people don't allow you access, they don't let you see,\" said shop owner Alfredo Garrido, 51. \"My opinion is that it is not a scientific research base, but rather a Chinese military base.\"\n\nAmong the wilder conspiracy theories reporters heard during a visit to the town: That the base was being used to build a nuclear bomb.\n\nThe drive from Las Lajas to the space station is barren and dusty. There are no signs indicating the station's existence.\n\nThe sprawling antenna is suddenly visible after a curve in the gravel road off the main thoroughfare. The massive dish is the only sign of human life for miles around.\n\nThe station became operational in April. Thirty Chinese employees work and live on site, which employs no locals, according to the Las Lajas mayor, Ms Maria Espinosa, adding that the station has been good for the local economy.\n\nMs Espinosa said she rented her house to Chinese space station workers before they moved to the base and had visited the site herself at least eight times.\n\nOthers in Las Lajas said they rarely see anyone from the station in town, except when the staff make a trip to its Chinese supermarket.\n\nReuters requested access to the station through CONAE, the local provincial government and China's embassy. CONAE said it was not able to approve a visit by Reuters in the short term, but it was planning a media day.\n\nIt added that students from nearby towns have already visited the compound.\n\nNO OVERSIGHT\n\nWhen Argentina's Congress debated the space station in 2015, during the presidency of Ms Cristina Fernandez, opposition lawmakers questioned why there was no stipulation that it only be for civilian use. Nonetheless, Congress approved the deal.\n\nWhen Mr Macri took office in 2015, he was worried the space station agreement did not explicitly say it should be for civilian use only, said Ms Malcorra, his then foreign minister, who flew to Beijing in 2016 to rework it.\n\nMs Malcorra said she was constrained in her ability to revise it because it had already been signed by Ms Fernandez. The Chinese, however, agreed to include the stipulation that it be for civilian use. She insisted on a press conference with her Chinese counterpart in Beijing to publicise this.\n\n\"This was something I requested to make sure there was no doubt or no hidden agenda from any side here, and that our people knew that we had done this,\" she said from her home in Spain.\n\nBut it still fell short on one key point - oversight.\n\n\"There was no way we could do that after the level of recognition that this agreement had from our side. This was recognised, accepted and approved by Congress,\" Ms Malcorra said.\n\n\"I would have written the agreement in a different way,\" she added. \"I would have clauses that articulate the access to oversight.\"\n\nMs Malcorra said she was confident that Argentina could approach China for \"reassurances\" if there was ever any doubt about activities at the station.\n\nWhen asked how Argentina would know about those activities, she said, \"There will be some people who will tell us, don't worry.\"\n\nLOGGING VISITORS\n\nThe opaqueness of the station's operations and the reluctance of Argentine officials to talk about it makes it hard to determine who exactly has visited the compound.\n\nA provincial government official provided Reuters a list of local journalists who had toured the facility.\n\nA number appeared to have visited on a single day in February 2017, 14 months before it became operational, a review of their stories and social media postings showed.\n\nAside from Ms Espinosa, the mayor of Las Lajas, no one else interviewed by Reuters in town had toured the station.\n\nResident Matias Uran, 24, however, said his sister was among a group of students who visited last year. They saw a dining room and a games room, he said.\n\nMr Alberto Hugo Amarilla, 60, who runs a small hotel in Las Lajas, recalled a dinner he attended shortly after construction began at the site.\n\nThere, he said, a Chinese official in town to visit the site greeted him enthusiastically. His fellow dinner guests told him the official had learned that Mr Amarilla was a retired army officer.\n\nThe official, they said, was a Chinese general.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nArgentina\n\nSpace and cosmos\n\nDefence and military", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/yq-argspacestation-31012019.jpg?VersionId=Ds2WW.5bsGNh7H8yhx69_7TpSiNPd9KO", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

The WIC provides greater assurance in the event employers are unable to pay compensation.\n\nThe proposed changes, which are open for public feedback, would mean non-manual employees not working in factories and who earn up to $2,600 are also covered by WIC.\n\nThe Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a statement on Thursday (Jan 31): \"While the proposed amendments may lead to higher WIC insurance premiums, the incremental cost is estimated to be manageable (at less than 0.01 per cent of annual total labour cost), with greater impact to companies with more injury claims.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Only injured employees on medical leave are now compensated with their average monthly earnings.\n\nBut the ministry said it \"intends to expand compensation to those placed on light duties as a result of work injury, such that they are no worse off than those given medical leave\".\n\nThe Act will also increase its maximum compensation levels by at least 10 per cent to keep pace with wage growth and rising medical costs.\n\nAn injured employee in the future will receive up to $45,000 within a year from the date of accident in medical expenses, up from $36,000 now.\n\nProcessing claims should also be faster with the proposed changes.\n\nSince most injuries show their final extent within six months after an accident, compensation can be made based on that assessment. Claims made will also be processed by default, instead of getting the employee to file a claim separately.\n\nAbout 1,300 claims a year, or 24 per cent of valid permanent incapacity claims, still take longer than six months to reach their conclusion, the MOM noted.\n\nIt added that future compensation can be made based on a multiple of the employee's basic monthly salary, a move that would reduce the delays from disputes over the salary used as the basis for compensation.\n\nSome insurers will be licensed to sell and process all insured claims under the Act. WIC insurers now process only temporary incapacity claims while the MOM processes death and permanent incapacity claims.\n\nThe maximum fines for employers delaying or avoiding compensation will also be increased from $10,000 to $15,000.\n\nThe public consultation document outlining the proposed changes can be accessed on the Reach website to Feb 25.\n\nSee more on\n\nLabour issues\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Fold7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nCuomo to stay in New York mayoral race despite losing Democratic primary\n\n\u2018The news really shocked me\u2019: Singer JJ Lin on being diagnosed with a heart condition in 2024\n\nAd\n\nOwn a Coffee Machine for $1* with Nespresso Subscription\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

The real problem seems to be the fact that South Korea is still very much Korea-centric.\n\nYes, we have come a very long way in opening up and, in some ways, South Korea is one of the most globalised countries in the world. It is not afraid of new things or new trends.\n\nWe have opened up to and accept the idea that despite having been homogeneous for such a long time, foreign nationals will and must become a part of the culture.\n\nMore and more policies are being created to support multicultural families, and Koreans are going everywhere to build companies, befriend new people and become part of the culture there.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Yet.\n\nPart of the reason is because they are constantly weighed down in domestic politics. They consequently become obsessed with how they are presented on their home turf.\n\nBut we still have hope. South Korea is known for its fast-paced change and its willingness to adopt next-generation technology. It always takes a bit of a struggle - sometimes more than that - but in the end, it has always pulled through.\n\nThe key is to focus on how we can go forward, and not backward, which is what politics does so much of the time.\n\nWho is at fault for what, who is running in which district and why are only some of the things that should be on our agenda.\n\nThe bigger emphasis should be on how we can use all this to move forward - into a future to be defined by a \"fifth industrial revolution,\" by a society where people can live without the fear of nuclear weapons, with less discrimination and more equality.\n\nIsn't that what we are all working toward?\n\nSo, let's send the message to the outside world that we are up to things other than North Korea, other than adjusting voting districts, or the number of parliamentary seats, or bashing Samsung or vice versa.\n\nSend the message that it's a good idea to do business with South Korea, to come to South Korea and to be with South Koreans.\n\nSure, sometimes it feels like we are bending over backwards, but as a country where two-thirds of our gross domestic product depends on exports, unless we find reliable sources of energy or some other system that can independently keep us afloat, we need to go to the next level of globalisation.\n\nMs Kim Ji-hyun is editor of The Investor desk at The Korea Herald.

In 2016, Singapore's Health Promotion Board cited studies by the Harvard School of Public Health in the United States which showed that each plate of white rice eaten daily on a regular basis raises the risk of diabetes by 11 per cent in the overall population.\n\nIn one study, researchers from NUS and Duke-NUS Medical School found no link between the quantity of white rice consumed and the risk of Type 2 diabetes when controlled for other variables like age, sex and body mass index (BMI), and various other food intakes.\n\nType 2 diabetes is related to weight management, and is a result of blocked or reduced insulin receptors. Over 90 per cent of diabetics suffer from Type 2 diabetes.\n\n\"Even over a relatively wide range of rice intakes, from half a bowl to several bowls a day, we didn't see much of an increase in the risk of diabetes,\" said Professor Rob Martinus van Dam, domain leader of epidemiology at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health in NUS and one of the study's co-authors.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Others may eat more meat to feel full.\n\nThese increase their risk of diabetes.\n\nSubstituting rice with whole grains, on the other hand, decreases the risk.\n\nAnother study, also involving Prof van Dam and Prof Koh, used established diet quality indices to determine the overall \"quality\" of a person's dietary pattern.\n\nThey then measured the link between diet quality and diabetes risk.\n\nA list of 165 food items and beverages were identified, covering an estimated 90 per cent of what is commonly eaten by the population in Singapore.\n\nIt is the first such study to examine local food specifically.\n\nThe researchers said the study found that whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and a moderate amount of dairy were associated with lower risks of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke, in line with other established dietary studies from mostly Western countries.\n\nSugar-sweetened drinks, processed meat and red meat - including beef, pork and even the darker portions of poultry like chicken thigh meat - were found to be associated with higher risks of the same diseases.\n\nThe items were scored according to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (Dash) diet index.\n\nThe proportion of each item as a part of a consistent dietary pattern was found to be more important than the absolute intake, said Prof Koh, who is also the principal investigator in the Singapore Chinese Health Study.\n\nThis means one does not have to cut out unhealthy foods like red meat entirely, as long as they are eaten in moderation, she added.\n\nAbout 45,400 Chinese Singaporeans who did not have diabetes, cancer or cardiovascular diseases were recruited between 1993 and 1998 for the Singapore Chinese Health Study.\n\nDetails about their diets were collected through questionnaires during two follow-up interviews. Over an average of 11 years, more than 5,200 developed diabetes.\n\nThis data was then used in the two recent studies.\n\nThe participants' diets were ranked according to how often and how much of a given food they ate on average.\n\nThose who ate relatively more whole grains, low-fat dairy, nuts, seeds, legumes, fruits and vegetables were given higher scores.\n\nThose who had more processed and red meats, sugary drinks and sodium in their diets were given lower scores.\n\nOther foods like fish and refined grains, including white rice, were not scored under the Dash index.\n\nThe researchers found that the top 20 per cent of the participants, who had relatively \"higher quality\" diets, were nearly 30 per cent less likely to develop diabetes compared to the bottom 20 per cent.\n\nDr Annie Ling, group director of policy, research and surveillance at the Health Promotion Board, said the studies are timely given the findings of the recent National Nutrition Survey 2018.\n\nThe survey showed gradual improvements in Singaporeans' dietary habits but highlighted areas for improvement.\n\nShe said: \"While Singaporeans are consuming more whole grains, fruits and vegetables, high sugar and sodium intake remains a cause for concern.\n\n\"It is important to continue encouraging Singaporeans to pay attention to the foods they choose and the quality of their diets.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nDiabetes\n\nDuke-NUS Medical School\n\nNUS\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nOwn your new iPhone from just $36/mth with Star Plan.\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nFormer NCT member Taeil sentenced to 3\u00bd years for rape\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Lavrov meets China\u2019s President Xi\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Flip7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/jtrice310119.jpg?VersionId=82cHTyvr22UfxwaJzW6ZsdgAG3cM_qB_", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

Course fees start from $193.60 for Singaporeans, and students can finish both modules in four weeks.\n\nThe new modules are just one of a string of new initiatives that FLIP will launch this year, in a bid to bring about more innovation and change to the legal sector.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Brochez, who lived in Singapore since January 2008, was jailed 28 months for forging his qualifications and for lying about his HIV status. He was deported from the island last April. The Singaporean doctor who was Brochez's partner\n\nwill stand trial for drug-related charges on May 29\n\n.

But two years of controversy about cosy dealings has laid the iconic banker low. After appearing to have won board support to continue in her role, Kochchar has been fired by the ICICI board with retroactive effect, reports the Times of India. The paper said she will need to repay 100 million Rupees (US$1.4 million) received as bonus since 2009, as well as forego stock options currently valued at 3.46 billion rupees. The move follows a report by a retired Supreme Court judge who apparently upheld allegations that she violated the bank's lending codes when ICICI loaned money to Videocon Group, an electronics company. Kochchar had been on 'leave' since last June pending the inquiry, and resigned her position in October.\n\nKochchar, the first woman to lead an Indian bank, was quoted as saying she was \"disappointed, hurt and shocked\" by the decision.\n\nFLY, HANEDA!\n\nGood news for air travellers to Tokyo - now, airlines can plan more flights to Haneda Airport, rather than to the more-distant Narita. That's because Japan and the US have reached a basic agreement on the use of new routes for commercial flights in the U.S. military-controlled airspace over part of Tokyo and its surrounding areas, Kyodo reported. With this agreement, arrival and departure slots for international flights at Tokyo's Haneda airport are expected to expand by half from the current 60,000 annually, Kyodo said. The airspace west of Haneda has been managed by US forces at Yokota Air Base since World War II and overflight restrictions forced carriers to go elsewhere or fly prescribed altitudes, inconveniencing them. Since the new routes will be set over central Tokyo, some residents are concerned about excessive noise and potential safety risks, Kyodo noted.\n\nJUST DON'T, NIKE\n\nIndonesian Muslims are taking a long look at their Air Max Nike's and some are not liking what they see.

Some 16,000 have signed it.\n\nNike denied allegations it intentionally insulted the Muslim community, saying the logo was a \"stylised representation of Nike's Air Max trademark\" and had no religious significance.\n\nThat's it for today, folks.\n\n- Ravi Velloor\n\nOTHER DEVELOPMENTS\n\n- Malaysia on Thursday\n\ninstalled the sports-loving Sultan of Pahang,\n\nAbdullah Ri'ayatuddin, as the country's new King\n\nafter the last monarch abdicated in a historic first following his reported marriage to a former Russian beauty queen.\n\n- Indonesia is battling a severe outbreak of deadly dengue, a mosquito-borne disease.\n\nMore than 13,000 cases have been reported in January,\n\ntwice that of the matching month last year and 133 have died, three times the fatalities recorded in January, 2018.\n\n- The 3-metre long python caught in front of Tang Plaza, a fashionable mall in Singapore's Orchard Road shopping district, has drawn a lot of reactions.

Some 12 per cent has gone to incinerators and the bulk ends up in landfills, dumps or in the natural environment.\n\nThe world body has warned that unless proper, better-orchestrated measures are taken, the seas would contain more plastic than fish by 2050.\n\nIndonesia still struggles with its draft guidelines to support the government's effort to phase out single-use plastic in 10 years starting at its sources. It already missed its own deadline last year and has yet to come up with a new timeframe.\n\nIn fact, Indonesia already has a law on waste management in place, but it was passed in 2008 when plastic pollution was not a popular concern.\n\nBesides, plastic is but one of numerous, equally dangerous pollutants such as oil and untreated industrial chemicals that are dumped into bodies of water.\n\nIndonesia's commitment to slash plastic waste by 70 per cent in the coming eight years as promised by Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Pandjaitan during the 2017 UN Ocean Conference in New York is notable.\n\nAs one of the conference vice-presidents, Indonesia would have to answer questions about its progress meeting this pledge.\n\nDrastic measures involving all stakeholders are needed for Indonesia to honour this big commitment.\n\nIndustries - from food suppliers and convenience stores to plastic makers - must act to reduce the use of plastics.\n\nThe government should offer incentives to recycling industries, phase out certain plastic products and conduct public awareness campaigns.\n\nCivil society initiatives encouraging restaurants, bars and coffeehouses deserve the support of the government and the public alike.\n\nKudos should also go to progressive local administrations that have introduced by-laws to restrict single-use plastics without awaiting the central government's guidelines, which are to materialise only God knows when.\n\nThe Jakarta Post is a member of The Straits Times media partner Asia News Network, an alliance of 23 news media organisations.\n\nSee more on\n\nEditorial Notes\n\nAsia Report\n\nIndonesia\n\nEnvironmental issues\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Fold7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nWhich floor is this?

Her employer was later arrested.\n\nMr Duterte responded with anger,\n\nbarring Filipinos from taking new jobs in Kuwait\n\nand calling on those working there to return home. Kuwait later expelled the Philippine ambassador, after embassy staff members attempted what they called rescues of Filipino maids who they said had been abused.\n\nThe countries settled their differences in May, with Kuwait agreeing to provide better protection to domestic workers from the Philippines.\n\nAbout 10 million Filipinos - roughly 10 per cent of the population - live and work abroad, many of them as maids. About 2.3 million work in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nMigrante International, an advocacy group for migrants worldwide, called the woman executed in Saudi Arabia \"another casualty of the Philippine government's decades-old labour export programme\".\n\nIt said Mr Duterte's government \"really has no intention of assuming full responsibility\" for the welfare of overseas workers.\n\nSaudi Arabia executed a maid from Indonesia in October, leading to protests from that country's government, which said that neither it nor the woman's family had been notified beforehand.\n\nIndonesia also sends many domestic workers to the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nA rights group said the Indonesian maid, Tuti Tursilawati, had killed her employer while defending herself from sexual assault.\n\nSee more on\n\nPhilippines\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nDeath penalty/Capital punishment\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Fold7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nAndie Chen urged by fellow actors not to feel discouraged after Best Actor loss\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Lavrov meets China\u2019s President Xi\n\nAd\n\nCurrency Volatility is Rising: Find Out How to Safeguard Your Business\n\nRead more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Trump is scheduled to meet Liu at 3.30pm US time (4.30am Singapore time), according to an e-mail of his schedule from the White House.\n\nWhile a breakthrough deal is seen as unlikely from this round of negotiations, the White House has said a concluding statement will be released on the progress they've made on core issues such as Chinese technology transfers and intellectual property practices, market access and Beijing's pledge to buy more American goods.\n\nStocks in Asia and Europe advanced on Thursday, following gains in the US on Wednesday. The S&P 500 reached the highest since Dec 6, after the Federal Reserve said it will be \"patient\" on any future interest-rate moves.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday expressed concern that prolonged negotiations could cause further uncertainty for investors. \"The concern is a longer drawn-out set of negotiations, which could result in sapping business. Uncertainty is not the friend of business,\" Powell said in response to a question during a press conference.\n\nThe talks\n\nbegan with an awkward silence\n\non both sides of a long negotiating table during a photo opportunity, broken when Lighthizer made joking remarks about table positioning and appearing in photographs of a dinner between Trump and Chinese Xi in that December meeting.\n\nSeated next to Liu was People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang, a reform-minded official who has advocated further opening of China's financial services markets, with officials from the Finance and Commerce ministries also present.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

China did offer at that meeting to go on a six-year buying spree to ramp up imports from the US, which was met with scepticism from the Trump administration.\n\nIn a sign that Beijing is serious about addressing US complaints, Chinese lawmakers this week completed a second review of a new law that is aimed at protecting the IP of foreign investors and banning forced technology transfers.\n\nBut US business groups said the draft law will not address the real regulatory issues of concern where forced technology transfer is occurring in the Chinese system. Another longstanding concern with Chinese laws is the breadth and scope of the national security review, the US Chamber of Commerce, AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai said in comments submitted on the Bill.\n\nECONOMIC IMPACT\n\nTrump this month said that China's slumping economy gave the country no choice but to make serious commitments. \"China posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to US trade tensions and new policies,\" Trump said Jan 21. \"Makes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!\"\n\nBut the impact of Trump's trade policy is also being felt by the US. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office on Monday said it expected that Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminium, and Chinese goods would cut the US real gross domestic product by at least 0.1 per cent on average through 2029. It also predicted overall US GDP growth would slow to 2.3 per cent this year, 1.7 per cent in 2020, and 1.6 per cent in 2021.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS-China ties\n\nTrade war\n\nDonald Trump\n\nChina\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet it from $36/mth with StarHub\u2019s SIM Only 5G Star Plan.\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nAndie Chen urged by fellow actors not to feel discouraged after Best Actor loss\n\nUS appeals court temporarily blocks bid to end Afghans\u2019 protected status in America\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Fold7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

His oldest daughter turned 29 and he could not wish her a happy birthday - the first time ever.\n\nDespite his detention, he also declared his love for Japan and for Nissan, to which he \"dedicated so many years to revive... to rebuild it again, to turn it into a powerhouse\".\n\nAnd for the first time, he provided a thorough account of his conditions.\n\nA light on constantly while sleeping. No watch and \"no sense of time\". Half an hour a day to pace around on the roof. He said he was \"craving\" fresh air.\n\n\"Yes I am strong but obviously I am tired,\" he said.\n\nThe detention centre itself was lightly guarded, with neither barbed wire nor officers outside - more like a hospital than a building holding people on death row.\n\nVisitors waiting to see loved ones sat calmly on chairs, in front of a big screen showing cookery programmes or debates in the Japanese Parliament.\n\nJust near the entrance sat a small shop selling produce for detainees.\n\nHere could be found all types of reading matter to while away the time: manga, sport, magazines featuring scantily clad women. All of it was only in Japanese.\n\nAll types of snacks were available, along with blankets for chilly prisoners.\n\nAs in the majority of Japanese public areas, the guards and shop staff were polite to a fault.\n\nTo enter the prison, visitors first fill out a form - Name Of Inmate: Carlos Ghosn. The reporters were assigned visitor number 117.\n\nAfter a short wait, personal effects were placed in a locker, leaving the two reporters only with pen and paper - no dictaphone or other recording device were allowed.\n\nThe two reporters were not even accompanied as they made their way along a grey-walled corridor up to the 10th floor for the interview.\n\nA guard showed the way and quickly the journalists found themselves about a metre away from one of the world's most famous prisoners, separated only by a thin screen.\n\nIn only 15 minutes, Ghosn covered an enormous amount of ground, taking about his love for his family, Japan and Nissan, but also his sense of betrayal and his difficult conditions.\n\nRefusing him bail for such a long period \"would not be normal in any other democracy of the world\", he charged.\n\nThe 15 minutes passed in an instant. The reporters tried to sneak in a final question but Ghosn was gently ushered to the exit.\n\n\"Come and see me again soon!\" he chirped, before being led back to his cell.\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nCourt trials\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Flip7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Lavrov meets China\u2019s President Xi\n\nWhich floor is this?

We state this not just with sorrow, but with deep concern for the fate of the treaty, for the fate of European and international security,\" Ryabkov said.\n\nDuring the conference with the other Security Council nations in Beijing, Ryabkov said bilateral dialogue was stalling on certain topics as one party was \"intentionally\" refusing to pursue discussions - a thinly veiled reference to the United States.\n\n\"Russia can't be blamed for anything. We are always ready for dialogue on all topics, including the most difficult current issues, and to be fully transparent.

He has already lost his business empire. But the\n\nbattle to clear his name is just beginning\n\n.\n\nTotally at ease among the champagne receptions of the world's elite at Davos and on the red carpet at the Cannes film festival, Ghosn came to epitomise \"globalisation\".\n\nA polyglot and holder of three passports, he wrote in an autobiography that \"just as globalisation and identity describe Nissan, they also perfectly express my life\".\n\nBorn Carlos Ghosn Bichara in Brazil on March 9, 1954, to Lebanese parents, he moved as a toddler back to Lebanon where he was educated in a multicultural Jesuit school by teachers from France, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.\n\nHe completed his education in France, where he gained citizenship, and lived for many years in the United States.\n\n'FIX THE COMPANY'\n\nAt the age of 24, he was recruited by tyre firm Michelin where he embarked on a brilliant career and earned his nickname as a \"cost killer\".\n\nHe moved to Renault in 1996, bringing a brutal early-rising work ethic to the French firm and again slashing costs wherever possible.\n\nIn 1999, he took a massive gamble on the struggling Nissan with a mandate to turn it around.\n\nA self-confessed \"inflexible\" boss, he ordered a series of \"sacrifices\" - five factories closed, 20,000 jobs cut.\n\nAfter a \"honeymoon period when he was admired and seen as a hero\", his authoritarian methods began to grate, according to employees.\n\nGhosn himself said he did everything he could to ingratiate himself with Nissan.\n\n\"For the general shareholders meeting, I had practised bowing at 30 and 60 degrees. But I was there for one reason: to fix the company.\"\n\nTensions mounted when he became head of Renault in 2005 and he added a third hat by becoming chairman of Mitsubishi Motors in 2017 - earning him millions of euros per year.\n\nLavish displays of wealth did not endear him to the Japanese, where corporate bosses tend to be less well compensated than their western counterparts.\n\nIn 2016, he threw a huge party at the Palace of Versailles outside Paris, complete with actors dressed in period costume.\n\nFrom the vast platters of fresh fruit at that reception to the rice-based diet at his detention centre, it has been a rude fall from grace.\n\nGhosn is convinced he is the victim of a \"plot\" by Nissan executives to oust him and strenuously denies the charges he faces of under-reporting his salary and seeking to transfer personal investment losses to company books.\n\n\"Is it a trap? Is it a plot? It's obvious: it's a story of betrayal,\" Ghosn said in his AFP interview.\n\n'UNPLANNED PATH'\n\nHis son Anthony Ghosn, 24, has painted a picture of a devoted family man.\n\nIn an interview just ahead of his father's sole court appearance so far, Ghosn junior said: \"He takes his role as a father even more seriously than his role as head of a major company.\"\n\n\"For him, family is always the priority.\"\n\nGhosn senior said not being able to speak to his family and missing his daughter's birthday for the first time were the hardest parts of his detention.\n\n\"What will I do next?\" Ghosn mused in 2017.\n\nThe answer: spend more time with his family and grandchildren.\n\nHe also hoped to teach or support other businesses, harnessing his extraordinary experience in the corporate world.\n\n\"I won't settle in one place. I will travel all over the world. I cannot conceive of spending all my time in just one country,\" he said.\n\nNow, in a bid to win bail, he has assured the court he would stay in Tokyo and await trial, offering to wear an ankle bracelet if necessary - a device never used in Japan.\n\nIn his only public appearance since his arrest, he was led into court with a rope around his waist and wearing plastic slippers. He was noticeably slimmer but seemed healthy.\n\nHe has faced adversity before - at the age of two, he accidentally drank some unboiled water and nearly died. He has talked of ups and downs in prison - and in life.\n\n\"Life has a way of following its own unplanned path,\" he once wrote.\n\nBut he could scarcely have imagined the route it would take over the past two months.\n\nSee more on\n\nAutomobile sector\n\nCourt trials\n\nJapan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/ak_ghosn_3101.jpg?VersionId=iqK2fxzvdT1ivw1TYcbJLUybS_DHqxUy", "alt_text": null}]}

Commanders answer for the training and safety of their men. To do so, commanders have to be fully committed and be personally and intimately involved in their units' training, operations and safety.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

He was crushed between the gun barrel of the howitzer and its cabin.\n\nLG Ong also said the reduction in training tempo will free up capacity as well for units to give more time to prepare for, execute and learn from each training activity.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Force and service chiefs, with commanders at all levels, will visit the ground more often to ensure that SAF training is safe, Mindef added in its statement.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nSAF\n\nDefence and military\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Flip7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUS appeals court temporarily blocks bid to end Afghans\u2019 protected status in America\n\nLurid tale of China\u2019s cross-dressing \u2018red uncle\u2019 goes viral online\n\nAd\n\nUpgrade now.

Amtrak suspended service into and out of Chicago, and thousands of flights were cancelled at O'Hare and Midway airports.\n\nEven the US Postal Service suspended service.\n\nThe polar plunge set a record low on Wednesday. The temperature reached -31 deg C at O'Hare International Airport, with a wind chill of 47 deg C below zero, according to the National Weather Service. That shattered the previous mark of -26 deg C set in 1966.\n\n\"Today's about as cold as it can get in Chicago,\" said Mr Matt Friedlein, a meteorologist with the weather service.\n\nAnd the wrath of the polar vortex has not yet passed. The all-time record low temperature for Chicago, -33 deg C, was in play overnight into Thursday, weather forecasters said, and temperatures were not expected to visit zero or above until Thursday night. Normal highs are not expected until Saturday.\n\nWith schools shuttered and many businesses and government offices closed because of the extreme conditions, most people heeded weather and health experts' advice, staying inside, huddling up at home with a good book, binge-worthy television or stir-crazy children.\n\nChicago Public Schools cancelled all classes and activities that were scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. Most schools and some churches and other institutions have been listing closings on the Emergency Closing Centre website. Most colleges, courts, cultural institutions and libraries were closed on Wednesday, and many plan to be closed on Thursday morning as well.\n\nParts of the South Side in Chicago looked like ghost towns as normally crowded outdoor Metra platforms were empty and Red Line stations were abandoned. Churches, daycare centres, banks, nail shops and hair salons posted closed for business signs on their doors.\n\nBut elsewhere, life went on, especially for those who had to work.\n\nTrucks rumbled over salt-covered roads delivering groceries and supplies, many fast-food places, grocery stores and pharmacies throughout the city and suburbs were open, and auto supply stores did brisk business.\n\nMr Willie Taylor nursed a cup of coffee in the McDonald's lobby in Englewood. He said his wife needed to report to her job at a local grocery store, so he got up early to get the car warmed up and drive her there.\n\n\"I came out to crank the car and I've been moving around ever since,\" said the 71-year-old Auburn Gresham resident. \"You've got to move around in this weather. You can't just stand in one place.\"\n\nMs Rebecca Steinmann, an emergency department nurse at Lurie Children's Hospital, was not taking any chances. She had her husband drive her to the station from her house eight blocks away, even though she was armoured against the cold with thermal underwear, hand warmers and toe warmers. She was hopeful she would not see many cold-related injuries when she arrived at work.\n\nWith most people holed up inside, the effects of the cold initially appeared to be minimal, according to area hospital and health officials. Chicago hospitals saw 14 emergency department visits for frostbite and/or hypothermia between 5.30am on Tuesday and 5.30am on Wednesday, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n\nAcross the rest of the state, hospital emergency departments had 16 visits for those conditions between 2am on Tuesday and 10am on Wednesday.\n\nLoyola University Medical Centre in Maywood had six cases of frostbite as of late Wednesday morning - a higher-than-usual number for a winter day, spokesman Jim Ritter said. But many hospitals across the Chicago area reported relatively quiet emergency departments overnight on Tuesday and Wednesday morning.\n\nThe city and collar counties set up warming shelters for those in need, and city officials reminded landlords to keep the heat on at apartments across the area. Chicago's Department of Buildings took action on Wednesday to restore heat at four properties in neighbourhoods across the city.\n\nThe city provided official warming centres, but the dangerously cold weather gave some community organisers and volunteers a chance to use their skills in a new way. Two warming centres operated by the city's Department of Family and Support Services will be open 24 hours. On the South Side, the King Centre is at 4314 S. Cottage Grove Ave., in Bronzeville, and on the West Side the Garfield Centre is at 10 S.Kedzie Ave., in the Fifth City neighbourhood.\n\nSenior centres across the city have extended hours to 8pm. An additional 500 beds were being sent to shelters. The city is also coordinating with religious leaders to reach out to vulnerable people, including senior citizens and those with disabilities, city officials said. Park District field houses, which often have evening hours, are for the first time this winter formally among the buildings being used as warming centres.\n\nAt Lincoln United Methodist Church in Pilsen, three women transformed the basement space normally used for exercise classes for Healthy Hood Chicago into a sleeping and warming shelter. Dozens of men piled in, laying on pallets of blankets, watching TV and eating beans and salad and sipping coffee.\n\nFor Ms Laundi Keepseagle, 28, the grassroots effort was a way to serve an overlooked population.\n\n\"We wanted undocumented individuals to have a place to go,\" said Ms Keepseagle, who works with SaveMoneySaveLife, an advocacy group supported by rapper Vic Mensa.\n\n\"We thought we could create a space for people who fall in the gaps. We're serving food, giving out clothes. Our main purpose is to make our guests feel at home.\"\n\nThe effort came together in hours on Tuesday. Volunteers posted on social media, canvassed the neighbourhood with fliers and did one-on-one outreach with residents they saw camping on the streets.\n\nBy Tuesday night, 34 people showed up to sleep on the floor and get a meal. On Wednesday, there were nearly 60 people staying there.\n\nThe cold led to a wave of power outages, downtown and in the suburbs.\n\nA portion of the Loop lost power at 1.20pm because of an outage, according to ComEd. The outage affected about 400 customers in an area near Monroe Street and Wabash Avenue. Earlier in the day, as many as 25,000 ComEd customers in the city and suburbs were without power for a time, ComEd spokesman John Schoen said.\n\nAmtrak cancelled Chicago-area service for Wednesday and expected to halt most trains for Thursday also. The South Shore Line suspended service on Wednesday. Metra announced the agency was honouring South Shore tickets, according to its website. On the CTA, the Yellow Line, which travels to suburban Skokie, experienced delays because of signal problems.\n\nAt Chicago airports, more than 1,700 flights were cancelled as of about 1pm on Wednesday, according to the city's Aviation Department.\n\nAfter about 1,400 flights were cancelled on Monday at Chicago airports because of snowstorms, about 600 were cancelled on Tuesday.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nWeather", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/sl_chicago_251218_31.jpg?VersionId=P8J6uedQcu9X3Szwr.2D8_izu24e87xg", "alt_text": null}]}

A net weighted balance of 14 per cent of manufacturers anticipated a less favourable business situation from January to June this year, according to the Economic Development Board (EDB). This is much gloomier than the outlook expressed in the previous quarterly survey, where a net weighted balance of just 1 per cent of manufacturers expected buisiness to weaken.\n\nThe net weighted balance is the difference between the proportion of optimistic and pessimistic firms polled by the two agencies.\n\nThe same is true for the services sector, with a net weighted balance of 4 per cent of firms expecting business conditions to worsen in the same time period, another survey by the Department of Statistics (SingStat) showed.\n\nThis is the first time since the second quarter of 2017 that overall business sentiment among services firms slipped into pessimism.\n\nMost industries in the manufacturing sector were downbeat. Sentiment was especially poor among the electronics industry, with a net weighted balance of 45 per cent of firms anticipating conditions to worsen in January to June this year compared to October to December 2018.\n\nEDB also highlighted the weaker sentiment among precision engineering firms, as they foresee weaker orders amid softening demand for semiconductors, their related equipment, as well as mounting worries over global trade tensions.\n\nOn balance, 24 per cent of precision engineering firms were less optimistic about the first half of this year relative to the last quarter in 2018.\n\nHowever, EDB's survey also showed some positivity among industries in the biomedical manufacturing and the transport engineering industries.\n\nBiomedical firms were bullish about their prospects, with a net weighted balance of 6 per cent foreseeing a favourable operating environment in the next six months, as exports of medical technology are expected to remain strong in this sector.\n\nIn the transport engineering industry, a net weighted balance of 4 per cent of firms also expect conditions to improve.\n\nThis is mainly due to the marine and offshore engineering firms, as they predict a continual modest uptick in demand for oil and gas field equipment and ship repairing activities in the first half of 2019.\n\nOverall, a net weighted balance of 2 per cent of manufacturers expect output to decrease in the first quarter this year.\n\nWithin the services sector, firms in the accommodation, transport and storage, wholesale trade, real estate and financial and insurance industries predict slower business in January to June this year, compared with July to December last year.\n\nFirms in accommodation, transport and storage saw the biggest dip in confidence, though that could be due to comparison with the latter half of 2018, which coincides with the year-end and festive holiday season, said SingStat.\n\nThe wholesale trade, and the financial and insurance industry, were also pessimistic in the light of the ongoing United States-China trade conflict, which could have a negative impact on their businesses.\n\nOn the other hand, firms in the information and communications industry expect business prospects to improve, especially those engaged in computer consultancy and web portal services.\n\nFirms in the food and beverage services industry expect more favourable business situation. Within the industry, fast food outlets and food caterers are among those that expect business conditions to improve over the next six months.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore economic data\n\nManufacturing\n\nServices sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/sl_sg_251218_33.jpg?VersionId=eXL92AipLr9oyO7y9_EzFh9WP0OdRLQZ", "alt_text": null}]}

Last year, it had none.\n\nThen there were the closures, most notably that of Singapore's only three-Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon Restaurant.\n\nBut RWS' latest, Table65, helmed by Dutch chef Richard van Oostenbrugge, could restore the shine.\n\nHe was a chef at the two-starred Bord'Eau Restaurant Gastronomique and his new restaurant in Amsterdam, Restaurant 212, was recently awarded a star by the Michelin Guide.\n\nTable65 is for those who want fine dining without the stuffiness. The service is excellent, the place looks amazing and you get tableside light displays worthy of a Universal Studios ride.\n\nYou can choose between an eight-course Experiential Menu ($218)and a five-course Discovery Menu ($148), or order from the a la carte menu if you're a small eater.\n\nIt does overwhelm, but the moment you are perched on the stool and the light switch is on, it's all systems go.\n\nIt begins with a trio of fish, with cold smoked horse mackerel, jelly of tomato consomme with marinated anchovy and cured mackerel.\n\nThe first taste of the glorious jelly sets the tone, jolting me with its brightness.\n\nThe 'Os a moelle' ($29) is a visual treat, with veal tartare encased in a translucent bone made out of the concentrated stock of smoked herring.\n\nFor additional luxury, it is topped with Beluga caviar.\n\nThe Ravioli of Belon oyster ($42) may not be as pretty, but it is superior in taste.\n\nThe veloute sauce has to work hard to pull off the marriage with veal shank, shellfish juice and oyster puree, but the pleasant hint of hazelnut does come through.

In some cases, Chinese fishing boats flew the North's national flag in an attempt to disguise themselves.\n\nThe latest revelation is based on details in the report, a copy of which has been obtained by The Yomiuri Shimbun.\n\nThe panel of experts is tasked with monitoring the implementation of UN sanctions against the North. Every March, it publishes an annual report that calls attention to North Korean attempts to skirt the sanctions.\n\nThe panel's previous reports have found that North Korea violated sanctions in its exports of coal, imports of refined petroleum and assistance to Syria, a nation suspected of chemical weapons use.\n\nFrom January to November 2018, more than 15 Chinese fishing ships operating in the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea and elsewhere were confirmed to possess North Korean fishing licenses, according to information in the forthcoming report provided by two UN member states.\n\nThrough testimony obtained from Chinese fishery operators, the panel learned that about 200 Chinese fishing boats are operating in waters around North Korea, and that fishing licenses are sold for about 810,000 Japanese yen (S$10,023) per month. The testimony has also shed light on the practice of Chinese fishery operators purchasing licenses through intermediaries. Some Chinese vessels carried the North Korean national flag in an attempt to pass themselves off as ships from the North.\n\nNorth Korea is said to have begun selling fishing rights several years ago. In August 2017, the Security Council adopted a resolution imposing a total ban on North Korean exports of marine products, stating the country's sale of fishing rights was a measure to obtain foreign currency. Another resolution adopted in December that year confirmed that the sale of fishing rights falls under exports of marine products, making clear that such sales are the target of sanctions.\n\nIn response to an inquiry about Chinese fishing boats holding North Korean fishing rights, the Chinese government told the panel that it quickly issued the required notice after the council adopted the resolution to ban the sale of fishing rights, according to the report. Beijing also said that Chinese corporations have stopped purchasing fishing rights from the North, the report said.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea's National Intelligence Service reported to the legislature in 2016 that the North had sold fishing rights to about 1,500 Chinese fishing boats that year, a three-fold increase from the average year, adding that the country had earned about US$30 million (S$40.4 million) from the sales.\n\nThe Japanese government is also aware of the situation. In a speech before a ministerial-level meeting of the UN Security Council in September 2018, Foreign Minister Taro Kono cited the sale of fishing rights as an example of cunning attempts by the North to evade UN sanctions.\n\nA US report on North Korean attempts to evade sanctions is also attached to the forthcoming report. The US document states that the North imported refined petroleum products on at least 148 occasions from January to August 2018, using illicit ship-to-ship transfers in international waters.\n\nIf all of these cargoes were fully loaded, the amount of imported petroleum would be about six times the upper limit set under the resolutions, according to the panel's estimate. The figure was determined by updating the data that the United States submitted to the panel in July last year.\n\nThe report concludes that North Korea has continued to defy UN resolutions.\n\nSee more on\n\nUN\n\nNorth Korea\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/yq-nkflag-31012019_2x_2x.jpg?VersionId=6sBIqSTEEFs1L6FfwrNVmRZD7bOQTKVx", "alt_text": null}]}

In total about 373 have said they'll post a loss out of the more than 2,400 mainland-listed firms that have announced preliminary numbers or issued guidance this season, data compiled by Bloomberg show. About 86 per cent of those incurring losses were profitable in 2017.\n\nDamage has been widespread: airlines faced soaring fuel costs and a weak yuan, the equity-market slump hurt brokerages, while\n\nChina's economic slowdown\n\nand surge in impairment costs slashed earnings for a bus manufacturer, a maker of refrigerators and an ID-card supplier. Another glut of forecast cuts is likely before the end of the day, as many firms opt to take a hit from more stringent accounting rules rather than report years of losses.\n\n\"We're only just seeing the beginning of deterioration in corporate earnings as the economy slows further,\" said Yu Dingheng, a fund manager at Shenzhen Flying Tiger Investment & Management Ltd. \"Things will continue to go downhill for firms seeing business slowing and even as the macro-economy recovers, these individual firms will never be what they were.\"\n\nJoining the growing list of firms projecting a worse 2018 on Wednesday were Lens Technology Co, developer Oceanwide Holdings Co, chemical producer CEFC Anhui International Holding Co and China Southern Airlines Co. Shares of all four companies fell onshore on Thursday.\n\nTo be sure, some Chinese firms actually said last year's results will be far better than expected: take Jiangxi Copper Co, WuXi AppTec Co or Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings Co. Only miner Jiangxi Copper rose ON Thursday.\n\nChina's equity traders fled stocks in Shenzhen again on Thursday, sending the city's benchmark down a fifth day. They've sought refuge in shares of state-controlled giants instead, betting that they're better placed to benefit from the government's efforts to support the economy.

The Chang'e-4 probe switched to a dormant mode during the lunar night due to the lack of solar power.\n\nBoth the lander and the rover ended the dormant mode automatically according to the elevation angle of the sunlight. And the key instruments on the probe have started to work.\n\nCurrently, the rover is located about 18m north-west of the lander. Communication and data transmission between ground control and the probe via the relay satellite Queqiao (Magpie Bridge) are stable, said CNSA.\n\nAs a result of the tidal locking effect, the moon's revolution cycle is the same as its rotation cycle, and it always faces Earth with the same side.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

We had no financial assistance then and had to pay for the hospitalisation and rehabilitation of my brother along with our daily expenses. Because of that I want to help other families,\" said the 30-year-old, who has two children of her own now.\n\nThe Islamic Law and Jurisprudence graduate from Al-Azhar University in Egypt, who has worked with organisations such as help-group Mendaki and educational institution Simply Islam, joined the Social Service Institute last year to pursue a part-time course for a Diploma in Social Service. She is now a community engagement executive with the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis).\n\n\"Graduates from religious backgrounds like me usually pursue teaching. But I see social work can also complement my religious background,\" she added. \"I wish to help create the awareness about social assistance for struggling families and be able to assist families holistically. Many people are not aware of social assistance programmes that are available.\"\n\nOn Thursday (Jan 31), Ms Liyana and six other students received the Muis Social Work Study Award during the Madrasah Teachers Symposium at Suntec Convention Centre.\n\nThe award is for students pursuing social work and studies who, upon graduation, contribute to the development of the Muslim community, said Muis chief executive Esa Masood in his opening speech at the symposium.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Bursary distributing organisation Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulid (LBKM) administers the funds.\n\nThe first batch of seven students on Thursday received between $5,000 and $10,000 each.\n\nAt the symposium, Muis also presented the Muis50 Contemporary Madrasah Leader Awards to six individuals who contributed towards the progress and achievements of madrasahs.\n\nAll had served as chairmen, committee members or principals of madrasahs for a continuous period of at least 15 years.\n\nAmong them is the chairman of Madrasah Al- Ma'arif's management committee, Mr Ma'mun Suheimi, 76. A Muis council member from 1995 to 2004, he continues to champion Madrasah development and education.\n\nHe said: \"Madrasah education is progressing all the time, it is not static, it is something that should continue to evolve to cater to the current generations and future generations. For example, learning IT is important, e-learning is important.\"\n\nIn his opening address, Mr Esa said the award recipients had improved Islamic education in Singapore.\n\n\"They drove initiatives in the early years and some continue to contribute in different capacities to the madrasah sector today,\" he said.\n\nCiting the progress of madrasahs in Singapore, Mr Esa said that all four madrasahs offering primary school education successfully scored above the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) benchmark over the last couple of years.\n\n\"In the first few years when the Compulsory Education Act was introduced, we were worried about clearing the PSLE benchmark. But, in the last few years, all four madrasahs offering primary education have successfully scored above the PSLE benchmark,\" he said.\n\nMuis figures show that 96.8 per cent of the 251 Singaporean madrasah students who sat for the PSLE in 2018 could proceed to secondary school.\n\nThe guest of honour at the symposium was Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs and Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifl.\n\nHe said: \"We are very fortunate to have the local madrasah system which existed even before independence when the British were here.

She held telephone calls with EU President Donald Tusk and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar late on Wednesday.\n\n\"Yesterday, we found out what the UK doesn't want, but we still don't know what the UK does want,\" Tusk tweeted after the 45-minute call, which an official with knowledge of it described as \"open and frank\".\n\nVaradkar told May that the need for the backstop had been reinforced.\n\nEuropean governments now think that a Brexit postponement is increasingly likely, officials briefed on a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday said. However, they remain divided over how long a postponement should be.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday negotiations with the EU could run close to the March 29 deadline and Britain might need a short delay to pass necessary legislation.\n\n\"It's difficult to know\" how long the process will take, Hunt told BBC Radio, adding that finalising proposals to put to the EU on the Irish border issue is \"not going to happen in the next few days.\"\n\nParliament is likely to abandon plans for a 10-day break in February, House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom warned lawmakers on Thursday (Jan 31).\n\n\"It is only right that I give the House notice that there are currently no plans to bring forward a motion to agree dates for the February recess, and that the House may therefore need to continue to sit to make progress on the key business before the House,\" Leadsom said.\n\nParliament had been due to break up on Feb 14 and return on Feb 25, according to a provisional schedule.\n\nBut there are still eight laws needed to prepare for Brexit, not just on the deal but also covering issues such as trade, agriculture and immigration.\n\nLeadsom had previously suggested Britain could probably secure \"a couple of extra weeks\" if needed. Any delay must be agreed by the other 27 EU countries.\n\n'Borders and Division'\n\nWhile the EU won't budge on the part of the Brexit deal covering the backstop, it is open to reworking some of the language related to future UK-EU relations in a bid to convince British members of Parliament that the backstop might never be needed, diplomats said.\n\nAs the EU dug in, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said it's \"crystal clear\" that the government won't allow economic self-interest to trump concerns around the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\n\"It is vitally important that politicians in Westminster understand the overwhelming wish across society in Northern Ireland not to return to the borders and division of times past,\" Coveney said in a speech, in a signal that the government in Dublin isn't going to soften its stance.\n\nThe European Commission stepped up its no-deal contingency planning. Plans include a request for the UK to continue paying into the bloc's budget in 2019 - even if the UK doesn't agree to the deal - so that projects in Britain retain EU funding.\n\nSee more on\n\nBrexit\n\nBritain", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/yheu31.jpg?VersionId=ujO5ruju_XuZii2NJy_j49leJno1PgMw", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

This includes a cut to corporate tax rates,\" Denni Purbasari, Joko's deputy chief of staff, told reporters, referring to the president's widely used nickname.\n\nIn 2016, Joko had promised he would follow a tax amnesty programme with a corporate tax cut, possibly bringing the level down to as low as the 17 per cent rate in neighbouring Singapore.\n\nHe has not delivered on the pledge so far.\n\nIndonesia currently taxes corporate profits at 25 per cent, or 20 per cent for publicly listed companies.\n\n\"If he is re-elected, after April 17, there will be more structural reforms he will launch. He will not wait until October (when the new presidential term begins),\" Purbasari said.\n\nJoko's opponent in the April election, former general Prabowo Subianto, plans to cut corporate tax rates by up to 8 percentage points to boost economic growth if he wins, Harryadin Mahardika, an economist in his campaign team, has said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

rice, fish and electrical goods - totalled US$1 billion (S$1.35 billion) between October and December, half of the entire country's land border trade, according to official figures.\n\nBut the riches made from the vast quantities of meth, opium, illegal animal parts and jade -

On the flipside, the industrial goods sector is projected to see the lowest increase at close to 1 per cent.\n\nBut pay increases do not seem to be in line with demand for some sectors. Despite 38 per cent of organisations indicating that they lack engineers and 29 per cent which say they lack information technology talent, salary increases for staff in these functions range from 2.8 to 3.4 per cent, in line with the general market increase instead of an expected salary premium given the lack of talent shortages for these roles.\n\nThe study also found that performance ratings of employees and variable bonus payouts are not necessarily aligned.\n\nResults showed that there is little differentiation in terms of actual bonus payouts between an employee who receives an above or below expectation performance rating.\n\nThe projected average variable bonus payment to be paid out by organisations across industries in Singapore increased to an average of 2.2 months in the latest study, compared to a slightly lower payout of two months last year.\n\nIn Asia, real wage increases are expected to be 2.6 per cent in 2019, the highest in the world. However, this is slightly down from the 2.8 per cent last year.\n\nChina's real-wage forecast growth for 2019 weakened at 3.2 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent last year. Japan saw a real-wage prediction of 0.1 per cent for 2019 compared to the 2018 prediction of 1.6 per cent.\n\nWhile growth in Asia is easing slightly, India, Vietnam and Singapore are exceptions to the rule.\n\nGlobally, real-wage salaries are expected to grow only an average of 1 per cent in 2019, dipping further from a 1.5 per cent prediction for 2018.\n\nSee more on\n\nSalaries\n\nSingapore economy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/sl_generic_251218_30.jpg?VersionId=WEjkxv3zEy7.vxnbY14iljjRw_oBQFke", "alt_text": null}]}

The pork producer said that contributed to its pigs' death rate being higher than expected.\n\nIt's the latest twist for the small-cap company that's been challenged on multiple fronts, from the spread of African swine fever - which has seen more than 900,000 hogs culled across the country - to an economic slowdown to a deleveraging drive by policymakers that's tightened credit flows to weaker borrowers.\n\nThe Zhengzhou, central China-based company revised its 2018 performance forecast to a net loss of 2.9 billion yuan (S$581.9 million) to 3.3 billion yuan, wider than previously anticipated, it said in the statement on Wednesday (Jan 30).\n\nMore pain may be looming: Chuying Agro has 2.3 billion yuan of bonds it needs to repay this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A call to the company's securities department went unanswered.\n\nStruggling Chinese firms have been getting innovative in their efforts to appease investors. A financing platform under HNA Group Co offered investors air tickets rather than cash for debt repayment last year.\n\nIn Chuying Agro's case, the company said in November that holders of 271 million yuan of its debt agreed to take ham or pork gift packages instead of interest payments. Owen Gallimore, head of credit strategy from Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, quipped that \"payment in kind becomes PIH (Pay In Ham)\".\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

But now there's enough evidence that all of this is occurring because of overdevelopment where services aren't available,\" said Mahendra, director of research at the institute's Ross Centre for Sustainable Cities.\n\nWhen cities grow at the behest of developers rather than guided by policy, she said, the result is development at the periphery.\n\nThat eats into agricultural or forest lands, and expands into areas that are far from jobs and largely unconnected to municipal services like water and public transit.\n\nAccess to services drops \"sharply\" just 5km from many city centres, according to the report.\n\nFor the study, the researchers used a first-ever technique to combine satellite images tracking how 499 of the largest cities in the developing world have expanded outward with radar data of how those cities have also grown upward.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It also notes that the dish is also popular in neighbouring Singapore and Thailand.\n\n\"Although the name translates from Malay as 'rich rice' (a reference to the coconut milk included in the recipe) there is another origin story for the name. According to legend, the daughter of a widow named Mak Kuntum accidentally spilled coconut milk into the rice pot. 'What did you cook?' Mak asked and her daughter answered 'Nasi le, Mak!' (Rice, mother!),\" says Google.\n\nIt notes that there are many versions of nasi lemak, each reflecting Malaysia's multi-ethnic melting pot of Malay, Chinese, Indian, and other indigenous and imported cultures.\n\nIt adds that the fundamental recipe - as featured in the video - is rice cooked with santan or coconut milk and flavoured with pandan (screwpine leaves) and galangal root, served with ikan bilis (fried anchovies), crispy peanuts (skin on), sliced cucumber, hard-boiled egg, and sambal (chilli paste) or a splash of tamarind juice, with an optional piece of fried chicken or beef rendang on the side.\n\nThe video depicts how nasi lemak and its accompaniments are made, from the boiling of rice, frying of peanuts, anchovies and chicken, and serving it with sambal or packed in banana leaf.\n\nThe doodle by illustrator Alyssa Winans also features music by composer Silas Hite. Google says nasi lemak is often sold at roadside stalls in a bungkus - wrapped in banana leaf or brown paper - and is so popular that it is also eaten for lunch and dinner, too.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It estimates seven million will go abroad.\n\nHotels and travel agencies in Asian countries from Thailand to Japan anticipate higher numbers than a year ago of Chinese tourists, who have become a powerful spending force with the ability to make, or break, the fortunes of retailers and tourism brands.\n\nBut recently, the numbers going to the US, Australia and New Zealand have fallen or show only small increases.\n\n\"We see the growth start to slow a little bit and per pax spending, especially on shopping, declining,\" said Mr Hunter Williams, a US-based partner at management consultant firm Oliver Wyman.\n\nThe consultancy says that average spending on overseas shopping a year ago was 5,800 yuan (S$1,163), compared with 8,000 yuan around Chinese New Year in 2016.\n\nIn 2018, the Chinese economy grew at its slowest rate in nearly three decades, and economists expect a further decline this year, in part because of weakening consumer spending.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Now, maybe 1,000,\" he said.\n\n\"Tourism is considered a luxury, something to have after your stomach is full.

A trolley boy since he was 17, he lives in a makeshift shelter beside the track with his two sons.\n\nMr Diaz said the trolley boys were just \"borrowing\" the track from the Philippine National Railways, but the state-owned train company has moved to halt the trolley service after the media drew attention to its dangers recently.\n\nThe risk arises because those pushing and riding the trolleys have to watch out for the trains to avoid collisions.\n\n\"Of course we get scared of the trains,\" said Mr Jun Albeza, 32, who has been a trolley boy for four years after he was laid off from plumbing and construction jobs.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Eight members of Mr Jeremy Corbyn's front bench team, who are supposed to follow party orders, also abstained.\n\nMr Corbyn's spokesman refused to say if the leader was disappointed with those who disobeyed, and said there had been \"no nods or winks\" to allow them to do so. It was clear, though, that any disciplinary action by party enforcers is not going to be severe.\n\nLabour has been trying to strike a balance between its members, the majority of whom want to stay in the European Union, and Leave-supporting voters it needs to hold on to in key districts. The party is united behind the compromise thrashed out last year, the leader's office said, and there was always likely to be some \"fraying around the edges\".\n\nSMALL MARGIN\n\nBut that fraying is all Mrs May needed on Tuesday in the tight margins of the House of Commons.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Tuesday's results could change their tune.\n\nAnd Mrs May, who is courting opposition lawmakers with promises on post-Brexit workers' rights and environmental protection, now knows there are at least 14 Labour MPs who either believe in Brexit or see the referendum result as an instruction from their voters.\n\n\"It is the responsibility of MPs of all parties to work together to produce the best outcome possible,\" said Ms Caroline Flint, one of the Tuesday rebels. \"Without Labour, there is no deal that can be passed in the Commons.\"\n\nMrs May knows this. Her Conservatives do not have a majority in Parliament, and even with her partners in the Democratic Unionist Party, she can only barely win votes. The Times newspaper on Thursday (Jan 31) reported that the premier is trying to woo support from Labour lawmakers with cash injections into the communities they represent.\n\nTuesday evening showed that between seven and 17 on Mrs May's side will rebel in a pro-EU direction. But when previous rebellions are taken into account, at least 25 Labour MPs have shown that they are willing to ignore Mr Corbyn's instructions and vote for aspects of Brexit. That could be enough to see the Prime Minister through.\n\nIt may be the premier does not even need support from Labour rebels. ITV's Robert Peston said on Wednesday (Jan 30) in a Facebook post that people close to Mr Corbyn say they could envisage a situation in coming weeks where it will become official party policy to vote for a Brexit plan.\n\nSee more on\n\nBrexit\n\nBritain\n\nTheresa May\n\nJeremy Corbyn", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/sl_tm_251218_27.jpg?VersionId=vB5yGgyi3xM6NmRUdUsig2hefpiiHpAO", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

She immediately launched an online petition, demanding that the company remove the popular shoe from its worldwide market.\n\nMs Noreen accused Nike of having a disrespectful attitude towards Islam, stating in the petition's description: \"It is outrageous and appalling of Nike to allow the name of God on a shoe. This is disrespectful and extremely offensive to Muslims and insulting to Islam.\"\n\n\"Nike has produced the Nike Air Max 270 shoe with the script logo on the sole resembling the word Allah in Arabic, which will surely be trampled, kicked and become soiled with mud or even filth,\" Ms Noreen wrote. She urged all Muslims and everyone who agreed with her to sign the petition.\n\nCurrently, over 16,000 people have signed the petition, with a goal of 25,000 signatures.\n\nOther supporters took to Twitter to express their outrage over Nike's allegedly blasphemous product.\n\n\"Why is Nike selling trainers that clearly have 'Allah' written in #Arabic. Remove shoes from sales. Disgusting and appalling,\" tweeted one angry supporter, with an image directing people to support Ms Noreen's petition.\n\nNike denied allegations it intentionally insulted the Muslim community, saying the logo was a \"stylised representation of Nike's Air Max trademark\" and had no religious significance, as reported by RT.\n\n\"It is intended to reflect the Air Max brand only.

Rangers plan to start allowing small groups of visitors to go to the beach this weekend to view the seals from a short distance away, Mr Dell'Osso said.\n\nThe herd is part of the area's growing elephant seal population, which currently numbers between 1,500 and 2,000.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But people also have a duty to do their part.\"\n\nHe urged people to have more public consciousness, follow the rules and change their polluting habits such as using vehicles that emit black fumes from the exhaust.\n\n\"I don't mean to cause inconvenience to people, but we need public participation to solve the problem,\" he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister also insisted that official agencies, which have the responsibility to mitigate the smog, such as the Pollution Control Department, the BMA and local authorities, must be efficient in monitoring PM2.5 levels, alert the people when the air quality drops to harmful levels, and relieve the situation to ensure the good health and well-being of the citizens.\n\nBut if it were found that related official agencies had failed to discharge their duties, Mr Prayut warned that they would be punished.\n\nHe also asked business operators and factory owners to scale down their operations during this time and make sure their facilities meet the environmental protection standard.\n\nIn the meantime, he has ordered the Internal Security Operations Command in each province to deploy military officers to inspect the operations of factories in their areas and ensure they were following the pollution emission standards.\n\nGovernment spokesman Puttipong Punnakanta, meanwhile, said the Prime Minister was also concerned about the well-being of students, so he asked the Education Ministry to order temporary closure of schools in the capital on Thursday and Friday.\n\nHe also authorised provincial governors to consider temporary closure of schools based on the air pollution situation in their province.\n\nBMA governor Aswin Kwanmuang has ordered all 50 districts of Bangkok to be designated a pollution-control area under the Public Health Act so as to allow the BMA to impose stricter legal measures such as banning outdoor burning, debarring vehicles that do not pass pollution emission standards and suspending construction work by official agencies.\n\nSee more on\n\nThailand\n\nPrayut Chan-o-cha\n\nBangkok\n\nAir pollution\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Fold7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nVietnamese man gets death penalty for murdering entire family\n\nAd\n\nCurrency Shifts: Why Your Business Can't Ignore Hedging Right Now\n\nRead more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

We're condemned to dialogue,\" French Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran frequently repeated during his time at the Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue.\n\nCardinal Tauran, who died last year, said the fact that there was any dialogue at all was an enormous achievement.\n\nBut he also feared that dialogue would be limited to \"little steps at the level of the elites, which don't turn into laws, don't reach the street\".\n\nPope Francis has insisted that \"the dialogue is moving forwards\", but also said Muslims should look at the Quran in a more interpretive way.\n\nBut, notes Christian-Islamic expert Cottini: \"We have more freedom of interpretation of the founding texts of Christianity, because the status of the word of God in the Bible is not the same as in the Quran, which Muslims consider the literal word of God.\"\n\nFUNDAMENTALISMS\n\nPope Francis takes great care not to use the word \"Islamist\" when an attack is carried out in the name of Islam, preferring to use \"terrorist\".\n\nIn 2014, he called for Muslim political and religious leaders as well as academics unambiguously to condemn terrorism, a source of Islamophobia.\n\nHe also puts Christian, Jewish and Muslim fundamentalisms on the same level - they are all \"deviations\".\n\nIn 2016, the Pope declined to \"associate Islam with violence\" when asked about the murder of French priest Jacques Hamel by two militants.\n\nIn the wake of the attack, he said that \"the world is at war\" but argued that religion was not the cause.\n\n\"When I speak of war, I speak of wars over interests, money, resources, not religion.

that the ceasefire is likely to collapse, pushing Hodeida into a deeper spiral of conflict that could precipitate famine.\n\n\"While the truce agreement initially brought some hope and relief, Hodeida's poorest residents live under the shadow of a resumption of conflict, particularly as the implementation of deconfliction processes remains slow at best,\" said Mr Adam Baron, a Yemen expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nFurther casting doubt on the fate of the ceasefire, UN special envoy Martin Griffiths on Monday (Jan 28) said some of the terms agreed during the Sweden talks, including a prisoner swap deal between the warring parties, had been delayed.\n\nMr Griffiths also confirmed plans to replace retired Dutch general Patrick Cammaert, who heads the monitoring team tasked with overseeing the withdrawal of rival forces from Hodeida.\n\nThe Houthis are using the truce to fortify their positions inside Hodeida, with a maze of shipping containers, trenches and sniper nests inside dense residential neighbourhoods, residents told AFP, in what they believe are preparations for a resumption of war.\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres has separately pointed to Houthi allegations that pro-government forces were massing troops close to the city.\n\nColonel Saeed Salmeen, an Emirati commander on Yemen's west coast, denied the allegation but said his men were ready for battle if required.\n\n'CONTROL OUR TEMPER'\n\n\"The coalition and the Yemeni government will have to cope with an unforgiving international climate if battle recommences,\" said Dr Michael Knights, a fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\n\"Though the Houthis appear to have deliberately sought a collapse of the ceasefire, performing provocative strikes... blame will probably accrue to the coalition if they advance in Hodeida.\"\n\nUS lawmakers have demanded greater accountability from Saudi Arabia for its military campaign in Yemen, after journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder put Riyadh's role in the conflict under the spotlight.\n\nAs they watch wounded fellow soldiers pour into hospitals during the ceasefire, their bodies sometimes riven with shrapnel, pro-government loyalists evince frustration that the truce halted their offensive just as they got tantalisingly close to the rebel-held port.\n\nCapturing the port, a key revenue earner for the rebels, is touted by loyalists as a possible game changer that would finally force the Houthis to their knees.\n\n\"We have manpower, firepower and morale,\" said a government loyalist, requesting anonymity.\n\n\"But we are doing our best to control our temper, our troops\" because of the truce, he said.\n\nAnother loyalist went further, insisting that military action was the only solution, a sentiment echoed by many.\n\n\"Even if 50,000 people die (if war resumes), so what?\" he said matter-of-factly.\n\n\"When we cut off their main nerve, we will finish them off forever.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nYemen\n\nWars and conflicts", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/ak_yemengirl_3101.jpg?VersionId=8FKtwJnsH4VOgH2e51SZ.mi6_YWeUN3L", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control -

Part of that plan involves building gas pipelines to heat homes, instead of relying on burning wood or coal.\n\nBut environmental activists warn that many unregulated businesses will have to be curbed if the authorities want to make an impact.\n\n\"Skopje is a city that has factories of heavy metal and chemical industries literally in the city,\" said Ms Tatjana Grozdanovska of Stop Air Pollution.\n\n\"Then there are hundreds of small plants and workshops that burn oil for heat, burn tyres...

Of these additional workers, 28,400 were Singaporeans or permanent residents, while 10,900 were foreigners.\n\nThis is a turnaround from 2017, when the number of foreigners - excluding maids - working in Singapore fell by 32,000. It was the biggest drop in 15 years and caused a rare drop in total employment.\n\nThe ministry said the increase last year was driven by the services sector, while the number of workers in construction and manufacturing fell for the third and fifth consecutive year respectively.\n\nMore residents were employed last year in service industries such as community, social and personal services; transportation and storage; financial and insurance services; information and communications; and professional services.\n\nThe annual average unemployment rate fell to 2.1 per cent last year, from 2.2 per cent in 2017. The rates were 3 per cent for Singaporeans and 2.9 per cent for residents, down from 3.3 per cent and 3.1 per cent respectively.\n\nAlso, fewer workers were laid off last year, as the economy continued to expand. A total of 11,020 workers were retrenched in 2018, down from 14,720 in 2017 and a peak of 19,170 in 2016.\n\nHowever, the MOM noted in a statement that labour market trends from September to December last year were mixed, with a slight uptick in unemployment rates compared with the third quarter of 2018.\n\nIt expects local workforce growth to remain modest going forward, due to the underlying demographics of an ageing population and low birth rates.\n\n\"As economic growth moderates, workers and businesses need to remain agile and responsive to economic restructuring and the evolving employment landscape,\" it said.\n\nNational Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay, a labour MP, said that with the general sense of uncertainty this year amid trade tensions between the United States and China, Brexit, and technological advances, the labour market figures for the first half of the year should be closely watched.\n\n\"I expect to see more companies doing more restrategisation, reorganisation and mergers and acquisitions, which may result in retrenchments,\" he said.\n\nHe added that he hopes to see a focus in Budget 2019 on more support for workers and companies to do training and upgrading.\n\nHe also hopes to see more emphasis on professionals, managers and executives, who are more affected by retrenchments, and on older workers, as the workforce ages.\n\nFinance Minister Heng Swee Keat will deliver the Budget speech on Feb 18.\n\nSee more on\n\nLabour market\n\nEmployment\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nWage gap\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Manufacturers also continued to cut jobs, a trend Beijing is closely watching as its weighs more support measures.\n\nNew orders - an indicator of future activity - pointed to further pressure in coming months. The sub-index fell to 49.6 from 49.7 in December, the second consecutive month in the contraction territory, amid persistently weak demand at home and abroad.\n\nNew export orders shrank for a eighth straight month on faltering external demand, though the sub-index ticked up slightly to 46.9 from the previous month's 46.6.\n\nDespite weaker orders, the output sub-index edged up to 50.9 from 50.8.\n\nVeteran China watchers typically advise taking its data early in the year with a pinch of salt, suspecting the trends may be distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays.\n\nMany firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays, which begin on Feb 4 this year. But workers, business owners and labour activists have told Reuters that companies are shutting earlier than usual as the trade war bites, with some likely to close for good.\n\nBleak data ahead of an annual meeting of parliament in March could raise the possibility that Beijing may speed up or intensify its stimulus efforts in 2019, after a slew of measures last year that analysts said were modest by Chinese standards.\n\nStill, many analysts believe conditions in China are likely to get worse before they get better, as support policies will take time to work their way through the economy.\n\nSome economists believe growth could even dip below 6 percent in the first half - from 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter - before stabilising later in the year.\n\nOne bright note in Thursday's data was an acceleration in service sector activity for the second straight month, reflecting some pockets of strength in the economy despite worries about faltering consumer demand.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina economy\n\nManufacturing\n\nPMI\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/sl_china_310119_40.jpg?VersionId=NkDiN.Hno812Rm3RapdSN5VSsB9AHCO3", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

Revenue is likely to rise only marginally on the back of a softer economic outlook, while expenditure is expected to surge by about 6.6 per cent.\n\nThis comes as the budget position for FY2018 is likely to surprise on the upside with a surplus of $3.3 billion compared to a budgeted deficit of $600 million, on the back of a better-than-expected revenue flow, and less-than-projected expenditure, said Mr Seah.\n\nWhile he believes that there is enough in the official coffers to provide more fiscal impetus in the coming two Budgets before the term of government ends, ensuring fiscal sustainability remains paramount.\n\nIn the report, he flagged that upward pressure on health and social spending will escalate along with the demographic shift, intensifying fiscal strain.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

One way to do so is by lifting the competitiveness of Singapore companies to succeed independently on a global stage, he suggested.\n\nThese companies could leverage the abundant supply of resources in the region while still providing meaningful jobs for local Singaporeans which could also\n\nhelp in alleviating the malaise faced by the professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs), he said\n\n.\n\n\"More importantly, corporate earnings generated overseas could translate into tax revenue to support a higher social expenditure.

The government has also responded to his challenge by cracking down on rebellious neighbourhoods, trying to preserve an autocratic, socialist-style system increasingly imperilled by deep unpopularity and foreign pressure.\n\nIn an interview with Russia's RIA Novosti news agency that aired on Wednesday, Mr Maduro said he has sent letters to the governments of Bolivia, Mexico, Russia and Uruguay to involve them in a new process of dialogue with the opposition.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

More than 800 people have been detained, according to the legal aid group Foro Penal.\n\nAfter waves of daily protests in recent years failed to dislodge Mr Maduro, the opposition has adopted a different strategy, said opposition leader and lawmaker Juan Andres Mejia, which is to demonstrate the will to protest without raising expectations among supporters or provoking the government into a violent response.\n\n\"The government is avoiding images of strong repression in Caracas, and focusing on cracking down on slums,\" he added. \"But the result is that the rates at which the death toll and number of detained are rising is higher\" than in past years.\n\nA larger protest is planned for this Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration is leading an international campaign to drive the leftist Venezuelan leader from power, embracing Mr Guaido's arguments that Mr Maduro began a second term after an election riddled with fraud and years of authoritarian rule that have plunged this oil-rich country into an economic and humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nMr Elliott Abrams, the State Department's newly appointed envoy for Venezuela, said the crisis appears to have exacerbated divisions within the Venezuelan military. Top commanders have enriched themselves, but the rank and file are suffering like most other Venezuelans, he said.\n\nThe senior officials \"are actually quite nervous about the mood\" in the country. \"Our hope is that, in what we believe will be the final period of the regime, it does not use violence to try to prolong its days in power,\" Mr Abrams said. \"We hope that if it comes to it, the Venezuelans, in the military, in the society, will turn away from violence. The only people willing die for Maduro are the Cubans who are his security guards.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Abrams said, the US and other countries opposed to Mr Maduro are scouring the world looking for assets that can be seized under US sanctions announced this week.\n\nMr Maduro and his supporters have waved away the European Union's demand that he accept presidential elections by this weekend or the EU would recognise Mr Guaido as president.\n\nOne of Mr Maduro's most prominent supporters, Mr Diosdado Cabello, said in a speech on Wednesday that the only elections the government is considering are for National Assembly, currently the only opposition-controlled body in Venezuela. \"Militia members, members of the police and the armed forces, wherever we have to mobilise to defend the homeland, we will,\" Mr Cabello said.\n\nIn Caracas, residents expressed frustration with the government, but some were wary about joining protests because of possible violence.\n\nOutside the Jos\u00e9 Manuel de los Rios Hospital in north-west Caracas, about 100 employees filled the street, chanting and waving signs, as dozens of police officers looked on. \"I'm here because I'm in a hospital where my patients are dying. We have nothing,\" said 26-year-old radiology technician Haberlyn Mejia. \"I hope there's a profound change in my country. We need it urgently.\"\n\nMr Rafael Tafuro, 65, a carpenter who was waiting for the subway in eastern Caracas on Wednesday morning, said that \"of course\" he would take part in the demonstrations. \"I protest because of everything. I haven't had work in a year. I'm a carpenter. Materials are way too expensive, and no one has money to pay for my services.\"\n\nBut Mr Lasmick Valverde, a 19-year-old accounting student, said he would not join the demonstrations. \"I'm too scared something will happen to me,\" he said. \"I support what they're doing, but I don't like protests.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nVenezuela\n\nUS foreign policy\n\nProtests", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/ak_jg_3101.jpg?VersionId=r.KXIiSh6rDMYgGreHSfF0MCQ4FOaf_n", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

Warming centres opened around the Midwest and schools and universities closed throughout the region as rare polar winds streamed down from the Arctic.\n\nAt the same time, on the other side of the planet, wildfires raged in Australia's record-breaking heat. Soaring air-conditioner use overloaded electrical grids and caused widespread power failures. The authorities slowed and cancelled trams to save power. Labour leaders called for laws that would require businesses to close when temperatures reached hazardous levels - nearly 47 deg C,\n\nas was the case last week in Adelaide, the capital of South Australia\n\n.\n\nThis is weather in the age of extremes. It comes on top of multiple extremes, all kinds, in all kinds of places.\n\n\"When something happens - whether it's a cold snap, a wildfire, a hurricane, any of those things - we need to think beyond what we have seen in the past and assume there's a high probability that it will be worse than anything we've ever seen,\" said Dr Crystal A. Kolden, an associate professor at the University of Idaho, who specialises in wildfires and who is working in Tasmania during one of the state's worst fire seasons.\n\nConsider these recent examples: Heat records were toppled from Norway to Algeria last year. In Australia, a drought has gone on so long that a child in kindergarten will hardly have seen rain in her lifetime. And California saw its most ruinous wildfires ever in 2018, triggering a bankruptcy filing this week by the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric.\n\nIs it climate change?\n\nHeat and drought extremes are consistent with scientific consensus: More greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere bring a greater likelihood of abnormally high temperatures. Also, broadly speaking, scientists say, a hotter planet makes extreme weather more frequent and more intense.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are higher than they have been in 800,000 years, and average global temperatures have risen. The last four years have been the hottest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organisation, and the 20 warmest years on record have all come in the past 22 years. Ocean temperatures have broken records for several straight years.\n\nAs for the extremely low temperatures this week in parts of the United States, they stand in sharp contrast to the trend towards warmer winters. They may also be a result of warming, strangely enough.\n\nEmerging research suggests that a warming Arctic is causing changes in the jet stream and pushing polar air down to latitudes that are unaccustomed to them and often unprepared. Hence this week's atypical chill over large swathes of the Northeast and Midwest.\n\nDr Friederike Otto, an Oxford University climate scientist who studies how specific weather events are exacerbated by global warming, said that while not all of these extreme events can be attributed to climate change, the profound changes in the Earth's atmosphere raise \"the likelihood of a large number of extreme events\".\n\n\"This means it becomes crucial to understand well where your community is vulnerable, and this can be something that was not on the agenda without climate change,\" she said.\n\nTake Chicago, for instance. It woke up to the hazards of heat two decades ago, when a five-day heatwave in the summer of 1995 killed hundreds of people, particularly those who lived alone. The city developed a heat action plan. It planted thousands of trees, set up neighbourhood cooling centres and created a text messaging system so residents could request that city officials check on vulnerable people.\n\nNow comes a cold spell that a generation of Chicago residents has never experienced, with Wednesday night (Jan 30) temperatures projected to dip to -31 deg C (the city's record low is -33 deg C, recorded in January 1985). The city said it would send out five buses to cruise the streets as mobile warming centres for homeless people. It has issued instructions on how to warm pipes so they do not freeze.\n\nExtreme heat, though, is the bigger problem overall.\n\nHeat records have been broken twice as often as cold records in the US since the 2000s.\n\nOne recent study in the journal PLOS Medicine projected a fivefold rise in heat-related deaths for the US by 2080. The outlook for less wealthy countries is worse; for the Philippines, researchers forecast 12 times more deaths. Extreme heat is already devastating the health and livelihoods of tens of millions of people, especially in South Asia.\n\nExtreme heat also affects the nutritional value of many crops. Even some of our most precious indulgences, like coffee, are in danger as temperatures rise.\n\nThis year, heat has been a problem in both Northern and Southern hemispheres. In Alaska, warmer-than-usual temperatures forced the cancellation of sled dog races, while cities in New Zealand, where the weather is generally so temperate that most homes do not have heating or air-conditioners, broke heat records. On Tuesday, Wellington, the capital, soared past 31 deg C, the highest since record-keeping began in 1927, and Hamilton topped 33 deg C, the highest since record-keeping began in 1940.\n\nMr Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said that in preparing for how climate change affects the weather, \"we have to be prepared for a wider range of possibilities\".\n\nSome preparation is connected to resiliency. Mayors promise to make their cities more resilient to climate change after one disaster or another. Scientists experiment with crop seeds that are more resilient to the vagaries of extreme heat and drought.\n\nDr Kolden, the fire specialist, noted that as a species, we pride ourselves on being resilient. But that human trait can also have a downside. It is why, often, even when officials tell us to evacuate from a fire zone or a flood plain, we do not. We think we will make it because we have made it before. Or that the forecasters are wrong.\n\n\"In our DNA, we've got this extreme resilience baked in,\" Dr Kolden said. \"That ends up being our downfall when it comes to the changing conditions.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nAustralia\n\nWeather\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nDon\u2019t miss $1,500 in savings with your Galaxy Z Fold7 pre-order\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nSpaniards struggle to enjoy their own beaches in tourist deluge\n\nAd\n\nThe complete guide on payments to Chinese suppliers from Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Its resounding beat stemmed in part from a US$3.3 billion accounting gain after revaluing a subsidiary, and executives warned of uncertainty during a deceleration of the world's second largest economy.\n\nChina is showing signs of further deterioration, hurting the consumer demand that Alibaba's e-commerce businesses rely on. Still, it's been spearheading a drive into lucrative new spheres such as rural markets, cloud services and entertainment. On Wednesday, Alibaba's chief executive officer Daniel Zhang told analysts those new initiatives as well as a global expansion should help offset the impact of an economic slowdown.\n\n\"China's economy is facing some uncertainty, but we do see opportunities,\" Zhang told analysts on a conference call. \"One of the key regions we will stay focused on in the near term is Southeast Asia.\"\n\nAlibaba's shares rose 6.3 per cent in US trading to their highest level since September. They have slumped 16 per cent in the past 12 months but rallied so far this month.\n\nNet income at China's biggest e-commerce company rose 37 per cent to 33.1 billion yuan in the December quarter, outpacing the 22.1 billion yuan projected. It booked a gain of 21.99 billion yuan (S$4.41 billion) after re-valuing on-demand services arm Koubei. The share of losses from the numerous companies it's invested in also narrowed sharply. Adjusted earnings-per-share was 12.2 yuan compared with the 11.2 yuan projected.\n\nWhile revenue rose 41 per cent to 117.3 billion yuan, that was the slowest pace in more than two years and lagged the 119.4 billion-yuan projected. Alibaba itself is bracing for more nervous consumers in 2019: in November, it trimmed its sales outlook by as much as 6 per cent.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Growth also sprang from a decision to take control of delivery network Cainiao, meals-on-demand service Ele.me and video platform Youku. Those expansions however have shifted the company away from an asset-light model.\n\nAlibaba could tap new revenue spigots this year such as personalized feed recommendations, which now generate more traffic than traditional search on its e-commerce platforms. The feed on Taobao, one of Alibaba's largest shopping platforms, pushes products that it thinks users will likely purchase based on their history.

The votes were cast at a shareholder meeting on Monday. Capital World has 1.31 billion issued shares. It proposed the share issuance in November.\n\nOUE Commercial Reit: OUE C-Reit's distribution per unit slid 34.2 per cent for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018. DPU decreased to 0.75 cent from 1.14 cent. If Q4 2017 DPU was restated to include the 1.3 billion new units issued on Oct 30, DPU would increase 21 per cent to 0.75 cent from 0.62 cent a year ago. The rights units issue was done to finance the purchase of the office component of OUE Downtown.\n\nAscendas Reit: Ascendas Reit on Wednesday posted a 0.7 per cent increase in distribution per unit (DPU) to 3.998 cents for the third quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, from 3.970 cents a year ago. Ascendas noted that the DPU takes into account an enlarged number of units in issue. Net property income rose 6.6 per cent to S168 million mainly due to lower property tax expenses.\n\nFrasers Hospitality Trust: Frasers Hospitality Trust on Wednesday posted a 4.3 per cent decrease in distribution per stapled security (DPS) to 1.2542 cents for the first quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, from 1.3107 cents a year ago.

The reversal was driven by fair value gains, mainly the group's preference shares investment in Nest Hotel Japan Corporation (NHJC), offset by the write-down on the 24 per cent interest in the land held for development, Ju Ren Da Sha. NHJC is in the business of hotel management, operations and investment, and manages 12 hotels in Japan.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore stocks\n\nSingapore companies\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Huawei has denied accusations of spying and sabotage.\n\nThe Chinese government denies any intention to spy on the West and has decried a ban on Chinese 5G suppliers in the US and Australia as unfounded.\n\nChina's Ambassador to the EU, Mr Zhang Ming, took a similar message to a private meeting at the Commission with EU tech commissioner Andrus Ansip on Jan 29, arguing that Huawei should not be blocked from 5G auctions in Europe, one of the four officials said.\n\nChina's mission to the EU could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nPOTENTIAL SETBACK\n\nThe tougher stance reflects growing security concerns in the West about Huawei. Some Western countries, including the US and Australia, have restricted Huawei from accessing next-generation mobile networks, and Germany is considering whether to do so.\n\nEuropean telecoms companies are preparing for the 5G technology that promises to link up everything from vehicles to factories at far greater speeds. If such measures were introduced by the EU, it could prove a setback for European efforts to stay competitive in 5G because it would likely lead to delays and extra costs in building out networks.\n\nDeutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecoms operator, on Wednesday (Jan 30) proposed a series of steps to ensure that Chinese vendors could take part in building Germany's 5G mobile networks without jeopardising national security.\n\nAccording to an internal Commission document reviewed by Reuters, the EU shift has been prompted by changes to Chinese intelligence and security laws in recent years.\n\nIn one example cited in the Commission document, China's National Intelligence Law states that Chinese \"organisations and citizens shall, in accordance with the law, support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work\".\n\nThat has sparked fears that Chinese companies like Huawei could be asked by the Chinese government to incorporate \"backdoors\" into its equipment that would allow Beijing access, for spying or sabotage purposes, the EU officials said.\n\nThe Commission concluded that there did not need to be evidence that China was actually spying before a change in policy was made, according to the document.\n\nChanging EU law is not straightforward and such an amendment would need to win approval from EU capitals. Even with that approval, it could be a year or more before a change to the law is made.\n\nIt might also involve the US-led Nato military alliance through coordination with the EU on protecting 5G networks, although discussions are at a very tentative stage, the EU officials and two Nato diplomats said.\n\nStill, the Commission hopes that the process of changing the law would have a chilling effect on business conducted by European countries with Chinese telecom equipment makers, according to one of the EU officials.\n\nWAKE-UP CALL\n\nThe four EU officials say a wake-up call was Poland's arrest of a Chinese employee of Huawei and a former Polish security official on spying allegations earlier this month, which Huawei denies.\n\nWarsaw is in close contact with the Commission in Brussels and is pushing the EU to use legislation to exclude companies such as Huawei, according to a senior Polish government source.\n\nChina's Premier Li Keqiang is also expected to raise objections to any EU ban on Chinese equipment with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk at an annual summit in Brussels, which has been brought forward to April 9 at Beijing's request, the officials said.

Michigan said all state offices would remain closed through Thursday.\n\nIn a rare move, the US Postal Service appeared to temporarily set aside its credo that \"neither snow nor rain... nor gloom of night\" would stop its work as it halted deliveries from parts of the Dakotas through Ohio.\n\nAt least eight deaths related to extreme cold weather have been reported since last Saturday in Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, officials and media reports said.\n\nIn Detroit, a 70-year-old man was found dead on Wednesday on a residential street, a Detroit police spokesman said. About 24km south in the community of Ecorse, a former city councilman in his 70s and dressed only in sleepwear was also found dead on Wednesday, Ecorse police said.\n\nA University of Iowa student was found dead outside a building at the campus early on Wednesday, the school said in a statement. The death of Mr Gerald Belz, a pre-med student in his second year at the school, was believed to be weather-related, the statement said.\n\nStreets in Chicago were nearly empty, with few people walking outside in the painfully cold air as temperatures hovered around -28 deg C.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The frigid winds were headed for the US East Coast later on Wednesday into Thursday.\n\nMore than a thousand flights, close to two-thirds of those scheduled, were cancelled on Wednesday into or out of Chicago O'Hare and Chicago Midway international airports, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\nAmtrak cancelled all trains in and out of Chicago on Wednesday.\n\nAt the Morning Joy Farm in Mercer, North Dakota, Ms Annie Carlson said her horses and sheep were doing fine.\n\n\"They can go into the barn if they wish,\" she said. \"They're snuggled in, warm and toasty.\"\n\nHer chickens, ducks and guinea hens were enjoying the 21 deg C climate inside their greenhouse-like hoop house, she said.\n\nMr Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the NWS, said some of the coldest wind chills were recorded in International Falls, Minnesota, at -48 deg C. Even the South Pole in Antarctica was warmer, with an expected low of -31 deg C with wind chill.\n\nTemperatures in Chicago will drop again \"quite precipitously\" on Wednesday night, Mr Orrison said, potentially breaking the record low of -33 deg C on Jan 21, 1985, the same day as Mr Ronald Reagan's second presidential inauguration.\n\nBanks and stores closed for business. Waste Management Inc, a major trash collection company, said it was cancelling pickups in counties across the Midwest on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nWARMING CENTRES\n\nThe bitter cold was caused by a displacement of the polar vortex, a stream of air that normally spins around the stratosphere over the North Pole, but whose current was disrupted and was now pushing south.\n\nOfficials opened warming centres across the Midwest, and in Chicago, police stations were open to anyone seeking refuge from the cold. Five city buses were also deployed to serve as mobile warming centres for homeless people, while city police handed out hats, jackets and blankets.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department said it could encourage people to get out of the cold.\n\n\"But we will never force someone,\" police officer Michael Carroll said.\n\nUS homes and businesses will likely use record amounts of natural gas for heating on Wednesday, according to energy analysts.\n\nSome residents just to the north and north-west of the Twin Cities in Minnesota were asked by Xcel Energy to dial down their thermostats to 16 deg C because of the strains on its natural gas supply system.\n\nThe Michigan Agency for Energy said the state's utility companies had agreed not to shut off gas or electric supplies to delinquent customers for the rest of the week.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nWeather\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Flip7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nFormer NCT member Taeil sentenced to 3\u00bd years for rape\n\nWhy so many Chinese are drowning in debt\n\nAd\n\nWhy Companies Are Hiring Women Returning From Career Breaks\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

The average daily wastewater discharge will also increase in tandem with the three production lines, although at approximately 60 per cent to 350 tonnes per day.\n\nThe in-house wastewater treatment and water recycling system is able to reduce the average wastewater discharge from 11 tonnes to 8 tonnes for every tonne of metal alloy produced. This reduction could potentially lead to cost savings of approximately 20-40 per cent from the regulated fee charged for every tonne of wastewater discharged from the electroplating production facility.\n\nThe group said that its wastewater treatment and water recycling initiative is also aligned with the Chinese government's commitment to reduce pollution in the Chinese city.\n\nThe quality of water discharged from Nico Steel Technology (Suzhou) must meet the \"stringent standards\" set by the local authorities for the industrial park. The aggregate amount of discharged water per day must also not exceed 500 tonnes.\n\nThese standards are closely monitored by the management of the industrial park and failure to comply could lead to an immediate production halt, or even a revocation of the operating licence, said the group.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The prosecution dropped its appeal against his sentence.\n\nBrochez, 34, was\n\nsentenced in March 2017 to 28 months in jail\n\n, and was deported in April last year after completing his sentence.\n\nLer told the police that he and Brochez had problems in their relationship in early 2009.\n\nThe two became acquainted through a gay dating website and met in person for the first time in Hong Kong in 2007. By January the next year, Brochez had moved to Singapore and was living with Ler in his Craig Road apartment.\n\nLer said that Brochez had accused him of sharing a screenshot of the HIV Registry with another individual and telling him that Brochez was HIV-positive.\n\nHe added that some time towards the end of 2012, he was asked by Dr Jeffrey Cutter - then director of the Communicable Diseases Division at MOH - about Brochez's allegations against him. Specifically, Dr Cutter had asked Ler if he had taken screenshots of the HIV Registry.\n\n\"Following this, the accused (Ler) was informed of an official investigation by MOH in respect of the allegations made by Mikhy against him,\" said court papers.\n\nIn September 2013, Ler was contacted by an officer from MOH's Surveillance and Enforcement Branch (SEB).\n\nAround Oct 4 that year, MOM received information from MOH that Brochez was HIV-positive and might have made a false declaration in his application in 2011 for a Personalised Employment Pass (PEP).\n\nMOM informed Brochez about the tip-off it had received and instructed him on Oct 8 to cancel his PEP by Nov 8, failing which the ministry would cancel it.\n\nBut Brochez replied that he would supply \"proof of being free of HIV\" to MOM.\n\nOn Nov 22, 2013, he went to a clinic where Ler was working as a locum.

The flaw also allowed video to be sent if the other user clicked either their power button or one of the volume controls.\n\nCupertino, California-based Apple mitigated the problem on Monday by remotely disabling multi-person FaceTime. It also said it would release a software update later this week to fix the issue.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Jayakumar, Ambassador-at-large Tommy Koh and Deputy Attorney-General Lionel Yee. The trio were involved in two legal cases over Pedra Branca, the most recent of which was to go before an international court last June,\n\nbut Malaysia pulled out before it took place\n\n.\n\nThey have written a book,\n\nPedra Branca: Story Of The Unheard Cases\n\n, which gives a behind-the-scenes account of the latest case and how Singapore prepared to counter Malaysia's applications for a revision and interpretation of the 2008 International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that gave Singapore sovereignty over Pedra Branca.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who launched the book yesterday, said it \"tells the story of a small country mounting a huge and robust effort on the global stage\", and \"records an important chapter in a much longer story of ups and downs in our bilateral relations with Malaysia\".\n\nReferring to recent bilateral issues on territorial waters and airspace management, Dr Balakrishnan said he had\n\nspoken about Singapore's position and approach in Parliament earlier this month\n\nand did not want to go into detail.\n\nBut, he added: \"Let me just underscore this: As a small nation, we want good relations with all our neighbours, we want to have as many friends as possible. And this is important when we address the inevitable bilateral issues that will crop up from time to time.\n\n\"Our paramount objective will always be to protect our sovereignty, independence and national interests, and to do so in accordance with international law and to ensure that all parties fully honour the agreements which we have solemnly entered into,\" he added.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It was made after Malaysia unilaterally extended the Johor Baru port limits, encroaching into territorial waters which Singapore regards as its own.\n\nThe Unclos declaration ensures no country can unilaterally initiate third-party arbitration or adjudication on maritime boundary disputes against Singapore.\n\nProf Koh said it was done to prevent Malaysia from making a \"pre-emptive strike\" and initiating unilateral proceedings against Singapore - which was what it did in 2003 in a land reclamation dispute.\n\nHe added: \"Singapore has not changed our consistent policy of upholding international law... If negotiations fail, we are willing to refer the disputes to a binding third-party dispute settlement procedure.

They spoke of a mix of enforcement tools, as Democrats had urged.\n\nThe long, contentious debate over one of Mr Trump's biggest 2016 campaign promises - a concrete border wall financed by Mexico - entered a new stage with the committee's launch last week ending a 35-day partial closure of the government.\n\nLawmakers have an opportunity, Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito said, to choose \"all of the above\" for border investments, \"including physical barriers where it makes sense\". Even Mr Trump's early-morning Twitter message on the committee's urgent work left some wiggle room on the wall.\n\n\"If the committee of Republicans and Democrats now meeting on Border Security is not discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier, they are Wasting their time!\" he tweeted.\n\nThe Feb 15 deadline was imposed when Mr Trump agreed last week to end the shutdown and give lawmakers another chance to forge a deal or face another closure.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It included no money for a wall or physical barriers, but House Appropriations Committee chairwoman Nita Lowey said: \"Everything's on the table.\"\n\nBut she added: \"Smart border security is not overly reliant on physical barriers, which the Trump administration has failed to demonstrate are cost effective compared to better technology and more personnel.\n\n\"Every dollar spent on ineffective proposals means one less dollar invested in measures that actually keep us safe.\"\n\nHIGH-TECH INVESTMENT\n\nInstead of Mr Trump's wall, Democrats have been urging investment in high-tech equipment to enhance border security, such as drones, sensors and advanced scanning equipment, along with additional law enforcement personnel.\n\nOn Dec 22, about a quarter of the US government closed, leaving 800,000 federal workers without pay for the next five weeks. The shutdown was prompted by Mr Trump's demand that any shutdown-ending legislation contain US$5.7 billion (S$7.7 billion) for his wall.\n\nMexico long ago refused to pay for it. Mr Trump now wants US taxpayers to foot the bill for a project that some estimates have shown could cost more than US$23 billion. He says it is needed to keep out undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs.\n\nDemocrats broadly support more border security, but oppose the wall and stood firm against Mr Trump's demand that money for it be part of shutdown-ending legislation. Mr Trump temporarily gave up that demand last Friday and agreed to the committee.\n\nCongress has until Feb 15 to pass a package to fund several federal agencies through Sept 30. That gives lawmakers little more than a week to settle their differences and leave time for both houses of Congress to debate and vote on any deal.\n\nMr Trump has moved off his demand for a 3,220km concrete barrier and now talks about either a wall or \"physical barrier\" on only some parts of the border. Democrats in the past have backed \"fencing\". The Department of Homeland Security says 1,050km of pedestrian and vehicle barriers already exist.\n\nDemocrats repeatedly have voted for US$1.3 billion in added border funds for this year. Late last year, Mr Trump even signalled his willingness to go along with that figure before reversing course and insisting on US$5.7 billion for his wall.\n\nWednesday's committee meeting might be the only public session, with future sessions likely behind closed doors.\n\nIf lawmakers do not craft a deal Mr Trump likes, he has threatened two possible next steps: another shutdown, or declaring a \"national emergency\" and taking existing funds appropriated by Congress for other purposes - possibly from the Defence Department, for example - to build his wall.\n\nThere is bipartisan opposition in Congress to the emergency strategy, which likely would spark a legal challenge.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nEnjoy a 512GB upgrade & free data roaming on this 5G plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nSpaniards struggle to enjoy their own beaches in tourist deluge\n\nParaguay says will defend ties with Taiwan, host its president\n\nAd\n\nCurrency Volatility is Rising: Find Out How to Safeguard Your Business\n\nRead more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

It will be integrated with the planned Teck Ghee station on the future Cross Island Line. These works are expected to begin by the second quarter of this year.\n\nShanghai Tunnel Engineering has previously completed railway infrastructure projects with tunnels in the Circle Line, Downtown Line and Tuas West Extension. It is also currently involved in the construction of tunnels for the Thomson-East Coast Line.\n\nLast month, LTA awarded six contracts worth a total of\n\n$3.14 billion for the construction of six sections of the expressway\n\n.\n\nThose contracts were for the design and construction of tunnels, along with facilities such as pedestrian overhead bridges and bus stops. The North-South Corridor, which is largely underground, will feature dedicated bus and cycling lanes.

He was at a workshop for parents in Punggol View Primary School.\n\nHe noted that the series, which features a pair of fictional siblings - brother Nabil and sister Nabilah - through stories set in Singapore, has gained traction among pupils, parents and teachers.\n\nReferring to the series, he said afterwards to reporters: \"It has become a platform for us to inculcate the reading habits among our children. At the same time, It opens up many more opportunities to talk about issues and things that are relevant to the lives of our children in Singapore\u2026 It looks at it from the perspective of Malay language and mother tongue. That is very important for us.\"\n\nHe said the learning of the mother tongue was becoming more challenging with the widespread use of English, and \"going upstream\" to Kindergarten 1 and 2 with the reader series would expose children to the mother tongue at an early age.\n\nThe books for K1 and K2 children, as well as for Primary 5 and 6 pupils, will be rolled out by 2021.

Employers also contribute a smaller proportion.\n\n\"With longer life expectancy and a smaller base of family support, Singaporeans need to be even more self-reliant in securing a stream of lifelong income for retirement,\" PAP.SG said in a 21-page position paper released yesterday at the party's headquarters in Bedok.\n\nIn the paper, which was submitted to the Government, the group added that increasing CPF contribution rates for workers beyond 55 would help boost their retirement adequacy and ensure older workers are paid the same as their younger colleagues for doing the same job.\n\nA motion will be tabled on matters raised in the paper at the next Parliament sitting on Feb 11, said Mr Tan, who is also Speaker of Parliament. The paper comes weeks before the Budget statement is delivered by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat on Feb 18.\n\nWholesaler Par International's managing director David Tan said unless there is government support to offset added costs for businesses - if CPF contribution rates for older workers are increased - firms might be less willing to retain seniors.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It added that policies are already there for older workers to have more opportunities, with grants to help industries redesign jobs for older workers, as well as train and acclimatise seniors to new industries.\n\n\"Where we can improve is to push for the adoption of these efforts in more industries,\" PAP.SG said, adding that seniors are potential manpower in a tight labour market. The paper also proposed that employers be given more help to manage the costs of hiring seniors.\n\nNee Soon GRC MP Henry Kwek said at a press conference yesterday that the rise of the sharing economy can mean more freelancing opportunities for seniors as well, but the issue is access to these roles. He added that more can be done to strengthen seniors' digital literacy.\n\nOn housing, the group suggested revising developmental guidelines for private sector developers who want to set up senior group homes that have assisted-living facilities.\n\nThere could be a separate land-use category for developers who want to build these homes, said Mr Kwek, so they are not competing with other forms of residences and can keep costs affordable.\n\nFormer PAP MP Chiang Hai Ding, a member of PAP.SG, said group homes can also be built in new or existing Housing Board blocks. Such homes already exist in some areas.\n\nThe paper added: \"Moving forward, our seniors want more diverse housing options. Many seniors prefer to maintain their independence and age in place.\"\n\nOther suggestions include providing an allowance for full-time caregivers like those caring for frail parents, and encouraging volunteerism and exercise among seniors.\n\nSee more on\n\nPAP\n\nAgeing\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nEnjoy a 512GB upgrade & free data roaming on this 5G plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nFormer NCT member Taeil sentenced to 3\u00bd years for rape\n\nSpaniards struggle to enjoy their own beaches in tourist deluge\n\nAd\n\nGet free installation and consultation with 5Gbps Broadband\n\nSign Up\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

An audio announcement will also be made in the bus whenever it is approaching a stop. Passengers with hearing aids that have the T-Loop feature - a special type of sound system - will be alerted to the upcoming bus stop through the system.\n\nIT program executive Chong Kwek Bin, 37, said the external bus speaker would be very helpful for visually impaired commuters like himself. And if the app is rolled out across the entire bus network, people with visual impairments \"can even explore bus routes\", he added.\n\nA survey\n\nconducted to gather feedback on the Land Transport Master Plan 2040\n\nfound that 85 per cent of commuters are willing to accept delays of up to five minutes to allow commuters with special needs to safely board or alight trains and buses.\n\nThe public consultation, which started in August last year, received more than 7,000 responses from commuters, academics, industry players and transport workers.\n\nThe respondents gave various suggestions to improve the transport system, including widening existing paths shared by pedestrians and cyclists as an alternative to building dedicated cycling paths.\n\nRespondents also generally agreed to prioritise the needs of commuters, such as those using buses or bicycles, over that of private car users when designing roads and paths.\n\nIn LTA's online survey, the number of people who supported reducing roads from three lanes to two lanes to create dedicated cycling paths was more than double that of those who opposed such measures.\n\nThe Land Transport Master Plan Advisory Panel will consider the views gathered and finalise recommendations to the Government by the middle of next month.\n\nSee more on\n\nLTA\n\nTransport policy\n\nPublic transport\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGet Galaxy Z Fold7 with $1,500 in savings on Device Plan\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nVietnamese man gets death penalty for murdering entire family\n\n18 years\u2019 jail for woman who hacked adoptive father to death after tussle over Sengkang flat\n\nAd\n\nCelebrate 25 years of connectivity with 5Gbps Broadband\n\nSign Up\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

These hotels are between a five-and 15-minute drive from Changi Airport.\n\nCapri's former owner Ascendas Frasers Pte Ltd and operator Frasers Hospitality Pte Ltd (FHPL) were slapped with the largest penalty of $793,925, with the hotel's current owner Frasers Hospitality Trustee Pte Ltd and FHPL handed a further fine of $216,526.\n\nThe Village hotels, which are both managed by Far East Hospitality Management Pte Ltd, were fined $286,610, while Crowne Plaza received a fine of $225,293.\n\nThe information shared across the four hotels included the percentage discount that corporate customers asked for during confidential negotiations, and the responses of the hotels' sales representatives.\n\nThe commission provided extracts of four WhatsApp conversations between the sales representatives at its media briefing, which it had obtained during its investigation that culminated in a raid on June 30, 2015.\n\nSales representatives of Capri and the two Village hotels exchanged information between July 3, 2014 and June 30, 2015.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Capri did not apply for leniency, CCCS added.\n\n\"The exchange of non-public commercially sensitive information between competitors is harmful to competition and customers in the market as it reduces the competitive pressures faced by competitors in determining their commercial decisions, including the price they will offer to customers,\" said the commission's chief executive Toh Han Li.\n\n\"If a business receives such information from its competitor, it should immediately and clearly distance itself from such conduct and report it to CCCS.\"\n\nMr Toh added that this was the second such case CCCS has handled where competitors shared commercially sensitive information, which is distinct from cases involving price-rigging behaviour.\n\nIn the other case, two ferry operators serving the Singapore-Batam route were in July 2012 fined $172,906 and $113,860 respectively for infringing the Competition Act.\n\nResponding to queries from The Straits Times, Far East Hospitality chief executive officer Arthur Kiong said: \"Although disappointed with the infringement decision, the Group respects the position taken by CCCS.\n\n\"We have and continue to take various steps to review and implement rigorous compliance and training programmes to ensure that our business practices are and continue to be fully compliant with all applicable laws.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nPrivacy issues\n\nCompetition laws\n\nHotels\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nPre-order Galaxy Z Fold7 to unlock a free storage upgrade\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\n18 years\u2019 jail for woman who hacked adoptive father to death after tussle over Sengkang flat\n\nAd\n\nHe Chose To Embark On A Career Switch In His 60s!\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nUnwrap an amazing SG60 offer\n\nSubscribe to ST to get 1 month of complimentary digital access* + $180 FairPrice Vouchers\n\n*Billed at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

His death is the fifth reported since September 2017, following four preceding years of zero training-and operations-related fatalities.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

It will also determine the contributory factors and make recommendations to rectify any lapses uncovered. The COI, convened by the Armed Forces Council last Friday, will submit its full report to the ERPSS for comments.\n\nThe ministry yesterday also provided details of the safety record for the SSPH and the standard operating procedures required of its operating and maintenance crew.\n\nIt said that in the last 15 years of SSPH operations, there has not been any reported injury of servicemen due to the gun being lowered for maintenance, or when operating in or firing the SSPH.\n\nIn the same period, more than 1,000 full-time servicemen, NSmen and regulars have been trained to operate the SSPH, with around 12,500 rounds fired.\n\nThe Chief of Army, Major-General Goh Si Hou, said at a press conference last Thursday that Mr Pang was in the SSPH cabin with two other servicemen - another technician and a gun detachment commander - when the incident happened.\n\nInitial findings showed that he suffered crush injuries when he was unable to get out of the gun barrel's way as it was lowered. When maintenance work is required during training and operations, a team of technicians is activated and they take charge of the SSPH.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the technicians may require the assistance of the gun commander. The army technicians are also trained and required to abide by the same drills and safety protocols as the four-man crew operating the SSPH.\n\nMindef said the SAF has reduced the training tempo for commanders and soldiers to assess safety protocols and plans in their units. \"The reduced training tempo will remain in place until the SAF is satisfied that training and other activities can be conducted safely. The SAF is committed to strengthening the safety culture on the ground,\" it added.\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of Defence\n\nDefence and military", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

Six more centres are expected to be set up by the four self-help groups by next year.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Iswaran. These included using state land for pop-up concepts and events, creating a local retail showcase and making the street more pedestrian-friendly.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the launch of Design Orchard, the realisation of the local retail and incubation space, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said that Orchard Road has come a long way from its days as a nutmeg and clove plantation, and must continue to be a place of innovation and evolution.\n\nAddressing building owners in the audience, he said that they should not feel constrained by the current rules when coming up with new concepts.\n\n\"Orchard Road is not a 2.4(km) IPPT run; we are not aiming for people to pass through Orchard Road in five or 10 minutes.

Landlords and retailers need to work closely to capitalise on the enhanced infrastructural changes.\"\n\nMs Esther Ho, director of Nanyang Polytechnic's School of Business Management, said that having themes in the sub-precincts will help developers focus more on aligning their malls with the concept and help avoid the \"cookie-cutter situation, where a shopper is confronted with the same brands or same merchandise assortment in different parts of Orchard Road\".\n\nAustralian urban planning consultancy Cistri, which conducted a $1.3 million study on Orchard Road last year and made recommendations for the shopping belt's long-term development, said that the proposals by the authorities build on the precinct's strengths.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It dealt mainly in local produce - agricultural and mineral products grown or produced in the surrounding archipelago - and sent them to colonial ports for packing and shipment to consumer countries. Trade also expanded to the various islands of the East Indies, the Peninsula, Siam and parts of Indo-China.\n\nWith a liberal immigration policy for traders and workers, the overlapping hinterlands and networks created a port city of immigrants from China, India, the Malay Archipelago and other places, said Prof Tan.\n\nThese different trading communities eventually constituted the plural and cosmopolitan society of Singapore, and from there, a local experience began to emerge, he said.\n\n\"Singapore became the heart of the intellectual world of South-east Asia. From the late 19th century onwards, the port city was not only bustling with commerce. It was a centre for Malay culture and literature, of Chinese diasporic intellectual and political ferment, and of Indian debates on cultural and religious reformism,\" he said.\n\n\"The port city became a dynamic force for social change.\"\n\nBy the late 19th century, Singapore became a staple port to the Malay peninsula. It was where tin, rubber and petroleum, extracted from the peninsula, were processed and exported elsewhere.\n\nBy this time, noted Prof Tan, Singapore had become so used to this hinterland that it had \"become inconceivable that the island could actually survive without it\".\n\nAfter World War II, Singapore's political leaders desired to create a common market with Malaya. Singapore briefly regained its northern hinterland when it formed Malaysia with the Federation of Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak in 1963.\n\nProf Tan noted that after Independence, Singapore continued to define and re-define its hinterland.\n\nIn the early 2000s, political leaders described Singapore as having a seven-hour hinterland, encompassing a region within a seven-hour flight radius from Singapore, referring to major markets such as Asean, China, India and Australia.\n\nWhile the port continues to shape the fortunes of the country, Prof Tan suggested other ways forward.\n\nNow a global city in a globalised world, the idea of a fixed economic hinterland has lost its meaning for Singapore. So his suggestion was to always remain open, be flexible and look out for opportunities.\n\n\"Hinterlands may shift, but if you can make yourself relevant, you will be able to adapt,\" he said.\n\nHe cited the examples of New York and London with their declining world ports and said both places \"have transformed into global cities with diverse functions\".\n\nSee more on\n\nHistory\n\nSingapore Bicentennial", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/ST_20190131_MZPORT_4590788.jpg?VersionId=cOE3R2CGAz3BYmHbA2QsmSqtmC7iVpxG", "alt_text": "Yale-NUS College president and historian Tan Tai Yong says Singapore's identity has been shaped by changes to its hinterland and port over seven centuries."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

She expressed the hope that the certainty of funding over a longer period of time would encourage volunteer welfare organisations to be open to trying out new approaches to support the vulnerable.\n\nThe 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study showed that one in seven adults had experienced a mood, anxiety or alcohol use disorder at some point in his lifetime and about three-quarters of these people did not seek help.\n\n\"This year, by spotlighting on mental health, I hope that we as a community are more aware of the needs of persons with mental health conditions and can better support them in their journey of recovery and reintegration.\n\n\"I hope that President's Challenge 2019 can bring about new programmes and approaches to help this group of individuals as well as their caregivers,\" said President Halimah.\n\nPresident's Challenge 2019, which focuses on mental health, will be raising funds for 67 organisations spanning a wide range of service sectors.\n\nSee more on\n\nMental health\n\nNational Council of Social Service (NCSS)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/ST_20190131_LVCHALLENGE87C5_4591001.jpg?VersionId=yh5CH5iRFyJcA1puykoR6pfgE1xZCSVg", "alt_text": "President Halimah Yacob hopes that the certainty of funding over a longer period of time would encourage volunteer welfare organisations to be open to trying out new approaches to support the vulnerable."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/ST_20190131_LVCHALLENGE_4591000.jpg?VersionId=8fN68OQxsGWo24sDgY3RfurOp3AmgkBY", "alt_text": "A panel of speakers sharing views on what recovery from mental health issues entails: (from left) Ms Tina Hung, deputy CEO, NCSS; Mr Jeffery Tan from Mindset Care; Ms Sumaiyah Mohamed from Club Heal; Professor Chua Hong Choon, CEO of IMH; Ms Porsche"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

The male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes do not bite and when they mate with wild female Aedes mosquitoes, the eggs do not hatch.\n\nST PHOTOS: JONATHAN CHOO\n\nCheryl Teh\n\nFollow topic:\n\nDengue fever\n\nPublished\u00a0Jan 31, 2019, 05:00 AM\n\nThe population of dengue-carrying mosquitoes in Nee Soon East and Tampines West has been cut by at least half after\n\nthe release of sterile male mosquitoes\n\n, which leads to eggs that cannot hatch. And this success will see the scheme, labelled Project Wolbachia, expanded to wider areas in the two estates.\n\nFrom April last year to this month, the National Environment Agency (NEA) saw an 80 per cent fall in the Aedes mosquito population in a research area in Nee Soon East. The population was halved in the Tampines West study site, the agency said yesterday.\n\nStill, \"it is not a magic bullet\" that will solve the mosquito problem, said Associate Professor Ng Lee Ching, director of the NEA's Environmental Health Institute. \"It will complement what we are doing: source reduction, mozzie wipeout (campaign), and removing as many mosquitoes as possible from the community.\"\n\nDengue continues to be a perennial problem for Singapore. There were 455 cases reported in just the first two weeks of this month - triple the number reported over the same two-week period in January last year.\n\nThe Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes' job is to control and reduce the Aedes aegypti mosquito population,\n\nthe primary species responsible for transmitting dengue and Zika\n\n. Eggs produced from the union of a male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquito and the female Aedes mosquito will not hatch. This limits the number of mosquito larvae each female Aedes mosquito can produce.\n\nResearch on the project started in 2009 and the first phase of the field studies started in 2016.\n\nThe first\n\nsmall-scale field studies in Braddell Heights\n\n, Nee Soon East and Tampines West examined the behaviour of the Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti in the urban environment, such as how far and high they fly, and how well they could compete with their wild counterparts to mate with females.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The agency also released the Wolbachia mosquitoes at higher floors, as only 6 per cent of the adult male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes released at the ground floor were later found on the ninth floor and higher.\n\nThe next phase, which will start next month, will see a doubling of the number of HDB blocks where the Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are released.\n\n\"The data that has been generated through the different phases of the field study is essential in developing an effective long-term mosquito suppression programme for Singapore,\" said Professor Ary Hoffmann, Laureate Professor at the University of Melbourne.\n\nHe is a member of Singapore's Dengue Expert Advisory Programme, which comprises experts on vector-borne diseases from Singapore, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nDecreasing the population of Aedes mosquitoes drastically might be possible in the long run, said Prof Hoffmann, who cited the example of a study in Guangzhou, where the mosquito population was reduced by 99 per cent.\n\nBut Singapore faces different challenges, he said. Compared with the urbanised, high-rise environment here, one-to two-storey buildings are prevalent in Guangzhou, which made it easier to control the population.\n\nIn the third phase, researchers will look into how many male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes should be released to maintain a low Aedes mosquito population.\n\nThe agency will also adjust the number of mosquitoes to be released along the way - to maintain the current mosquito population, or to suppress higher numbers in the expanded area.\n\nThey will also develop the production and release of these mosquitoes on a large scale.\n\nSix of these male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are currently released weekly, for every person in the study area.\n\nThe NEA said yesterday that the improved results from phase two are due to the expanded area of study sites and the Wolbachia mosquitoes being released at higher floors, in addition to ground-floor releases.\n\nIn the third phase of the project, mosquitoes will be released weekly at 84 blocks in Nee Soon East, and 60 blocks in Tampines West.\n\nWith this expansion, the study will involve the largest number of households since it started - with 7,950 in Nee Soon East, and 5,560 households in Tampines West.\n\nMosquitoes will continue to be released around the HDB blocks, and along common corridors, but not in homes.\n\nResidents at the field study sites might notice an increase in mosquitoes during the field study, but these male mosquitoes released will not bite or transmit diseases, NEA said.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nDengue fever\n\nNational Environment Agency\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nGalaxy Z Flip7: Bonus trade-in cash, free upgrade & more\n\nOrder Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nFormer NCT member Taeil sentenced to 3\u00bd years for rape\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nCurrency Volatility is Rising: Find Out How to Safeguard Your Business\n\nRead more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/ST_20190131_CTMOSQUITOXLJA_4591379.jpg?VersionId=re0O5PcEtZFhmHY7rlrngRuaHRqvfF6A", "alt_text": "The mosquito eggs in the beaker (bottom left) are fertilised and kept in trays (above) until the mosquitoes are almost fully grown and ready for release.

The public spaces are also designed to maximise natural breeze passing through.\n\nProject partners include architecture firm Serie+Multiply, infrastructure consultancy Surbana Jurong and contractor Kajima Corporation.\n\nConstruction for SDE4 began about two years ago and the building can hold about 400 students.\n\nOther net-zero energy buildings here are in the works.\n\nThe Tahir Foundation Connexion, which is also fully solar-powered, is due to be completed at the end of this year at Singapore Management University.\n\nExisting net-zero energy buildings here, such as the BCA (Building and Construction Authority) Academy, have been modified to become so.\n\nSee more on\n\nNUS\n\nBuildings\n\nSustainable living/development", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

He did not tell her of the possible side effects of the injection but had not actively recommended the treatment.\n\nThe injection can cause a patient to experience increased pain and inflammation in the area injected, which can be worse than the pain and inflammation caused by the condition being treated. The pain typically lasts for one to two days.\n\nMore than 4,000 people, mostly doctors, later\n\nsigned a petition to Health Minister Gan Kim Yong following the ruling\n\n, concerned that the ruling could change the way medicine is practised here by imposing a significant additional burden on doctors.\n\nSMC yesterday said the court clarified that an \"information dump\" would not be appropriate, and that \"a reasonable patient would not need or want to know and understand every iota of information before deciding whether to undergo a proposed treatment\".\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

However, the tribunal said that it would be good clinical practice to document in the case notes that a patient had been informed and was agreeable to the injection - \"a proposition which no doctor would reasonably disagree with\", said SMC.\n\nDr Lim had admitted that he had not advised the patient of any possible complications, said SMC.\n\n\"He explained that this case was an isolated incident and wholly uncharacteristic of his usual clinical practice, as he could normally outline all treatment options to his patients, including the possible complications of the treatment,\" it said.\n\n\"It should be emphasised that Dr Lim was charged for wholly failing to inform the patient of any possible complications and not for failing to inform the patient of all possible complications that could arise from the H&L injection.\"\n\nDr Tho Kam San, who started the petition, told The Straits Times that he respects the SMC's decision and was glad to note that doctors would not face the expectation to inform their patients of every possible complication.\n\n\"We would like to thank Minister Gan Kim Yong and SMC for clarifying the position on this issue.

I feel strongly that it is.\"\n\nTaken together, the balance sheet announcement and the shift on rate hikes was meant to convey maximum flexibility from a central bank buffeted in recent weeks by financial market volatility, signs of a global economic slowdown and a partial US government shutdown that clouds the economy.\n\n\"This marks a full 180 from what the Fed was signalling just a few months ago,\" said Mr Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, in Newport Beach, California.\n\nAfter the Fed statement, US stocks added to gains, with the S&P 500 index rising 1.5 per cent, while the dollar and short-term yields fell as investors gauged an even lower probability of additional rate hikes anytime soon.\n\nMarket expectations of future rates fell further. Contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate continued to price about a one-in-four chance of a hike in 2019, and contracts maturing in 2020 were signalling a small but rising chance of a rate cut then.\n\nThe Fed's policy statement left its overnight benchmark lending rate in a target range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.\n\nThe US central bank said continued economic and job growth was still \"the most likely\" outcome. But it removed language from its December policy statement that risks to the outlook were \"roughly balanced\".\n\nCLOUDIER OUTLOOK\n\nThe Fed raised rates four times last year including in December, when it signalled it would do so twice more this year.\n\nThe economic outlook, however, has become more clouded as a result of recent volatility in financial markets and signs that growth is slowing overseas, including in China and the euro zone. There are also fears the 35-day partial shutdown of the US government may crimp consumer spending.\n\n\"In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the committee will be patient\" in determining future rate hikes, the Fed's rate-setting committee said in the policy statement.\n\nThe Fed made no change to the US$50 billion maximum monthly runoff of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities from its balance sheet. Some traders have urged it to slow or halt its pullback from the bond markets, at least for now.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Fed said that it had decided to continue managing policy with a system of \"ample\" reserves, reinforcing the notion that the rundown may end sooner than expected.\n\n\"Overall, this signals the Fed will not be on autopilot going forward,\" said Mr Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.\n\nThe downgrade in the Fed's language around rate increases included a change in its description of economic growth from\"strong\" to \"solid\", and it noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation have \"moved lower in recent months\".\n\nThe Fed's policy decision was unanimous.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS Federal Reserve\n\nInterest rates\n\nJerome Powell", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/2019-01-25t120759z_2120706880_rc18a282c330_rtrmadp_3_global-economy.jpg?VersionId=HCmQVgMB9b.Z.3RvvISxro1mK7BMIjYZ", "alt_text": null}]}

One went to Peru, and another to the Dominican Republic.\n\nMore than 40 people have died so far in and around the protests that began a week ago, the United Nations human rights office said. Hundreds have also been arrested, including children.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump and Mr Guaido agreed to maintain regular communication after Venezuelan authorities opened an investigation that could lead to Mr Guaido's arrest.\n\nOil prices rose nearly 3 per cent on Wednesday, as investors remained concerned about supply disruptions because of Venezuela. Mr Maduro, 56, says Mr Guaido is staging a US-directed coup against him.\n\nFacing the biggest challenge to his rule since replacing Hugo Chavez six years ago, Mr Maduro told Moscow's RIA news agency on Wednesday that Mr Trump ordered \"the government of Colombia and the Colombian mafia to kill me\", reprising an accusation of assassination plots that he has often made over the years.\n\nBogota and Washington have routinely denied that.\n\nHowever, speculation about military action against him was fuelled this week when Mr Bolton carried a notepad with the words \"5,000 troops to Colombia\".\n\nUS Major-General Mark Stammer, the commander of US Army South, was in Colombia on Wednesday, US embassy officials said.\n\nIn response to Mr Guaido's invitation to army officers to join his cause in return for an amnesty, Mr Maduro has made daily visits to troops, whose pledges of allegiance are televised.\n\nHe is not expected to stand down while he has the backing of senior military officers.\n\n\"Do you want to be a coward?\" he yelled in a call-and-response session with hundreds of soldiers on Wednesday.\n\n\"No, President,\" they shouted back.\n\nSee more on\n\nVenezuela\n\nPolitics and government\n\nDonald Trump", "images": []}

There's an ill wind blowing in the country,\" Gantz said in a Tel Aviv speech that was frequently interrupted by chants of support from the crowd.\n\n\"I see a leadership that's concerned with itself, not with you, not with us. It's time for a leadership that unites, that acts differently and leads differently.\"\n\nNetanyahu is fighting for his political life as he seeks a new term in April 9 parliamentary elections that would make him Israel's longest-serving prime minister. Although polls show him cruising to another victory, his political survival could be jeopardised if Attorney-General Avihai Mandelblit decides to indict him.\n\nNetanyahu has denied wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a witch hunt by left-wing opponents. He says he would continue to govern even if charged, and he's not obligated to resign unless convicted. Mandelblit, who is currently reviewing the case files, is expected to announce his intentions in the next few weeks.\n\nGantz didn't explicitly rule out serving in a Netanyahu-run government - unless the prime minister is indicted.\n\n\"The idea that a prime minister can rule after an indictment is served against him is ridiculous to me,\" he said.\n\nPolls show Gantz as the opposition figure most likely to deliver a serious contest at a time when many Israelis are despairing over the country's politics and its future in a volatile region. With just over two months until the vote, it's not clear if the opposition can muster enough strength to overpower Netanyahu's coalition of nationalist and religious parties.\n\nGantz's military credentials - he spent 38 years in the army before retiring in 2015 - are a top political asset against Netanyahu, who built his career as a defender of Israel's security. The ex-general also has a reputation for clean hands and affability.\n\nSecurity issues generally are a deciding factor when Israelis vote, and Gantz did not stray from the consensus. He pledged to retain Israel's West Bank settlement blocs, keep Jerusalem united under Israeli rule, hold on to the Jordan Rift Valley and maintain control of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nHe never mentioned a Palestinian state, and vowed not to \"tolerate a threat to Israeli sovereignty\" from Iran.\n\nIn his first foray into politics, Gantz's Israel Resilience party is running second only to Netanyahu's Likud, albeit with half the number of mandates, according to recent polls. Gantz told supporters Tuesday he's interested in forming political alliances that could bolster the party.\n\nBefore his speech, Gantz agreed to run on a joint ticket with Moshe Ya'alon, another ex-military chief who served as defence minister under Netanyahu until an acrimonious parting.\n\n\"Benny, we're here to win,\" Ya'alon said as he joined Gantz onstage.\n\nDespite Gantz's decidedly mainstream approach, Netanyahu and his allies branded the former military chief with a label they consider the kiss of death.\n\n\"Whoever says he's not right and not left - is left,\" the prime minister wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nSee more on\n\nIsrael\n\nPolitics and government\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu", "images": []}

Some of the damage is tangible, such as jobs, investment and capital; some of it less so, like international clout and talent.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May is aiming to renegotiate the most contentious part of her separation deal with the European Union after it was rejected by Parliament. Officials in Brussels have already warned they won't even consider her demands. Meanwhile, the threat of economic chaos still looms over her country.\n\nHere's a look at where there's been the biggest impact so far.\n\nFinance\n\nThe City of London has seen a steady outpouring of money and jobs as the world's biggest financial companies reorient their European footprints to protect business.\n\nFive of the largest banks looking to serve the continent are transferring 750 billion euros (S$1.16 trillion) of balance-sheet assets to Frankfurt, according to people familiar with the matter. They've had to move capital to get EU approval to continue providing services across the bloc.\n\nExchanges handling daily transactions have also upped sticks or at least reproduced their London services on the continent. CME Group Inc. has moved its US$228 billion-a-day European market for short-term financing, the largest in the region, to Amsterdam.\n\nWhile fewer bankers have left London than first estimated, moves are being made. The world's biggest banks have outlined plans to transfer several thousand staff to cities such as Paris, Dublin and Madrid. Those personnel shifts are likely to be irreversible, according to TheCityUK, a lobby group.\n\nThe Economy\n\nThe pound has declined more than 10 per cent against the euro since Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016. Exporters may have benefited, but the increasing cost of imported goods and services boosted inflation.\n\nThe effect is a drop in purchasing power for consumers, making life even more difficult for the nation's beleaguered retailers.\n\nBusinesses have also been deferring spending decisions as they ride out the uncertainty over what form Brexit will take. The Bank of England had forecast zero growth in investment for 2018. Officials have also warned it may not be possible to regain all the lost ground, with central bank policy maker Michael Saunders saying some of it might be a \"permanent loss.\"\n\nGrowth has also taken a hit. A UBS study in September 2017 suggested the referendum had already cost Britain more than 2 per cent of economic output. The damage could be long-lasting, with the economy not predicted to return to its pre-referendum pace of growth until beyond 2020, according to forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nThe departure of the European Medicines Agency to Amsterdam has wounded Britain's pharmaceutical industry. The agency had been in London for 22 years.\n\nDrug companies have been spending money to expand testing facilities in the EU and safeguard their ability to market across the bloc. The money, the industry argues, could have been spent on developing new treatments.\n\nThe EMA, which oversees drugs for about 500 million people, has also stopped assigning work to the UK's pharmaceutical regulator, unsure whether the two organisations will still be collaborating after Brexit.\n\nSkills\n\nNet immigration from the EU to Britain has fallen to its lowest level in six years, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThat has hurt the hospitality industry, agriculture, construction and the National Health Service. They all face labour shortages and have traditionally relied on EU workers.\n\nThen there's higher education. Many are concerned about the impact on international student enrollment and cross-cultural exchanges and learning programmes within the EU. Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh in part blamed Brexit for job cuts in 2017, while Manchester University also cited the uncertainty surrounding Britain's departure when announcing the need to reduce costs.\n\nMedia\n\nA flurry of international media companies has already moved broadcast licences out of the UK, not waiting for any resolution to the Brexit impasse in Westminster.\n\nDiscovery Inc. and Comcast Corp.'s NBC Universal, which currently use UK permits to beam channels across Europe, are among them. Discovery is moving some staff and licences to Amsterdam while NBC Universal has filed applications in Germany.\n\nEven the venerable BBC, the UK's national broadcaster founded in the 1920s, is in talks with Irish and Dutch regulators about transferring some licences into the EU for its commercial channels.\n\nHousing\n\nBrexit uncertainty has hit the UK housing market. An index of prices by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors slipped to its weakest level in six years at the end of 2018.\n\nThere's been a particular slowdown in transactions in London, where the number of sales at the end of last year was at the lowest annualised level since RICS began compiling the data in 1994.\n\nCredit\n\nUncertainty about the pound and the economy have exacerbated a decline in sterling's role in global credit markets. Overseas non-financial companies only sold 7 billion pounds (S$12.4 billion) of notes last year, less than half the amount issued in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSales of pound-denominated corporate bonds also had their longest drought in nearly two decades at the end of 2018, as borrowers shied away from a market rattled by Brexit uncertainty. The cost of insuring the subordinated bonds of major British banks has also been rising in recent months.\n\nStatus\n\nBritain's status as European hub of choice has suffered a blow. Japanese electronics groups Sony Corp and Panasonic Corp, insurer Chubb Ltd. and money-exchange firm TransferWise are among the companies who have moved their EU headquarters or set up new subsidiaries.\n\nSee more on\n\nBrexit\n\nBritain\n\nEU\n\nFinancial services", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/topshots-topshot-britain-eu-politics-brexit-083721.jpg?VersionId=6JNOVzMTkAAucl6L7_oYathtxRA56b6L", "alt_text": null}]}

This is the main issue at the end of the day,\" Rahat said.\n\nA poll published on Wednesday by Israeli news site Walla! gave Gantz's party 19 spots in the 120-seat parliament, up from around 12-13 in polls before his speech.\n\nThe survey of 1,009 Jews and Arabs, conducted by Panel Politics, showed Netanyahu's Likud slipping to 29 seats from a previous 33.\n\nSee more on\n\nIsrael\n\nPolitics and government\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/07330628.jpg?VersionId=TXueh5okVp9gqkA4qYAF4XHgzFrWn1y8", "alt_text": null}]}

He should understand the Sports Hub's role in Singapore society, and how to work with key local stakeholders.\n\n\"It would also be best if he comes from the private sector because the commercial mindset is important to make his stint successful as he sets about to fill the calendar, attract events and get the best deals.\"\n\nKoh Ching Ching, head of group brand and communications at OCBC, the Hub's Premier Founding Partner, noted that the new CEO needs to make the Sports Hub a world-class \"beacon for Singaporeans as well as overseas markets\".\n\nShe added: \"We all want the Singapore Sports Hub to be a global sports and entertainment hub; that is why it is configured as a commercial project - to optimise the absorption of the best practices and talent.\n\n\"At the same time, the Sports Hub serves the local community by hosting essential grassroots programmes and activities.\n\n\"We would look to the new CEO to fundamentally integrate both interests and be able to fashion successful engagements for both corporates and the community.\"\n\nWhen Oon was appointed the CEO in January last year, he acknowledged the need to balance the Government's social objectives with the private sector's economic objectives, but made clear his priority was to serve all Singaporeans.\n\nNetball Singapore CEO Cyrus Medora said the balancing act is a \"real struggle\", but hopes the incoming Sports Hub CEO will have a heart for Singapore sports.\n\nHe said: \"I think Jin Teik did okay in many aspects, and as a Singaporean he did his best to showcase Singapore sports.\n\n\"From a Singaporean point of view, I would like the Sports Hub to host more local events. For that to happen, the next CEO should be someone who cares about Singapore sports and is able to create a national identity for the Hub with local sports.\"\n\nOon's predecessor Manu Sawhney, on the other hand, was seen as more business-like.\n\nThe insider said, however, that neither were suited for the role.\n\nThe source said: \"Jin Teik and Manu Sawhney before him have more experience as sports-based executives or administrators, but running the Sports Hub is closer to running the Singapore Expo than a national sports association as it entails managing a calendar of events, balancing commercial and public aspects, combining facilities, events and marketing expertise.\"\n\nWith a spate of high-profile departures in recent years - chief operating officer Wong Lup Wai and chief financial officer Sandy Tay had also resigned recently - James Walton, sports business group leader for Deloitte Singapore and South-east Asia, believes the next CEO should also be able to prevent such future upheavals.\n\nHe said: \"The new CEO needs to be a steady pair of hands to stabilise SPHL (Sports Hub Pte Ltd) and help retain their talented people.\n\n\"He also needs to have contacts and connections to identify an increased calendar of top events and help work with Singapore Tourism Board, Sport Singapore and other agencies to bring them in, as well as innovation and creativity to engage with the Singaporean population and create unique experiences befitting this great facility.\"\n\nCIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun felt that the new CEO must be given clear objectives and priorities, with seemingly conflicting public- and private-sector interests.\n\nHe said: \"They have to be clear what they want to achieve. I don't think it matters if he is local or foreign, but he has to be a businessman. If they are bottom-line driven, the new CEO has to be ruthless because he cannot be running certain local events at a loss.\n\n\"Otherwise, if they are not clear about this, the new CEO will still be pulled in different directions and the turnovers will continue.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Sports Hub\n\nSports and recreation", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/31/wj_4031.jpg?VersionId=oDA3VezYJMCLBJvj0E3aHWk3_iS8nf9g", "alt_text": null}]}

But Coveney told national broadcaster RTE that none of those proposals were new.\n\n\"We have been through all of these things. We have tested them and we have found that they do not stand up to scrutiny, and now we have a British prime minister advocating again for the same things that were tested,\" Coveney said.\n\n\"What we are being asked to do here is to compromise on a solution that works and to replace it with wishful thinking. That's what's being asked of the Irish government and we won't do it.\"\n\nMay has said she will seek \"legally binding changes\" to the divorce deal but has been met with a blunt response from the EU, with European Council President Donald Tusk, among others, backing Dublin in saying it was not up for renegotiation.\n\nCoveney said there were mechanisms to get around some of the challenges May faces but the only way to do so was through the accompanying political declaration on future EU-UK ties.\n\nUnlike the binding divorce agreement, the non-binding declaration can be renegotiated to ease concerns on the backstop, he said.\n\nHowever both sides were \"running out of road\" to prevent Britain crashing out of the bloc at the end of March without an agreement, he added.\n\nCoveney also challenged May to stand by previous statements that the backstop was necessary to rule out a return of checks between British-run Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.

The prosecution has dropped its appeal against his sentence.\n\nAccording to Ler's police statement that was submitted as evidence in his trial, he said he and Brochez had problems in their relationship in early 2009.\n\nThe two got to know each other through a gay dating website and first met in person in Hong Kong in 2007. By January the following year, Brochez had moved to Singapore and was living with Ler in his Craig Road apartment.\n\nLer said the American claimed that the Singaporean had shared a screenshot of the HIV Registry with another individual, and also told the same person that Brochez was HIV-positive.\n\nIn the statement, Ler said that sometime towards the end of 2012, he was asked by Dr Jeffrey Cutter - then director of the Communicable Diseases Division from MOH - about Brochez's allegations against him.\n\nSpecifically, Dr Cutter asked Ler if he had taken screenshots from the HIV Registry.\n\n\"Following this, the accused (Ler) was informed of an official investigation by MOH in respect of the allegations made by Mikhy against him,\" according to the court papers.\n\nDr Cutter was later called by Ler as a witness during the trial.\n\nDr Cutter, who met Ler in 2010 when the latter was a medical officer at the Communicable Diseases Division, testified that he had received a complaint in 2013 against Ler from Brochez.\n\nDr Cutter said he then questioned Ler about the matter and subsequently escalated it to the enforcement branch of the MOH to investigate any potential wrongdoing.\n\nBased on the evidence, the trial judge said it showed that in August or September 2012, Brochez told Dr Cutter that Ler had breached medical confidentiality by divulging his HIV status to another individual.\n\nFollowing further complaints from Brochez in around August or September 2013, Dr Cutter decided or received instructions to launch an official investigation.\n\nIn September 2013, Ler was contacted by an officer from the MOH's Surveillance and Enforcement Branch (SEB).\n\nAround Oct 4, the MOM received information from the MOH that Brochez was HIV-positive and that he might have made a false declaration in his application in 2011 for a Personalised Employment Pass (PEP), which allowed him to change employers without getting a fresh Employment Pass.\n\nThe MOM told Brochez about this and instructed him on Oct 8 to cancel his PEP by Nov 8, failing which the ministry would cancel it.\n\nBut Brochez replied to say that he would supply \"proof of being free of HIV\" to the MOM.\n\nLer, who was working as a locum at a clinic at Great World City, then used his own blood for the test on Nov 22, 2013, and passed it off as Brochez's.\n\nThis was the same ruse that the two had used in 2008, when Brochez first applied for an EP, which he was issued with on March 24, 2008. An earlier test in Singapore, which he had taken using a fake Bahamian passport, had revealed that Brochez was HIV-positive.\n\nOn Nov 29, 2013, Brochez sent a copy of the falsified result to the MOM, which seemed to give him the all-clear and led the ministry to agree to retaining his PEP.\n\nBut the MOH investigator was surprised to find out that Ler had conducted the test on Brochez when he visited the clinic as part of his investigations into Ler.\n\nOn Dec 10, 2013, Ler was questioned by the same SEB officer at the Kranji Camp, where the doctor was on in-camp training duty.\n\nIn a statement recorded that day, Ler lied to the SEB officer that the blood was not taken from \"Mikhy\", who had accused him of leaking his HIV-positive status, but from another person. Ler was later convicted on this charge of lying to a public servant.\n\nThe SEB officer informed his superiors. A day later, a police report was lodged over a possible cheating offence over the Nov 22, 2013 blood test.\n\nOn Jan 23, 2014, Ler was questioned by the police, where he admitted to lying to the SEB officer on Dec 10, 2013. But Ler lied again that it was Brochez's blood - not his own - that was tested during the Nov 22 blood test.\n\nOn May 2, 2014, Brochez gave a statement to the police at the Central Police Station, where he lied that it was his blood that was tested during the HIV blood test. His false statement was intended to cause the police to cease investigations.\n\nThe MOH said Ler resigned in January 2014.\n\nThere are no details of further enforcement actions by the authorities until May 2016 when the MOH received information that Brochez was in possession of confidential information that appeared to be from the HIV Registry.\n\n- Additional reporting by Fabian Koh and Rei Kurohi\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of Health\n\nAids/HIV", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/30/befunky-collage_3.jpg?VersionId=iC3HX3zp47ihqWfgCQdGUIuAw1RlW8vJ", "alt_text": null}]}

Jayakumar, Ambassador-at-large Tommy Koh and Deputy Attorney-General Lionel Yee. The trio were involved in two legal cases over Pedra Branca, the most recent of which was to go before an international court last June,\n\nbut Malaysia pulled out before it took place\n\n.\n\nThey have written a book,\n\nPedra Branca: Story Of The Unheard Cases\n\n, which gives a behind-the-scenes account of the latest case and how Singapore prepared to counter Malaysia's applications for a revision and interpretation of the 2008 International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that gave Singapore sovereignty over Pedra Branca.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who launched the book on Wednesday, said it \"tells the story of a small country mounting a huge and robust effort on the global stage\", and \"records an important chapter in a much longer story of ups and downs in our bilateral relations with Malaysia\".\n\nReferring to recent bilateral issues on territorial waters and airspace management, Dr Balakrishnan said he had spoken about Singapore's position and approach\n\nin Parliament earlier this month\n\nand did not want to go into detail.\n\nBut, he added: \"Let me just underscore this: As a small nation, we want good relations with all our neighbours, we want to have as many friends as possible. And this is important when we address the inevitable bilateral issues that will crop up from time to time.\n\n\"Our paramount objective will always be to protect our sovereignty, independence and national interests, and to do so in accordance with international law and to ensure that all parties fully honour the agreements which we have solemnly entered into,\" he added.\n\nDuring the book's launch at The Pod in the National Library building, Prof Jayakumar, Prof Koh and Mr Yee also took part in a 30-minute panel discussion moderated by Ms Lydia Lim, head of training and talent development at The Straits Times.\n\nAsked what lessons could be gained from the two Pedra Branca cases, Prof Koh stressed the importance for Singapore to produce generations of good international lawyers, in the Attorney General's Chambers, universities and private sector.\n\nProf Koh said international law is a \"shield and sword\" for a small country like Singapore, to protect the country from actions by other states, and to take proactive actions to protect its interest against other countries.\n\nProf Jayakumar said good political leadership is needed to \"manage the bilateral relations in such a way that you keep things on an even keel\" and not to let the latest issue derail the overall tenor of cooperation and bilateral relations.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Yee said bilateral disputes involve many agencies of the Government, which have to work together cohesively as a team. Each must also go beyond the limits of their expertise, like the Singapore legal team having to understand the factual and technical aspects of the cases, Mr Yee added.\n\nDuring the session, Ms Lim asked the panel about Singapore's move in December to file a declaration under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos).\n\nIt was made after Malaysia unilaterally extended the Johor Baru port limits, encroaching into territorial waters which Singapore regards as its own.\n\nThe Unclos declaration ensures that no country would be able to unilaterally initiate third-party arbitration or adjudication on maritime boundary disputes against Singapore.\n\nProf Koh said this was done to prevent Malaysia from making a \"pre-emptive strike\" and initiating unilateral proceedings against Singapore - which was what it did in 2003 in a land reclamation dispute.\n\nHe added: \"Singapore has not changed our consistent policy of upholding international law... If negotiations fail, we are willing to refer the disputes to a binding third-party dispute settlement procedure.

There were others.\n\nThe Government and non-profit entity Art Outreach swooped in and worked tirelessly to set up mini-fair The ARTery at Marina Bay Sands, which helped a number of stranded galleries on short notice.\n\nEveryone pitched in to help, and worked together to achieve the common goal of helping to repair any resultant damage to Singapore's reputation as an arts hub.\n\nCommercial art fairs will come and go, but the groundswell of support and fellow feeling that this incident precipitated is something that will surely stand the test of time.\n\nIn more utilitarian terms, this combination of efficient community and government-led action is something of a national badge of pride.\n\nFinally and more importantly, we should not forget that the Singapore arts scene comprises more than just a commercial art fair driven by sales and purchases.\n\nIt is made up of an entire art community, as was evidenced by the diverse programming during Singapore Art Week. It featured site-specific installations, institutional shows, exhibitions by independent art spaces and much more - there was something appealing for every art lover.\n\nRather than looking for new players to step into the void left by Art Stage and put us back on the regional or global arts map, I would contend that the Singapore art community has plenty of mettle to take on the world stage on its own terms.\n\nJasdeep Sandhu\n\nSee more on\n\nToday's Letters\n\nNational Arts Council\n\nArt fairs/Art market", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/30/yq-pinkmen-30012019_2x_2x.jpg?VersionId=jeSJsce0Nm.9SZoFOdSqDh0TyAwZaXNk", "alt_text": null}]}

Due to weather conditions, the search would start at the end of this weekend and take up to three days.\n\n\"Based on a detailed assessment of the flight path and last known radar position, we have now identified a priority search area of approximately four square nautical miles,\" they said.\n\nA remotely operated vehicle will be used to examine visually any wreckage found.\n\nA privately funded operation is also set to search for wreckage on Sunday and the AAIB said it was liaising closely with those involved.\n\nSala had been travelling from Nantes to make his debut for Premier League side Cardiff City after being signed for a club record fee of \u20ac17 million (S$26 million).\n\nRescuers scoured over 4,000 sq km after the single-engined Piper Malibu plane went missing but had failed to find a trace of the aircraft until now.\n\nThe plane had been cruising at 5,000 feet (1,525m) when the pilot requested to descend to a lower altitude on passing Guernsey. It then lost radar contact at 2,300 feet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cardiff played their first game since Sala's disappearance, a 2-1 Premier League defeat at Arsenal, where tributes were paid to the missing player and pilot.\n\nSee more on\n\nEPL\n\nAir crashes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/30/2019-01-30t144405z_1944800602_rc1efdee8720_rtrmadp_3_soccer-sala-crash-police.jpg?VersionId=xio2MxjZBiv6.qQzp_dWzwaVcIZvy_Rk", "alt_text": null}]}

The company reacted after a separate developer reported the FaceTime flaw and it was written about on the Apple fan site 9to5mac.com, in an article that went viral.\n\nThe bug, and Apple's slow response to patching it, has renewed concerns about the company's commitment to security, even though it regularly advertises its bug reward program and boasts about the safety of its products.\n\nHours before Apple's statement addressing the bug Monday, Tim Cook, the company's chief executive, tweeted that \"we all must insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Rarely is there a software flaw that grants such high-level remote access and is so easy to manipulate: By adding a second person to a group FaceTime call, you can capture the audio and video of the first person called before they answer the phone, or even if they never answer.\n\n\"If these kinds of bugs are slipping through,\" said Patrick Wardle, the co-founder of Digita Security, which focuses on Apple-related security, \"you have to wonder if there are other problematic bugs that other hackers are exploiting that should have been caught.\"\n\nOn Monday, Apple said it was aware of the issue and had \"identified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week.\"\n\nBut the company has not addressed how the flaw passed through quality assurance, why it was so slow to respond to Thompson's urgent warnings, or whether it intends to reward the teenager whose mother raced to alert the company to the bug in the first place.\n\nA bug this easy to exploit is every company's worst security nightmare and every spy agency, cybercriminal and stalker's dream. In emails to Apple's product security team, Thompson noted that she and her son were just everyday citizens who believed they had uncovered a flaw that could undermine national security.\n\n\"My fear is that this flaw could be used for nefarious purposes,\" she wrote in a letter provided to The New York Times. \"Although this certainly raises privacy and security issues for private individuals, there is the potential that this could impact national security if, for example, government members were to fall victim to this eavesdropping flaw.\"\n\nMARKET FOR BUGS\n\nUnknown to Thompson, there is a healthy market for bugs and the code to weaponise them, which allow governments, defence contractors and cybercriminals to invisibly spy on a person's device without their knowledge, capturing everything from their location to information caught on their microphone and camera.\n\nThe FaceTime flaw, and other Apple bugs, can fetch tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, from dozens of brokers. Those brokers then sell those bugs for ever-higher sums to governments, and intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world. On the seedier side of the spectrum are brokers who will sell these tools on the dark web to the highest bidder.\n\nThe only catch is that hackers must promise never to disclose the flaw to the vendor for patching, so that buyers can keep their access.\n\nThe market for Apple flaws has soared in the post-Edward Snowden era as technology makers include more security, like end-to-end encryption, to thwart would-be spies. This month, Zerodium, a well-known broker, raised its reward for an Apple iOS bug to US$2 million (S$2.7 million).\n\nIn part to compete in that market, and reward those who do right by the company by notifying it of potentially lucrative bugs, Apple announced its own bounty programme in 2016 - the last of the Silicon Valley companies to do so.\n\nAt a hacker conference that year in Las Vegas, Apple made a surprise announcement: It said it would start paying rewards as high as US$200,000 to hackers who responsibly turned over crucial flaws in its products. But the bounty programme has been slow going, in part, hackers say, because they can make multiples of that bounty on the black market, and because Apple has taken its time rewarding them for reporting problems.\n\nThe FacePalm bug marks a particularly egregious case, researchers say, not just because it was discovered by a teenager simply trying to use his phone, but because it allowed full microphone and video access.\n\n\"This is a bug that Apple's Q&A should have caught,\" Wardle said. \"And where there's smoke, there's almost always fire.\"\n\nBug brokers say FacePalm, while impressive, would not have brought a top price because it leaves a record of the attack. The flaw works only if you FaceTime the person you want to capture audio and video for, notifying your target of the call.\n\nBugs that fetch US$2 million or US$3 million on the black market leave no trace, work more than 99.5 per cent of the time and work instantaneously, said Adriel Desautels, the chief executive of Netragard, a company that helps firms protect their software.\n\nIn this case, Desautels said, FacePalm is not as dangerous as a flaw that can covertly track someone's location, turn on their camera and capture video without a trace.\n\nBut, he added, \"It's pretty good for a high schooler.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nApple\n\niPhones\n\nCyber security", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}

The sun was out, and he and a group of fellow skiers had plans to hit the slopes at Deer Valley Ski Resort in Park City, Utah. Despite having skied for more than 30 years, it was Sanderson's first time at the renowned resort.\n\nBut what was supposed to be a fun day spent exploring new trails ended abruptly when Sanderson found himself carted down a beginner run by ski patrol, suffering from \"serious brain injuries\" and four broken ribs, which he now alleges were caused by Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nThe 72-year-old retired optometrist claims that Paltrow, 46, was \"skiing out of control\" when she hit him from behind, \"knocking him down hard, knocking him out\", according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by KUTV.\n\nInstead of staying to help, \"Paltrow got up, turned and skied away, leaving Sanderson stunned, lying in the snow, seriously injured\", the lawsuit said, describing the incident as a \"hit-and-run ski crash\".\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on Tuesday (Jan 29) in Utah state court, also alleges that Eric Christiansen, a Deer Valley ski instructor who was with Paltrow at the time, not only failed to call for help, but \"falsely\" accused Sanderson of having caused the crash.\n\nSanderson is suing Paltrow, Christiansen and the resort for \"negligent actions\", seeking an excess of US$3.1 million (S$4.2 million) in damages.\n\nA spokesman for Paltrow told The Washington Post in an e-mailed statement that the lawsuit \"is completely without merit\", adding: \"Anyone who reads the facts will realise that.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Seeing large signs as \"big as two refrigerators\" telling skiers to slow down, Sanderson said he decreased his speed appropriately and was \"just enjoying the day\".\n\n'HYSTERICAL SCREAM'\n\n\"Then, I heard this hysterical scream like you never hear on a ski run,\" he said. \"Never have I heard it in my life... like King Kong came out of the jungle or something.\"\n\nIn an instant, Sanderson said he felt something hit him in the back near his shoulder blades. The force of the impact knocked him face first into the slope.\n\nRobert B. Sykes, one of Sanderson's attorneys, alleges this was Paltrow, who had been coming down the mountain behind Sanderson at \"a very good rate of speed\", accompanied by a group of people that included ski instructors and the actress's family and friends.\n\n\"All I could think about was there was this lady that was kind of beside me and I thought, 'Don't get her tangled up in this because she may not be able to handle it either as a beginner,'\" said Sanderson, who is 1.72m tall and weighs about 72kg.\n\n\"I remember trying to lurch to my right, and I couldn't control it. I didn't realise there was weight on my back. I just remember my arms not being able to control myself and then going down, and that's all I remember to that point.\"\n\nWhen he regained consciousness, Sanderson said his goggles and helmet were filled with snow and all he felt was soreness.\n\n\"My ribs were really sore, and my brain felt like I'd been injected with Novocain,\" he said. \"It was just numb, nothing was making sense.\"\n\nCraig Ramon, one of the people who had been skiing with Sanderson, witnessed the crash and filled in the blanks. In a taped interview conducted by one of Sanderson's lawyers that was played at the news conference, Ramon said he too had heard \"a yell... or a noise\", before seeing Paltrow hit Sanderson.\n\n\"They looked like one person basically going down,\" he said, stacking his hands on top of one another to illustrate the collision. \"She lands right on top of him and then she slides off to the side.\"\n\nAs Sanderson lay motionless, Ramon said an instructor, whom he called a \"mountain host\", arrived and \"started yelling at Terry, 'What did you do?'\"\n\nPaltrow, Ramon said, was struggling to get up and did not respond to him repeatedly asking her if she was okay. After getting to her feet, Paltrow started skiing away and the rest of her group followed, Ramon said. The instructor helped Sanderson up before also leaving the pair behind to go after Paltrow, he said.\n\n\"You could tell he was in pain, and he wasn't really moving too well,\" Ramon said about Sanderson. \"He just seemed dazed.\"\n\nSanderson said he was slow to remember his name after the crash and could not recall where he was skiing. When he tried to ski down the hill, he said Ramon stopped him, saying, \"'You've forgotten how to ski, you have no idea what you're doing, so I'm going to find help.'\"\n\n'CLOSED BRAIN INJURY'\n\nBeyond the broken ribs, the lawsuit said Sanderson had suffered a \"closed brain injury\", which Sykes likened to \"shaken baby syndrome\". Long-term effects of the injury include loss of short-term memory, personality changes and problems with direction, Sykes said.\n\nSykes and Sanderson's other attorney, Lawrence D. Buhler, said Paltrow violated the National Ski Area Association's Responsibility Code, which instructs skiers to \"always stay in control, and be able to stop or avoid other people or objects\". It also dictates: \"People ahead of you have the right of way. It is your responsibility to avoid them.\"\n\nThey also alleged that the actress and her group did not comply with a Summit County, Utah, ordinance that bans skiing \"in a reckless or negligent manner\". The ordinance states that any skier \"involved in a collision that results in an injury\" has to offer help, notify ski area employees, and provide their name and address before leaving.\n\nSykes called the ordinance \"a very, very important rule for skiers\", adding, \"it even applies to celebrities, believe it or not\".\n\n\"If you have a collision, doesn't matter whose fault it is... it's your duty to hang around and render aid, even if you didn't cause it,\" he said. \"What Ms Paltrow did that day was knock down Terry Sanderson, pick herself up, dust herself off and ski off, without rendering any help.\"\n\nLawyers representing Paltrow \"don't deny the collision\", but they argue that \"Gwyneth Paltrow was downhill and Terry Sanderson hit\" her, Sykes said.\n\nPaltrow's spokesman confirmed this position to The Post.\n\nOn social media, many were critical of Sanderson and accused him of suing Paltrow only because of her fame and wealth, which he and his lawyers denied.\n\n\"I'm a proud person and I don't like to be told I'm not telling the truth,\" Sanderson said. \"And that she now is telling my truth... that's offensive to me.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nActors\n\nCelebrities\n\nWinter sports", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2019/01/30/2018-12-04t231541z_844981252_rc1521dda710_rtrmadp_3_people-ryan-murphy-star.jpg?VersionId=lkczk9S7C6A9DkVxqxIOY2xwCQIiWtpT", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b860a2cfcd1b72f65762b0410ccc20780606070d8d144c06713c2d1e6e77582a", "alt_text": "Investigations against 11 law practices have been concluded."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/21a769769f8fe9aa7e22a466dd2f31a3325bda40b15bde73c615455c9b1b2d35", "alt_text": "The loss of control - including seizures and psychotic episodes - have unsurprisingly led to the vapes acquiring names such as Space Oil and Zombie Vape."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b95b4c0f89146f37bc9e14510d9e16b18cc4b2ab148e7e104557cdf1035cf51d", "alt_text": "After a strong start to the year with 5.4 per cent growth in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter slowed to 5.2 per cent."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fb4e880c18d1dc45edb43e0576b73be06285ca399192361cfec701915a6c39b0", "alt_text": "The Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce set up to help businesses ride out these challenges on July 10 announced the Business Adaptation Grant."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49e0a60b215929ebe93ab6eea74d9675034e2e9b5076bba787cbc1f604582b3f", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87441a1a322d67492baa8b2230f4606d1cda10e7015c518d8d50d20a58634bdd", "alt_text": "Jean Ling with her husband Jake Oh and their three children Summer, 6,  Evan, 2, and Adel, 5 months, in their home on June 23, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0a27787d00c1c733aae5b92d97ab3df12a55413baf47d90b7e5810631d8275ef", "alt_text": "Facial ageing occurs at every level, from bone and muscle to fat and skin, and is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4693f96cf2b323ee3efa236520b149c8dfaea78090582884370e7c76ed2fa78", "alt_text": "Married couple Sivachandran Palaniasmy and Anitha Sivadasan have cared for more than 20 children, including those with special needs, since they started fostering in 2003."}]}
