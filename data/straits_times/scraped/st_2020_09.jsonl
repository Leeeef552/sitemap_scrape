In turn, this also means better jobs in HR,\" he said, noting that there are about 47,000 HR professionals in Singapore, of whom 90 per cent are local.\n\nMr Zaqy highlighted that median wages for HR professionals have grown by about 10 per cent from 2015, and HRTAP aims to support these workers to take on roles with higher value-add and wages through HR transformation.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The new systems have helped enhance its workers' digital competencies since, he added.\n\nThe HRTAP aims to have 5,000 HCDT assessments by 2025, and for 80 per cent of companies to have improved diagnostic scores by the same year, he said.\n\nIn a virtual panel discussion, several members of the HRTAP spoke on how HR will support business transformation, and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the role of HR professionals and the industry.\n\nIHRP chief executive Mayank Parekh emphasised the need for HR professionals to develop digital acumen, and utilise analytics to improve performance and employee experiences. \"It is critical now that HR leaders progress from just anecdotal approaches to convince business leaders to more evidence-based thinking and providing more data and decision science behind the recommendations that they are making,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nHuman resources\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nZaqy Mohamad", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign - DBS Wellness space 1 (CREDIT DBS Bank)\n \nCredit: Photo of DBS Bank office"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ababd7adbab5ef95d4223806a015c648e9803c8d554289cc24869840a46a74ae", "alt_text": "Enforcement action by the Health Sciences Authority netted a suspect and various vapes on July 10."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7f73688fa163929df2c176d392b660d82a63b73e970c811e2339978d254a5fcd", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo, with retirees Chong Hock Loo, 75, and Shirley Tan, 68, during the PCF Family Day event on July 13."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0748316b0c8c0488543313beecbd97ee6f6260fce547cdce53f76f53d9d6a49f", "alt_text": "From left: Pathlight School students Marcus Goh, Nurdaanya Mohamed Hafiz and Brennan Tay with their respective artwork, part of a total of 30 artwork that are selected in the Wing Tai X Pathlight School art competition to be displayed on a construction hoarding along Kim Seng Linear Park, on July 11, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0f74970f823073d68c58dca22ef69d6312f85ec19cd11cccf600d0046eabbb32", "alt_text": "Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - July 13, 2025 Italy's Jannik Sinner celebrates with the trophy after winning the men's final against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz REUTERS/Andrew Couldridge"}]}

The earliest day they will be able to enter is Oct 8.\n\nThe Air Travel Pass scheme allows for all forms of short-term travel, including leisure travel. This is in contrast to reciprocal green lane arrangements, which are usually for essential business and official travel. Visitors will have to take a swab test upon arrival, and can go about their activities after they get a negative test result. They will have to use the TraceTogether app while they are here, among other conditions.\n\nCAAS also said that Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning from Australia (excluding Victoria state) and Vietnam will be able to take a Covid-19 test upon arrival. This will replace the requirement of a seven-day stay-home notice with a test before the end of the notice.\n\nSince restrictions on visitors from Brunei and New Zealand were lifted on Sept 8, CAAS has approved 331 applications from such travellers. As at 5pm yesterday, 136 visitors have arrived. None of them tested positive for Covid-19 upon arrival.\n\nIn a Facebook post yesterday, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said he has spoken to Mr Michael McCormack, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister, and Mrs Tao Thi Than Huong, Vietnam's Ambassador to Singapore, about the move.\n\n\"They were appreciative of Singapore's decision, and when conditions are right, I believe they will consider reciprocating the lifting of restrictions to travellers from Singapore,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCAAS/Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\n\nAviation/Aerospace sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/yq-c3-30092020.jpg?VersionId=WrgdnBgJPNq7cK9z0b_By7lmGqLzRAbv", "alt_text": null}]}

Democrats got almost US$8 billion for a pandemic programme to feed children who normally receive school lunches.\n\nWith the temporary spending Bill finished, lawmakers will try to complete work on the 12 annual appropriations Bills for fiscal 2021 in the post-election lame-duck session in November and December.\n\nThe Senate hasn't drafted any of the Bills so far, and there is likely a battle ahead over paying for Trump's wall on the US-Mexico border and replacing military funds he redirected to pay for border security last year.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agreed earlier this month to keep discussion of a coronavirus relief package separate from the stopgap Bill.\n\nThe two leaders on Wednesday held their first in-person talks since August, and while no deal on the stimulus was reached, they plan to continue discussions.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nPolitics and government\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/08703815.jpg?VersionId=3fK_UNY049yULpjFly6lyxbMaxiYxzUu", "alt_text": null}]}

We aim to ramp this up gradually to provide 30,000 spaces each week. And this will allow congregants to perform their Friday prayers more regularly,\" he added.\n\nMuslims have to reserve their slots via an online booking system.\n\nSome mosques will run a pilot scheme to accommodate up to 250 congregants, split across five zones, for each of the three Friday prayer sessions weekly. The pilot to further raise the Friday prayer capacity is part of progressive reopening plans announced by Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong last Saturday.\n\nMr Esa said Muis will provide more details about the pilot after it gets more clarity and approval from the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. The mosques will be selected based on whether there is high demand for prayer slots and also if the venue has enough room to split congregants into five zones, he added.\n\nMuis' senior director of mosque and community development Helmy Isa also announced that, in line with the national guidelines for the silver generation, congregants aged 60 and above who are feeling well may return to the mosques.\n\nPreviously, when mosques reopened in June,\n\nMuis had advised seniors to refrain from visiting.\n\nMr Helmy, however, urged those who are feeling unwell, vulnerable individuals and children aged below 12 against visiting the mosques and to perform their prayers at home.\n\nMufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir noted that some challenges will remain as the pandemic is not over.\n\n\"Even with the increase in the number of prayer spaces, we will not be able to perform our Friday prayers... on a weekly basis yet,\" he said, adding that those who fail to secure a slot can skip the prayers and tune in to the sermons online.\n\nMr Helmy said aLIVE classes, an Islamic education programme, will gradually restart, with some mosques piloting physical classes from the middle of this month.

It is becoming more attractive to some as Beijing tightens its grip on Hong Kong.\n\n\"Amazon is always in a state of innovation and disruption,\" said Mr Justin Tang, the head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. \"Asia is a source of growth for them and they need to be near where their rivals are.\"\n\nAmazon currently has about 200 job openings in Singapore for roles such as sales, according to its career site. It launched its Singapore website, which was also its first in South-east Asia, last year. A representative for Amazon declined to comment.\n\nA spokesman for Citigroup confirmed it is giving up the space, but declined to say who is taking over. Some consumer banking staff, and employees in other functions, will relocate to Changi Business Park where the bank has bigger premises and a long-term lease, he said.\n\nAmazon, which has been rapidly expanding in Singapore, has existing offices in Capital Square and One George Street. A lease for the space in Asia Square Tower 1 would typically be for more than five years.\n\nCitigroup is among financial firms around the world grappling with what post-pandemic working life will look like, with some companies such as Nomura seeing opportunities to cut costly real estate by keeping a portion of staff at home.\n\nAlthough the Singapore Government has eased some Covid-19 restrictions, remote work is still the default option.\n\nCitigroup is reviewing its workspaces because of the virus and looking at other ways of working to allow flexible arrangements, the spokesman said. The bank on Tuesday said it will open its biggest wealth management hub globally in Singapore in December as it aims for double-digit growth in the nation.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\n\u2022 Additional reporting by Prisca Ang\n\nSee more on\n\nAmazon\n\nEDB", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/st_20201001_xamazon_60003682.jpg?VersionId=ulxCwsyInKWtV8Nn38PxQeG9PdAFHr.e", "alt_text": "Amazon will lease three floors at Asia Square Tower 1 (left), sources say.

Waldo Rubio dragged wide from close range and then Shon Weissman raced forward and forced Thibaut Courtois into a smart save.\n\nBut as the visitors were gaining in confidence, Madrid struck, Vinicius taking advantage of a string of defensive errors, the last committed by Bruno, his attempted clearance falling to the feet of the 20-year-old, who made no mistake.\n\nRaul Garcia and Waldo went close to an equaliser before Modric hit the post late on.\n\nSee more on\n\nLa Liga\n\nReal Madrid\n\nFootball matches", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/08710367.jpg?VersionId=kolyZpRwhkV1Xk3D.eOAIJs7KN.hXuK5", "alt_text": null}]}

They cannot be identified as they are below 18.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Melina Chew said that the teens, who would frequently hang out in the bedroom, had been staying over for several days.\n\nTwo of them became acquainted with Noor through her sale of contraband cigarettes. One of the two, a 14-year-old, had also purchased Ice from her on previous occasions.\n\n\"When they indicated that they wished to smoke Ice, the accused permitted them to do so in the bedroom and proceeded to share her smoking utensil with them, with everyone taking turns to take puffs from the smoking utensil,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nThe prosecutor added that the teens did not pay Noor for the Ice they had consumed.\n\nCNB officers raided the flat the next day and arrested the four individuals as well as two men - Noraidil Supri and Muhammad Sharil Ideres, both 37 - who were at the residence to purchase Ice from Noor.\n\nCourt documents did not state if the men have been dealt with.\n\nThe CNB officers also found 55 cartons and six packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes in Noor's bedroom.\n\nThe court heard that this was not the first time contraband cigarettes had been found in the flat.\n\nCustoms officers had discovered 93 packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes in a raid of the unit a week earlier, after they had spotted Noor handing over packets of cigarettes to two 14-year-old boys - who were not identified in the court documents - near the flat.\n\nYesterday, District Judge Kan granted Noor's request to defer her jail term to Oct 9, so that she can settle her personal affairs.\n\nFor her offence of permitting a person under 21 to consume a drug in her possession, Noor could have been jailed for up to 10 years.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore crime\n\nDrug offences", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_VNFD_6000131.jpg?VersionId=7k7l3BG_8H8OUF1N4TPZgc32BnX8H3.e", "alt_text": "Noor Fadhilah Azlan, 28, had on Sept 24 last year offered two 14-year-olds and one 13-year-old the drug known as Ice in a rented bedroom she was living in.

At this point in his career, it's just about winning. And his ability to do what he does at his age is incredibly uncommon. But there's a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes.\"\n\nBy reaching the championship round, the 35-year-old James joins Bill Russell (12), Sam Jones (11) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (10) as the only players with 10 or more NBA Finals appearances.\n\nNot only is he back in the title decider, he is also doing it while still playing at an elite level, having recently finished runner-up for the Most Valuable Player honours.\n\n\"To see what LeBron has done, when he moved on to Cleveland and then to (Los Angeles), it really is just a testament to his greatness and his commitment to winning,\" added Spoelstra. \"To be able to do it with different rosters and uniforms is really remarkable.\"\n\nOn the eve of the Finals, James reflected on the four seasons he spent with the Heat, a team he joined when he was 25.\n\n\"I was still a kid and still trying to figure out who I am as a person and as a man,\" he said. \"I grew, and they allowed me to grow.\"\n\nThe Heat are a team who are the work of former Laker Riley, who knows all about winning as a coach.\n\nHe won four titles in the 80s heyday of Magic Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar, another with the Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal-led Heat in 2006, and then acquired the team of James, Wade and Chris Bosh for their 2012 and 2013 triumphs.\n\n\"Probably one of the greatest minds this game has ever had... This league is not the same without Riles,\" said James. \"He's a great guy, great motivator, someone who just knows what it takes to win.\"\n\nHe added of Spoelstra: \"The players know how great Spo is. He prepares his team every single night. They are going to play hard, they are going to play together.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Waiters is waiting to get his first NBA ring. Before joining the Lakers as a free agent, the 28-year-old played just three games for Miami averaging 9.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1 assists per game.\n\nHe will get a ring if the Lakers win, but he would also be eligible if the Heat clinch the victory, provided Miami are willing to offer him one. The Heat, built around Jimmy Butler who has averaged 20.6 points, 4.3 assists and 6 rebounds this postseason, are underdogs for the clash.\n\nBefore the season tipped off 11 months ago, Miami were regarded as 60-1 shots of finishing the campaign as champions. Some bookmakers pegged them at 110-1.\n\nEven before the season restarted in Orlando in July, the Heat were a generous 30-1 to win the title, with the Milwaukee Bucks expected to emerge as the Eastern Conference representatives in the Finals.\n\n\"I just don't think that we're underdogs,\" Butler said on Tuesday when asked to assess the Heat's status.\n\n\"So what that nobody picked us to be here? That's okay. We're just going to go out here and compete, play together like we always have. We're going to do this our way, the Miami Heat way.\"\n\nNYTIMES, REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nMIAMI V LA LAKERS\n\nGame 1: StarHub Ch202, 9am\n\nSee more on\n\nNBA\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nLeBron James\n\nBasketball players", "images": []}

In 2007, the SAFNA Act was amended to allow the flag to be displayed without a flagpole or the need to be illuminated at night between July 1 and Sept 30.\n\nPreviously, this was allowed only during the month of August for National Day celebrations.\n\nYesterday, Mr Tong said his ministry initiated a review of SAFNA rules before the recent report.\n\nThe potential amendments may allow for more occasions on which the flag can be displayed, while protecting it from extended display or neglect.\n\nHe called for members of the public to\n\nshare their suggestions here.\n\nSee more on\n\nNational identity\n\nMinistry of Culture, Community and Youth\n\nEdwin Tong", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_VNFLAG_6001025.jpg?VersionId=UhqvL_8z38acUhJddsotfDN5UlPIaLKg", "alt_text": "Every year, the national flag can be displayed outside a building or in an open space without a flagpole between July 1 and Sept 30.

But from the opening question by moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News, the tension was unmistakable and the clashing quickly got out of hand. What resulted is likely to go down as one of the low points in US presidential debate history.\n\nMr Trump's frequent interruptions and personal barbs during the roughly 90-minute showdown were the personification of his re-election strategy, which has focused largely on exciting a core group of die-hard supporters who revel in his willingness to insult and shock while giving no ground.\n\nBut Mr Biden's weighted assaults made clear that the challenger was not going to wilt as the two rivals engaged in a verbal slugfest the likes of which US voters have not seen on the modern debate stage.\n\nNBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt said the debate was \"a low point in political discourse\".\n\nDr Richard Haass, president of US think-tank Council on Foreign Relations, said: \"That was the most discouraging, most depressing, most troubling 90 minutes I can recall. If you are not worried about the future of this country, you were not watching.\"\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper said of the debate: \"That was a hot mess, inside a dumpster fire, inside a train wreck... The American people lost.\"\n\nThe insults featured heavily during a chaotic encounter in which Mr Trump often talked over Mr Biden and Mr Wallace.\n\nThe tone of the debate was set early, as a question about the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg set off a back-and-forth between the candidates that quickly turned personal.\n\nMr Biden, who has refused to answer the question of whether he supports expanding the Supreme Court, was consistently cut off by Mr Trump as he tried to answer a question. He initially ignored Mr Trump's interruptions, but after the President said, \"He's not going to answer the question\", Mr Biden hit back: \"I'm not going to answer the question.\"\n\nAs Mr Biden tried to restart his explanation, the President cut him off again, and the Democratic nominee shot back: \"Will you shut up, man? This is so un-presidential.\"\n\nDuring another exchange on the topic of Mr Trump's tax history, the US President cut Mr Biden off as the former vice-president argued that the current administration's tax cuts had been ill advised, saying that Mr Biden's long career in public service should have produced the improvements he sought.\n\nMr Biden responded with a blunt retort: \"You're the worst president America has ever had.\"\n\nMr Trump retorted that \"in 47 months, I've done more than you have in 47 years\", referring to his rival's career in Washington.\n\nMr Biden even called the President a \"clown\" - twice.\n\nAt one point, he apparently thought better of it. \"It's hard to get any word in with this clown, excuse me, this person,\" he said, during their exchange about taxes.\n\nOn Twitter and at campaign rallies, Mr Trump, 74, has called Mr Biden \"Sleepy Joe\", an apparent dig at the 77-year-old Democrat's vitality. He did not use the nickname on Tuesday. But in their first debate, Mr Trump had plenty of disparaging things to say about his rival, whom he trails in national opinion polls ahead of the Nov 3 election.\n\nThe President brought up Mr Biden's son's struggles with drugs and mocked his opponent's academic performance at the University of Delaware where, according to the Washington Post, Mr Biden graduated 506th in a class of 688.\n\n\"He was the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word smart with me,\" Mr Trump said. \"Because you know what, there's nothing smart about you, Joe.\"\n\nMr Trump also suggested that Mr Biden could not drum up enough interest to hold large in-person rallies, when Mr Biden criticised him for flouting social distancing rules at events.\n\nDuring a segment on race relations, Mr Wallace asked Mr Trump whether he would denounce white supremacists. Mr Trump answered only with an ambivalent comment on the \"Proud Boys\" - a white supremacist group which held a gathering in Portland last week. \"Proud Boys stand by, stand back, but somebody has to do something about (the far left anti-fascist network) Antifa,\" he said.\n\nHe also declined to say he would accept the election results, repeating his unfounded assertion that widespread voting by mail would lead to massive fraud.\n\nMr Trump was set to spend yesterday in Minnesota with a fund-raiser in the afternoon before a rally in Duluth. Mr Biden and his wife, Jill, were to embark on a train tour through six cities in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, including counties that Mr Trump won four years ago on the strength of working-class white voters.\n\nUntil Tuesday, Mr Biden still led Mr Trump by some seven points in nationwide polls. More than a million Americans are already casting early ballots and time is running out to change minds or influence undecided voters.\n\nMeanwhile, election betting odds on Betfair Exchange, the operator of the world's largest online betting bourse, showed Mr Biden's probability of winning at 60 per cent, up from 56 per cent before the debate. Mr Trump has a 40 per cent probability of victory.\n\nREUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, BLOOMBERG\n\nSEE\n\nWORLD\n\n,\n\nOPINION\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nJoe Biden", "images": []}

The Sembawang-Yishun package comprises about 400 buses plying 27 routes.\n\nThe change in operator means SMRT drivers involved in these routes will be offered a job by Tower Transit.\n\nGuidelines stipulate that Tower Transit's employment terms cannot leave the drivers worse off than their current agreement with SMRT.\n\nThe tender, called last November, was the first time the LTA concurrently called tenders for two packages, which it said could achieve \"economies of scale\".\n\nOperators submitted a bid for the combined package, and also bid for each bus package separately.\n\nUnder the bus contracting model, the Government owns all operating assets and collects fare revenue. Transport firms bid or negotiate to run route parcels for a fixed sum over a fixed period.\n\nSingapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) transport economist Walter Theseira said the final bids bore this aim out.\n\n\"It looks from the bids that TTS was able to promise this to a greater extent than some of the competitors... But all parties did incorporate a discount for the joint bid compared with the single bids,\" he said.\n\nTower Transit bid $482 million for the Bulim package, $582 million for the Sembawang-Yishun package, and $1.03 billion for the combined one.\n\nSMRT bid $540 million for the Bulim bus package, $700 million for the Sembawang-Yishun bus package, and $1.19 billion for the combined one.\n\nOn TTS' almost doubling of its bus routes, SUSS transport researcher Park Byung Joon said it would have been a very different story if SMRT and SBS Transit had won, suggesting that it \"would have been the end of bus tender in Singapore\" and the return to the era of having only two bus operators.\n\n\"TTS is not and will never be in the position to compete with the two local giants,\" he said. \"TTS is going to be as big as what LTA is going to allow them to be.\"\n\nThis article was edited for clarity.\n\nSee more on\n\nLTA\n\nSMRT\n\nTower Transit", "images": []}

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyse it, two of the sources said.\n\nEffective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that\n\nhas killed more than one million people worldwide.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has pledged US$1.2 billion (S$1.6 billion) to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the US vaccine race include Pfizer Inc, Moderna Inc and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nRegulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\n\nThe FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\n\n\"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\n\nFurther complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the US regulator requires, two of the sources said.\n\nThe FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\n\nVIRAL VECTOR\n\nAll of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\n\nWhile other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\n\nReuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\n\nIn one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\n\nThe type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinise raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\n\nThe US government's effort to speed development of a Covid-19 vaccine - and promises by Mr Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\n\nAstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\n\nIndependent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with Covid-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\n\nThe safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\n\n\"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Professor Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\n\nAstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nVaccines\n\nInfectious diseases", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/nz_vaccine_011037.jpg?VersionId=GrDpuI512R..raO2dnHUa_mhsIWYhN5W", "alt_text": null}]}

The Anglo-Dutch major offered voluntary severance, scaled back recruitment and reviewed expatriate staff contracts.\n\nThe reorganisation is also designed to further Shell's expanded green ambitions. The company said in April\n\nit planned to eliminate all net emissions\n\nfrom its operations and the bulk of greenhouse gases from fuel it sells to its customers by 2050. It also said that ultimately, it would do business only with emission-free companies.\n\nThe company also flagged yesterday that it expects oil-product sales volumes in the third quarter to be four million to five million barrels a day. Refining margins will be \"significantly\" lower than in the second quarter.

On Monday evening, Mr Trump had shared at least four news articles about the New York issues on Twitter.\n\nThe problems in New York are yet another blemish for the New York City Board of Elections, which is run by a board of Democrats and Republicans, and has a long history of mismanaging elections.\n\nMr Michael Ryan, the board's executive director, blamed the board's vendor, Phoenix Graphics, a commercial printing company based in Rochester, New York, which was hired to mail out ballots in Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nThe foul-up was briefly addressed on Tuesday at a Board of Elections meeting, as Mr Ryan, a Democrat, said the error was limited to \"one print run\". He added that the vendor would bear the cost of sending out new ballots to all potentially affected voters.\n\n\"It is essential that confidence be established in this process and that we make certain that all of the voters who potentially have a problem have a full and fair opportunity to remedy that problem,\" Mr Ryan said.\n\nOfficials encouraged voters to e-mail or call a hotline if they received an erroneous ballot. But phone lines already appear to be jammed.\n\nMs Merrily Rosso, who lives in the Bushwick neighbourhood of Brooklyn, received an absentee ballot on Monday with a stranger's name on it. She looked him up and discovered that he lived nearby.\n\nConcerned, she called the Brooklyn Board of Elections twice. The first time, it hung up. The second time, the phone just rang.\n\nSo she called the New York City Board of Elections. There were roughly 80 callers ahead of her, and she hung up.\n\nMr Michael Weiss, a musician who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, said the ballot mailed to his partner had someone else's name on it. He walked it over to the person listed on the ballot.\n\n\"She opened her mail to find another neighbour's ballot in her envelope, which I took and hand delivered to him around the corner. Of course, he also received someone else's ballot in the mail,\" Mr Weiss said.\n\nPhoenix Graphics, a family-owned firm, has worked with the city Board of Elections since at least 2010, according to city records, including during the June primaries.\n\nWrong ballots signed by voters will be invalid.\n\nAs part of an effort to battle misinformation, popular video-sharing app TikTok on Tuesday launched a US election guide.\n\nTikTok's in-app guide provides links to voter registration pages and access to election information from sources such as the National Association of Secretaries of State and BallotReady, according to head of US public policy Michael Beckerman.\n\nBallotReady chief executive officer Alex Niemczewski said: \"Younger voters often do not realise everything that will appear on their ballot, and we believe that TikTok can help them vote their entire ballot.\"\n\nThe election guide makes its debut as TikTok battles to stop a ban ordered by President Trump. The company has challenged the ban in court as being capricious and politically motivated.\n\nNYTIMES, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nTikTok", "images": []}

He wisely leaves most of the martial arts action to younger actors such as Ai Lun, who is given a kitchen pots-and-cutlery comedy fight scene taken from Chan's playbook.\n\nThis being a holiday blockbuster, albeit one with a long-delayed release, quoting from Chan's own catalogue is normal, even expected.\n\nThe thin excuse for a plot lets Chan, playing Tang, the boss of private security company Vanguard, dash from London to Dubai and elsewhere. Aided by his crew, Tang hopes to foil a kidnapping involving a Chinese businessman Qin (Jackson Lou), his daughter Fareeda (Xu Ruohan) and terrorists seeking a high-tech weapon.\n\nThe something-for-everyone nature of the project is best described as - take a deep breath - a family-friendly, militaristic gunplay, martial arts action-comedy with a pro-China take on world affairs.\n\nAs if to further punish film-maker Stanley Tong, a frequent Chan collaborator, political events that have happened since the viral outbreak have made the film's finale seem almost comically optimistic.\n\nAdded to that is the Achilles' heel of too many Asian films: sloppy visual effects. The African animals here would look fake even if viewed on a first-generation iPhone, while the Fast And Furious (2001 to 2019) homage, featuring exotic cars streaking down Dubai's streets, reeks of vintage console games.\n\nBut like they say: It would not be a Chinese New Year burger if it didn't come with extra cheese.\n\nJIANG ZIYA: LEGEND OF DEIFICATION\n\nAnother festive film coming out of pause mode is animated feature Jiang Ziya: Legend Of Deification, the follow-up to Ne Zha (2019), the highest-grossing non-American animation film at the Chinese box office.\n\nThe lush, expensive-looking adaptation of a 16th-century Chinese novel Investiture Of The Gods is part of a cinematic universe of deities, demons and humans. There is an attempt to explain backstories, but the dense cosmology - which includes various realms and classes of supernatural beings - will give the uninitiated the feeling of having dropped into an Avengers movie while knowing nothing of the preceding Thor, Iron Man or Captain America films.\n\nThe immortal Jiang Ziya is on the verge of promotion after the events of the first movie - after all, he has defeated the fox demon and is ready to fulfil his destiny. As a test of loyalty, the gods ask him to perform a final task before his ascension, which he fails because of his empathy for humans. For that, he is banished to the earthly realm, where Jiang, with the help of clan members, humans and adorable supernatural creatures, has to earn redemption.\n\nThe story's focus on swirling action at the expense of character can be frustrating - if liberties can be taken in the area of cute animals, why not also add more colour to the two-dimensional Jiang and his friends? But for an intoxicating visual overload, this battle of the divinities told in twitchy video game-influenced graphics is hard to beat.\n\nLEAP\n\nThe sports biopic Leap tracks the Chinese women's national volleyball team over 40 years of its history, from the time it came from nowhere to world-beating status in the early 1980s, to its lean years before its return to form in recent years.\n\nVIEW IT\n\nVANGUARD\n\nPG13, 107 minutes\n\nNow showing\n\nRating: 2.5 Stars\n\nJIANG ZI YA: LEGEND OF DEIFICATION\n\nPG13, 110 minutes\n\nOpens today\n\nRating: 3 Stars\n\nLEAP\n\nPG, 135 minutes\n\nOpens today\n\nRating: 2.5 Stars\n\nPINOCCHIO\n\nPG, 125 minutes\n\nOpens today\n\nRating: 2 Stars\n\nROGUE\n\nM18, 116 minutes\n\nOpens today\n\nNot reviewed\n\nMuch of the team's story is tied to the story of one person, the player-turned-coach Lang Ping, played by Gong Li. Hong Kong director Peter Chan (the romance Comrades, Almost A Love Story, 1996) does what he can to make this a story about solid Chinese values - the willingness to endure a tortuous training regime, the self-loathing that comes with losing - and effectively makes the point that in the 1970s, the nation's citizens were built differently.\n\nBut throughout, the towering figure of Lang, still a deeply respected figure in the country, dominates. But she remains an enigma. The film's lack of insight into her mind, given her importance to the story, frustrates.\n\nPINOCCHIO\n\nPinocchio, Italian writer Carlo Collodi's 19th-century tale of the titular puppet who comes to life, has been adapted for film several times, most famously by Disney in the classic 1940 animated feature.\n\nJust as Disney has done with some of its works, Italian film-maker Matteo Garrone (the award-winning crime drama Gomorrah, 2008) has attempted a live-action version of the fantasy. And like Disney when it tries to make cartoon flying elephants and talking orang utans look real, this project is a misfire.\n\nGarrone uses special effects to make child actor Federico Ielapi look properly wooden. But in the style of fantasy masters like Terry Gilliam (Time Bandits, 1981; The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen, 1988), dwarf actors in heavy prosthetics play supporting characters. He meets them after he is separated from his father, Gepetto (Roberto Benigni).\n\nGarrone's adherence to Collodi's story, with its 19th-century values - disobedient children deserve cruel punishments, for example - and rambling, one-thing-after-another style do the film no good. That anachronistic voice, paired with the low-key realism of the visuals, are an odd pairing.\n\nThe version shown in Singapore has English dialogue dubbed over the original Italian to make the film more palatable to families with children. This is a strange decision given the film's decidedly non-cute look, which some might call grotesque, made worse by how the English voices have unnecessarily strong Italian accents.\n\nROGUE\n\nOpening this week but not reviewed is military action drama Rogue, starring Megan Fox as the soldier-for-hire of the title. She leads her team into Africa to extract hostages while battling rebel fighters and a man-eating pride of lions. It is directed by M.J. Bassett, who comes to the project after helming well-received action television shows Altered Carbon (2018 to 2020) and Strike Back (2010 to 2020).\n\nSee more on\n\nReviews\n\nMovie review", "images": []}

For a ride-hailing licence, operators are to pay a fee equivalent to 0.6 per cent of their gross revenue.\n\nST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG\n\nChristopher Tan\n\nFollow topic:\n\nTaxis\n\nPublished\n\nOct 01, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nA long-delayed regulatory framework to level the playing field between cabbies and private-hire drivers will kick in soon.\n\nAsked for an update on the regulatory framework for the point-to-point (P2P) transport sector, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it would start later this month.\n\nThe framework has been in the works for about three years now, with the passing of the P2P Passenger Transport Industry Act in August last year.\n\nThe framework was to have taken effect by June this year. But because of the Covid-19 crisis, which has disrupted transport demand, it was postponed to last month, and then to this month.\n\nThe Straits Times understands that the framework will take effect in the latter half of the month.\n\nWith it, operators will incur licensing fees that are pegged to their respective revenue.\n\nFor a street-hail service licence, which allows drivers to pick up passengers on the street, the fee is 0.3 per cent of the licensee's gross annual revenue.\n\nFor a ride-hailing licence, which restricts a licensee to only phone-hailed rides, operators are to pay a fee equivalent to 0.6 per cent of their gross revenue.\n\nWhile the framework is expected to address an uneven playing field, stakeholders and observers reckon more can be done.\n\nA Grab spokesman said that while the company \"supports the intent\" of the framework, all ride-hail and carpool platform operators should be required to build in-app safety features such as number masking, an emergency button, sharing of real-time ride location and driver identity authentication.\n\nShe said child seats should also be a requirement for both private-hire cars and taxis. They are currently not required for the latter.\n\nAddressing the anti-competitive clause of the framework, Grab said the \"current inconsistency whereby taxi operators can restrict their drivers from taking fixed-fare jobs on other platforms\" should be addressed \"as soon as possible\".\n\nFramework at a glance\n\n\u2022 Operators with 800 or more vehicles need to be licensed. Smaller operators are exempt but have to meet basic safety standards.\n\n\u2022 Operators providing both street-hailing and ride-hailing services need to hold separate licences.\n\n\u2022 Carpooling platforms with 800 or more vehicles will also need to obtain a licence.\n\n\u2022 Operators can be sanctioned if their drivers are involved in too many accidents or commit too many offences.\n\n\u2022 All private-hire cars will need to go for annual vehicle inspection.\n\n\u2022 Exclusive arrangements preventing drivers from switching platforms will not be allowed.\n\n\u2022 Taxi availability standards, such as requiring taxi operators to maintain at least 80 per cent of their taxis on the road during peak hour, to be removed.\n\n\u2022 Licensed operators need to provide the Land Transport Authority (LTA) with trip and driver-related data.\n\n\u2022 LTA can also issue codes of practice for licensees.\n\n\u2022 The Public Transport Council will have powers to ensure that fares are clear and communicated upfront.\n\n\u2022 Fare evasion and overcharging offences will be extended to private-hire car trips.\n\n\u2022 LTA can fix maximum or minimum number of authorised drivers a licensed operator may have.\n\nSingapore University of Social Sciences transport economist Walter Theseira said: \"The most important thing about the P2P framework is that, in principle, it gives LTA similar powers over both taxi operators and private-hire firms.\"\n\nBut Associate Professor Theseira said the framework does not level the playing field completely.\n\n\"An area which remains an obvious problem is the difference in regulatory treatment of taxis and private-hire cars. Taxi operators continue to suffer from a lack of flexibility,\" he said.\n\n\"Taxis cannot be repurposed readily. Private-hire cars have always had flexibility to be converted to being a normal passenger car.\"\n\nThis becomes a big sticking point \"when you have a big downturn like this\", Prof Theseira added.\n\n\"For the same reason, when there is a sharp recovery, private-hire fleets can expand quickly, but taxis can't unless the regulatory framework becomes more flexible.\"\n\nMr Ang Hin Kee, adviser to the National Taxi Association and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association, said companies should go beyond their business of matching drivers to passengers.\n\n\"Take up the responsibility of helping drivers with their Medisave, retirement and training needs,\" he suggested.\n\nHe said that while drivers are not employees, they are key to the success of these businesses.\n\n\"Platforms need to work with car rental companies to ensure that they cannot disassociate themselves from responsibilities to the drivers just because one leases the car and the other matches passengers.\"\n\nMr Ang said ride-hailing platforms should also \"level up\" their contribution to the financial aid given to drivers during this pandemic.\n\nSee more on\n\nTaxis\n\nGrab\n\nGojek\n\nLTA", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_VNCAB_6000306.jpg?VersionId=5JH5lKUF9DCon0BXMRByqLBU80r1l2vv", "alt_text": "Under the new regulatory framework, operators will incur licensing fees that are pegged to their respective revenue.

They are at their third-lowest levels in three years.\n\nIndustry regulator Energy Market Authority (EMA) said that the electricity tariff changes apply to only 53 per cent of households which buy electricity from SP Group at the regulated tariff.\n\nThey do not apply to the remaining 47 per cent of households which, as at end June, have switched to a retailer in the open electricity market.\n\nIn the last quarter of the year, households powered by SP Group will have electricity tariffs rise from 19.6 cents to 21.43 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh), before the 7 per cent goods and services tax (GST).\n\nThis means that the average monthly electricity bill for families living in four-room Housing Board flats will increase by $7.01.\n\nGas tariffs for households are up by 0.83 cent per kwh, from 16.36 cents last quarter to 17.19 cents this quarter per kwh, before GST.\n\nSP Group and City Gas review electricity and gas tariffs quarterly based on guidelines set by EMA.\n\nSP Group said the increase in electricity prices from this month to December is due to higher energy costs, which determine close to 73 per cent of the tariffs in the quarter, and are paid to power generation companies.\n\nOther components of the electricity tariff, such as network costs and market support services, remain unchanged.\n\nCity Gas said that gas tariffs have also gone up due to fuel cost hikes.\n\nBut earlier in the third quarter, electricity tariffs fell by 15 per cent and gas tariffs fell by 4 per cent, following a dip in the second quarter as well.\n\nProfessor Subodh Mhaisalkar, executive director of the Nanyang Technological University's Energy Research Institute said the Covid-19 pandemic led to a global decline in fuel prices - oil in this case - in March.\n\n\"Economic activity is not what it was and oil prices are forecast to be low until demand increases to match supply,\" he said.\n\nHowever, with the easing of Covid-19 safety curbs, Prof Mhaisalkar added that most analysts are predicting a modest increase in fuel prices, and thus an associated increase in electricity prices is expected.\n\nBut if electricity retailers rely on green sources of energy such as solar, he said, they may be able to keep tariffs unchanged even if fuel prices rise.\n\nOne open market electricity retailer that is dropping prices slightly, instead of raising them, is iSwitch.\n\nMr Andrew Koscharsky, iSwitch's chief commercial officer, said that the company will be lowering the rate of its fixed price contract by 0.6 per cent from 15.79 to 15.69 cents per kwh (before GST).\n\nThe retailer, which has more than 100,000 customers, said that this price will apply to its six-month contract for customers.\n\nOn how iSwitch is able to lower prices despite fuel cost increases, Mr Koscharsky said that the company is able to pass on cost savings to its customers because it is not bound by the same \"expensive overheads that may be tied to a traditional utility\".\n\nSee more on\n\nElectricity and power\n\nConsumer electronics", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/af_sg-flats-electricity_300920.jpg?VersionId=fcEwM8Eu5gzBPONkv1hehyjJ19wi5tQr", "alt_text": null}]}

The MAS has said fiscal policy was the \"centrepiece\" of the economic response to the pandemic.\n\nThe Government has pumped nearly $100 billion worth of stimulus into the economy.\n\nEconomists say the worst may be over for the bellwether economy that contracted a record 13.2 per cent year on year in the second quarter, but warn the recovery is likely to be sluggish.\n\nWith Covid-19 case numbers falling locally, the country has been gradually lifting some of its lockdown measures to reopen its economy in recent months and has signalled it wants to slowly resume tourism and travel.\n\nThe trade-reliant economy's exports have mostly held up this year, supported by global demand for Singapore's pharmaceutical products, but there are concerns about whether export growth is sustainable given the sluggish global economy.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nMAS/Monetary Authority of Singapore\n\nMonetary policy\n\nCoronavirus", "images": []}

As businesses have reopened and millions of jobs have been regained, economists believe that the US economy will rebound in the third quarter, while noting that more fiscal relief is needed to sustain the economic recovery.\n\n\"While the economy has been doing better than expected, I think there's downside risk to that if there is no further fiscal support,\" US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said recently, at a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nThe central bank chief noted both employment and overall economic activity remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, and the country still has 11 million unemployed, out of the 22 million who were laid off in March and April amid Covid-19 shutdowns.\n\nThe median projection for the unemployment rate is 7.6 per cent at the end of this year, and 4 per cent by the end of 2023, according to the Federal Reserve's latest economic projections.\n\nThis is still above the historic low of 3.5 per cent the country experienced before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic and Republican lawmakers remain deadlocked on the next round of relief roughly two months after the extra US$600 (S$820) per week federal unemployment benefits - part of a US$2 trillion relief package approved by Congress in late March - expired at the end of July.\n\nAmid growing doubts about the two sides' willingness and ability to break the impasse, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin resumed their talks earlier this week over a US$2.2 trillion relief package newly proposed by House Democrats.\n\nXINHUA\n\nSee more on\n\nGDP\n\nUS economy", "images": []}

Following the reports, the Singapore police raided the Wirecard office in Pasir Panjang in February last year.\n\nThe suspicions regarding Wirecard's accounting practices persisted, with chairman Wulf Matthias resigning in January following months of controversy.\n\nMr Markus Braun, its chief executive, resigned in June after auditor EY refused to sign off on the firm's 2019 accounts, declaring that some \u20ac1.9 billion had gone missing. EY also said there were clear indications Wirecard was involved in a fraud with multiple parties around the world in different institutions.\n\nThe Singapore police and the Monetary Authority of Singapore then launched an investigation into several local companies in relation to the Wirecard scandal. In August, Singaporean R. Shanmugaratnam, director of Citadelle Corporate Services, was charged with falsifying accounts.\n\nGiven that Wirecard is unlikely to revive its fortunes, retailers in Singapore will have to turn to other forms of e-payment such as Nets.\n\n\"Since Wirecard has quite a significant presence here, there is likely to be some disruption. Customers who have Wirecard pre-paid cards will also be affected,\" said Prof Mak.\n\nMs Choo Wan Sim, United Overseas Bank's (UOB) head of cards and payments, Singapore, said many merchants have sought the bank's guidance in the last two months on how to create more certainty around their payment processing options, or to become part of UOB's merchant network.\n\n\"We also advise them on payment acceptance options such as using unified point-of-sale terminals which enable them to accept a wide range of payment schemes through a single terminal as well as how they can accept new payment schemes such as Alipay and WeChat Pay,\" she said.\n\nShe added that these merchants come from a range of sectors, including retail, e-commerce, supermarket, food and beverage, and insurance.\n\nAssociate Professor Lawrence Loh, also from NUS Business School and who is director of the Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations, said that while merchants may currently find it inconvenient to switch to another system, it will at most be a one-off event. He also observed that the issue is due more to corporate fraud than to any inherent problems in digital payments.\n\n\"It will take more than a Wirecard incident for consumer confidence in e-payments to be really rocked.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMAS/Monetary Authority of Singapore\n\nPayment systems", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_WIRE01__6001142.jpg?VersionId=5CvprCu4TB3VHNW7bio1uUILHOfWNUNu", "alt_text": "German digital payment firm Wirecard supported a large network of businesses in Singapore, including retail, e-commerce, supermarket, food and beverage, and insurance.

The country has begun a 40-day period of national mourning.\n\n\"We honestly feel like we're going to be lost without his guidance,\" said Ms Fajer, a Kuwaiti woman.\n\nDignitaries from around the world paid respects to the seasoned diplomat and savvy politician, who was widely respected as a humanitarian who strove to heal rifts in the Middle East, mending ties with former occupier Iraq and trying until his death to resolve a bitter Gulf dispute.\n\nIn her condolence letter to Sheikh Nawaf yesterday, President Halimah Yacob said Singapore will always appreciate the longstanding support of Sheikh Sabah with regard to the bilateral relationship between the two countries.\n\n\"His Highness remained a strong believer of cooperation among small states such as Kuwait and Singapore for mutual benefit,\" said the President, adding that she recalled his \"enduring optimism\" for preserving regional stability.\n\nAnalysts saw Sheikh Sabah's death - following that earlier this year of Oman's Sultan Qaboos, who also played a moderating and balancing role in the region - as the end of an era in the Gulf.\n\nAn aggressive younger generation has risen to power, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have taken hawkish stands against rival Iran.\n\n\"Though the incoming power brokers in neighbouring Gulf countries did not always heed his advice, the Emir was a reminder of an order hard-fought to achieve that was the basis for the goodwill international partners bear the region,\" wrote Ms Kirsten Fontenrose, director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative.\n\nSheikh Nawaf, who has held high office for decades, takes over as Kuwait is facing the repercussions of the coronavirus crisis, which has triggered a sharp decline in oil prices and severe economic consequences for Gulf states.\n\nThe elder statesman, who was named heir apparent in 2006, served as defence minister when Iraqi troops rolled into the oil-rich emirate in 1990, and also as interior minister in the face of challenges from Islamist militants.\n\nThe new leader is popular within the ruling al-Sabah family and is reported to have been a consensus choice for ruler.\n\nHe also enjoys a reputation for modesty and has largely maintained a low profile.\n\nKuwait's oil, investment and foreign policies are not expected to change under his rule.\n\nDespite expectations for a smooth succession, there could be more spirited debate over who the new crown prince should be. Kuwait's Constitution stipulates that the ruler should be a descendant of the nation's founder Mubarak al-Sabah, but the throne has alternated between the descendants of his sons, Salem and Jaber, for four decades.\n\nContestants for the newly vacated role of crown prince include Sheikh Sabah's son and former deputy prime minister Nasser Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, a Kuwaiti political heavyweight.\n\nREUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nKuwait\n\nPolitics and government", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_VNKUWAIT_6000462.jpg?VersionId=HS_djD3Z09a9BOki3Lu0mJN2fDjC0D0h", "alt_text": "The new Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, taking the oath of office in Parliament yesterday.

The firm officially launched today.\n\nIts US$2.2 million (S$3 million) seed funding is provided by co-founder and chief executive Timo Recker, through his exit from German plant-based meat company LikeMeat following its acquisition earlier this year.\n\nThe firm's co-founder and chief operating officer Andre Menezes told The Straits Times that the start-up capital has been used to assemble the company's team here and get its R&D centre, which is located in Shenton Way, up and running. It is also channelled towards the development of commercial partnerships and branding, he added.\n\nThe firm is currently raising a bridge financing round, which will be closed by the end of the year, for its expansion plans in Asia.\n\nIt also aims to raise another round of funding in the second half of next year, Mr Recker said.\n\nNext Gen currently has manufacturing capacity that can supply about 9,000 restaurants a year, through its partner in the Netherlands. Instead of running its own factories, Next Gen has chosen to emulate leading players and work with manufacturing partners around the globe, Mr Menezes said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

It appears to be behind Mr Trump's recent remarks that the pandemic is \"rounding the corner\" and \"would go away even without the vaccine\".\n\nIts most vocal adherents are calling for mask wearing and social distancing to end just as cold weather is shifting social activity indoors, where the risk of transmission is higher.\n\nEven in places where the pandemic hit especially hard - a French aircraft carrier, the Brazilian city of Manaus, the slums of Mumbai in India and a neighbourhood in Queens, New York - infections did not noticeably slow down until almost 60 per cent of the inhabitants were infected.\n\nAnd even those levels may not suffice, given that cases are increasing again in Brazil and in areas in the New York borough of Brooklyn that had seen cases spike and then drop off.\n\nThe chief proponents of the idea that herd immunity is somehow close at hand contend that most people in the world are immune to the virus, thanks to \"T cell immunity\" derived from having contracted common colds that were caused by the four relatively benign coronaviruses that have circulated for years.\n\nBut this theory is unfounded.\n\nDr Thomas Frieden, a former director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said: \"Immunity in 2020 is no closer to being just around the corner than prosperity was in 1930.\"\n\nMore than 200,000 Americans have already died, and models estimate that if people return to old habits, more than 300,000 and possibly 400,000 could die before a vaccine is widely available.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nMedical research", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_WKUSA3_6000577.jpg?VersionId=suvYlEhysrZk2laU1S4m8BdDY5Ho9zOx", "alt_text": "Commuters in the New York borough of Brooklyn, where cases are on the rise again.

Their employers will pay just $3 annually for each worker.\n\nThis has been made possible by the $600,000 raised so far by Leap201 and NTUC's Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC).\n\nThe payout from the insurer is $10,000 if a worker dies from a non-work-related accident or is totally and permanently disabled.\n\nWorkers stricken with critical illnesses will each receive up to $10,000. The 37 critical illnesses covered under the scheme include major cancers, stroke with permanent neurological deficit and heart attack of specified severity.\n\n\"From MWC's experience, unexpected heart attacks, cancer, stroke and diabetes are some of the leading causes of death among the migrant worker community in Singapore,\" said MWC chairman Yeo Guat Kwang.\n\nIncome's chief executive Andrew Yeo said: \"When migrant workers are rendered unable to work due to serious injuries, illnesses or worse, death, their loved ones at home are also very much impacted, as many migrant workers here are breadwinners of their families.\"\n\nLeap201 chairman Michael Lien urged employers and dormitory operators to buy the insurance. \"It is up to us to care for the very people who help build our country in their time of need,\" he said.\n\nIndustry partners and employer groups who wish to be early adopters of the scheme can e-mail MWC at feedback@mwc.org.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nNTUC\n\nWorker welfare", "images": []}

Each site is up for tender for a term of up to three years.\n\nThe highest tender of $90,000 for annual rent was awarded to IT Meng Landscape and Construction, for a cluster site in Jurong West, with one site spanning a total area of 3,311 sq m - three-fifths of a football field - and the other at 2,974 sq m.\n\nOther carpark locations included Choa Chu Kang, Tampines, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh and Sembawang.\n\nMr Lim Kok Thai, chief executive of SFA, said: \"The successful tenderers' proposals included hydroponic and vertical farming systems with a variety of innovative features such as IoT (Internet of Things), blockchain technology and automated climate control.\n\n\"With these farming systems, the sites have the potential to collectively produce around 1,600 tonnes of vegetables annually.\"\n\nHe hoped that the transformation of the rooftops to vegetable farms will contribute to Singapore's \"30 by 30 goal\" - to produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030.\n\nMs Phoebe Xie, 30, director and co-founder of local urban technology company AbyFarm, was one of the six that successfully tendered for the carpark rooftop spaces.\n\nWith the 3,171 sq m site in Ang Mo Kio, it hopes to begin construction of the farm in the next few months, and to have its launch date within the first half of next year.\n\n\"The farm will be entirely automated, with real-time technology used to control the environment within the greenhouse, and to consistently monitor the crops and identify early the possibility of bad crops, which will ensure its quality,\" she said.\n\nWith an expected yield of 200 tonnes of fruits and vegetables each year, the company is looking to harvest local favourites, such as kang kong and kai lan as well as other types of produce like mushrooms, figs and Japanese melon.\n\nThere are currently a total of four SFA-licensed rooftop farms in Singapore, including a pilot urban farm launched last year at a multi-storey carpark in Ang Mo Kio.\n\nThe tender for the nine sites, which was launched on May 12, closed on June 16. The sites were awarded using the price-quality tender method, where both the bid price and the quality attributes, such as production output, and design and site layout, were factored into the tender evaluation.\n\nIn addition, the sites were assessed for their suitability for urban farming, such as availability of electricity, water to support such farming, as well as current or future developments of HDB blocks.\n\nHDB has studied the parking demand in these areas and ascertained that residents' parking needs would not be compromised.\n\nSFA said it will be working with HDB to tender out more carpark rooftop sites for urban farming in the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nSee more on\n\nSFA/Singapore Food Agency\n\nFood security", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_VNROOF_6000340.jpg?VersionId=hISQnQDp22iZqjDWfMo6GtEyT1HkEJV1", "alt_text": "An artist's impression of AbyFarm, one of six successful tenderers for the HDB carpark rooftop spaces.

They are lovers.\n\nWriter-director Ray Yeung tells The Straits Times in an e-mail interview that he always wanted Suk Suk's central romance to be between two older people - an unpopular artistic choice, given that viewers prefer to see young, attractive persons on screen.\n\nYeung's film shows Pak (played by Tai Bo) and Hoi (Ben Yuen), two men well into their 60s, doing things lovers do.\n\nTaxi driver Pak lives in fear of his wife and child discovering his double life while Hoi, a divorced man who lives with less anxiety, has to respect Pak's boundaries.\n\nFudging the visuals to make the film more palatable, as film-makers sometimes do with characters past 50, such as by using flashbacks, was out of the question.\n\n\"The aim of the film is to show the experiences of these men in their twilight years. If I had used flashbacks or younger actors to play them, I don't think it would truly reflect their struggles,\" he says.\n\nThe Cantonese-language Suk Suk, Yeung's third feature, will be screened this month as part of the Singapore Chinese Film Festival 2020. It scored five nominations in the 2019 Golden Horse Awards, including Lead Actor (for Yuen and Tai).\n\nAt this year's Hong Kong Film Awards, Tai picked up Best Actor while Patra Au, who plays his wife Ching, won Best Supporting Actress. At the same event, the film also earned a Best Picture nomination.\n\nYeung says that when men of a certain age fall in love, they face problems related to how they had to blend into the mainstream while growing up.\n\n\"They were living in an era when homosexuality was illegal and almost everyone had to get married. An unmarried man of a certain age was seen as an outcast and this would affect his status at work, within the family and society at large,\" says Yeung, whose previous films, Front Cover (2015) and Cut Sleeve Boys (2006), also explored gay themes.\n\nChing, Pak's wife, is trapped in a loveless marriage.\n\n\"These women are married to someone who doesn't desire them. The foundation of their relationship is based on a lie. They suffer, often in silence, wondering why their husbands are not attracted to them sexually. If they find out the truth, it would be devastating,\" he says.\n\nCompared with a decade ago, it is easier today to get a film such as Suk Suk made, says Yeung, though he did face some difficulties obtaining funding and in casting actors.\n\nEventually, he found Tai and Yuen - actors with decades of experience in films and television.\n\nWith playing gay characters less of a taboo now, Yeung believes that the depiction of such persons on television and in films has improved over time, compared with several years ago, when in films such as Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle (2004), an effeminate character exists purely for laughs.\n\nWhile it seems that gay characters are popping up everywhere these days, on closer inspection, their tales have little impact on the stories being told.\n\n\"In mainstream films, they are usually depicted as side characters who rarely have their own storylines. They are usually there to support the dilemmas of the main leads,\" he says.\n\n\u2022 Suk Suk, with the original Cantonese dialogue (with English subtitles), is being screened as part of the Singapore Chinese Film Festival 2020 from Oct 10.

Its borders stayed open, as did bars, restaurants and schools.\n\nHairdressers, yoga studios, gyms and even some cinemas remained open, as did public transportation and parks. Gatherings of more than 50 people were banned, museums were closed and sporting events were cancelled.\n\nBut that was the extent of the measures, with officials saying they would trust in the good sense of Swedes to keep their distance and wash their hands.\n\nSome experts believe that Sweden is now almost fully in control of the virus.\n\nDr Kim Sneppen, professor of biocomplexity at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, said: \"There are indications that the Swedes have gained an element of immunity to the disease, which, together with everything else they are doing to prevent the infection from spreading, is enough to keep the disease down.\"\n\nIndeed, comparative analyses show that Sweden's death rate at the height of the pandemic in the spring far surpassed the rates in neighbouring countries and was more protracted.\n\nOthers point out that the country's overall death rate is comparable to that of the United States.\n\nNow, though, the question is whether Sweden's current low caseload, compared with sharp increases elsewhere, shows that it has found a sustainable balance - or whether the recent numbers are just a temporary aberration.\n\nWith a population of 10.1 million, Sweden averaged just over 200 new cases a day for several weeks, although in recent days that number has jumped to about 380.\n\nThe per capita rate is far lower than nearby Denmark or the Netherlands - if higher than the negligible rates in Norway and Finland. Sweden is also doing far better, for the moment, than Spain, with 10,000 cases a day, and France, with 12,000.\n\nIn response to the recent outbreaks, many European countries are imposing new restrictions.\n\nBut political leaders, anxious to avoid unpopular and economically disastrous lockdowns, are relying mostly on social distancing measures while trying to preserve a degree of normalcy, with schools, shops, eateries and even bars open.\n\nIn essence, some experts say, they are quietly adopting the Swedish approach.\n\nDr Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health in Geneva, said: \"Today, all of the European countries are more or less following the Swedish model, combined with the testing, tracing and quarantine procedures the Germans have introduced, but none will admit it.\"\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nSweden\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": []}

such as sovereign, quasi-government and supra bonds - fell in some regions and cash allocations were down.\n\nThe allocation by Singapore-based asset managers into equities rose to 42 per cent of AUM last year, from 41 per cent in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, investments into fixed income assets also increased, led by flows into corporate bonds, which accounted for 66 per cent of fixed income AUM last year.\n\nWhile traditional AUM - equities and fixed income - increased by a combined 25 per cent last year, Singapore's alternatives sector also continued to expand at a steady pace.\n\nPrivate equity and venture capital firms posted strong growth of 14 per cent and 86 per cent respectively.\n\nNEW FRAMEWORK FOR FUNDS\n\nMAS said Singapore is also fast becoming an Asia-Pacific hub for asset managers seeking to locate their investments and fund management activities in the same destination through variable capital companies (VCC) - a new flexible corporate structure designed for it.\n\nThe central bank and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) launched the VCC framework on Jan 15.\n\nAs at mid-last month, more than 120 VCCs have been incorporated with Acra, it said.\n\n\"The VCC has attracted diverse interest from global and local asset managers due to its flexibility, such as its ability to be used as either a standalone fund or as an umbrella fund with multiple sub-funds, across traditional and alternative investment objectives,\" MAS said.\n\nCOVID-19 CHALLENGES\n\nBeyond the new VCCs, 86 new asset manager licences and registrations were issued in the first three quarters of this year.\n\n\"Despite the\n\nongoing Covid-19 pandemic\n\nand lingering uncertainty on the full extent of its implications on the asset management industry, Singapore continues to be an attractive place for business,\" MAS said.\n\nMAS said it has been working closely with Singapore-based asset managers to minimise business disruptions as well as support them in upskilling and venturing into new business streams.\n\nThese efforts will ensure that the industry is well-positioned to capitalise on new opportunities as the economy recovers, the central bank said.\n\nMAS said that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations continue to be at the forefront of investors' and asset managers' minds.\n\nDespite the dampening impact of Covid-19 on investment sentiment, global net inflows into sustainable funds have increased this year.\n\nSingapore's share of ESG managed assets stood at 28 per cent last year, compared with 27 per cent in 2018, the survey found.\n\nSee more on\n\nMAS/Monetary Authority of Singapore\n\nInvestment funds\n\nSurveys\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/yq-mas-30092024.jpg?VersionId=jcTZHCAJjH9DAHJn.SDw3QhdieBGIqND", "alt_text": null}]}

The song, which has a music video, is his tribute to black music, specifically the early blues of the Mississippi Delta.\n\nHis other post-circuit breaker work - The Clouds Are Bleeding, And We All Can't Breathe - consists of electric guitar improvisations which he dubs \"the most intense instrumental album I've ever recorded\".\n\nThe other three albums have works created before the circuit breaker.

The second is that Singaporeans need to focus on opportunities only within the country, and the third is prioritising long-term career plans, he said in his keynote address at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Teachers' Conference, which was held virtually.\n\nHe said many people think learning to use data and to code will be sufficient. \"I'm not saying that's not important, but I'm saying that's not enough... because many of (these processes) will eventually be automated if they can be.\"\n\nSoft skills - empathy, the ability to tell a story and create connections with others - will help people differentiate themselves.\n\nMr Chng also said it will be important to disabuse people of the notion that \"Singapore is enough\".\n\n\"What worries me is we are so focused on what's happening here... 'I just want to get a simple job', 'I want to just create stuff for Singapore'. Increasingly, if you think that way, you'll start getting pressures from elsewhere because there's global competition. There's competition with robots and technology.\" There are opportunities globally and in Asia, he added, and Singaporeans must ensure they stay relevant.\n\nNoting that many pride themselves on long-term planning, he said: \"Growing up as a Singaporean, we all think there's a divine plan for us and our children... You clear secondary school, go on, get a job and that's your plan for life.\"\n\nBut life is not that straightforward. The ability to react and plan in the short term will be important, he stressed. Students should pursue their \"obsessions and side hustles\", which will help them build confidence and find meaning.\n\nITE chief executive Low Khah Gek also spoke at the conference yesterday, touching on disruptions in the economy due to Covid-19. \"We need to understand the new reality of where the Singapore economy is heading, further shifts in industries and businesses and, more importantly, the changes to jobs and workplace skills.\"\n\nDr Gog Soon Joo, chief skills and research officer as well as chief futurist at SkillsFuture Singapore, said there will be fewer \"single skill\" jobs.

We meet three recent beneficiaries to see not only how the fund has helped them, but also how it has influenced them to give back.\n\nFollow topic:\n\nCovid-19\n\nPublished\n\nOct 01, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nA special payout of $100 each will be made to about 10,000 students who receive regular help from The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF) to help them cope during the downturn caused by the ongoing pandemic.\n\nFamilies who have been hit hard by job cuts will also be given a hand, with the fund offering assistance for three to six months. This is to ensure that the children's education does not suffer while their parents are looking for work.\n\nThese new moves are being made as the fund - initiated by ST journalists on Children's Day in 2000 as part of the newsroom's efforts to reach out to the community - marks its 20th anniversary today.\n\nAnnouncing the additional assistance, the fund's chairman, Mr Warren Fernandez, said: \"We know that these are exceptionally difficult times for many families so we are doing all we can to try to help.\n\n\"We are able to do so only because of the support of our generous donors who have stepped up in this time of great need.\"\n\nThe additional help, he added, would come in handy for parents who need to pay for books and other educational needs at the end of the year.\n\nIt would also help prevent children from having to go hungry if their parents are affected by the economic downturn, said Mr Fernandez, who is editor of The Straits Times and editor-in-chief of Singapore Press Holdings' English/Malay/Tamil Media Group.\n\nThe monthly financial aid for primary school pupils is $60 while those in secondary school receive $95. The assistance lasts for up to 24 months. Each post-secondary student gets $120 a month, and is supported for up to 48 months.\n\nSince earlier this year, the ST charity has taken steps to beef up financial aid for students whose families have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. This year, beneficiaries received $50 per month for two months - in May and July - on top of the regular monthly aid that was given out.\n\nAbout 2,000 students have also been selected by schools and social service agencies for a $500 e-grant from the fund to buy products from Challenger or Harvey Norman to help them with their home-based learning.\n\nIn total, the fund has disbursed nearly $11 million this year to help beneficiaries cope with the extraordinary financial difficulties wrought by the pandemic.\n\nOver the past two decades, the fund has given out about $80 million to close to 180,000 students.\n\nMs Tan Bee Heong, general manager of the STSPMF, said the fund has received tremendous support from the public this year, with more than $10 million in donations.\n\nThe amount was the largest donation the fund has received since its inception, she added.\n\nSaid Ms Tan: \"The school pocket money not only ensures that our beneficiaries do not go hungry in school and are able to focus on their studies, but it also gives their parents a sense of security and assurance that they do not have to worry about their children going hungry in school. Parents are then able to focus on resolving their other challenges.\"\n\nSince 2017, more than 250 mainstream schools have joined the fund as disbursing partners to give out school pocket money to their students.\n\nHOW TO DONATE\n\nDonation via PayNow\n\nUEN: T11CC0007D\n\nIn the reference number field, indicate your NRIC/FIN and contact number for tax exemption.\n\nIf sending a cheque, make it out to \"SPMF\" or \"The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund\" and send it to: The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund, 1000 Toa Payoh North, News Centre, Singapore 318994.\n\nInclude the following information on the back of the cheque: For individual donors, indicate name, NRIC/FIN, contact number and address.\n\nFor corporate donors, indicate company name, UEN, contact person, contact number and address.

The grant helped to provide pocket money to students who needed to buy meals during the school holidays.\n\nTo adapt to the changing needs of its beneficiaries, Ms Tan said the fund conducts regular reviews of the social service landscape to ensure it stays relevant and responsive to needs on the ground.\n\nSome of the past reviews and adjustments to the fund's policies included adjusting the per capita income requirement and monthly school pocket money when the cost of living increased. In 2013, the fund was expanded to include students in junior colleges, polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education.\n\nSaid Mr Fernandez: \"We are very grateful for the strong support of our donors. Our aim is to ensure we repay their kindness by doing as much as we possibly can for the kids and families who turn to us for help.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nChildren and youth", "images": []}

Dozens have been reported killed and hundreds wounded in fighting since Sunday that has spread far beyond the enclave's borders, threatening to spill over into an all-out war between the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe skirmishes have raised concerns about stability in the South Caucasus region, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets, and raised fears that regional powers Russia and Turkey could be drawn in.\n\nSome of Turkey's Nato allies are increasingly alarmed by Ankara's stance on Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region inside Turkey's close ally Azerbaijan that is run by ethnic Armenians but is not recognised by any country as an independent republic.\n\nEchoing remarks by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu yesterday said Turkey would \"do what is necessary\", when asked whether Ankara would offer military support if Azerbaijan requested it.\n\nMr Cavusoglu also said French solidarity with Armenia amounted to supporting Armenian occupation in Azerbaijan.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, whose country is home to many people of Armenian ancestry, hit back during a visit to Latvia. He said France was extremely concerned by \"warlike messages\" from Turkey \"which essentially remove any of Azerbaijan's inhibitions in reconquering Nagorno-Karabakh\". \"And that we won't accept,\" he said.\n\nNagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave, broke away from Azerbaijan in the 1990s in a war that killed an estimated 30,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands.\n\nIn yesterday's clashes, the latest in decades of conflict, Armenian media said three civilians were killed and several wounded by shelling in the town of Martakert in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nAzerbaijan said 14 Azeri civilians had been killed since fighting began on Sunday, and released footage showing grey smoke rising from inside Nagorno-Karabakh as it was pounded by Azeri artillery.\n\nPhotographs taken in the Azeri town of Terter showed people taking cover in dugouts, and damaged buildings that residents said had been hit by Armenian shells.\n\nAzerbaijan said ethnic Armenian forces tried to recover lost ground by launching counter-attacks in the direction of Madagiz, but Azeri forces repelled the attack.\n\nArmenia said the Azeri army had been shelling the whole front line during the night and two Azeri drones were shot down over Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh's administrative centre. It was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nArmenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said he was not considering asking for Russia's help at this point under a post-Soviet security treaty, but did not rule out doing so.\n\nHe said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had not discussed the possibility of Russian military intervention when they spoke by telephone on Tuesday.\n\nArmenia's unified information centre, an online governmental platform, posted pictures of the wreckage of what it said was an SU-25 warplane shot down by a Turkish fighter jet on Tuesday.\n\nTurkey denied downing the plane.

On the whole, 2,348 of 2,543 dengue clusters, or about 92 per cent reported this year, have been closed.\n\nThe NEA said a slower rate of disease transmission was observed in some of the larger dengue clusters, such as the 179-case cluster in Balam Road, in the MacPherson area, which had an average of less than one case reported a day in the past two weeks.\n\nThere are, however, still large dengue clusters located in Arnasalam Chetty Road, Kim Yam Road, Aljunied Road, Geylang Road, Guillemard Road, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 2, East Coast Road, Jalan Baiduri and Bedok North Avenue 1.\n\nTo curb dengue transmission, the NEA and its partners have kept up a high tempo of preventive inspections for mosquito breeding, as well as inspections in cluster areas.\n\nThe NEA has also provided town councils and stakeholders with surveillance data to prioritise dengue control measures and target areas with higher mosquito populations.\n\nThese measures include stepping up the cleaning of drains in certain areas and removing discarded receptacles to prevent the accumulation of stagnant water.\n\nThis year's dengue outbreak is the largest in seven years, with 30,431 cases reported as at Tuesday, surpassing the previous high of 22,170 reported in 2013.\n\nAs at Aug 5, 20 people aged between 25 and 92 have died of dengue this year.\n\nSee more on\n\nDengue fever\n\nNational Environment Agency", "images": []}

What I did today with Eric Dier is very dangerous,\" said Mourinho, suggesting that dehydration could have led to the defender's problem.\n\n\"It should be forbidden to play two matches in 48 hours. What Eric Dier did is not human.\"\n\nTimo Werner's first goal for Chelsea compounded Mourinho's woes in a dominant start from Frank Lampard's men.\n\nBut Erik Lamela levelled for Spurs seven minutes from time and new Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy was unable to stop Dier, Lamela, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane scoring from the spot.\n\nTammy Abraham, Cesar Azpilicueta, Jorginho and Emerson also converted their penalties.\n\nBut Mason Mount's effort clipped the post to the delight of the watching Gareth Bale, who could be fit to feature for Spurs in the last eight with the matches not till late December.\n\n\"Anything can happen on penalties,\" said Lampard. \"You want to stay in these competitions of course but there's lots to like. We dominated the first half but the game changed (in the second).\"\n\nMourinho claimed the fixture pile-up gave him no choice but to prioritise today's Europa League play-off tie against Maccabi Haifa.\n\n\"I told the players they should only think about this game, but I have to think about three games,\" added the Portuguese manager, who faces his former club Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\n\"I cannot believe in 48 hours we are playing a European game. The boys were absolutely phenomenal.\"\n\nLampard made eight changes, but Werner was one of those retained from the 3-3 draw at West Brom on Saturday and he took the opportunity to get his first goal after moving from Bundesliga team RB Leipzig.\n\nSpurs debutant Sergio Reguilon was twice at fault in the build-up as he gifted possession to Azpilicueta and then dived in trying to block the Spaniard's cross, which allowed the Chelsea captain to pick out Werner at the edge of the box to arrow a shot into the bottom corner.\n\nMourinho then showed his intent by introducing Kane with 20 minutes to go.\n\nBut moments later the Spurs boss was marching down the tunnel after Dier, as the defender made a dash to the dressing room before quickly returning.\n\nChelsea did not make the most of a brief period with an extra man, as Callum Hudson-Odoi fired over and Werner's fierce effort was saved by Hugo Lloris.\n\n\"He wasn't happy but there was nothing I could do about it, nature was calling,\" said Dier of being pursued by Mourinho.\n\n\"I heard there was a chance, but thankfully they didn't score.\"\n\nChelsea were punished when Lamela slotted home at the far post to send the game to a shoot-out and ultimately Spurs into the last eight.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nChelsea\n\nLeague Cup\n\nJose Mourinho", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/st_20201001_sptcam_6000407.jpg?VersionId=e8gPh3Yqk.IEd1mGGx.sfuHhTESaZ6YC", "alt_text": "Top: Tottenham's Harry Kane and other players jumping on goalkeeper Hugo Lloris after their 5-4 penalty shoot-out win over Chelsea at home.

While nuclear and chemical weapons were largely in the hands of nations, cyber weapons - and AI techniques - are in the hands of criminal groups, terrorist groups and teenagers.\n\nStill, the report's focus on working with allies and developing global codes of ethics and privacy runs counter to the instincts of the Trump administration, making it more surprising that the Republican members of the task force signed on.\n\n\"I think this is a case of pushing for a different path at the Pentagon,\" said Representative Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican and a co-chairman of the group.\n\nThis week, House Republicans plan to issue another report, aimed at containing Chinese power.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nUS military\n\nAI/artificial intelligence", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_WKREAPER_6001010.jpg?VersionId=bAsY2J3.idLZ3F1Gqv0EA5WOiyf7boUQ", "alt_text": "A US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone at Amari Air Base in Estonia.

We are now seeing low community transmission, but we must remain vigilant.\n\n\"We are\n\nprogressively reopening our economy\n\nin a safe manner. But there is much uncertainty ahead and many people are understandably anxious about their jobs,\" he said, adding that the announcement of the additional measures had provided much needed certainty to businesses and workers.\n\nAmong the key measures announced were adjustments to\n\nthe Jobs Support Scheme,\n\nwhich helps employers fund up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee, for 10 months up to August this year.\n\nThe measures extend wage support till March next year, tiered based on how quickly each sector is expected to recover.\n\nFirms in the hardest-hit aerospace, aviation and tourism sectors, which were getting 75 per cent wage support, get 50 per cent wage support for seven more months.\n\nThe built environment sector will get 50 per cent support for two more months, before it is lowered to 30 per cent of wages paid up to March next year, in line with the phased resumption of construction activities.\n\nMost other sectors will get 10 per cent support for seven more months.\n\nHowever, sectors that are doing well, such as biomedical sciences, financial services and infocommunications and technology, will get this amount of support up to December.\n\nIn addition,\n\nthe Covid-19 Support Grant,\n\nintroduced in May to help Singaporeans who have been laid off or have suffered significant income loss, was extended to December. To qualify, unemployed applicants must demonstrate job search or training efforts.\n\nMr Heng said the measures would be funded by the reallocation of monies from other areas, such as development expenditures that were delayed due to Covid-19.\n\nLast month, he updated Parliament that he would table the third Supplementary Supply Bill to set out details of provisions to meet additional spending on these measures, which would then be debated by MPs.

Neuer stood his ground, however, to deny the Norwegian and Kimmich snatched the winner.\n\nBayern have also won the German league and Cup double, the Champions League and the European Super Cup this year.\n\nSee more on\n\nBayern Munich\n\nFootball matches", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/fbl-ger-supercup-bayern_munich-dortmund-204722.jpg?VersionId=d.uSdDj7iRQjdSaMK5U4zRN2sqFcVyRb", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/2020-09-30t203049z_207745965_rc289j9jta6h_rtrmadp_3_soccer-germany-bay-dor-report.jpg?VersionId=ngRszo.NPBm6dVqM9mGpzi3xXpRZDrwO", "alt_text": null}]}

The Straits Times understands that this refers to funds held by Wirecard as part of processing payments for merchants, as well as corporate customers which issue pre-paid cards.\n\nOnce a fintech giant with businesses spanning the globe,\n\nWirecard filed for bankruptcy in June\n\nafter disclosing that \u20ac1.9 billion (S$3 billion) in cash, supposed to be in bank accounts in the Philippines, did not exist.\n\nPayment gateways like Wirecard act as a link between financial institutions. When a bank customer pays for his purchase at a retailer using a credit card, payment gateways alert the cardholder's bank that a transaction is in process.\n\nBanks will then indicate whether the customer has sufficient credit to make the purchase. The retailer receives the payment and the payment gateway typically receives a cut from the transaction.\n\nWirecard's main business activities in Singapore are to process Visa and Mastercard payments for merchants and help companies issue pre-paid cards.\n\nSingapore is home to Wirecard's Asia-Pacific headquarters in Pasir Panjang. Wirecard was still listed as a tenant at the building when ST visited the premises yesterday.\n\nMAS said it has been monitoring the impact of parent company Wirecard AG's insolvency on the ability of its Singapore entities to continue providing payment services here.\n\nHowever, Wirecard SG has told the authority that it is unable to continue providing payment processing services to a \"significant number of merchants\", it said.\n\nAs such, MAS assessed that it is in the interest of the public for Wirecard SG to cease its payment services and promptly return all customers' funds, it said. \"This provides the greatest certainty to customers on their appropriate course of action, including seeking alternative service providers.\"\n\nAlternative forms of e-payment available in Singapore include Nets, PayNow and SGQR. In addition, banks such as DBS, United Overseas Bank and OCBC, as well as payment services provider Nets, provide merchant acquisition services.\n\nSome merchants that have used Wirecard are now offering consumers other payment options while others are adjusting. For example, the BreadTalk outlet at VivoCity did not accept credit cards when ST visited yesterday, suggesting that customers use cash instead.\n\nST understands that companies across various sectors such as Subway and Gong Cha had used Wirecard, although it is unclear if and when they made a switch.\n\nSheng Siong Group chief executive Lim Hock Chee said yesterday that the grocery chain had already moved away from using Wirecard. It offers a range of payment options including Nets and credit card.\n\nChef Park Tan, who owns Indonesian restaurant Pagi Sore, said Wirecard was the main processor of credit cards for his business, but he switched to another payment processor, First Data, after news of the missing billions hit the headlines.\n\nHe said: \"There was no additional cost in switching but it was troublesome. Things are already bad for businesses during this pandemic and then this hits...\n\n\"I imagine that some who have not switched will be scrambling now because it takes a while to change to a new processor.\"\n\nEntities under Wirecard are not currently licensed by MAS.\n\nSEE\n\nTOP OF THE NEWS\n\nSee more on\n\nMAS/Monetary Authority of Singapore\n\nFraud\n\nPayment systems", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/rk_wirecard_011020.jpg?VersionId=GJZTNfHYy3i0wHd7k0x3nVx8YUHP4liA", "alt_text": null}]}

The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats will Fall in the Fall,\" the president commented.\n\nThe retweet was later deleted.\n\nAnd in September, Trump expressed sympathy and support for\n\n17-year-old right-wing activist Kyle Rittenhouse,\n\nwho faces murder charges after shooting dead two anti-police protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin in August.\n\n'REPUBLICAN VOLUNTEER SECURITY FORCE'\n\nTrump's reluctance to call out the Proud Boys has helped turn them into one of the most prominent extreme militia-type groups on the right, since they were founded in 2016.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, which researches extremist groups, says the Proud Boys are bound by extreme male chauvinism, opposition to immigrants and Muslims, with some members also embracing white supremacy.\n\nMostly they have tied themselves to Trump and whatever he supports, the ADL says.\n\n\"After several years of forging alliances with members of the Republican political establishment, the Proud Boys have carved out a niche for themselves as both a right-wing fight club and a volunteer security force for the (Republican Party),\" it said.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUS presidential election 2020", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/portland-unrest-12.jpg?VersionId=jBio5mMOp2_3G1ZvstvZBpBp.lu8TNY9", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/2020-09-30t142427z_215705855_rc229j94xijr_rtrmadp_3_usa-election-debate-europe.jpg?VersionId=0OxWFSENj3KvhWqEwXqBEJDZ8hBi9XN5", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign - DBS Wellness space 1 (CREDIT DBS Bank)\n \nCredit: Photo of DBS Bank office"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ababd7adbab5ef95d4223806a015c648e9803c8d554289cc24869840a46a74ae", "alt_text": "Enforcement action by the Health Sciences Authority netted a suspect and various vapes on July 10."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7f73688fa163929df2c176d392b660d82a63b73e970c811e2339978d254a5fcd", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo, with retirees Chong Hock Loo, 75, and Shirley Tan, 68, during the PCF Family Day event on July 13."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0748316b0c8c0488543313beecbd97ee6f6260fce547cdce53f76f53d9d6a49f", "alt_text": "From left: Pathlight School students Marcus Goh, Nurdaanya Mohamed Hafiz and Brennan Tay with their respective artwork, part of a total of 30 artwork that are selected in the Wing Tai X Pathlight School art competition to be displayed on a construction hoarding along Kim Seng Linear Park, on July 11, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0f74970f823073d68c58dca22ef69d6312f85ec19cd11cccf600d0046eabbb32", "alt_text": "Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - July 13, 2025 Italy's Jannik Sinner celebrates with the trophy after winning the men's final against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz REUTERS/Andrew Couldridge"}]}

Their letters were released by Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn her letter, President Halimah said China has made immense progress over seven decades, particularly after the launch of its reform and opening-up policy in 1978.\n\nIt is now the world's second-largest economy and a top trading partner for many countries, including Singapore. Amid the pandemic, China has been one of the first countries to control the outbreak and revive its economy, she wrote.\n\nSingapore-Sino relations have grown in tandem with China's development, President Halimah added, noting that this year is the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n\n\"In the short span of thirty years, our bilateral ties have strengthened significantly and broken new ground in diverse areas.

Both countries work closely in multilateral fora too, PM Lee said, and Singapore is looking forward to marking the 30th anniversary of Asean-China relations next year.\n\n\"We also look forward to the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership later this year, which will be a timely affirmation of our joint commitment to upholding a rules-based multilateral trading system.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nLee Hsien Loong\n\nHalimah Yacob", "images": []}

He started receiving a $35 monthly allowance from The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF).\n\nThe money not only allowed him to have a meal at recess, but also helped develop his self-confidence.\n\nThose days of going hungry in school from Primary 1 to Primary 3 are still fresh in the mind of Mr Lau, now 23 and a National University of Singapore (NUS) undergraduate.\n\nHe said: \"The extra pocket money allowed me to mingle with my friends and develop my social skills without worrying about whether I could afford to go out with them.\n\n\"These skills are important because they prepare a child for interpersonal relations at the workplace in the future.\"\n\nMr Lau is among the 180,000 beneficiaries of the STSPMF, which was launched on Children's Day in 2000. Today marks the fund's 20th anniversary.\n\nMr Lau said that when he was in polytechnic, the fund again came to his aid between 2014 and 2015.\n\nHis sister, now a 20-year-old polytechnic student, was also a beneficiary of the fund.\n\nThe family was also supported by the Thye Hua Kwan Family Service Centre in Bedok North.\n\nMr Lau, who is pursuing a degree in chemical engineering on an NUS scholarship, said he appreciates the assistance he received and plans to give back to the community.\n\n\"When I first joined the course, I was motivated by the potential to earn well. But now, I believe what matters more is what we do with the money that we earn. I want to uplift other kids who could be in the situation I was in,\" he said.\n\nFor another beneficiary of the STSPMF, the pocket money has given her the opportunity to explore her creative side.\n\nAdele Soong, eight, a Primary 2 pupil at St Margaret's Primary School, spent $40 from the money she received to buy an electronic keyboard. With the help of an app and YouTube videos, she has taught herself how to play it.\n\nSTSPMF beneficiaries in primary school receive $60 a month.\n\nHer mother, Ms Tiffany Tee, 45, an administrative assistant, said: \"When Adele wants to buy food or stationery, like a watercolour paint set, I can tap the fund to buy it for her instead of putting it off to the next month or her birthday.\"\n\nMs Tee and her husband also have two sons - a four-year-old and a nine-year-old who is autistic.\n\nThe three children receive aid from the Education Ministry's Financial Assistance Scheme, which helps needy families meet school expenses.\n\nMs Tee said the money Adele receives from the STSPMF is a welcome relief. On a typical school day, Adele and her best friend would tuck into their favourite food at recess: roti prata.\n\nThough she enjoys painting and aspires to be an artist, she is saving up to buy a set of drums as she wants to learn new instruments on her own.\n\nFor 14-year-old Dahlia Dlaila Iskandar, the STSPMF has encouraged her to aspire to be a nurse.\n\nThe Secondary 2 student at CHIJ Katong Convent and her two siblings, aged six and 16, faced financial difficulties at home while growing up. Her parents had to set aside money for bills and basic needs, which took priority over other purchases.\n\nDahlia has been a beneficiary of the fund since 2013. She received an allowance for 19 months while in primary school and for five months this year, from January to May.\n\nShe said: \"The fund encourages me to work harder in school so that I can achieve my dream to be a nurse and help other people. I'm thankful for the contributions made by donors.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nStraits Times School Pocket Money Fund\n\nFinancial aid", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_FUND1_6000200.jpg?VersionId=11X1shjOWp4D4Oazp9noY7.Rj3uxQdzC", "alt_text": "Left: Undergraduate Malcom Lau says The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund allowed him to have a meal during recess and gave him the opportunity to mingle with his friends, which helped develop his social skills and build his self-confidence.

Those who receive it after Sept 30 can submit applications within 10 working days of receiving the notice.\n\nBesides those with disputes, the new changes also provide a mechanism for those affected by construction-related delays to get help.\n\nThis mechanism aims to provide relief for those who rent goods used for construction work who are now liable for additional expenses due to a delay or breach in a related contract.\n\nFor example, a contractor may have rented goods such as scaffolding material or hand drills from a supplier to perform works under a construction contract with a third party.\n\nBut the works may have been delayed due to the pandemic, incurring additional rental expenses. The contractor can then apply for relief, said MinLaw.\n\nThe support also applies to tenants of non-residential properties who cannot carry out or finish renovation or fitting-out works during their rent-free period.\n\nTenants are typically granted a rent-free window to finish such works, but they might have lost out on this window if contractors could not complete renovation due to\n\nthe coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe tenant may apply for relief for the part of the rent-free period that was not used, MinLaw added.\n\nLastly, the new mechanism also applies to landlords of non-residential properties who are unable to deliver possession to the tenant by a stipulated date because of coronavirus-related delays in construction.\n\nTo be eligible for relief, applicants must also check that their affected contracts had been in force any time between Feb 1 this year and March 31 next year.\n\nThe contract must also be entered into before March 25, and any delay or breach must have occurred between Feb 1 this year and March 31 next year.\n\nThey must submit applications for relief by May 31 next year.\n\nMinLaw added that an assessor appointed by the ministry may adjust the contractual terms to mitigate the impact of the delay, in those specific circumstances.\n\nAmendments to the Act\n\nAmendments to the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and related laws to strengthen the legal mechanisms available to support businesses and people in dealing with the impact of the pandemic:\n\n1.

Biden asked.\n\n\"Or does he just ignore you, look down on you, lie to you?\"\n\nAfter the president failed to explicitly condemn white supremacists, Senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the US Senate, said on Wednesday that he believes Trump \"needs to correct\" his comments.\n\n\"White supremacy should be denounced at every turn.

a margin similar to that of national polls heading into the Nov 3 election.\n\n'MELTDOWN'\n\nWhile Biden's camp was praising their candidate's performance Wednesday, Trump took to Twitter to lash out at Fox News host Chris Wallace, the moderator, claiming he had joined forces with Biden and ganged up on him.\n\nBiden responded with a tweet depicting Trump as a crying baby.\n\nThe Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said Trump's debate behavior demonstrated why she had recommended that Biden not debate him at all.\n\n\"You saw a political nervous breakdown, a meltdown,\" Pelosi said on MSNBC.\n\nTrump \"has never respected the dignity of his office and he demonstrated that last night\".\n\nThe Cleveland debate was scheduled to be the first of three before the election but the acrimonious debacle led to calls by some commentators for the two others to be cancelled.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Biden's running mate Senator Kamala Harris suggested it was unlikely that the Democratic nominee would bow out of the next debates.\n\n\"Joe Biden's never going to refuse to talk to the American people,\" Harris said.\n\nTrump was to attend a fund-raiser Wednesday and address an outdoor campaign rally in Duluth, Minnesota, a Midwestern state narrowly won by Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe next debate is scheduled for Oct 15 in Miami.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden\n\nUS presidential election 2020", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/topshots-topshot-combo-us-vote-debate-065025.jpg?VersionId=vGFmGYTwTNEQiWT0DUO65ywvwOusl8ZQ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign -

She was 78.\n\nThe death was confirmed by her children in a message posted on her official fan page on Facebook. She suffered for decades from Addison's disease (she had a kidney removed when she was 17) and since at least 2015, from dementia.\n\nI Am Woman reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts at the end of 1972 - a good six months after it was released. Individual call-in requests helped build radio play and the song earned her a Grammy Award for best female pop vocal performance.\n\nShe was the first Australia-born artist to win a Grammy and make the Billboard 100 record charts. Some male observers called the song - beginning with the words \"I am woman/Hear me roar/In numbers/ Too big to ignore,\" sung by a 1.6m tall soprano - angry, man-hating, dangerous or all three.\n\n\"That simply underlined the many things women needed liberating from,\" a writer for Variety reflected last year. \"Nobody called Sinatra a menace when he sang My Way, a no less straightforward hymn to selfdetermination.\"\n\nDuring the 1970s, three of Reddy's songs - including Delta Dawn and Angie Baby - went to No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Three others - Ain't No Way To Treat A Lady, You and Me Against The World and Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress) - made the Top 10.\n\nMore than three decades later, The Chicago Tribune declared her the \"queen of '70s pop\".\n\nHelen Maxine Lamond Reddy was born on Oct 25, 1941, in Melbourne, the only child of Max Reddy, a writer, producer and actor; and Stella (Lamond) Reddy, an actress whose stage name was Stella Campbell. Her father was in New Guinea, serving in the Australian army, when she was born.\n\nThe Reddys performed on the Australian vaudeville circuit and Helen began joining them on stage when she was four. At 12, she rebelled by quitting show business and going to live with an aunt while her parents toured.\n\nBut her financial situation - after an early marriage, parenthood and divorce - persuaded her to return. She had a solid reputation in Australian television and radio when she won a 1966 talent contest sponsored by Bandstand, a Sydney pop-music television show. The prize was a trip to New York City and a record-company audition there.\n\nThe audition did not pan out and her career got off to a slow, discouraging start. Before Capitol Records signed her in 1970, at least 27 record labels rejected her, and she and her new husband, Jeff Wald, who was now her manager, moved - first to Chicago, then to Los Angeles.\n\nTimes were hard, especially when the couple lived in New York. In The Woman I Am: A Memoir (2006), she wrote: \"When we did eat, it was spaghetti, and we spent what little money we had on cockroach spray.\"\n\nHer first hit was a 1971 cover of I Don't Know How To Love Him, a hit from the award-winning stage show Jesus Christ Superstar. The success of I Am Woman, with Reddy's lyrics and Ray Burton's music, came a year later.\n\nShe was a frequent guest in the early 1970s on variety, music and talk shows such as The Mike Douglas Show, The Carol Burnett Show, The David Frost Show, The Merv Griffin Show and The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour. The Helen Reddy Show (1973) was an eight-episode summer replacement series on NBC.\n\nShe made her big-screen debut in the disaster movie Airport 1975 (1974) as a guitar-playing nun who comforts a sick little girl (Linda Blair) on an almost certainly doomed 747. She always liked to point out that Gloria Swanson and Myrna Loy were also in the cast.\n\nThat was followed by a starring role in the Disney movie Pete's Dragon (1977) as a sceptical New England lighthouse keeper who doubts an orphaned boy's stories about his animated fire-breathing pet.\n\nReddy's Broadway career consisted of replacing the lead in Blood Brothers, a musical set in Liverpool, for a few months in 1995. But she had a busy stage career elsewhere, starring in productions of Anything Goes, Call Me Madam and Shirley Valentine in England and in the United States, from Provincetown to Sacramento.\n\nHer last song to make the American charts was I Can't Say Goodbye To You (1981) and Imagination (1983) was her last album. Her final screen appearance was in The Perfect Host (2010), a crime comedy with David Hyde Pierce.\n\nReddy married and divorced three times. In 1961, she married Kenneth Claude Weate, an older musician who was a family friend. They had a daughter and divorced in 1966.\n\nIn 1968, she married Wald, and they had a son. They separated in 1981, when he checked into a treatment facility for cocaine addiction, and divorced two years later. That same year, she married Milton Ruth, a drummer in her band. They divorced in 1995.\n\nSurvivors include her two children, Traci Wald Donat, the daughter from her first marriage, and Jordan Sommers, the son from her second; her half-sister, Toni Lamond, an Australian singer-actress; and a grandchild.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nObituary\n\nMusicians", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_NYTREDDY01_5999235.jpg?VersionId=DVREgtILg64RKaVxvuYyhSQ4oN1AJZXq", "alt_text": "Singer Helen Reddy performing on stage at the women's march in Los Angeles in January 2017."}]}

Dr Cavaleri said at the time the first approval of a vaccine could come by the end of the year.\n\nIn a normal environment, drugmakers submit trial data to the regulator for a review that can take many months. Once that's complete, an opinion is given on whether the product should be authorised for use, which must be signed off by the European Commission.\n\nIn emergencies like a pandemic, a rolling review avoids delays so that an EMA recommendation and approval from the European Commission can be sought as quickly as possible. The agency started such an evaluation of remdesivir to treat Covid-19 in April, while trials were ongoing, and the drug was given conditional approval three months later.\n\nAstraZeneca declined to comment.

It also removes the need for cabbies to toggle between their phone and the taxi's mobile display terminal.\n\nWith the app, taxi drivers can start their taxi meter when they opt for street hail jobs and control their rooftop sign when they have passengers on board.\n\nSMRT passengers who make phone bookings can also expect shorter waiting times for their drivers, as their bookings will be allocated with the updated mapping tools and ride optimisation features that the Grab platform offers.\n\nThe enhanced app was jointly developed by SMRT and Grab.\n\nSMRT Roads president Tan Kian Heong said: \"We have been working with Grab on this project for a year now. This new system will seamlessly integrate Grab's driver app with our street hail system, providing convenience and more job opportunities to our taxi partners.\"\n\nGrab said it has also designed and developed a Web-based fleet operations platform \"from ground up\" to streamline SMRT's operational needs. With this, SMRT is able to supervise and control the entire dispatch and fleet operations from a central portal efficiently.\n\nThe Web portal also enables SMRT operations officers to register new vehicles in the fleet, or suspend errant drivers and customers quickly if required. They will also be able to track bookings in real time and send in-app notifications to drivers if there are any important announcements.\n\nSMRT, the third-largest cab operator here, has also set up a dedicated cloud-based infrastructure to ensure \"an optimal experience for its drivers and operations team\".\n\nGrab said it rolled out more than one tech improvement to its own transport platform each week on average last year.\n\nChristopher Tan\n\nSee more on\n\nSMRT\n\nGrab", "images": []}

United States President Donald Trump, 74, did the lion's share of interruptions, frequently talking over his opponent Joe Biden, 77, and heckling him.\n\nMr Biden, who often could barely get a word in, was occasionally thrown off balance. \"Will you shut up, man?\" he said at one point. \"This is so unpresidential... keep yapping, man.\"\n\nThis would have played differently to different audiences. Mr Trump's supporters are likely to see him as strong and Mr Biden as a weak opponent who needed the moderator to stand up for him. Meanwhile, the President's detractors will call him a bully.\n\nMr Biden's strategy of addressing the camera at times, directly asking the audience whether their life experience contradicted the miraculous pandemic recovery extolled by Mr Trump, was very much in line with his brand of campaigning and folksy charm.\n\nAll in all, the barrage of interruptions meant the two men could hardly engage with each other on substantive points nor delve deep into policy discussions.\n\n2 THE SPECTRE OF SOCIALISM\n\nMr Trump tried to paint Mr Biden as a socialist, while trying to pit the left wing of the Democratic Party against Mr Biden for not being leftist enough for them.\n\n\"They're going to dominate you, Joe, you know that,\" said Mr Trump. \"Your party wants to go socialist.\"\n\n\"I'm the Democratic Party right now,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nThe former vice-president responded in a consistently moderate manner. Over the course of the debate, he explicitly said he was against defunding police forces and did not support the Green New Deal.\n\n3 PERSONAL INSULTS SIGNAL MORE UGLINESS AHEAD\n\nAt times, the debate descended into name-calling and insult-hurling. Mr Biden called Mr Trump a clown, a fool, a liar, and the worst president the US has ever had.\n\nMr Trump mocked Mr Biden's intellect, saying he graduated at the bottom of his class. \"Don't ever use the word smart with me. There's nothing smart about you, Joe.\"\n\nThe debate got especially heated when Mr Trump went after Mr Biden's son Hunter, whom he accused without proof of corrupt business dealings. He also referenced Hunter's drug abuse and said he was \"dishonourably discharged\" from the military. Mr Biden, who had been in the middle of praising his late son Beau's military service in Iraq, said: \"That is simply not true.\"\n\n4 TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON ELECTORAL FRAUD CLAIMS\n\nAsked about the integrity of the election, Mr Trump doubled down on his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, calling the election rigged and saying: \"This is not going to end well.\"\n\nHe said he was urging his supporters to \"go into the polls and watch very carefully\", in contrast to Mr Biden's pledge to call on his supporters to remain calm on election night. Mr Biden also promised not to call a victory until the results had been independently certified.\n\nMr Trump's comments raise the chance of unrest should he lose.\n\n5 MOST VOTERS HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MINDS\n\nThe debate is unlikely to close the gap between the candidates. Voting is already under way in many states and most people say their minds have already been made up.\n\nHistorically, polls also do not shift that much at this stage.\n\nIn a FiveThirtyEight analysis of polls from 1976 to 2012, the difference between polling leads just after the first debate and at the end of the campaign was an average of 2.2 per cent.\n\nA\n\nMorning Consult poll\n\nreleased on Tuesday morning found that 86 per cent of voters say their position was immobile, with only 14 per cent saying they might change their mind.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/ST_20201001_TAKE01_6000796.jpg?VersionId=1lhqSAhZEOg1MkfSt2fygsJfYXfdanWk", "alt_text": "Supporters of US President Donald Trump watching the debate at the Trump Victory Campaign centre in Katy, Texas."}]}

It falls to all of us to act together and urgently to advance protection and development in parallel,\" he added.\n\nXi defended the \"UN-centered international system\" and the Paris climate accord, in what appeared to be an attack at the US, which is set to leave the landmark agreement.\n\nA call to redirect financing away from fossil fuels and other polluting industries and into locally led conservation was launched by environmental group Fauna & Flora International and backed by more than 130 organisations.\n\n\"UN member states must take the lead in getting ahead of this crisis and putting funding into the hands of those who are best placed to use it - local conservation organisations,\" said Mark Rose, chief executive of Fauna & Flora International.\n\nThe world spends an estimated US$80 billion - US$90 billion on conservation each year, but studies show that hundreds of billions of dollars may be needed to save ecosystems from collapse.\n\nBritain, Canada and others joined the European Union on Monday in pledging to protect 30 per cent of their land and seas by 2030.\n\nUN officials hope to secure a global agreement on that target at a major round of negotiations on biodiversity due to take place in China in 2021.\n\nRAPID LOSS\n\nThis year has brought both the extent and costs of biodiversity loss into stark relief.\n\nAnimal populations fell by 68 per cent between 1970 and 2016, according to the Living Planet Report 2020, a biannual assessment by World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London.\n\nParts of the world are much worse off, with animal populations in the tropical Americas down 94 per cent during the same period.\n\nPlants and fungi have a much higher risk of becoming extinct than previously thought, according to a report by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, released on Wednesday. About 20 per cent of species are at risk of disappearing, the group found.\n\nThe main threat to plants are agriculture and aquaculture activities, while the number one threat for fungi is residential and commercial development.\n\nPreserving nature is essential to the survival of economic activities such as fishing and agriculture, the European Forest Institute argued in an action plan also made public on Wednesday.\n\nOver 75 per cent of the global food crop types rely on animal pollination, with insects playing a key role. Around 4 billion people rely primarily on natural medicines for their health care, and some 70 per cent of drugs used for cancer come from products inspired by nature.\n\nIf humanity continues on this trajectory, we face a future where 30 per cent to 50 per cent of all species could be lost by the middle of the century, a report on the cost of biodiversity loss by the Paulson Institute think tank concluded in mid-September.\n\nTo reverse the decline in biodiversity by 2030, the global community would need to spend between US$722 billion and US$967 billion each year over the next decade.\n\nThe biodiversity finance gap stands at between US$598 billion and US$824 billion per year, the report said.\n\nBRAZIL'S RICHES\n\nAbout a fifth of the world's biodiversity resides in Brazil, with more than 100,000 animal species and 40,000 plant species: 70 per cent of the world's identified total.\n\nThe country's importance to global biodiversity and climate give it outsize attention in plans to protect planetary resources.\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro acknowledged Brazil's riches, but pushed back on international designs to protect them.\n\n\"The Convention on Biological Diversity enshrines the sovereign right of states to use their natural resources in accordance with their environmental policies,\" he said, \"and that is precisely what we intend to do with the huge wealth of resources found in the Brazilian territory.\"\n\nLeaders at the UN summit also warned that ongoing biodiversity loss was partly to blame for the emergence and spread of Covid-19.\n\n\"Biodiversity loss, deforestation, the loss of farmland, animal habitat loss and the consumption of wild species are creating conditions for infectious diseases that we will soon be unable to control,\" said Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the Republic of South Africa.\n\nSee more on\n\nClimate change\n\nPlants", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/2020-09-29t082500z_1096699667_rc288j9cgqdd_rtrmadp_3_malta-britain-royals-attenborough.jpg?VersionId=tFtt1q3h.j2Is17MoQCH6r9iNUl9f7gQ", "alt_text": null}]}

If he is not on the pitch tonight and Sunday, he will not come and will continue to train with Real Madrid.\"\n\nHazard has missed Madrid's opening two matches in La Liga, with coach Zinedine Zidane adamant the 29-year-old would only play when he was ready.\n\nAsked earlier this month if Hazard had recovered from the ankle injury that plagued him last season, Zidane said: \"I don't know, I can't tell you exactly.\n\n\"He is better and the most important thing is him, his feeling, that he is 100 per cent. We have time, we are starting the season.

He said the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) expects to lift its technical ban \"not long\" after the FAA, but national operational clearances needed for individual airlines to resume flying could take longer.\n\nSeparately, the US House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on Wednesday unanimously approved bipartisan legislation to reform the FAA's aircraft certification process in the wake of the 737 Max crashes.\n\nSee more on\n\nBoeing\n\nAir crashes\n\nAir safety", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/2020-09-30t172303z_872600199_rc259j9dx9vg_rtrmadp_3_boeing-737max.jpg?VersionId=NUOwyD40RYga579p_CMHHy2iRjRvtJ6U", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign - DBS Wellness space 1 (CREDIT DBS Bank)\n \nCredit: Photo of DBS Bank office"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ababd7adbab5ef95d4223806a015c648e9803c8d554289cc24869840a46a74ae", "alt_text": "Enforcement action by the Health Sciences Authority netted a suspect and various vapes on July 10."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7f73688fa163929df2c176d392b660d82a63b73e970c811e2339978d254a5fcd", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo, with retirees Chong Hock Loo, 75, and Shirley Tan, 68, during the PCF Family Day event on July 13."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0748316b0c8c0488543313beecbd97ee6f6260fce547cdce53f76f53d9d6a49f", "alt_text": "From left: Pathlight School students Marcus Goh, Nurdaanya Mohamed Hafiz and Brennan Tay with their respective artwork, part of a total of 30 artwork that are selected in the Wing Tai X Pathlight School art competition to be displayed on a construction hoarding along Kim Seng Linear Park, on July 11, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0f74970f823073d68c58dca22ef69d6312f85ec19cd11cccf600d0046eabbb32", "alt_text": "Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - July 13, 2025 Italy's Jannik Sinner celebrates with the trophy after winning the men's final against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz REUTERS/Andrew Couldridge"}]}

At one stage, she even served underarm.\n\nThe marathon tie featured 24 breaks of serve with 28-year-old Bertens firing 61 winners but committing 63 unforced errors.\n\nFor 2016 semi-finalist Bertens, who needed the wheelchair after cramping left her unable to move, it was a first win in six meetings with the Italian.\n\nErrani stormed off court, refusing to \"racquet tap\" with Bertens before screaming the obscenity in Italian as she stomped off Court 14 having also appeared to mock her opponent's injury.\n\n\"After one hour, she's injured but then she's running around like never before,\" said Errani who lost the 2012 final in Paris to Maria Sharapova.\n\n\"She leaves the court in a chair and now she's in the locker room and eating in the restaurant, perfect. She exaggerated.\n\n\"It made me very angry, so well done to her but she can win without doing that.\"\n\nBertens, however, insisted her injury was genuine and that she had cramped in \"my left leg, right foot and both hands\" during the match.\n\n\"At the end I had total body cramps,\" said Bertens who has a tour-leading 79 wins on clay in the last four years.\n\nShe hit back at Errani who she said had squandered a series of opportunities to wrap up the tie.\n\n\"She can say whatever she feels like and if I was (faking) then maybe I should take up acting classes - I am not sure what she was thinking.\n\n\"The cramps came and went in the match. I couldn't even fist pump because my fingers wouldn't move.\"\n\nBertens said she had spent 45 minutes in the physio room after the match and only stopped cramping after 30 minutes of treatment.\n\n\"She should have been in there. It's not nice to hear what she said, I don't want to take it personally, she was just frustrated with herself.\"\n\nThe Dutchwoman said she had never experienced being escorted off a court in a wheelchair until Wednesday although she did once try out the experience of playing in a wheelchair.\n\n\"I wanted to walk off the court today, but the physio said 'no, you have to sit down' so I didn't have a choice.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nFrench Open (Tennis)\n\nWomen's tennis", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/tennis-fra-open-women-131121.jpg?VersionId=2S7AC2t_KtrMGccDm1wS1RlMgwH6rbMm", "alt_text": null}]}

He proceeded to photograph it and left it to go on its way.\n\nThe recent rediscovery here has changed the snake's status in Singapore from \"indeterminate\" to \"extant\", now that its existence is definitively recorded. Before this sighting, it was not clear if it still existed here.\n\n\"Regionally, this species is also quite rare, with colour photographs having been published in a research paper only in 2018,\" said Mr Law Ing Sind, 24.\n\nThe co-founder of the Herpetological Society of Singapore, an enthusiast group for the study of reptiles and amphibians, noted that this record is scientifically significant, as it reaffirms the presence of this species in Singapore, and raises the possibility of it occurring in southern peninsular Malaysia.\n\nLittle is known about the behaviour and habitat of the snake.\n\nIt is assumed to be aquatic and can be found in small forest streams at night.\n\nThis snake is just one of many snakes to be discovered or rediscovered in Singapore, which highlights the vast biodiversity present here, said the society in a Facebook post.\n\n\"I personally think that Singaporeans should be elated that our small country still has a wealth of biodiversity still present, and that we continue to be better stewards of such treasures,\" added Mr Law.\n\nThe Selangor mud snake is the second snake to have been discovered or rediscovered in the last decade near Nee Soon swamp forest.\n\nHere are five other local snakes discovered or rediscovered in the last two decades, according to the Herpetological Society of Singapore.\n\n1. Lined blind snake\n\nA recent sighting of a lined blind snake, last seen in 1847, was a significant discovery, said reptile and amphibian enthusiasts in Singapore.\n\nThe reptile's body was\n\nfound along a bike trail at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve by Dr John van Wyhe,\n\na senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore, in September last year.\n\nAt 52cm, the snake, also known by its scientific name Ramphotyphlops lineatus, is believed to be the longest specimen of its kind.\n\n2. Black water mud snake\n\nA black snake with a brownish-yellow underbelly,\n\nthe 40cm-long reptile was discovered in September 2014\n\nby staff from the National Parks Board's National Biodiversity Centre in the Nee Soon swamp forest during a biodiversity study.\n\nNot much is known about the snake's population size.\n\nThe black water mud snake, also known as Phytolopsis punctata, is listed as a data-deficient species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, with limited information available on its population trend.\n\nThe elusive species, which lives in forests and wetlands, and is non-venomous, is native to Singapore, Indonesia and peninsular Malaysia.\n\n3. Smooth slug snake\n\nA carcass of the smooth slug snake was discovered in 2014 as roadkill\n\nat Old Upper Thomson Road by a member of the Nature Society (Singapore). It was previously last seen in 1978 near Mandai zoo.\n\nThe slug snake, scientific name Asthenodipsas laevis, is listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List, which means it is not under threat. The slug snake can be found in peat swamps and black water environments within South-east Asia.\n\nLike the black water mud snake, the slug snake is also a non-venomous species.\n\n4. White-spotted cat snake\n\nRediscovered in 2009, the white-spotted cat snake was recorded again in 2015 by reptile and amphibian enthusiasts.\n\nThese records occurred more than a century after the last sighting of this species in Singapore in 1896.\n\nThe highly arboreal snake, also known as Boiga drapiezii, lays its eggs inside termite nests.\n\n5. Gimlett's reed snake\n\nThe snake, also known as Calamaria gimletti, was rediscovered in 2017.\n\nPreviously, the specimen was collected from Pulau Pawai in 1933.\n\nHowever, this was correctly identified only 70 years later in 2004. Like all other reed snakes, the species likes forest leaf litter and likely preys on soil invertebrates.\n\nLISTEN TO GREEN PULSE PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nBiodiversity\n\nWildlife\n\nAnimals", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/tl-selangormudsnake-o-300920.jpg?VersionId=c6O62flv7StS2yr_O8TUqJb0n5FdCvlH", "alt_text": null}]}

As many as 682 customers may be owed sums ranging from $7 to as much as $84,088, according to a creditors' notice issued by provisional liquidators from audit firm Deloitte and Touche.\n\nIt was the only travel agent closure over a near-eight month period this year that impacted customers, STB said.\n\nMr Samson Tan, chief executive of GTMC Travel, said the\n\nextension of wage subsidies through March next year\n\nhas been a lifeline for many, while employees are also taking pay cuts, going on training courses and being redeployed during the lull.\n\nGTMC Travel has also moved into a smaller office which it shares with another travel agent to save on rent.\n\n\"I think after March if nothing happens and the Government doesn't extend (wage subsidies), a lot may call it a day. But most can hang on till then,\" Mr Tan said.\n\nChan Brothers Travel said it has received \"significant interest\" for its recently launched staycation packages, which include hotel stays paired with a guided tour of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.\n\nIt is also engaging customers through Facebook live sessions that offer travel tips for popular destinations like Japan and Taiwan when holidays to these places are possible.\n\nMs Alicia Seah, director of public relations and communications at Dynasty Travel, said the firm is\n\ngearing up for the resumption of corporate travel.\n\nAs safety considerations and country-specific requirements are now a major concern for travellers, \"the role of travel agents will become even more essential post-Covid\", she said.\n\nMr Steven Ler, president of the National Association of Travel Agents Singapore, said he sees light at the end of the tunnel, given the high demand for structured itineraries and end-to-end travel solutions as business and essential travel pickup.\n\nSingapore's allowance for\n\nbigger conferences of up to 250 people\n\nwill bring more visitors in the coming months, and the industry is working with ground operators to ensure a smooth process, Mr Ler said.\n\nThere is also strong pent-up demand for leisure travel, with wilderness, driving and sailing holidays garnering the most interest.\n\n\"Customers want to know what they need to be aware of, such as when they need to undergo the swab test, if they need to be quarantined and whether there is a list of approved places to stay. These are some of the pieces we are trying to pull together,\" he said.\n\nHe added that travel agents are also looking to bundle insurance offerings that will cover overseas travel.\n\n\"We can't sell any itineraries now, but at least we can get a sense of the potential areas of concern so we can guide customers when things restart,\" said Mr Ler.\n\nNgee Ann Polytechnic senior tourism lecturer Michael Chiam noted that more travel agents may be forced to fold, given the long recovery ahead for the tourism sector.\n\nBut there is likely to be a surge in demand for their services as travel restrictions relax.\n\n\"Travel preferences and habits may change due to the safety concerns of travellers, so it is important for travel agents to offer innovative (solutions) in order to take advantage of the upward trend,\" said Dr Chiam.\n\nSee more on\n\nTravel and leisure\n\nBusiness closures\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/yq-sgtourism-30092024.jpg?VersionId=9WQosTgvtI8qL3NEH01sB.52Lhutqrgt", "alt_text": null}]}

It did not specify when this would be.\n\nTo prepare for this, it is working with DNV GL to establish a cruise certification programme benchmarked against global health, safety and hygiene standards.\n\nA number of countries closed their ports to cruise vessels earlier this year after the rapid spread of the coronavirus\n\naboard the Diamond Princess,\n\nwhich was quarantined\n\noff the coast of Japan\n\nin February. At least 700 passengers and crew members were found to have been infected.\n\nDNV GL, which was chosen over three other bidders, will establish a set of health and safety protocols, conduct compliance audits and certify cruise ships that meet requirements. It will also develop a penalty framework for non-compliance to safety management measures.\n\nThe firm, which developed its own certification in infection prevention for the maritime industry in June, has already awarded it to Genting Cruise Lines' Explorer Dream vessel. The Explorer Dream has been\n\noperating island-hopping cruises\n\nin Taiwan since July.\n\nAll cruise lines must be audited and receive Singapore's certification to sail out of its ports, STB said in the tender documents. For the first three months, inspectors will also be required to conduct onboard checks for each sailing.\n\nMs Annie Chang, STB's cruise director, told ST on Wednesday (Sept 30) that the certification will serve as a quality mark to assure passengers that the cruise has met required safety and hygiene standards. More details will be announced later, she added.\n\nAsked whether the\n\n$100 SingapoRediscovers vouchers,\n\nto be issued to all Singaporeans in December, would be redeemable for cruise tickets, Ms Chang reiterated that they can be spent only on hotel stays, attraction tickets and approved tours.\n\nCRUISE INDUSTRY ON PAUSE WORLDWIDE\n\nChan Brothers Travel told ST that it will be partnering Dream Cruises to market and sell \"cruises to nowhere\" from Singapore, though sales have not yet been launched.\n\nGenting Cruise Lines, which operates the Star, Dream, and Crystal Cruises brands, will also be launching domestic cruise itineraries in the Chinese cruise hub of Hainan, in addition to its ongoing Taiwan sailings. It did not respond to queries.\n\nCruising remains on pause in much of the world as the industry\n\nseeks to develop a set of health and safety norms\n\nthat will prevent onboard outbreaks and convince port authorities to reopen cruise traffic.\n\nAn expert panel assembled by Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Group put up a list of 70 health and safety recommendations for the cruise industry last week. They include pre-boarding screening, plans to address cases of infection on board and strictly controlled shore excursions.\n\nThe two cruise giants pledged to develop new operating protocols based on the recommendations, which they said would be submitted to the authorities around the globe for review and approval.\n\nMs Angie Stephen, Royal Caribbean Group's Asia-Pacific managing director, said its ships will feature upgraded air filtration systems, changes to dining configurations and other health and safety measures when they return to service.\n\nAsked whether it will be seeking certification to sail out of Singapore, Ms Stephen said the cruise line will work closely with local authorities to implement necessary requirements.\n\n\"We will only resume cruising once we have the blessing of the local authorities in Singapore, and will announce our cruises when that happens,\" she said, adding that there are no current plans to resume international itineraries from Singapore, as ports in Asia remain closed.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line did not respond to queries on whether it plans to attain certification, or offer cruise to nowhere itineraries here.\n\nCelebrity Cruises also declined to comment, saying that its sailings remain suspended worldwide until Oct 31.\n\nA spokesman for Princess Cruises said its global operations will be paused until mid-December, adding that a return to service operations involving public health and safety protocols has yet to be formalised.\n\nMs Alicia Seah, director of public relations and communications at Dynasty Travel, said the travel agency is looking forward to collaborating with cruise lines that develop \"sail to nowhere\" offerings.\n\nAffordable ticket prices will be key to drawing locals, given the abundance of staycation packages on land, she noted.\n\n\"If they come in time for the year-end holidays I think the cruises will be quite attractive,\" said Ms Seah.\n\nSee more on\n\nCruises\n\nSingapore Tourism Board\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/dw-cruises2-covid-200930.jpg?VersionId=IbhYMJUuDB8SOJzptWnZIXN0IyWh5mXP", "alt_text": null}]}

Critics have argued that it will also make Facebook harder to break up should antitrust regulators try and force that.\n\nFacebook executives have warned that the project is a massive technical undertaking and will take years to complete, in part because the plan is to encrypt all messages between the three services so even Facebook can't read them.\n\nThe company is starting with Messenger and Instagram and has been testing the ability to send messages between the two since the summer. It will start rolling out the feature to all users over the coming weeks.\n\nBut this is just a first step, and doesn't yet include end-to-end encryption.\n\nMessenger offers a secure option, called \"secret chat\", but that level of encryption isn't available as part of the update with Instagram, Mr Chudnovsky said.\n\nWhatsApp messages are already encrypted, meaning Facebook will likely need to build that functionality into Messenger-Instagram conversations before it can enable communication between all three apps.\n\n\"The full timeline is quite a bit out - we are not at the half point yet,\" Mr Chudnovsky said in an interview. \"It'll take a while. It's not like a year from now we are sitting here and all of it is set and done.\"\n\nIf Facebook does decide in the future to build messaging back into the main app, he said, it would be limited to minimise its size and complexity.\n\n\"We are thinking about what lightweight messaging inside the blue app might look like,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTechnology sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/yq-socialmed-30092024.jpg?VersionId=K8Ldu0qAaV92zCsTMJ86By2aELd75TK5", "alt_text": null}]}

The first incident happened in 2018 and the other last year.\n\nTwo other similar charges were taken into consideration by District Judge Adam Nakhoda during sentencing.\n\nChen's victims cannot be named due to a gag order to protect their identities.\n\nCourt documents did not state the school Chen taught at, but The Straits Times understands that he was employed by an international school at the time of his offences.\n\nOn Jan 11, 2018, Chen targeted a 17-year-old while on the way to his girlfriend's home.\n\nHe was in the lift with the victim and her sister, both of whom were in school uniforms.\n\nChen pressed the button for the highest floor in the building, even though his girlfriend lived on the fourth storey.\n\nWhile standing behind the two girls, he placed the phone underneath his victim's skirt and recorded a video.\n\nHe withdrew his mobile phone after the victim's sister noticed his movement and turned to look at him.\n\nChen eventually exited the lift at the top floor and watched the video before proceeding to his girlfriend's flat.\n\nThe victim's sister later called the police and he was arrested eight days later.\n\nBut even with the case hanging over him, Chen struck again on Sept 25 last year. This time, he was accompanying his girlfriend to shop at a store.\n\nHe approached a 17-year-old staff member from behind and recorded a video underneath her dress.\n\nCourt documents state that Chen's actions were captured on closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras.\n\nThe staff member, who had noticed Chen standing close behind her, later made a police report. He was subsequently arrested five days later.\n\nChen's lawyers Ravinderpal Singh and James Ow Yong said in their mitigation plea that their client had resumed psychotherapy sessions for his behaviour and even applied a super-glue sticker to cover the camera of his mobile phone.\n\nIn sentencing Chen, District Judge Nakhoda noted several aggravating factors in his offences, including the use of a recording device which made it possible for the videos to be viewed repeatedly and disseminated.\n\nFor each offence of insulting a woman's modesty, Chen could have been jailed for up to a year and fined.\n\nSee more on\n\nOutrage of modesty/Insulting modesty\n\nSingapore crime\n\nVoyeurs", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/21/court.jpg?VersionId=dUjIiqtxi5JwSBPTL_3rI9Fj3X6H_OBR", "alt_text": null}]}

The roughly 320 buses in the Bulim package ferry commuters in Clementi, Jurong East and Bukit Batok along 29 routes, and operate out of the Bulim depot.\n\nIt is already operated by TTS.\n\nThe Sembawang-Yishun package consists of about 400 buses plying 27 routes, and is now operated by SMRT.\n\nThe change in operator means that SMRT employees involved in these routes will be offered a job by the incoming operator, TTS.\n\nGuidelines on good employment practices stipulate that TTS' employment terms cannot be worse-off than those set out in their current agreement with SMRT.\n\nThe tender,\n\ncalled in November last year,\n\nwas the first time the LTA had concurrently called for tenders for two packages, which it said could achieve \"economies of scale\".\n\nOperators had to bid for each package separately, but also had to submit an offer for a combined Bulim/Sembawang-Yishun package.\n\nUnder the bus contracting model, the Government owns all operating assets and collects fare revenue. Transport firms bid or negotiate to run route parcels for a fixed sum over a fixed period.\n\nSingapore University of Social Sciences transport economist Walter Theseira said the final bids bore this aim out.\n\n\"It looks from the bids that TTS was able to promise this to a greater extent than some of the competitors... But all parties did incorporate a discount for the joint bid compared to the single bids,\" he said.\n\nTTS bid about $482 million for the Bulim bus package and $582 million for the Sembawang-Yishun package, and $1.03 billion for the combined package.\n\nSMRT bid $540 million for the Bulim bus package, $700 million for the Sembawang-Yishun bus package, and $1.19 billion for the combined package.\n\nOn TTS' almost doubling of their bus routes, SUSS transport researcher Park Byung Joon said it would have been a very different story if SMRT and SBS Transit had won, suggesting that it \"would have been the end of bus tender in Singapore\" and the return to the era of having only two bus operators.\n\n\"TTS is not and will never be in the position to compete with the two local giants,\" he said, adding: \"TTS is going to be as big as what LTA is going to allow it to be.\"\n\nSMRT, in response to queries, said it was disappointed at not being awarded the package, but will work with relevant agencies for a smooth transition.\n\nThe LTA can extend the contract term by another two years at the end of the five-year contract.\n\nThis article was edited for clarity.\n\nSee more on\n\nLTA\n\nBuses", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/dw-towertransit-200930.jpg?VersionId=6JA2w0zsUQf5Bs0WVFExhjjyRKAxZnTl", "alt_text": null}]}

The earliest day they will be able to come into Singapore will be Oct 8.\n\nThe Air Travel Pass scheme allows for all forms of short-term travel, including leisure travel. This is in contrast to reciprocal green lane arrangements between countries, which are usually for essential business and official travel.\n\nVisitors will have to take a swab test upon arrival, and can go about their activities after they get a negative test result. They will\n\nhave to use the TraceTogether app\n\nfor the duration of their stay here, among other conditions.\n\nCAAS also said that Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning from Australia (excluding Victoria state) and Vietnam will be able take a Covid-19 test upon arrival.\n\nThis will replace the current requirement of a seven-day stay-home notice with a test before the end of the notice.\n\nCAAS added that it has updated Singapore's travel advisory to allow for travel to Australia (excluding Victoria) and Vietnam.\n\nIt advised travellers to check the entry requirements imposed by these countries and to take necessary precautions if travelling.\n\nAustralia currently bans all overseas travel, and those who want to do so have to apply for an exemption. In addition, foreigners are not allowed to enter the country at the moment.\n\nMeanwhile, Vietnam has temporarily suspended entry of all foreigners and overseas Vietnamese via commercial flights. It will only approve entry for some foreigners, such as those with diplomatic passports, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSince border restrictions to visitors from Brunei and New Zealand were lifted on Sept 8, CAAS has approved 331 applications from travellers from the two countries.\n\nAs of 5pm on Wednesday, 136 visitors have arrived so far. None of them tested positive for Covid-19 upon arrival.\n\nTransport Minister Ong Ye Kung said last month that the unilateral reopening of borders to Brunei and New Zealand was\n\na \"small, cautious\" step that can resuscitate Changi Airport.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mr Ong said he has spoken to Mr Michael McCormack, Australia's deputy prime minister and Mrs Tao Thi Than Huong, Vietnam's ambassador to Singapore, about the move.\n\n\"They were appreciative of Singapore's decision, and when conditions are right, I believe they will consider reciprocating the lifting of restrictions to travellers from Singapore,\" he said.\n\nThe minister added that Singapore's move to further open up was another step in resuscitating Changi Airport.\n\nThe Changi air hub is a crucial part of Singapore's economy, contributing more than 5 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product and employing 192,000 people before the pandemic.\n\nNow, it is among the worst-hit segments of the economy, with the transportation and storage sector shrinking at an annualised rate of 80 per cent in the second quarter of the year, compared with the previous quarter.\n\nSee more on\n\nCAAS/Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\n\nMinistry of Transport\n\nAviation/Aerospace sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/10/01/md-auz-0110.jpg?VersionId=WeQCMm_bzbDiUw8a3qqtdTmk8QUdmikO", "alt_text": null}]}

They are currently not required for the latter.\n\nAddressing the anti-competitive clause of the framework, Grab said the \"current inconsistency whereby taxi operators can restrict their drivers from taking fixed-fare jobs on other platforms\" should be addressed \"as soon as possible\".\n\nSingapore University of Social Sciences transport economist Walter Theseira said: \"The most important thing about the P2P framework is that in principle it gives LTA similar powers over both taxi operators and private-hire firms.\"\n\nBut Dr Theseira said the framework does not level the playing field completely.\n\n\"An area which remains an obvious problem is the difference in regulatory treatment of taxis and private-hire cars.\n\n\"Taxi operators continue to suffer from a lack of flexibility,\" he said. \"Taxis cannot be re-purposed readily.\n\n\"Private-hire cars have always had flexibility to be converted to being a normal passenger car.\"\n\nThis becomes a big sticking point \"when you have a big downturn like this\".\n\n\"For the same reason, when there is a sharp recovery, private-hire fleets can expand quickly, but taxis can't unless the regulatory framework becomes more flexible.\"\n\nMr Ang Hin Kee, adviser to the National Taxi Association and National Private Hire Vehicles Association, said companies should go beyond their business of matching drivers to passengers.\n\n\"Take up responsibility of helping drivers with their Medisave, and retirement and training needs,\" he suggested.\n\nHe said that while drivers are not employees, they are key to the success of these businesses.\n\n\"Platforms need to work with car rental companies to ensure that they cannot disassociate themselves from responsibilities to the drivers just because one leases the car and the other matches passengers,\" he added.\n\nMr Ang said said ride-hailing platforms should also \"level up\" their contribution to the financial aid given to drivers during this pandemic.\n\nFramework at a glance\n\n- Operators with 800 or more vehicles need to be licensed. Smaller operators are exempt but have to meet basic safety standards.\n\n- Operators providing both street-hailing and ride-hailing need to hold separate licences.\n\n- Carpooling platforms with 800 or more vehicles will also need to obtain a licence.\n\n- Operators can be sanctioned if their drivers are involved in too many accidents or commit too many offences.\n\n- All private-hire cars will need to go for annual vehicle inspection.\n\n- Exclusive arrangements preventing drivers from switching platforms will not be allowed.\n\n- Taxi availability standards, such as requiring taxi operators to maintain at least 80 per cent of their taxis on the road during peak hour, removed.\n\n- Licensed operators need to provide LTA with trip and driver-related data.\n\n- LTA can also issue codes of practice for licensees.\n\n- The Public Transport Council will have powers to ensure that fares are clear and communicated upfront.\n\n- Fare evasion and overcharging offences will be extended to private-hire car trips.\n\n- LTA can fix maximum or minimum number of authorised drivers that a licensed operator may have.\n\nSee more on\n\nTaxis\n\nGrab\n\nLTA", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/tl-transport-s-300920.jpg?VersionId=PcrVGzI6_XKObiZFm2CLulI9.majnVfY", "alt_text": null}]}

A total of 17 civilians have been reported dead.\n\nAzerbaijan's defence ministry said on Wednesday that \"intense fighting was continuing\", claiming that its forces have killed 2,300 Karabakh separatist troops since hostilities broke out.\n\nThe ministry said its troops had \"destroyed 130 tanks, 200 artillery units, 25 anti-aircraft units, five ammunition depots, 50 anti-tank units, 55 military vehicles\".\n\nIt said Karabakh's separatist forces had \"shelled the city of Terter, targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure\".\n\nKarabakh's defence ministry, for its part, said Azerbaijani forces \"continued artillery shelling\" of separatist positions along the front line on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe two sides have accused each other of targeting civilian areas, including in areas away from Karabakh.\n\nYerevan is claiming that Turkey, a longstanding ally of Azerbaijan, is providing direct military support, including mercenaries, for Baku.\n\nIt said on Tuesday that a Turkish F-16 flying in support of Baku's forces had downed an Armenian SU-25 warplane, but Ankara and Baku denied the claim.\n\n'CLOSE TO LARGE-SCALE WAR'\n\n\"We are definitely very close to seeing a large-scale war, possibly even on a regional scale,\" Ms Olesya Vartanyan of the International Crisis Group told AFP.\n\n\"If we see mass civilian casualties... that will be a very strong pretext for any regional power - no matter Russia or Turkey - to intervene,\" she said.\n\nKarabakh's declaration of independence from Azerbaijan sparked a war in the early 1990s that claimed 30,000 lives, but it is still not recognised as independent by any country, including Armenia.\n\nArmenia and Karabakh declared martial law and military mobilisation on Sunday, while Azerbaijan imposed military rule and a curfew in large cities.\n\nTalks to resolve the conflict have largely stalled since a 1994 ceasefire agreement.\n\nFrance, Russia and the United States have mediated peace efforts as the \"Minsk Group\", but the last big push for a peace deal collapsed in 2010.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday condemned what he called Turkey's \"reckless and dangerous\" statements backing Baku, saying they \"remove any inhibitions from Azerbaijan\".\n\nSee more on\n\nArmenia\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nWars and conflicts", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/tl-karabakh-e-300920.jpg?VersionId=sljMK9.wyMFq_DBn16nnTG6ygyPbB7qZ", "alt_text": null}]}

We are now seeing low community transmission, but we must remain vigilant.\n\n\"We are\n\nprogressively reopening our economy,\n\nin a safe manner. But there is much uncertainty ahead, and many people are understandably anxious about their jobs,\" he said, adding that the announcement of the additional measures had provided much needed certainty to businesses and workers.\n\nAmong the key measures announced were adjustments to\n\nthe Jobs Support Scheme,\n\nwhich helps employers fund up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee, for 10 months up to August 2020.\n\nThe measures extend wage support till March next year, tiered based on how quickly each sector is expected to recover.\n\nFirms in the hardest-hit aerospace, aviation and tourism sectors, which were getting 75 per cent wage support, get 50 per cent wage support for seven more months.\n\nThe built environment sector will get 50 per cent support for two more months, before it is lowered to 30 per cent of wages paid up to March next year, in line with the phased resumption of construction activities.\n\nMost other sectors will get 10 per cent support for seven more months.\n\nHowever, sectors that are doing well, such as biomedical sciences, financial services, and infocommunications and technology, will get this amount of support up to December.\n\nIn addition,\n\nthe Covid-19 Support Grant,\n\nintroduced in May to help Singaporeans who have been laid off or have suffered significant income loss, was extended to December. To qualify, unemployed applicants must demonstrate job search or training efforts.\n\nMr Heng said the measures would be funded by the reallocation of monies from other areas, such as development expenditures that were delayed due to Covid-19.\n\nLast month, he updated Parliament that he would table the third Supplementary Supply Bill to set out details of provisions to meet additional spending on these measures, which would then be debated by MPs.\n\nThis Bill will go through the usual parliamentary proceedings and has to be assented to by the President, he added.\n\nMr Heng will deliver his ministerial statement in Parliament at 1.30pm next Monday, the Ministry of Finance said.\n\nThe statement will be published on\n\nthe Singapore Budget website\n\nafter delivery.\n\nSee more on\n\nHeng Swee Keat\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/yq-hsk-30092024.jpg?VersionId=hNvKjiQGbEOFFBBn0pUX_RDIMSZRMIDI", "alt_text": null}]}

It tested two doses of Moderna's vaccine - 25 micrograms and 100 micrograms - in 40 adults aged 56 to 70 as well as 71 and older.\n\nOverall, the team found that in older adults who received two injections of the 100 microgram dose 28 days apart, the vaccine produced immune responses roughly in line with those seen in younger adults.\n\nModerna is already testing the higher dose in a large Phase III trial, the final stage before seeking emergency authorisation or approval.\n\nSide effects, which included headache, fatigue, body aches, chills and injection site pain, were deemed mainly mild to moderate.\n\nIn at least two cases, however, volunteers had severe reactions.\n\nOne developed a grade-three fever, which is classified as 39 deg C or above, after receiving the lower vaccine dose. Another developed fatigue so severe it temporarily prevented daily activities, Dr Anderson said.\n\nTypically, side effects occurred soon after receiving the vaccine and resolved quickly, he said.\n\n\"This is similar to what a lot of older adults are going to experience with the high dose influenza vaccine,\" Dr Anderson said. \"They might feel off or have a fever.\"\n\nMr Norman Hulme, a 65-year-old senior multimedia developer at Emory who took the lower dose of the vaccine, said he felt compelled to take part in the trial after watching first responders in New York and Washington state fight the virus.\n\n\"I really had no side effects at all,\" said Mr Hulme, who grew up in the New York area.\n\nHe said he was aware Moderna's vaccine employed a new technology, and that there might be a risk in taking it, but said, \"somebody had to do it\".\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nVaccines", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/eb_moderna_300920.jpg?VersionId=nDlDJtFBmo0Mq039dhkK3aZSv1394sRo", "alt_text": null}]}

He also enjoys a reputation for modesty and has largely maintained a low profile.\n\nMajor policy changes are not expected during his reign, even after the Gulf underwent a seismic shift with Kuwait's neighbours, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, opting to establish relations with Israel.\n\nNormalisation with the Jewish state is highly unpopular among the Kuwaiti public, which largely supports the Arab world's historic position of demanding a resolution of the Palestinian cause before giving diplomatic concessions to Israel.\n\nDespite expectations for a smooth succession, there could be more spirited debate over who the new crown prince should be.\n\nKuwait's constitution stipulates that the ruler should be a descendant of the nation's founder, Mubarak al-Sabah, but the throne has alternated between the descendants of his sons, Salem and Jaber, for four decades.\n\nContestants for the newly vacated role of crown prince include Sheikh Sabah's son and former deputy prime minister Nasser Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, a Kuwaiti political heavyweight.\n\n\"Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmed should be viewed more as a caretaker than as a watershed new leader,\" said Ms Cinzia Bianco, a research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\"Behind the scenes, however, younger princes would likely continue to compete to succeed him.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nKuwait\n\nRoyal families", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/eb_kuwait_300920.jpg?VersionId=WpLAf6JwJa8n_e_e5usYRLXnshekcj6g", "alt_text": null}]}

His doctors said the blood cancer had spread to his spine and brain, and he had recently been in hospice care in his home town of Palm Springs, California.\n\n\"I'm heartbroken that my hero is now gone. Tim was truly the sweetest person in the world,\" Mr Hoeffgen said in the Facebook post.\n\nHe said Mr Brown had made it his life's work to tell the story of his HIV cure and \"became an ambassador of hope\".\n\nFor Dr Huetter, the German doctor caring for him in 2007, Mr Brown's case was a shot in the dark.\n\nThe treatment involved the destruction of Mr Brown's immune system and the transplanting of stem cells with a gene mutation called CCR5 that resists HIV.\n\nOnly a tiny proportion of people - most of them of northern European descent - have the CCR5 mutation that makes them resistant to the Aids-causing virus.\n\nThis and other factors made the treatment Mr Brown had expensive, complex and highly risky. Most experts say it could never become a way to cure all HIV patients, since many of them would risk death from the procedure itself.\n\nMore than 37 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV, and the Aids pandemic has killed about 35 million people since it began in the 1980s.\n\nMedical advances over the past three decades have led to the development of drug combinations known as antiretroviral therapies that can keep the virus in check, allowing many HIV positive people to live with the virus for years.\n\nA second HIV patient, Mr Adam Castillejo, who was known as \"the London patient\" until he revealed his identity this year, is also thought to be in remission from HIV after having a transplant in 2016 similar to the one Mr Brown had.\n\n\"Although the cases of Timothy and Adam are not a viable large-scale strategy for a cure, they do represent a critical moment in the search for an HIV cure,\" said Prof Sharon Lewin, a HIV specialist at Australia's Doherty Institute.\n\nShe said Mr Brown was \"a champion and advocate for keeping an HIV cure on the political and scientific agenda\", and added: \"It is the hope of the scientific community that one day we can honour his legacy with a safe, cost-effective and widely accessible strategy to achieve HIV remission and cure.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nAids/HIV\n\nHealth and well-being", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/af_timothy-ray-brown_300920.jpg?VersionId=BnnD5tjY10vQgOgjlzDwDm2opyzovD2S", "alt_text": null}]}

Another scenario is where there is sub-division of property, which means there are multiple sub-tenants but not all of them may be eligible for waivers.\n\nRental relief assessors, however, will not review existing arrangements that have already been agreed upon by landlords and tenants regarding the implementation of rental waivers.\n\nThose who have disputes relating to the amount of rent waiver can submit applications for a rental relief assessor to review.\n\nThey have to submit the application by Oct 14, if they received notice of a cash grant by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) on or before Sept 30.\n\nThose who receive it after Sept 30 can submit applications within 10 working days of receiving the notice.\n\nBesides those with disputes, the new changes also provide a mechanism for those affected by construction-related delays to get help.\n\nThis mechanism aims to provide relief for those who rent goods used for construction work, who are now liable for additional expenses because of a delay or breach in a related contract.\n\nFor example, a contractor may have rented goods such as scaffolding material or hand drills from a supplier to perform works under a construction contract with a third party.\n\nBut the works may be delayed because of the pandemic, incurring additional rental expenses. The contractor can then apply for relief, said MinLaw.\n\nThe support also applies to tenants of non-residential properties who cannot carry out or finish renovation or fitting-out works during their rent-free period.\n\nTenants are typically granted a rent-free window to finish such works, but they might have lost out on this window if contractors could not complete renovation due to\n\nthe coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe tenant may apply for relief for the part of the rent-free period that was not used, MinLaw added.\n\nLastly, the new mechanism also applies to landlords of non-residential properties who are unable to deliver possession to the tenant by a stipulated date because of coronavirus-related delays in construction.\n\nTo be eligible for relief, applicants must also check that their affected contracts had been in force any time between Feb 1 this year and March 31, 2021.\n\nThe contract must also be entered into before March 25, and any delay or breach must have occurred between Feb 1 this year and March 31 next year.\n\nThey must submit applications for relief by May 31 next year.\n\nMinLaw added that an assessor appointed by the ministry may adjust the contractual terms to mitigate the impact of the delay in those specific circumstances.\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/yq-tpxchange-30092024.jpg?VersionId=zqsGNhU_sEQ1joCYaReTT53kZs_5ckeT", "alt_text": null}]}

They were awarded to six tenderers.\n\nEach site has a term of up to three years.\n\nThe highest tender of $90,000 for annual rent was awarded to IT Meng Landscape and Construction for a cluster site in Jurong West, with one site spanning a total area of 3,311 sq m - three-fifths of a football field - and the other at 2,974 sq m.\n\nOther carpark locations include Choa Chu Kang, Tampines, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh and Sembawang.\n\nSFA chief executive Lim Kok Thai said: \"The successful tenderers' proposals included hydroponic and vertical farming systems with a variety of innovative features such as IoT (Internet of Things), blockchain technology and automated climate control.\n\n\"With these farming systems, the sites have the potential to collectively produce around 1,600 tonnes of vegetables annually.\"\n\nHe added: \"We look forward to seeing these HDB multi-storey carpark rooftops transform into productive vegetable farms that will contribute to\n\nSingapore's '30 by 30' goal,\n\nand we will render assistance and guidance to farms where needed.\"\n\nThe 30 by 30 goal refers to Singapore's aim to produce 30 per cent of the country's nutritional needs locally by 2030.\n\nMs Phoebe Xie, 30, director and co-founder of local urban technology company AbyFarm, was one of the six who successfully tendered for the carpark rooftop spaces.\n\nWith the 3,171 sq m site at Ang Mo Kio, the company hopes to begin construction of the farm in the next few months, and to have its launch date within the first half of next year.\n\nUsing a combination of hydroponics and aeroponics vertical farming methods, the farming process is expected to use 90 per cent less water, and it is said to be 10 times more productive compared to traditional methods.\n\n\"The farm will be entirely automated, with real-time technology used to control the environment within the green house, and to consistently monitor the crops and early identify the possibility of bad crops, which will ensure the quality of our crops,\" she said.\n\nWith an expected yield of 200 tonnes of fruits and vegetables each year, the company is looking to harvest local favourites, such as kang kong and kailan as well as other types of produce such as mushrooms, figs and Japanese melon.\n\nCo-founder of SG Veg Farms Eyleen Goh, 46, who secured a cluster site at Sembawang, said the company is expecting around 80 to 100 tonnes of vegetables per site each year.\n\nThe company will be selling most of its produce to nearby supermarkets, though it hopes to host weekend markets for residents to buy its vegetables.\n\nMinister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that \"the challenges of Covid-19 and climate change, together with other trade and environmental pressures, pose a threat to Singapore's supply of critical resources such as food\".\n\nAs land is scarce in Singapore, the SFA has been \"unlocking alternative spaces to grow food, such as vacant buildings, like the former Henderson Secondary School and carpark rooftops\".\n\n\"Over the next few years, we will be master-planning the larger Lim Chu Kang area and will be engaging the stakeholders and the public in the process,\" she said, adding that there are longer term plans in place to \"expand agriculture in the Lim Chu Kang area and aquaculture off (Singapore's) southern coast\".\n\nMr Melvin Chow, senior director of SFA's food supply resilience division, said in May that the launch of the tender for the nine sites came as a result of growing interest from both the industry and the public towards urban farming in community spaces.\n\nLast year,\n\na pilot urban farm\n\n- spanning 1,900 sq m - was launched at a multi-storey HDB carpark in Ang Mo Kio. Known as the Citiponics Farm, it aims to grow up to four tonnes of vegetables a month.\n\nThe tender for the nine sites, which was launched on May 12, had closed on June 16, and the sites were awarded using the price-quality tender method, where both the bid price and the quality attributes, such as production output, design and site layout, as well as business and marketing plans, were factored into the tender evaluation.\n\nThe SFA said it will be working with HDB to tender out more multi-storey carpark rooftop sites for urban farming in the fourth quarter of the year, as the move is also in line with HDB's Green Towns Programme to cool HDB towns through the use of greenery, such as on carpark rooftops.\n\nMore details of these plans for tender will be released at a later date.\n\nSee more on\n\nSFA/Singapore Food Agency\n\nFood security", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/yq-citiponics-12052021.jpg?VersionId=_c7cFTAuZRX8Vo32ijGGSJzG1581u3yZ", "alt_text": null}]}

The 17-year-old boy received a similar instruction from another gang member that day.\n\nThe pair met the other gang members at the service at a pavilion near Block 37 Circuit Road on April 5. The \"secret society ritual\" started at around 1pm that day.\n\nThe dead man's son knelt beside the altar while another gang member prepared two burning joss sticks.\n\nAfter that, Lee, the teenager and the other members were told to gather in front of the altar.

The company sees sustainable annual cost savings of US$2 billion (S$2.74 billion) to US$2.5 billion by that time.\n\n\"We have to be a simpler, more streamlined, more competitive organisation,\" chief executive officer Ben van Beurden said. \"We feel that, in many places, we have too many layers in the company: too many levels between me, as the CEO, and the operators and technicians at our locations.\"\n\nThe move adds to the growing list of major announcements this year which has seen Big Oil slash dividends, take multi-billion-dollar writedowns and axe jobs following\n\noil's coronavirus-induced plunge.\n\nBP said in June it planned to cut 10,000 jobs as it moved into cleaner energy,\n\nChevron intends to trim\n\n10 per cent to 15 per cent of its global workforce, while Exxon Mobil is\n\nreviewing staffing country by country.\n\nShell began the process in May, when Mr van Beurden told staff in a memo that it was reshaping the company to make it leaner and more resilient and that there could be redundancies in the second half of the year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The Anglo-Dutch major offered voluntary severance, scaled back recruitment and reviewed expatriate staff contracts.\n\nThe reorganisation is also designed to further Shell's expanded green ambitions. The company said in April that it\n\nplanned to eliminate all net emissions\n\nfrom its own operations and the bulk of greenhouse gases from fuel it sells to its customers by 2050. Shell also said that ultimately, it would do business with emission-free companies only.\n\nThe company also flagged on Wednesday that it expects oil-product sales volumes in the third quarter to be four million to five million barrels a day. Refining margins will be \"significantly\" lower than in the second quarter. It also sees post-tax impairment charges of US$1 billion to US$1.5 billion.\n\nWhen contacted by The Straits Times, a Shell spokesman said: \"Through reshaping Shell, we aim to enable our strategy, streamline our organisation and take out costs. As a result, we will be a simpler, more streamlined, more competitive organisation that is more nimble and able to respond to customers.\n\n\"However, no detailed guidance or final figures on where the impacts will be as this is still being worked through.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nOil and gas sector\n\nJob cuts\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/tl-shell-r-300920.jpg?VersionId=cVEoAIGDy4t.9cn48YIu5RRc.bI95NKI", "alt_text": null}]}

This, and two other cherished beliefs, were labelled myths that Economic Development Board managing director Chng Kai Fong sought to debunk when addressing educators on Wednesday (Sept 30).\n\nThe first myth is that digital and technical skills will be enough. The second is that Singaporeans need only focus on opportunities within the country, and the third is that people need to prioritise long-term career plans, he said in his keynote address at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Teachers' Conference.\n\nElaborating, Mr Chng said that most people think that learning to use data and to code will be sufficient.\n\n\"I'm not saying that that's not important, but I'm saying that's not enough... because many of (these processes) will eventually be automated if they can be.\"\n\nHe said that soft skills - the ability to tell a story, to have empathy, and create connections with others - will help people to stand out and differentiate themselves.\n\nMr Chng also said that it will be important to disabuse people, including the future generation, of the notion that \"Singapore is enough\".\n\n\"What worries me is that we are so focused on what's happening here... 'I just want to get a simple job', 'I want to just create stuff for Singapore'. Increasingly, if you think that way, you'll start getting pressures from elsewhere because there's global competition. There's competition with robots and technology.\"\n\nThere are opportunities around the world and in Asia, which is growing, he noted, and Singaporeans will have to make sure they stay relevant.\n\nTouching on the final myth, Mr Chng said that many people here pride themselves on long-term planning.\n\n\"Growing up as a Singaporean, we all think there's a divine plan for us and our children... You clear secondary school, go on, get a job, and that's your plan for life,\" he said.\n\nBut life is not as straightforward as this. The ability to react and plan in the short term will be very important, he stressed.\n\nHe encouraged students to pursue their \"obsessions and side hustles\", which will help them to build confidence and find meaning.\n\nITE chief executive Low Khah Gek also spoke at the conference on Wednesday, where she touched on disruptions in the economy due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"We need to understand the new reality of where our Singapore economy is heading, further shifts in industries and businesses and, more importantly, the changes to jobs and workplace skills,\" she said.\n\nDr Gog Soon Joo, chief skills and research officer as well as chief futurist at SkillsFuture Singapore, also spoke on issues such as future jobs and skills that will be in demand.\n\nThere will be fewer jobs that require a single skill, she said, giving the example of a data scientist, who will be expected to be able to do storytelling and conveying a message with analysis.\n\n\"We expect more and more job content to change.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nITE\n\nSkills training\n\nStudents\n\nEducation and schools", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/eb_digital_300920.jpg?VersionId=.fbpj9F3YFEq0j_Nv8baQX8Dvwo8aQ7Q", "alt_text": null}]}

She was 78.\n\nThe death was confirmed by her children in a message posted on her official fan page on Facebook. She suffered for decades from Addison's disease (she had a kidney removed when she was 17) and since at least 2015, from dementia.\n\nI Am Woman reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts at the end of 1972 - a good six months after it was released. Individual call-in requests helped build radio play and the song earned her a Grammy Award for best female pop vocal performance.\n\nShe was the first Australian-born artist to win a Grammy and make the Billboard 100 record charts. Some male observers called the song - beginning with the words \"I am woman/ Hear me roar/ In numbers/ Too big to ignore,\" sung by a 5-foot-3 soprano - angry, man-hating, dangerous or all three.\n\n\"That simply underlined the many things women needed liberating from,\" a writer for Variety reflected in 2019. \"Nobody called Sinatra a menace when he sang My Way, a no less straightforward hymn to self-determination.\"\n\nDuring the 1970s, three of Reddy's songs - including Delta Dawn and Angie Baby - went to No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Three others - Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady, You and Me Against the World and Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress) - made the Top 10.\n\nMore than three decades later, The Chicago Tribune declared her the \"queen of '70s pop.\"\n\nHelen Maxine Lamond Reddy was born on Oct 25, 1941, in Melbourne, the only child of Max Reddy, a writer, producer and actor; and Stella (Lamond) Reddy, an actress whose stage name was Stella Campbell. Her father was in New Guinea, serving in the Australian army, when she was born.\n\nThe Reddys performed on the Australian vaudeville circuit, and Helen began joining them onstage when she was four. At 12, she rebelled by quitting show business and going to live with an aunt while her parents toured.\n\nBut her financial situation - after an early marriage, parenthood and divorce - persuaded her to return. She had a solid reputation in Australian television and radio when she won a 1966 talent contest sponsored by Bandstand, a Sydney pop-music television show. The prize was a trip to New York City and a record-company audition there.\n\nThe audition did not pan out and her career got off to a slow, discouraging start. Before Capitol Records signed her in 1970, at least 27 record labels rejected her, and she and her new husband, Jeff Wald, who was now her manager, moved - first to Chicago, then to Los Angeles.\n\nTimes were hard, especially when the couple lived in New York. In The Woman I Am: A Memoir (2006), she wrote: \"When we did eat, it was spaghetti, and we spent what little money we had on cockroach spray.\"\n\nHer first hit was a 1971 cover of I Don't Know How to Love Him, a hit from the award-winning stage show Jesus Christ Superstar. The success of I Am Woman, with Reddy's lyrics and Ray Burton's music, came a year later.\n\nShe was a frequent guest in the early 1970s on variety, music and talk shows like The Mike Douglas Show, The Carol Burnett Show, The David Frost Show, The Merv Griffin Show and The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour. The Helen Reddy Show (1973) was an eight-episode summer replacement series on NBC.\n\nShe made her big-screen debut in the disaster movie Airport 1975 (1974) as a guitar-playing nun who comforts a sick little girl (Linda Blair) on an almost certainly doomed 747. She always liked to point out that Gloria Swanson and Myrna Loy were also in the cast.\n\nThat was followed by a starring role in the Disney movie Pete's Dragon (1977), as a skeptical New England lighthouse keeper who doubts an orphaned boy's stories about his animated fire-breathing pet.\n\nReddy's Broadway career consisted of replacing the lead in Blood Brothers, a musical set in Liverpool, for a few months in 1995. But she had a busy stage career elsewhere, starring in productions of Anything Goes, Call Me Madam and Shirley Valentine in England and in the United States, from Provincetown to Sacramento.\n\nHer last song to make the American charts was I Can't Say Goodbye to You (1981), and Imagination (1983) was her last album. Her final screen appearance was in The Perfect Host (2010), a crime comedy with David Hyde Pierce.\n\nReddy married and divorced three times. In 1961, she married Kenneth Claude Weate, an older musician who was a family friend. They had a daughter and divorced in 1966.\n\nIn 1968, she married Wald, and they had a son. They separated in 1981, when he checked into a treatment facility for cocaine addiction, and divorced two years later. That same year, she married Milton Ruth, a drummer in her band. They divorced in 1995.\n\nSurvivors include her two children, Traci Wald Donat, a daughter from her first marriage, and Jordan Sommers, a son from her second; her half sister, Toni Lamond, an Australian singer-actress; and a grandchild.\n\nSee more on\n\nObituary\n\nMusicians\n\nAustralia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/af_helen-reddy_300920.jpg?VersionId=5Y5ej5zNDPzBQhLN4H0UoYRnu9v69pl2", "alt_text": null}]}

Five years after \"dieselgate\" emissions cheating revelations rocked the car industry, ex-Audi CEO Rupert Stadler on Wednesday (Sept 30) becomes the first top executive to stand trial in Germany.\n\nStadler, 57, faces charges of \"fraud, falsifying certifications and false advertising\", according to the indictment that will be read out before the Munich district court.\n\nHe will be in the dock alongside former Audi and Porsche manager Wolfgang Hatz and two Audi engineers, all facing the same charges.\n\nGerman car giant Volkswagen - whose subsidiaries include Porsche, Audi, Skoda and Seat - admitted in September 2015 that it had installed manipulating software in 11 million diesels worldwide.\n\nThe so-called defeat devices made the vehicles appear less polluting in lab tests than they were in real driving conditions, allowing the vehicles to emit toxic gases far beyond the legal limit.\n\nNot a single senior executive has been convicted over the scam in Germany, although two VW employees have received jail terms in the United States.\n\nIntense media interest in the Stadler case coupled with coronavirus precautions have led court officials to move proceedings to a larger room in a justice building outside the city centre.\n\nThe complex trial is expected to last until December 2022.\n\nIf found guilty, the accused face up to 10 years in jail.\n\n'NO KNOWLEDGE'\n\nVolkswagen has always insisted that the diesel trickery was the work of a handful of lower-level employees acting without the knowledge of superiors, although prosecutors dispute this.\n\nStadler had been Audi's chief executive for 11 years when\n\nhe was arrested in June 2018.\n\nHe spent four months in pretrial detention owing to concerns he could try to influence witnesses.\n\nA career Audi man, he joined the luxury car maker in 1990 and was named CEO in 2007.\n\nProsecutors say Stadler knew about the scam by the end of September 2015 \"at the latest\" but nevertheless allowed thousands more vehicles fitted with illegal defeat devices to be sold.\n\nHis three fellow defendants are accused of having developed diesel engines equipped with the manipulating software, and allegedly installed in cars sold by the VW group as far back as 2009.\n\nThe charges cover a total of 434,420 Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche vehicles sold in Europe and the United States.\n\nStadler has consistently denied the accusations.\n\nCo-accused Hatz, whose past roles at the VW group include research and development chief at its Porsche unit, also rejects any wrongdoing.\n\nHis lawyer said Hatz would respond to the charges \"in detail\".\n\nELECTRIC PIVOT\n\nStadler is not the only high-profile executive bracing for his day in court.\n\nA regional tribunal in Brunswick, near VW's Wolfsburg headquarters, ruled earlier this month that Martin Winterkorn, former CEO of the VW group, must stand trial on charges of fraud and stock market manipulation.\n\nThe group's current CEO Herbert Diess and supervisory board chair Hans Dieter Poetsch faced similar accusations of failing to inform shareholders in a timely manner of the pollution scam.\n\nBut those proceedings were dropped after VW agreed to a settlement that cost it \u20ac9 million (S$14.5 million).\n\nThe \"dieselgate\" saga has already cost VW more than \u20ac30 billion in fines, legal costs and compensation to car owners - mainly in the United States.\n\nClaims of emissions rigging have also ensnared rival carmakers such as Daimler and Fiat Chrysler.\n\nThe fallout has prompted the industry to accelerate a shift towards environmentally-friendly electric vehicles, requiring huge investments at a time when carmakers are already confronting a tough economic climate.\n\nAnd Volkswagen's \"dieselgate\" bill is not quite settled yet.\n\nIn April, VW settled Germany's biggest lawsuit in an out-of-court settlement in which it agreed to pay around \u20ac750 million to 235,000 customers, or between 1,350 and 6,250 euros per car.\n\nIt is now trying to reach settlements with up to 60,000 individual claimants after a German court issued a landmark ruling in May ordering VW to buy back a manipulated diesel from its owner.\n\nSee more on\n\nGermany\n\nDiesel/Petrol\n\nAutomobile sector\n\nCourt trials", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/eb_germany_300920.jpg?VersionId=zlvZRuJSqwQuqVcBfW0SH52zfzdC8n3j", "alt_text": null}]}

Japan's Nikkei slid 1.5 per cent and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.8 per cent.\n\nSingapore's Straits Times Index was down 0.1 per cent at 2:04pm local time.\n\nChinese property developers gained, led by a 15 per cent jump in Evergrande shares after the heavily-indebted giant reached a deal to ease cash crunch concerns.\n\nChina's\n\nfactory activity expanded at a faster pace\n\nin September, helped by rising export orders. The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 in September from 51.0 in August. Analysts had expected it to pick up slightly to 51.2.\n\nUS stock futures ground higher in Asian time during the debate but then retreated after Trump cast doubt on whether he would accept the election's outcome.\n\nS&P 500 futures were last 0.6 per cent lower, with Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 futures down by as much as 1 per cent.\n\nEuropean markets looked set to follow, with FTSE futures falling 0.4 per cent and Euro STOXX 50 futures down 0.6 per cent.\n\nThe US dollar crept higher and is set for its best monthly gain since July 2019, while the yen rose 0.2 per cent to 105.50 per dollar, its strongest daily rise in nearly two weeks.\n\n\"The share market normally prefers the incumbent (president) to win,\" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney. \"US futures initially rose, as perhaps Trump delivered some punches, but it wasn't enough,\" he said.\n\n\"Investors have gone back to worrying about a contested election, a delay in the outcome and whether Trump will go peacefully if he loses.\"\n\nCONTESTED RESULT\n\nThe presidential debate yielded no clear winner and barely moved the needle in betting markets, which project a narrow Biden victory.\n\nOdds maker Smarkets slightly lowered Trump's chance of re-election to 40 per cent after the debate, compared with 42 per cent beforehand.\n\nBut as the election draws closer, investors are increasingly expecting a bumpy final lap and are bracing for the possibility that the result is unclear on polling day.\n\nOptions trade points to a volatile November. Two-month dollar/yen volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the yen, is elevated, and its premium over one-month volatility is near record levels.\n\nOn Wednesday major currencies slipped a tad on the dollar after the debate, knocking the euro from a one-week high to US$1.1736.

A second phase of the ban aimed at stopping TikTok operations in the US is set to take effect on Nov 12.\n\nGovernment lawyers have argued that the president has a right to take national security actions, and said the ban was needed because of TikTok's links to the Chinese government through its parent firm ByteDance.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nTikTok\n\nUS presidential election 2020", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/af_tikotk-us_300920.jpg?VersionId=wEDRg53bozMWcF_6rSaR3ip6knxiMXDs", "alt_text": null}]}

EXTREME MESSINESS OF THE DEBATE\n\nTuesday night was less a debate and more a spectacle. Mr Trump, 74, did the lion's share of interruptions, frequently talking over Mr Biden, 77, and heckling him with short, sharp comments and questions.\n\nMr Biden, who often could barely get a word in, was occasionally thrown off balance. \"Will you shut up, man?\" he said at one point, adding: \"This is so unpresidential...keep yapping, man.\"\n\nThis would have played differently to different audiences. Mr Trump's supporters are likely to see him as strong and Mr Biden as a weak opponent who needed the moderator to stand up for him, while the President's detractors will call him a bully.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Mr Trump's combative approach will endear him to undecided voters and white suburban women, whom he needs to win over to close in on Mr Biden's lead.\n\nMr Biden's strategy of addressing the camera at times, directly asking the audience whether their life experience contradicted the miraculous pandemic recovery extolled by Mr Trump, was very much in line with his brand of campaigning and folksy charm.\n\nMr Biden also came under attack in the Democratic primaries but bounced back, suggesting that personal attacks do not work as well against him.\n\nAll in all, the barrage of interruptions meant that the two men could hardly engage with each other on substantive points, nor delve deep into policy discussions.\n\nThis meant that Mr Trump could skip quickly past uncomfortable moments and potential pitfalls. The debate breezed past his administration's handling of the pandemic, an area he has consistently received low scores in national polls for, and a bombshell New York Times report on his tax returns.\n\nMr Biden also could not effectively rebut Mr Trump when he made exaggerated claims, nor hold his feet to the fire for failing to condemn white supremacists or his lack of a comprehensive healthcare plan.\n\n2. THE SPECTRE OF SOCIALISM\n\nMr Trump simultaneously tried to paint Mr Biden as a socialist, while trying to pit the left wing of the Democratic Party against Mr Biden for not being leftist enough for them.\n\n\"They're going to dominate you, Joe, you know that,\" said Mr Trump near the start of the debate, adding: \"Your party wants to go socialist.\"\n\n\"I'm the Democratic Party right now,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nThe former vice-president responded in a consistently moderate manner, rendering Mr Trump's socialism line of attack less effective.\n\nOver the course of the debate, Mr Biden explicitly said he was against defunding police forces and did not support the Green New Deal.\n\nWhile neither are positions that will endear him to the left wing of the party, they will likely reassure skittish swing voters. They are also unlikely to irrevocably alienate left-wing Democrats, who are strongly opposed to Mr Trump and have been campaigning for Mr Biden.\n\n3. PERSONAL INSULTS SIGNAL MORE UGLINESS AHEAD\n\nThe debate at times descended into name-calling and insult-hurling.\n\nMr Biden called Mr Trump a clown, a fool and a liar, told him to shut up, and called him the worst President the United States has ever had.\n\nMr Trump mocked Mr Biden's intellect, saying that he graduated the lowest in his class. \"Don't ever use the word smart with me,\" said Mr Trump. \"There's nothing smart about you, Joe.\"\n\nThe debate got especially heated when Mr Trump went after Mr Biden's son Hunter, whom he accused without proof of corrupt business dealings. He also referenced the younger Mr Biden's drug abuse and said he was \"dishonourably discharged\" from the military.\n\nMr Biden, who had been in the middle of praising his late son Beau's military service in Iraq, said: \"That is simply not true.\"\n\n\"He's fixed it, he's worked on it,\" Mr Biden said of Hunter's drug problem. \"I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.\"\n\n4. TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS OF ELECTORAL FRAUD\n\nAsked about the integrity of the election, Mr Trump doubled down on his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, calling the election rigged and saying: \"This is not going to end well.\"\n\nHe said that he was urging his supporters to \"go into the polls and watch very carefully\", in contrast to Mr Biden's pledge to call on his supporters to remain calm on election night. Mr Biden also promised not to call victory until the results had been independently certified.\n\nMr Trump's comments raise the chance of unrest should he lose, with his supporters potentially unwilling to accept the election and its outcome as legitimate.\n\n5. MOST PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MINDS\n\nThe debate was also unlikely to close the gap between Mr Trump and Mr Biden. Voting is already underway in many states, and most people say that their minds are made up.\n\nHistorically, polls also do not shift that much at this stage. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of polls from 1976 to 2012, the difference between polling leads just after the first debate and at the end of the campaign was an average of 2.2 per cent.\n\nA Morning Consult poll released on Tuesday morning found that 86 per cent of all voters say their position on the 2020 race was immobile, with only 14 per cent saying they might change their mind.\n\nParty voters were similarly set in their ways, with 9 per cent of Democrats and 11 per cent of Republicans saying they were open to change. Just over a quarter of independents say they might change their mind.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/af_us-debates_300920.jpg?VersionId=6gpqnbsHnLD2KKngqQX14LsjAyqkUhD5", "alt_text": null}]}

It's one of the rules of diplomacy.\"\n\nMr Pompeo will meet the Vatican's Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin on Thursday.\n\nPowerful cardinal Oscar Maradiaga said the US intervention was unwelcome, and clearly linked to the US election campaign.\n\n\"They're looking for Donald Trump to get elected, and everything is based on that logic. In this sense, I don't think they're acting in the interests of Americans,\" he said in an interview with the Repubblica daily on the eve of Mr Pompeo's visit.\n\nPope Francis' opening towards China had particularly angered the \"anti-Francis\" network close to the US president, he said, led by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the Vatican's former envoy to the US, and Mr Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former adviser.\n\nProfessor Massimo Faggioli, a theologian at the Villanova Catholic University in the US, said there was a concerted effort under way to \"turn a certain anti-Francis and anti-Vatican sentiment, which has become more visible in recent years, into votes for Trump\".\n\n\"Vatican diplomacy is being used for propaganda,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Centre, around half of Catholic registered voters describe themselves as Republicans or lean towards the Republican Party, while roughly the same identify with or lean towards the Democratic Party.\n\nA \"notable majority of white Catholics\" voted for Mr Trump last time, Prof Faggioli said, and \"the plan is to keep this bloc of white Catholic voters in some states where it is especially needed\".\n\nMr Pompeo is also set to meet Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio on Wednesday to discuss US efforts to deter European allies from using equipment by Chinese manufacturer Huawei in developing their 5G networks.\n\nThe US accuses Huawei of being a tool for Chinese espionage.\n\nItaly insists that its Golden Power law - which allows the government to impose conditions, restrictions or a ban on foreign investment in strategic industries - protects it from risk.\n\nNonetheless, Mr Conte promised last week to take stronger measures to\n\nensure national security in the country's 5G networks.\n\nTalks will likely also touch on Italy's involvement in China's ambitious Belt and Road trade and infrastructure investment plan.\n\nRome became the first G7 country to sign up to the plan last year, a move sharply criticised by those who fear the investment scheme will allow key trade secrets and technologies to slip into Beijing's hands.\n\nSee more on\n\nMike Pompeo\n\nVatican\n\nUS presidential election 2020", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/rk_mp-pf-collage_300920.jpg?VersionId=aIf3z0QWbytl8RKpN4iS2OU9O7A3KS87", "alt_text": null}]}

Staff will move into the new offices early next year, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the plans are not public.\n\nCitigroup, currently the building's largest tenant with nine floors, is trimming its office space to better use its real estate as its 10-year lease is due to expire soon, the people said.\n\nEconomic Development Board executive vice-president Kiren Kumar told The Straits Times that companies worldwide and from various industries continue to grow here to serve Asian and global markets.\n\nIn particular, tech sector companies are building capabilities in software engineering, product development, e-commerce and cloud services, he said. \"This will allow us to meet the growing demand for enterprise and consumer digital services in Singapore and Asia, and create meaningful jobs for Singaporeans in both tech and non-tech roles within the technology sector.\"\n\nAmazon's plans in Singapore come as some of China's biggest technology corporations such as Tencent, Alibaba Group and ByteDance make the island-state their beachhead for the rest of Asia. Singapore is becoming a regional base for both Western and Chinese companies because of its developed financial and legal systems. It is becoming more attractive to some as Beijing tightens its grip on Hong Kong.\n\n\"Amazon is always in a state of innovation and disruption,\" said Justin Tang, the head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. \"Asia is a source of growth for them and they need to be near where their rivals are.\"\n\nJOB OPENINGS\n\nAmazon currently has about 200 job openings in Singapore for roles covering data analytics, sales and advertising, business development, and marketing and public relations, according to its career site.\n\nThe company launched its Singapore website, which was also its first in South-east Asia, last year.\n\nA representative for Amazon declined to comment. A spokesman for Citigroup confirmed that the bank is giving up the space, but declined to say which tenant is taking over. Some consumer banking staff, and employees in other functions, will relocate to Changi Business Park where the bank has bigger premises and a long-term lease, he said.\n\nAmazon, which has been rapidly expanding in Singapore over recent years, has existing offices in Capital Square and One George Street. A lease for the space being taken in Asia Square Tower 1 would typically be for more than five years.\n\nCUTTING COSTS\n\nCitigroup is among financial firms around the world that are grappling with what post-pandemic working life will look like, with some companies such as Nomura and Fifth Third Bancorp seeing opportunities to cut costly real estate by keeping a portion of staff at home.\n\nAlthough the Singapore Government has eased some restrictions around the virus, such as allowing more workers to return to the office, remote work is still the default option.\n\nCitigroup is reviewing its workspaces because of the virus and looking at other ways of working to allow flexible arrangements, the spokesman said.\n\nThe bank on Tuesday (Sept 29) said it will open its biggest wealth management hub globally in Singapore in December as it aims for double-digit growth in the nation. The facility, called Citi Wealth Hub at 268 Orchard, will open with space for more than 300 relationship managers and product specialists.\n\nAdditional reporting by Prisca Ang\n\nSee more on\n\nAmazon\n\nCommercial buildings\n\nCitigroup", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_ast1_300955.jpg?VersionId=A2QCJZM18dW_p6Y7XGrlIDX99Xh7Ht04", "alt_text": null}]}

In turn, this also means better jobs in HR,\" he said, noting that there are some 47,000 HR professionals in Singapore, of whom 90 per cent are local.\n\nMr Zaqy highlighted that median wages for HR professionals have grown by about 10 per cent from 2015, and HRTAP aims to support these workers to take on roles with higher added value and wages through HR transformation.\n\nThe panel has also recommended both targeted and broad-based initiatives to help companies build HR capabilities.\n\nAs part of its targeted support, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and IHRP are working with agencies to develop sector-specific HR playbooks, with curated tools and solutions.\n\nThe Government will also integrate HR capability-building components into its enterprise support schemes, such as the Scale-Up SG programme that helps high-growth companies, said Mr Zaqy, who was speaking on the second day of the HR Tech Festival Asia, which ends on Thursday.\n\nBroader measures implemented include providing businesses with greater access to more affordable HR technology solutions.\n\nThe MOM will also introduce an employer data portal to allow companies to access company-specific workforce insights in the fourth quarter of this year, which will help employers in manpower planning and assess how they could improve their hiring and employment practices.\n\n\"Companies become better places to work in and achieve stronger business outcomes when HR capabilities improve,\" Mr Zaqy said.\n\nHe highlighted that the national Human Capital Diagnostic Tool (HCDT), which identified strengths and gaps in human capital processes as well as appropriate solutions, is a useful resource that businesses can tap.\n\nMore than 1,000 firms have used the HCDT to date, said Mr Zaqy, citing local furniture Scanteak, which implemented a new HR system and an e-learning platform for its sales staff after using the tool. The new systems have helped enhance its workers' digital competencies since, he added.\n\nThe HRTAP aims to have 5,000 HCDT assessments by 2025, and 80 per cent of companies to have improved diagnostic scores by the same year, he noted.\n\nIn a virtual panel discussion, several members of the HRTAP spoke on how HR will support business transformation, and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the role of HR professionals and the industry.\n\nHRTAP co-chairman Poon Hong Yuen, who is deputy secretary for workforce at MOM, said: \"Covid-19 has not slowed down what we need to do. In fact, it has accelerated what we need to do, which is having to take a leadership role in terms of business and sector transformation.\"\n\nThis includes areas such as job redesign, digitalisation and the building of new skill capabilities, he said.\n\nIHRP chief executive Mayank Parekh emphasised the need for HR professionals to develop digital acumen and utilise analytics to improve performance and employee experiences.\n\n\"It is critical now that HR leaders progress from just anecdotal approaches to convince business leaders to more evidence-based thinking (and) providing more data and decision science behind the recommendations that they are making,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSkills training\n\nHuman resources\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nZaqy Mohamad", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_raffles_300976.jpg?VersionId=B1SKjItcdNzIThWNciIWI0iFyqA8e93C", "alt_text": null}]}

This was largely driven by weaker business lending.\n\nLoans through the domestic banking unit - which captures lending in all currencies, but reflects mainly Singdollar lending - stood at $678 billion in August,\n\ncompared with $679 billion a month ago.\n\nBusiness lending stood at $423 billion, down 0.4 per cent from a month ago. The growth in loans to manufacturers and financial institutions narrowed from a month ago. In particular, loans to the hefty financial institutions segment fell 2.1 per cent in August from a month ago to $101 billion.\n\nThe single-largest business lending segment - that is, to the builders - however, held up. Loans to the construction industry continued to grow, up 0.8 per cent in August over the month to $150 billion.\n\nGrowth in consumer loans stayed in positive territory. In August, it lifted 0.3 per cent from a month ago to $255 billion, pushed in part by a sharp jump in share financing. Share financing was up 13.7 per cent to $1.75 billion in August from a month ago, reversing from a month-on-month decline in July.\n\nThe slight boost in consumer lending was despite mortgages contracting month on month since February this year. Housing and bridging loans stood in August at $199 billion, contracting 0.1 per cent over the month.\n\nFrom a year ago, total lending in August fell 1 per cent, marking the third consecutive weakening since June.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

During times like these change is inevitable and we need to be willing to adapt quickly.\"\n\nSouth Africa's move confirms that South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby (Sanzaar) will be unable to deliver the 14-team Super Rugby competition already promised to broadcasters in a five-year deal.\n\nSuper Rugby, long criticised as unwieldy, had planned to cut down to 14 teams from 15 next year, by kicking out Japan's Sunwolves. But this season was halted by the coronavirus, prompting New Zealand, Australia and South Africa to go it alone with domestic tournaments.\n\nThe pandemic has now proved the catalyst for the disintegration of Super Rugby, which was long praised for its attractive, free-flowing play before over-expansion began to pull the competition apart.\n\nSanzaar refused to comment on South Africa's move, saying it would wait until an executive council meeting expected in the coming weeks. Rugby Australia also declined to comment when contacted by AFP.\n\nSouth Africa said the world champion Springboks remained committed to Sanzaar's four-nation Rugby Championship, whose scheduling has sparked complaints by the All Blacks as their players face spending Christmas in quarantine.\n\nNew Zealand's Robinson said the four Sanzaar partners had already agreed to look at more domestic-related competitions in 2020 and 2021. But South Africa said it had rejected the option of playing in further domestic series.\n\nSouth Africa's Bulls, Lions, Sharks and Stormers will now explore joining PRO14, while the Cheetahs will be available for a potential 'Super Series' formed from the wreckage of Super Rugby - as long as their participation is \"cost-neutral at least\".\n\n\"Our members are excited about the prospect of closer alignment with PRO Rugby and seeking a northern hemisphere future,\" said SA Rugby chief executive Jurie Roux.\n\n\"However, we would not have been taking this decision but for actions elsewhere,\" he added, referring to the decisions of New Zealand and Australia.\n\nA significant part of the PRO14 appeal for South Africa is the time zone with the widest difference between South Africa and Britain and Ireland being two hours for six months each year, compared with 11 hours for New Zealand.\n\nThrough 25 years of Super Rugby, South Africans have had to watch matches from New Zealand and Japan before breakfast, from Australia in mid-morning and from Argentina after midnight.\n\nNew Zealand is working on plans for a second domestic Super Rugby Aotearoa competition, with the possibility of its five domestic franchises being joined by a Pacific islands side.\n\nAustralia is backing the prospect of a trans-Tasman competition, although the two sides have been at odds over how many Australian teams will take part.\n\n\"I think we're better players when we play against you guys. And it will only get better over time,\" Rugby Australia chairman Hamish McLennan told Sky Sport's \"The Breakdown\" programme.\n\n\"We've got a good crop of young guys coming through and I think the competition will improve,\" he said.\n\n\"And we've got to work together to leverage our strength together on the global stage.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nRugby\n\nSuper Rugby", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/af_rugby_300920.jpg?VersionId=rkgZ1z5iGh55PacRZ0EIZuh3j8PBQMx1", "alt_text": null}]}

They are lovers.\n\nWriter-director Ray Yeung tells The Straits Times in an e-mail interview that he always wanted Suk Suk's central romance to be between two older people - an unpopular artistic choice, given that viewers prefer to see young, attractive persons on screen.\n\nYeung's film shows Pak (played by Tai Bo) and Hoi (Ben Yuen), two men well into their 60s, doing things lovers do. Taxi driver Pak lives in fear of his wife and child discovering his double life while Hoi, a divorced man who lives with less anxiety, has to respect Pak's boundaries.\n\nFudging the visuals to make the film more palatable, as film-makers sometimes do with characters past 50, such as by using flashbacks, was out of the question.\n\n\"The aim of the film is to show the experiences of these men in their twilight years. If I had used flashbacks or younger actors to play them I don't think it would truly reflect their struggles,\" he says.\n\nThe Cantonese-language Suk Suk, Yeung's third feature, will be screened in October as part of the Singapore Chinese Film Festival 2020. It scored five nominations in the 2019 Golden Horse Awards, including Lead Actor (for Yuen and Tai). At this year's Hong Kong Film Awards, Tai picked up the Best Actor while Patra Au, who plays his wife Ching, won Best Supporting Actress. At the same event, the film also earned a Best Picture nomination.\n\nYeung says that when men of a certain age fall in love, they face problems related to how they had to blend into the mainstream while growing up.\n\n\"They were living in an era when homosexuality was illegal and almost everyone had to get married. An unmarried man of a certain age was seen as an outcast and this would affect their status at work, within the family and society at large,\" says Yeung, whose previous films, Front Cover (2015) and Cut Sleeve Boys (2006) also explored gay themes.\n\nChing, Pak's wife, is trapped in a loveless marriage.\n\n\"These women are married to someone who doesn't desire them.

If they find out the truth, it would be devastating,\" he says.\n\nCompared with a decade ago, it is easier today to get a film such as Suk Suk made, says Yeung, though he did face some difficulties obtaining funding and in casting actors. Eventually, he found Tai and Yuen, actors with decades of experience in films and television.\n\nWith the falling away of the taboo about playing gay characters, Yeung believes that the depiction of such persons on television and in films have improved over time, compared with several years ago, when in films such as Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle (2004), an effeminate character exists purely for laughs.\n\nWhile it seems that gay characters are popping up everywhere these days, on closer inspection their stories have little impact on the stories being told.\n\n\"In mainstream films, they are usually depicted as side characters who rarely have their own storylines, They are usually there to support the dilemmas of the main leads,\" he says.\n\nSuk Suk, with the original Cantonese dialogue (with English subtitles) is being screened as part of the Singapore Chinese Film Festival 2020 from Oct 10.

It also called for the United States to \"lead in the formulation and ratification of a global treaty on artificial intelligence in the vein of the Geneva Conventions\", a step that the Trump administration has resisted for cyberweaponry and the broader use of artificial intelligence.\n\nBut questions persist about whether such a treaty would prove useful. While nuclear and chemical weapons were largely in the hands of nations, cyberweapons - and artificial intelligence techniques - are in the hands of criminal groups, terrorist groups and teenagers.\n\nNonetheless, the report's focus on working with allies and developing global codes of ethics and privacy runs counter to the instincts of the Trump administration, making it more surprising that the Republican members of the task force signed on.\n\n\"I think this is a case of pushing for a different path at the Pentagon,\" said Representative Jim Banks, a co-chairman of the group.\n\nIn an interview, he was careful to avoid criticising the White House, but Mr Banks praised the work of Mr Ash Carter, president Barack Obama's last defence secretary, for beginning initiatives to force the Pentagon to explore and adopt technologies already developed in the private sector.\n\nThis week, House Republicans plan to issue another report, aimed at containing Chinese power.\n\nArguing for an end to reliance on legacy systems is one thing; executing that policy is another. Usually each of those weapons systems has a constituency that can step in to save it, often wielding the argument that the Pentagon would be putting workers at military contractors out of a job. Notably, the task force did not identify which systems needed to be retired.\n\nBut the task force concluded that approach had squelched risk-taking, and could \"hinder the military's ability to fully utilise private sector innovation\".\n\n\"The Pentagon knows how to acquire large programmes,\" such as \"fighter jets or aircraft carries, but it is less adept at purchasing at scale the types of emerging technologies that will be required for future conflict\", it said.\n\nDefence Department officials have sought to address that problem. But the task force found that while those efforts sometimes succeeded, they were too small, and \"the Pentagon has so far only been able to tap into a fraction of the innovation being developed in the United States\".\n\nSee more on\n\nPentagon\n\nDefence and military\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/af_pentagon-us_300920.jpg?VersionId=mcxhqBmU.S39scsdp74QRw5l4qUfnI0Y", "alt_text": null}]}

(Mr Trump did not accede.)\n\nKnown for his sharp interrogations of political figures, Mr Wallace - at 72 the youngest of the three men onstage - succeeded in keeping Mr Trump more or less in check during his first go-round as moderator four years ago, when the pundits declared the veteran Fox News anchor a clear winner of the night.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Wallace faced harsh reviews as viewers assessed his performance on social media.\n\n\"Moderate this debate - now,\" presidential historian Michael Beschloss demanded on Twitter 15 minutes in, speaking for a large swath of the political class.\n\nIn a brute-force style, Mr Trump flouted the agreed-upon ground rules and refused to allow Mr Biden his two minutes to respond to questions, leaving Mr Wallace yelping at one point, \"Let him answer!\".\n\nNot satisfied with merely speaking over his Democratic opponent, Mr Trump took aim at the moderator, too, repeatedly scolding Mr Wallace.\n\n\"I guess I'm debating you, not him, but that's OK, I'm not surprised,\" Mr Trump said after one query from Mr Wallace which he disliked.\n\nThe debate had no breaks. But at the midway point, perhaps sensing that Mr Trump was threatening to steamroll the event, Mr Wallace did something unusual for a presidential moderator: He effectively called the debate to a temporary halt.\n\n\"The country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions,\" Mr Wallace said, directly asking Mr Trump to yield a higher civic ideal. \"I'm appealing to you, sir, to do it.\"\n\nNodding at Mr Biden, Mr Trump replied defiantly: \"And him, too?\"\n\nMr Wallace replied: \"Well, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting.\"\n\nFew journalists envied the moderator his task heading into the night.\n\nMr Trump's onstage intensity and logorrhea have proved a formidable challenge for some of the nation's leading interviewers. And with the president ignoring the traditional parameters of debate decorum, Mr Wallace was left with few good options to keep Mr Trump from chattering without pause.\n\nHe tried humour.\n\n\"If you want to switch seats, we can do that,\" Mr Wallace told the president at one point, arching a brow. (Mr Trump did not parry.)\n\nMr Wallace said he regretted having to raise his voice, \"but why should I be different than the two of you?\".\n\nOn social media, some viewers at home called for the president's microphone to be shut off, but that was a power Mr Wallace did not possess: Neither campaign would have agreed beforehand to such a mechanism.\n\nWhich left the moderator, a lonely man on a large stage, having to try to cajole, joke, plead and argue to maintain order.\n\n\"If you are coming down hard on Chris Wallace, ask yourself, what could a moderator have done in the face of Trump's behaviour?\" veteran political strategist Jeff Greenfield asked on Twitter immediately afterward.\n\nMr Lester Holt, who had Mr Wallace's role as leadoff moderator of the 2016 debates, gave a resigned response on the NBC News telecast after the debate ended.\n\n\"If hearing that this debate is over was music to your ears, you may not be alone,\" Mr Holt told viewers, adding that he was \"at a bit of a loss for words\".\n\nMr Wallace, son of the \"60 Minutes\" legend Mike Wallace, drew on the entirety of his on-screen repertoire: the defusing aside, a self-deprecating remark, a jabbing question. None seemed to knock Mr Trump off his determination to dominate the night.\n\nIt was a far cry from Mr Wallace's stated goal for the debate.\n\n\"I'm trying to get them to engage, to focus on the key issues, to give people at home a sense of 'why I want to vote for one versus the other',\" he had said beforehand.\n\nInstead, he closed the evening with Mr Trump still talking off screen, attempting to argue over Mr Wallace's signoff.\n\n\"This is the end of this debate,\" the Fox News anchor said, drawing a deep breath. \"It's been an interesting hour and a half.\"\n\nTwo more match-ups are scheduled between Mr Trump and Mr Biden, and the next moderator assigned to maintain control will be a TV personality known less for jousting with lawmakers than listening, quietly and attentively, to rambling on-air callers: Mr Steve Scully of cable and satellite television network C-SPAN.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_wallace_300956.jpg?VersionId=RsmOYUhuUNYbg.eLgs6l7BVtJn_7un68", "alt_text": null}]}

The last-minute briefing included no Democratic lawmakers; staff members for Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking member of Mr Graham's committee, were blocked from attending, a deviation from normal practice for intelligence briefings on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe impromptu briefing angered Democrats. Mr Ratcliffe had promised to brief on the sources, but some congressional officials were surprised by the hasty meeting. They suggested that the scheduling reflected the need to brief Mr Graham before congressional testimony by former FBI director James Comey on Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats called the releases one of the starkest examples of politicisation of the intelligence agencies under Mr Trump.\n\nWhile Mr Ratcliffe - a former congressman from Texas with little intelligence experience - promised during his Senate confirmation hearing to be nonpartisan, since taking the job he has highlighted Chinese election interference over what career officials say is a greater threat from Russia and made other declassifications similarly beneficial to the president.\n\n\"Ratcliffe is abusing his position exactly as I feared he would, and the abuse is accelerating as we near the election,\" Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement.\n\nThe letter on Tuesday was the first time Mr Ratcliffe had released material dismissed by other officials as unverified rumour. He initially embraced that assessment, saying that \"the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication\".\n\nThe intelligence agencies have stopped short of definitively assessing the material as disinformation.\n\nBut in a statement hours after the release of the letter, Mr Ratcliffe appeared to caveat his own warning.\n\n\"To be clear, this is not Russian disinformation and has not been assessed as such by the intelligence community,\" he said. \"I'll be briefing Congress on the sensitive sources and methods by which it was obtained in the coming days.\"\n\nThe snippets of information that Mr Ratliffe released included an intelligence report sent to Mr Comey on Sept 7, 2016, and handwritten notes by the CIA director at the time, Mr John Brennan, that said he had briefed President Barack Obama on the information.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Brennan said the release amounted to \"blatant politicisation\".\n\n\"Russian interference in the election was real, intense and unprecedented in scale and scope. It was authorised personally by Putin to hurt Secretary Clinton and to promote the electoral prospects of Donald Trump,\" said Mr Nick Shapiro, Mr Brennan's former deputy chief of staff at the CIA, referring to President Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\n\"The intelligence on this is incontrovertible and the analysis unimpeachable.\"\n\nMr Brennan was presenting a huge array of information about Russia to the White House in the summer of 2016. Including the information about what Russian intelligence was saying about Mrs Clinton's plans was not an endorsement of its accuracy, but a demonstration of how much information the United States was collecting on Moscow, a former intelligence official said.\n\nOther officials say they believe that the intelligence could simply be Russia's analysis of American politics, suggesting not a plot by the Clinton campaign to manufacture a scandal but a legitimate political critique of the Trump campaign's stance towards Russia.\n\nOfficials said the timing was not a coincidence, pointing not only to the debate but also to Mr Comey's testimony on Wednesday before Mr Graham's committee, which is scrutinising the bureau's Russia investigation that the president has long sought to falsely portray as a plot to undermine him.\n\nMr Graham brushed aside concerns about the veracity and provenance of the information.\n\n\"I'm not saying whether it's true or not,\" he told reporters. \"I'm asking Democrats, do you give a damn whether the FBI investigated, or do you only care about investigating Trump?\"\n\nHe added that it was \"not far-fetched to believe the Clinton campaign would do something like this.\"\n\nAs the election approaches, administration officials have been declassifying an array of material aimed at raising questions about the investigations of the 2016 campaign. The disclosures have mainly appeared aimed at energising Trump's political base and fuelling conspiracy theories that the national security establishment has been trying to stymie his presidency.\n\nLast week, Attorney General William Barr provided Mr Graham with declassified documents that tried to further cast doubt on aspects of the FBI's Russia's investigation. Former FBI and Justice Department officials said the selective declassification appeared to be part of a pattern of politically motivated steps by Mr Barr to bolster Mr Trump's allegations about the inquiry.\n\nMr Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, seized on Mr Ratcliffe's disclosure, writing on Twitter that it showed that Mrs Clinton was behind what he called \"the Russia Hoax\".\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nRussia\n\nDonald Trump\n\nHillary Clinton", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/af_john-ratcliffe_300920.jpg?VersionId=2yYsPMvyuAP3YqYDlGEKeLtRWL9V2f49", "alt_text": null}]}

Its gauge for new export orders rose at the fastest pace in over three years.\n\n\"The higher official PMI for both manufacturing and non-manufacturing suggested China's growth recovery is on track,\" Nomura analysts said in emailed comments.\n\nRecently, economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices have all suggested a further pick up in the industrial sector. Profits at China's industrial firms extended robust growth in August to the fourth month, official data showed on Sunday.\n\nDomestic demand also shows signs of broadening, with industrial output accelerating the most in eight months in August and retail sales growing for the first time this year.\n\nThe official PMI also showed activity in China's services sector expanded at a faster pace in September, as demand across the economy continues to recover from the coronavirus-induced slump.\n\nCHALLENGES AHEAD\n\nYet, even as China emerges from the pandemic in fairly stable shape, many expect the road ahead to be bumpy.\n\n\"Although overall manufacturing demand has improved, the industry has recovered unevenly,\" said Zhao Qinghe, an official at the NBS, in comments accompanying the data, noting weaknesses in demand for clothing and wood processing manufacturing in particular.\n\n\"In addition, the global epidemic has not yet been fully and effectively controlled, and there are still uncertain factors in China's imports and exports,\" he said.\n\nA sub-index for employment in the official PMI improved slightly but remained in contractionary territory. It stood at 49.6 in September from 49.4 the month before, indicating the pressure on jobs and keeping policymakers primed for more support measures.\n\nMoreover, a growing rift between China and the United States over trade, technology and a range of other issues have analysts warning about risks to the outlook. Tensions between the two countries are expected to escalate further ahead of the US presidential election in November, which some China observers say could undercut the recovery.\n\nChina's economy, which grew 3.2 per cent in the second quarter year-on-year, is set to expand 2.2 per cent this year - the weakest in over three decades.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nManufacturing\n\nPMI\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/af_china-factory_300920.jpg?VersionId=dVMy.a77s4kh6h3YnrjETf76maDWTay1", "alt_text": null}]}

He called the president a \"racist\" after Mr Trump defended his orders to end racial sensitivity training in the government.\n\nMr Trump insulted Mr Biden's intelligence and jabbed the former vice-president over unsubstantiated allegations about his son Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings.\n\nMr Biden called Mr Trump \"the worst president America's ever had\" and said that under his leadership, \"we've become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, more violent\".\n\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOMINEE\n\nThe\n\nback-and-forth quickly degenerated\n\nafter Mr Trump answered the first question, about his nominee to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Mr Trump said he had the right to move swiftly to replace her, while Mr Biden said US voters should weigh in first.\n\n\"We won the election,\" Mr Trump said in answer to the first question, about\n\nhis nominee Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes to the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe debate moderator, Fox News host Wallace, tried to intervene as the two candidates squabbled over their respective health policies, and Mr Trump complained: \"I guess I'm debating you.\"\n\n\"Folks, do you have any idea what this clown is trying to do?\" Mr Biden, who frequently spoke directly into the camera, said as Mr Trump talked over him.\n\n\"Will you shut up, man,\" he grumbled moments later.\n\nHANDLING OF PANDEMIC\n\nWallace subsequently asked about Mr Trump's response to\n\nthe coronavirus pandemic,\n\nwhich has killed more than 200,000 Americans so far, and why voters should trust Mr Biden to handle the response better.\n\n\"You don't panic. He panicked,\" Mr Biden said. \"He still doesn't have a plan.\"\n\n\"Wrong,\" Mr Trump interjected.\n\n\"You could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood,\" he told Mr Biden, alleging \"millions\" of Americans would have died with the former vice-president leading the country.\n\n\"I know how to do the job,\" Mr Biden said. \"I know how to get the job done.\"\n\nAfter enduring Mr Biden's criticism of his coronavirus response, Mr Trump seized on a Biden remark that his management of the crisis would be \"smart\".\n\n\"Don't ever use the word 'smart' with me,\" Mr Trump said, reminding Mr Biden that he once said he went to Delaware State University when he went to University of Delaware.\n\nMr Biden chuckled. \"Oh, give me a break.\"\n\n\"There's nothing smart about you, Joe,\" Mr Trump added.\n\nMASKS - TO WEAR OR NOT TO WEAR\n\nMr Trump and Mr Biden even argued about whether Americans should wear masks to combat the spread of the virus. Many people in Mr Trump's entourage in the audience did not wear one, and when an official from the Cleveland Clinic, which is co-hosting the debate, came by to offer them masks, they refused.\n\nMr Biden's entourage wore masks. He noted that the director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this month that near-universal mask-wearing would end the US outbreak. Mr Trump said other officials had claimed the \"opposite\".\n\n\"No serious person said the opposite,\" Mr Biden said.\n\n\"I think masks are OK,\" Mr Trump said. \"I mean I have a mask right here. When needed, I wear masks. I don't wear masks like him.\"\n\nTRUMP'S TAX CONTROVERSY\n\nHours before the debate began,\n\nMr Biden released his most recent tax return\n\ns, signalling that he wanted new revelations about the president's taxes at centre stage for their first face-to-face encounter.\n\n\"Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes\" in 2016 and 2017, Wallace asked Mr Trump, a reference to The New York Times' reporting beginning on Sunday on tax records the president has kept secret.\n\nMr Trump did not directly answer, saying he paid millions of dollars in taxes.\n\n\"Show us your tax returns,\" Mr Biden interjected.\n\n\"I paid $38 million one year. I paid $27 million one year,\" Mr Trump said, without specifying which years.\n\n\"Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?\" Wallace repeated.\n\n\"Millions of dollars,\" Mr Trump answered. \"And you'll get to see it.\"\n\nThe difference between the two candidates' tax history is fodder for Mr Biden's argument that Mr Trump has conned working-class voters into supporting him.\n\nMr Biden paid nearly US$300,000 (S$410,383) in income taxes in 2019, according to his returns. Billionaire Trump, meanwhile, paid US$750 in 2016 and 2017, and nothing in 10 of the last 15 years, according to The New York Times.\n\nCHINA, FAMILIES\n\nAfter the discussion of Mr Trump's taxes, a question about Mr Trump's economic record degenerated into arguing - again in personal and insulting terms - over China and the two candidates' families.\n\n\"You take a look at what he's actually done. He's done very little,\" Mr Biden said. \"China's perfected the art of the steal.\"\n\nMr Trump used the criticism as an opening to attack Mr Biden's son Hunter Biden, demanding to know whether he had taken \"billions of dollars\" from China and alleging \"the mayor of Moscow's wife gave your son three and a half million dollars.\"\n\nMr Biden audibly sighed. \"That is not true,\" he said. \"It's totally discredited.\"\n\nMr Trump began talking over him again, insisting the claim was only discredited by the media.\n\n\"It's hard to get any word in with this clown,\" Mr Biden said. \"His family, we could talk about all night.\"\n\nMr Trump said some of his family had given up comfortable lives to move to Washington and help him govern. Wallace ended the back-and-forth by admonishing the two men not to interrupt each other, focusing on Mr Trump, who he said had been the worst about it.\n\nRACE ISSUE\n\nAfter Wallace asked Mr Trump to explain actions he had taken to end racial sensitivity training in the government and by federal contractors, Mr Trump said that \"I ended it because it's racist\" and \"they were teaching people to hate our country and I'm not going to allow that to happen\".\n\n\"Nobody's doing that,\" Mr Biden responded. \"He's the racist.\"\n\nWallace asked Mr Trump if he would condemn white supremacists and militia groups.\n\n\"Sure, I'm willing to do that, but I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not the right wing. I'm willing to do anything. I want to see peace,\" he said.\n\nThen do it, Wallace said to him.\n\n\"You want to call them - what do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead,\" Mr Trump said. \"Who would you like me to condemn?\"\n\nMr Biden said he should condemn the Proud Boys, a group of Trump supporters who have engaged in protests and street violence with left-wing demonstrators.\n\n\"Proud Boys?\" Mr Trump said. \"Stand back and stand by, but I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left, because this is not a right-wing problem.\"\n\nMr Biden noted that law enforcement officials in Mr Trump's administration have named white supremacists one of the nation's gravest domestic threats.\n\n\"Antifa's an idea, not an organisation,\" he said.\n\n\"You've got to be kidding,\" Mr Trump replied.\n\nBIDEN'S SONS\n\nLater, Mr Biden returned to the discussion to his family, noting the military service of his late son Beau Biden and accusing Mr Trump of calling service members \"losers,\" a reference to an Atlantic report earlier this month about the president disparaging people in the military.\n\nMr Trump has denied the report.\n\n\"He was not a loser,\" Mr Biden said. \"He was a patriot and the the people left behind there were heroes.\"\n\n\"Are you talking about Hunter?\" Mr Trump said. \"I don't know Beau. I know Hunter,\" who he said \"got thrown out of the military, he was thrown out, he was dishonourably discharged.\"\n\n\"That's not true,\" Mr Biden said. \"He wasn't dishonourably discharged.\"\n\n\"For cocaine use,\" Mr Trump said. \"And he didn't have a job until you became vice-president.\"\n\n\"None of that is true,\" Mr Biden said, adding that \"my son, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem. He's overtaken it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it. And I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.\"\n\nMr Hunter Biden was discharged from the military because of drug use.\n\nLater, after an exchange about the environment and the economy, Mr Trump alleged that Mr Biden had called people in the military \"stupid b******s\" on tape, raising his voice as Wallace pleaded for him to \"stop\".\n\n\"Play it,\" Mr Biden said of the alleged recording.\n\nFIVE WEEKS TO ELECTION DAY\n\nTuesday's (Sept 29) presidential debate, the first of three before the Nov 3 election, is hosted by Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nThe topics, which were announced last week by the Commission on Presidential Debates, include a comparison of the Trump and Biden records, the Supreme Court, the coronavirus, the economy, racial tensions, the violence in US cities and the integrity of the election.\n\nWith five weeks left until Election Day, polls show Mr Biden leading Mr Trump nationally and in key swing states. The Democrat's campaign has approached the debate as a high-stakes moment when he could cement his advantage or see it begin to erode.\n\nFor Mr Trump, the debate is a critical opportunity to try to regain momentum after months of declining poll numbers.\n\nOrganisers said there were about 80 people in the audience, including the candidates' family members, their guests, campaign staff, hosts, health and security officials and journalists.\n\nMr Trump's guests included First Lady Melania Trump, sons Eric and Donald Jr, daughters Ivanka and Tiffany, and allies such as US Representative Jim Jordan and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\nMr Biden's wife Jill sat in Mr Biden's section.\n\nWith more than a million Americans already casting early ballots and time running out to change minds or influence the small sliver of undecided voters, the stakes were enormous as the two White House candidates took the stage before the election.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden\n\nElections", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/rk_trump-biden_300920.jpg?VersionId=ItnoM8rd1uCkCBV3HClGP9kVKanbvFa9", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nmtrumpbiden3009.jpg?VersionId=vrInhujeHYGxiTTTwujmmp1WnbriG9Rc", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_debate1_300957.jpg?VersionId=FdYqo2wAhkZzJG07b3TScPNn0_1QgP6o", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_debate2_300958.jpg?VersionId=y6UJtSdF8Jea2bLF9SMpUsiRB4Albxmc", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_debate3_300959.jpg?VersionId=XSueMP2IAOwBiD9jV4KFVEnS9.oFqvjq", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_debate4_300960.jpg?VersionId=SoCTBM5tdsZyp33KdLeFzGFKxSx4QiNG", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_debate5_300961.jpg?VersionId=YznuscjRyl7ubnrPbp72YH_242YGoStr", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_debate6_300962.jpg?VersionId=N7qJhtmjrVXoq0ur6P1XR4DhfVGQQN2x", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_debate7_300963.jpg?VersionId=ZOPZ2ljj8RaVXHQwXwnJMJFVit24uAUb", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_debate8_300964.jpg?VersionId=n.szvpS_ONOeN.zGkZ.3hvgMPW0vOLrt", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign -

Elections have consequences.\n\n\"We have the Senate and we have the White House and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all.\n\n\"... I think that she (Barrett) will be outstanding. She will be as good as anybody who has ever served on that court.

I'm not elected for (just) 3-1/2 years.\"\n\nResponding, Mr Biden said: \"He's elected until the next election. ... The election's already started.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nMr Biden: \"You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap and... the golf course and go in the Oval Office and (put) together Democrats and Republicans, and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.\"\n\nMr Trump: \"You didn't think we should have closed our country (to China) because you thought it was terrible.\n\n\"We've done a great job. But I tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job we've done. You don't have it in your blood.\"\n\nOn Mr Biden's proposed approach\n\nto developing\n\ncoronavirus\n\nvaccines, Mr Trump said: \"People like this would rather make it political than save lives.\"\n\nMr Biden: \"Guess what, a lot of people died, and a lot more going to die unless he gets a lot smarter a lot quicker.\"\n\nMr Trump: \"There's nothing smart about you, Joe.\"\n\nOn Mr Trump's mask policy, Mr Biden said: \"He's a fool on this.\"\n\nHEALTHCARE\n\nTold by Mr Trump that he has adopted former Democratic presidential rival Bernie Sanders' \"socialised medicine\" proposals, Mr Biden said: \"Everybody here knows he's a liar... You picked the wrong guy on the wrong night at the wrong time.\n\n\"Folks, do you have any idea what this clown's doing? I tell you what, he is not for anybody needing healthcare.\"\n\nAfter Mr Trump explained his health proposal, Mr Biden said: \"He has no plan for healthcare... The fact is, this man has no idea what he's talking about.\"\n\nAt another point, while being interrupted by Mr Trump, Mr Biden said: \"Will you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential... Keep yapping, man.\"\n\nWallace to Mr Trump: \"I think the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you, sir, to do that.\"\n\nReferring to Mr Biden, Mr Trump said: \"And him, too.\"\n\nWallace: \"Well, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting.\"\n\nRACE RELATIONS\n\nMr Biden: \"This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred, racist division.\"\n\nCiting Mr Biden's support for the 1994 crime Bill, Mr Trump said: \"You've treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country.\"\n\nMr Biden: \"Yes, there is a systemic injustice in this country in education and work and in law enforcement, and the way in which it is enforced.\"\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT AND URBAN UNREST\n\nMr Trump: \"The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats in many cases, radical left, and they have got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don't want to say anything about law and order. And I'll tell you what the people of this country want and demand: law and order, and you're afraid to even say it.\"\n\nMr Biden said Mr Trump had done nothing to calm down the protests: \"He just pours gasoline on the fire.\"\n\nResponding to Mr Trump attacking him on the suburbs, Mr Biden said: \"He wouldn't know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn. I know suburbs.\"\n\nMr Trump: \"Name one law enforcement group that has come out and supported you. One. Think. We have time.\"\n\nMr Biden: \"Under this President, we've become weaker, sicker, more divided and more violent.\"\n\nWHITE SUPREMACISTS\n\nMr Wallace: \"Are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence or the number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha, and as we've seen in Portland?\"\n\nMr Trump: \"I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right. ... I'm willing to do anything. I want to see peace.\"\n\nMr Wallace: \"Then do it, sir.\"\n\nMr Biden: \"Do it, do it. Say it.\"\n\nMr Trump: \"You want to call them. What do you want to call them? Give me a name.\"\n\nMr Biden, referring to a right-wing group: \"Proud Boys.\"\n\nMr Trump: \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.\"\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nMr Trump: \"I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water, and do whatever else we can that's good.\"\n\nMr Biden: \"The first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord.\"\n\nELECTION INTEGRITY\n\nMr Biden encouraged mail-in voting by saying Mr Trump does it, too. \"He sits behind the Resolute Desk (in the White House) and sends his ballot to Florida.\"\n\nMr Biden: \"He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of that election. ... If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that will be accepted. \"If we get the votes, he's going to go. He can't stay in power.\"\n\nMr Trump: \"Don't tell me about a free transition. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. This is not going to end well.\"\n\nMr Biden: \"You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person - whatever way is the best way for you. Because he cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election.\"\n\nAsked by Mr Wallace if he would urge his supporters to stay calm and pledge not to declare victory until the election is certified, Mr Trump said: \"I'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully.\"\n\nMr Trump: \"If I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with it. They cheat.\"\n\nMr Biden: \"The fact is I will accept it and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted. That'll be the end of it.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/rk_dt-jbcollage_300920.jpg?VersionId=l70q61VPu46AsAm3hkINibB4MyEBblLm", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/rk_dt-jb_300920.jpg?VersionId=eJjeTQ7pndysICCjtm32EP0OBP4mThrP", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign - DBS Wellness space 1 (CREDIT DBS Bank)\n \nCredit: Photo of DBS Bank office"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ababd7adbab5ef95d4223806a015c648e9803c8d554289cc24869840a46a74ae", "alt_text": "Enforcement action by the Health Sciences Authority netted a suspect and various vapes on July 10."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7f73688fa163929df2c176d392b660d82a63b73e970c811e2339978d254a5fcd", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo, with retirees Chong Hock Loo, 75, and Shirley Tan, 68, during the PCF Family Day event on July 13."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0748316b0c8c0488543313beecbd97ee6f6260fce547cdce53f76f53d9d6a49f", "alt_text": "From left: Pathlight School students Marcus Goh, Nurdaanya Mohamed Hafiz and Brennan Tay with their respective artwork, part of a total of 30 artwork that are selected in the Wing Tai X Pathlight School art competition to be displayed on a construction hoarding along Kim Seng Linear Park, on July 11, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0f74970f823073d68c58dca22ef69d6312f85ec19cd11cccf600d0046eabbb32", "alt_text": "Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - July 13, 2025 Italy's Jannik Sinner celebrates with the trophy after winning the men's final against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz REUTERS/Andrew Couldridge"}]}

JPMorgan admitted responsibility for the traders' actions. The US Justice Department filed two counts of wire fraud against the bank's parent company but agreed to defer prosecution related to the charges, under a three-year deal that requires the bank to report its remediation and compliance efforts to the government.\n\nThe settlement included fresh details about spoofing on the bank's Treasuries desk, which was occurring at the same time as previously alleged market manipulation on the bank's precious metals desk. Five traders on the Treasuries desk manipulated prices of US Treasury contracts, as well as trading in notes and bonds in the secondary market, over eight years, according to the settlement, causing US$106 million in losses. None of those traders have been charged publicly.\n\nMembers of that group openly discussed their illegal strategies via chats, with one trader writing on six occasions that he was \"spoofing\" the market, according to the government's statement of facts. Another Treasuries trader, in a November 2012 chat, described his success in moving the market by tricking high-frequency traders: \"a little razzle dazzle to juke the algos...\"\n\nThe accord also ends the criminal investigation of the bank that led to a half dozen employees being charged for allegedly rigging the price of gold and silver futures from 2008 to 2016. Two have entered guilty pleas, and three traders and a former JPMorgan salesman are awaiting trial. In all, according to the settlement deal, 10 JPMorgan traders caused losses of US$206 million to other parties in the market.\n\nJPMorgan will pay the biggest monetary penalty ever imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, including a US$436.4 million fine, US$311.7 million in restitution and more than US$172 million in disgorgement, according to a CFTC statement. The CFTC said its order will recognize and offset restitution and disgorgement payments made to the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission. The Justice Department resolution requires that more than US$300 million of the penalty be set aside to cover potential victims who could apply for relief through the government.\n\n\"For nearly a decade, a significant number of JPMorgan traders and sales personnel openly disregarded US laws that serve to protect against illegal activity in the marketplace,\" said Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI's New York Field Office.\n\nJPMorgan, in a statement, said it doesn't expect any disruption of service to clients as a result of the resolutions.\n\n\"The conduct of the individuals referenced in today's resolutions is unacceptable and they are no longer with the firm,\" said Daniel Pinto, a co-president of JPMorgan. \"We appreciate that the considerable resources we've dedicated to internal controls was recognized by the DOJ, including enhancements to compliance policies, surveillance systems and training programs.\"\n\nUnder the settlement, the bank is required to cooperate with the government's ongoing investigations and prosecutions. That includes making current and former employees available for interviews or testimony.\n\nJPMorgan put at least four members of the Treasuries operation on leave starting earlier this year. The departures were related to the investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter. The settlement didn't identify the five Treasuries traders, and it's unclear whether the government will pursue any legal action against any of the traders referenced in the settlement.\n\nIn a couple of the trades, prosecutors alleged in the indictment against the individuals that a JPMorgan trader was spoofing the market for gold and silver futures as he made trades for two hedge funds. The government referred to the funds as \"key clients\" that provided \"important sources of revenue and market intelligence\" for the precious metals desk. It didn't name the funds, accuse them of any wrongdoing or indicate they were aware of any allegedly improper trading, which occurred in December 2011 and January 2012.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, those funds were Moore Capital Management and Tudor Investment Corp. They declined to comment through spokesmen.\n\nThe JPMorgan penalty far exceeds previous spoofing-related fines levied against banks, and is the toughest sanction imposed in the Justice Department's years-long crackdown on spoofing.\n\nSpoofing typically involves flooding derivatives markets with orders that traders don't intend to execute to trick others into moving prices in a desired direction. The practice has become a focus for prosecutors and regulators in recent years after lawmakers specifically prohibited it in 2010. While submitting and canceling orders isn't illegal, it is unlawful as part of a strategy intended to dupe other traders.\n\nMore than two dozen individuals and firms have been sanctioned by the Justice Department or the CFTC, including day traders operating out of their bedrooms, sophisticated high-frequency trading shops and big banks such as Bank of America Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nThe Justice Department took a much more aggressive tack on the JPMorgan matter, alleging several individuals from its trading desk had engaged in a racketeering conspiracy to manipulate precious metals futures prices. While other suspected market cheats have been charged with specific spoofing and manipulation offenses, the Justice Department accused JPMorgan metals traders under the 1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- a criminal law more commonly applied to Mafia cases than global bank probes.\n\nWhile the individuals remain charged under the RICO law, Tuesday's resolution didn't accuse the bank of racketeering conspiracy.\n\nThe highest-level individual charged is Michael Nowak, a veteran gold trader who was indicted under seal in August 2019 along with two others. A former JPMorgan salesman who worked with hedge fund clients was later added to the case.\n\nJPMorgan has faced charges before. In 2015, the bank pleaded guilty to felony antitrust charges along with several other global banks that paid penalties and admitted to conspiring to rig the price of US dollars and euros. The bank agreed to pay US$550 million, but it and other global lenders in the accord felt little lasting hit from markets or customers, undercutting investor fears that a guilty plea would devastate their business. The Justice Department said it took the previous plea into account in determining penalties.\n\nSee more on\n\nBanks and financial institutions\n\nFinancial crimes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/rkjpmorgan_300920.jpg?VersionId=EpRwy.Ln_gJjLdyn4luogJlR7evXccoU", "alt_text": null}]}

Others chatted freely, at times quite near one another, in cozy conference rooms. Face masks were nowhere to be seen.\n\nIt seemed like January, before the spread of the coronavirus in Europe, but it was actually last week, as many European nations were tightening restrictions amid a surge of new cases.\n\nIn Sweden, new infections, if tipping upward slightly, still remained surprisingly low.\n\n\"I have potentially hundreds of tiny interactions when working here,\" said Thom Feeney, a Briton who manages the coworking space. \"Our work lives should not be reduced to just the screen in front of us. Ultimately, we are social animals.\"\n\nNormalcy has never been more contentious than now in Sweden. Almost alone in the Western world, the Swedes\n\nrefused to impose a coronavirus lockdown in the spring\n\n, as the country's leading health officials argued that limited restrictions were sufficient and would better protect against economic collapse.\n\nIt was an approach that transformed Sweden into an unlikely ideological lightning rod. Many scientists blamed it for a spike in deaths, even as many libertarians critical of lockdowns portrayed Sweden as a model.\n\nDuring a recent Senate hearing in Washington, Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading US infectious disease specialist, and Senator Rand Paul, R-Ky., angrily clashed over Sweden.\n\nFor their part, the Swedes admit to making some mistakes, particularly in nursing homes, where the death toll was staggering. Indeed, comparative analyses show that Sweden's death rate at the height of the pandemic in the spring far surpassed the rates in neighbouring countries and was more protracted. (Others point out that Sweden's overall death rate is comparable to that of the United States.)\n\nNow, though, the question is whether the country's current low caseload, compared with sharp increases elsewhere, shows that it has found a sustainable balance, something that all Western countries are seeking eight months into the pandemic - or whether the recent numbers are just a temporary aberration.\n\n\"It looks positive,\" said Anders Tegnell, Sweden's state epidemiologist, who gained global fame and notoriety for having kept Sweden out of lockdown in March.\n\nWith a population of 10.1 million, Sweden averaged a little more than 200 new cases a day for several weeks, although in recent days that number has jumped to about 380. The per capita rate is far lower than nearby Denmark or the Netherlands (if higher than the negligible rates in Norway and Finland).\n\nSweden is also doing far better, for the moment, than Spain, with 10,000 cases a day, and France, with 12,000.\n\nCritics say Sweden does not test for the virus as thoroughly as many other nations - with 142,000 tests for the week ending Sept 13.\n\nBritain, with about six times the population, tested only 587,000 people in the most recent week, far fewer per capita than Sweden. And Britain conducted far more tests than France, Germany or Spain in that period.\n\nIn early September, 1.2 per cent of tests in Sweden were positive, compared with about 7% currently in Northwest England, Britain's hardest-hit area.\n\nIn response to the recent outbreaks, many European countries are imposing new restrictions. But political leaders, anxious to avoid unpopular and economically disastrous lockdowns, are relying mostly on social-distancing measures, while trying to preserve a degree of normalcy, with schools, shops, restaurants and even bars open.\n\nIn essence, some experts say, they are quietly adopting the Swedish approach.\n\n\"Today, all of the European countries are more or less following the Swedish model, combined with the testing, tracing and quarantine procedures the Germans have introduced, but none will admit it,\" said Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health, in Geneva.\n\n\"Instead, they made a caricature out of the Swedish strategy. Almost everyone has called it inhumane and a failure.\"\n\nBack in the spring, when other nations were clamping down, Sweden was often vilified for having gone its own way. Its borders stayed open, as did bars, restaurants and schools. Hairdressers, yoga studios, gyms and even some cinemas remained open, as did public transportation and parks.\n\nGatherings of more than 50 people were banned, museums closed and sporting events cancelled. But that was the extent of the measures, with officials saying they would trust in the good sense of Swedes to keep their distance and wash their hands.\n\nFlahault lauded Sweden's government for that part of its approach.\n\n\"The Swedes went into self-lockdown,\" he said. \"They trusted in their people to self-apply social distancing measures without punishing them.\"\n\nBut Flahault also warned about what he called a major flaw in the Swedish approach.\n\n\"They continue not to wear masks,\" he said. \"That can be a big drawback in the Swedish strategy if masks prove effective and key in fighting the pandemic.\"\n\nSweden might also just be enjoying a lull between peaks of infection. The public face of the country's coronavirus policies, Tegnell, agrees, saying the numbers can always go up, as they just have.\n\nThat said, however, \"Sweden has gone from being one of the countries in Europe with the most spread to one that has some of the fewest cases in Europe,\" he said in a recent interview.\n\nSome experts believe that Sweden is now almost fully in control of the virus.\n\n\"There are indications that the Swedes have gained an element of immunity to the disease, which, together with everything else they are doing to prevent the infection from spreading, is enough to keep the disease down,\" Kim Sneppen, professor of biocomplexity at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, said in an interview.\n\nSee more on\n\nSweden\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/rk_stockholm_300920.jpg?VersionId=lKmqdDegd5MTLorIiNnOmHF6WUnOMggT", "alt_text": null}]}

That conclusion would imply that businesses, schools and restaurants could safely reopen, and that masks and other distancing measures could be abandoned.\n\n\"The idea that herd immunity will happen at 10 or 20 per cent is just nonsense,\" said Dr Christopher J.L. Murray, director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which produced the epidemic model frequently cited during White House news briefings as the epidemic hit hard in the spring.\n\nThat belief began circulating months ago on conservative news programs like those of Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham. It has been cited several times by Dr Scott W. Atlas, President Donald Trump's new pandemic adviser.\n\nIt appears to be behind\n\nTrump's recent remarks\n\nthat the pandemic is \"rounding the corner\" and \"would go away even without the vaccine\".\n\nBut it is also gaining credence on Wall Street and among some business executives, said prominent public health experts, who consider the idea scientifically unfounded as well as dangerous.\n\nIts most vocal adherents are calling for mask-wearing and social distancing to end just as cold weather is shifting social activity indoors, where the risk of transmission is higher.\n\nEven in places where the pandemic hit especially hard - a French aircraft carrier, the Brazilian city of Manaus, the slums of Mumbai, India, and a neighbourhood in Queens, New York - infections did not noticeably slow down until almost 60 per cent of the inhabitants were infected.\n\nAnd even those levels may not suffice, given that cases are increasing again in Brazil and in Brooklyn areas that had seen cases spike and then drop off.\n\n\"Immunity in 2020 is no closer to being just around the corner than prosperity was in 1930,\" said Dr Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"The route to immunity without a vaccine would be through graveyards filled with hundreds of thousands of Americans who did not have to die.\"\n\nIn April, in an opinion piece for The Hill that endorsed letting the virus circulate, Atlas cited the conventional wisdom that herd immunity requires that about 60% of people have antibodies. But last week he said on \"The Ingraham Angle\" that \"most of the immunity for this virus is felt to be due to T-cell immunity\" and speculated that such immunity was why children rarely became dangerously ill and why Asian countries did well against the virus.\n\n(Many reputable medical experts think that children, who suffer many colds, may be protected in that regard. But Asian countries contained the virus through early travel bans, lockdowns, masks and rigorous contact tracing.)\n\nThe calculations that 85 per cent to 90 per cent of all Americans are vulnerable come from numerous sources.\n\nOn Friday, the CDC, citing still-unreleased data from blood samples collected at commercial laboratories across the country this summer, said that less than 10 per cent of samples contained antibodies to the virus.\n\nAlso Friday, in a study published in The Lancet, Stanford University scientists examined 28,500 blood samples from dialysis centres in 46 states and found antibodies in just over 9 per cent.\n\nAnd the epidemic-modelling teams, at the request of the Times, used their models to calculate what percentage of the country is infected. The models were based not on blood sampling but on testing and death data from all 50 states.\n\nMurray's institute estimated that 29 million Americans, or 9% of the population, have had the virus. The Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health estimated the figure at 41 million, or 12.5 per cent.\n\nMichael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said his team believed it was 10 per cent to 12 per cent. The Covid-19 Projections website consulted by Resolve to Save Lives, Frieden's health advocacy initiative, calculated it at 16 per cent.\n\nEach model \"has its warts\" because they use slightly different assumptions about fatality rates and test accuracy, said Nicolas A. Menzies, a collaborator at the Harvard modeling lab. But all reach similar conclusions: Although some parts of the country were heavily infected in the spring - more than 20 per cent of residents of the New York metropolitan area are believed to be immune, for example - the average across the country is far lower.\n\nMore than 200,000 Americans have already died,\n\nand models estimate that if people return to old habits, such as gathering indoors without masks, more than 300,000 and possibly 400,000 could die before a vaccine is widely available.\n\nThe chief proponents of the idea that herd immunity is somehow close at hand are American and European medical professionals who oppose lockdowns. They contend that most people in the world are immune to the virus thanks to \"T-cell immunity\" derived from having contracted common colds that were caused by the four relatively benign coronaviruses that have circulated for years.\n\nBut this theory is unfounded. Helper T-cells are white blood cells that, once \"primed\" by an initial infection, can linger in the tissues for decades until they meet the same virus again and destroy it, by triggering the production of antibodies and by summoning other virus-killers.\n\n(Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, offered the metaphor of a Lego car. Antibodies recognize the car's outline and attach themselves, disabling it. But T-cells recognize individual Lego blocks, even internal ones. If the car is already parked inside a human airway cell, for instance, the cell can effectively wave a car part around to attract the attention of primed helper T-cells, which in turn can recruit \"killer T-cells\" to inject toxic proteins that wipe out both garage and car.)\n\nThe immunity conferred by a common cold coronavirus appears to last a year or two, immunologists say, and then a person can catch the same cold again. Antibodies against it fade away; primed T-cells remain.\n\nPrimed T-cells may lower the odds of dying from the new, dangerous coronavirus, Crotty said, but that has not been proven. There is no evidence that they protect against becoming infected with it.\n\nDuring a congressional hearing last week, Sen. Rand Paul, a former eye surgeon, engaged in a heated exchange on the topic with Dr Anthony Fauci, the country's leading infectious disease expert.\n\nThe senator argued that New York's outbreak slowed because of T-cell immunity. Fauci quickly countered: \"If you believe 22% is herd immunity, I believe you're alone in that.\" In a later interview, Fauci said that he \"knew of no scientific evidence\" that common cold-derived T-cells protect against infection with Sars-CoV-2. Furthermore, he added, any contention that the pandemic was dying out \"makes absolutely no sense at all.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/rk_us-testingcenter_300920.jpg?VersionId=8UvsFyBkgWl1XrOLqtFR_HlbHZzahrZZ", "alt_text": null}]}

Fully 10 per cent of likely voters in the Times/Siena poll didn't express a vote preference, or said they favoured a third-party candidate.\n\nWill the president or Biden be able to peel away enough of those votes to make a meaningful difference in the race?\n\nChris Wallace, the Fox News host who will moderate the debate Tuesday, has announced the six topics on which it will be focused: the Supreme Court, the coronavirus outbreak, the integrity of the election, the economy, \"race and violence in our cities\", and the respective political records of Trump and Biden.\n\nHere's a look at what polling says about where the public stands on those issues - and how the candidates may be looking to score points on each front.\n\nTHE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\nIn the wake of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent death, Trump wasted no time in choosing a successor.\n\nHe tapped Judge Amy Coney Barrett\n\n, an appeals court jurist with a staunchly conservative record - including a history of opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPolls conducted just before Barrett was announced as the nominee showed that voters\n\npreferred the winner of the November election to name Ginsburg's replacement\n\n, following the precedent set four years ago, when Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, refused to hold hearings during an election year on Judge Merrick B. Garland's nomination.\n\nFifty-six per cent of likely voters said so in the Times/Siena poll, compared with 41 per cent who said Trump should go ahead and fill the seat now.\n\nTwo NBC News/Marist College surveys in Michigan and Wisconsin released Sunday also found that a slim majority of likely voters in those swing states thought the winner of the election should be allowed to fill the seat.\n\nBut now that Barrett has been nominated, both presidential candidates have made it clear that this debate is about a lot more than Senate precedent.\n\nIn an interview that aired on Sunday, Trump declared that with Barrett on the bench, it was \"certainly possible\" that the court might overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that legalised abortion nationwide.\n\nSuch an outcome would go against the will of most Americans, who support keeping abortion legal.\n\nIn the Times/Siena poll, voters said by more than 2-to-1 that they would be less likely to back Trump if he appointed a justice who would overturn Roe. By 20 percentage points, voters said in a Kaiser Family Foundation poll this month that they trusted Biden on issues of abortion and family planning more than Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden, who himself has a mixed record on abortion rights, has put a much more urgent focus on the Affordable Care Act, a law that has grown increasingly popular during Trump's term. Americans now tend to say they support it, according to various polls.\n\nIn the Times/Siena survey, independent voters alone supported it by more than 2-to-1. And in the Kaiser poll, voters said by a 13-point margin that they preferred Biden over Trump to determine the law's future.\n\nThe administration is currently backing a lawsuit before the Supreme Court that seeks to annul the Affordable Care Act, and Biden has argued that confirming Barrett could mean the end of the law.\n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nIn making that argument, Biden has returned repeatedly to the health threats posed by the coronavirus.\n\n\"We are still in the midst of the worst global health crisis in a century, a crisis that has already taken over 200,000 lives - between 750 and 1,000 lives a day, and counting,\" Biden said on Sunday. \"And yet the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court right now, as I speak, to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nSince May, the pandemic has been a weak point politically for Trump - in part because a majority of Americans have consistently disagreed with his focus on speedily reopening, and because many voters simply don't feel they can trust him on this life-or-death matter.\n\nBy a 15-point margin, respondents to the Times/Siena poll said they disapproved of how he had responded to the virus - including 50 per cent of white voters, who generally lean toward supporting the president.\n\nAccording to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll this month, 65 per cent of Americans said they tended not to believe the information the president provided on the virus. In poll after poll, voters consistently say by double-digit margins that they think Biden would do a better job handling the pandemic.\n\nAt the debates, look for Biden to return to the virus as often as he can, hammering the president on what he sees as his greatest vulnerability.\n\nTHE ECONOMY\n\nIf there is one area in which Trump retains at least a slight advantage over Biden, it is the economy. Even as the pandemic has shuttered businesses across the country, putting millions of Americans out of work, a majority of voters have continued to express approval of how Trump handles economic matters.\n\nBy a 12-point margin, respondents to the Times/Siena poll gave him positive marks on that front. In the NPR/PBS/Marist survey, Americans favoured Trump over his opponent by 7 points on handling the economy.\n\nTo the extent that Trump can succeed in reminding voters of how things were going before March, he appears to have a strong hand. But where the economy intersects with the virus, things grow dicier.\n\nFifty-five per cent of likely voters said he was at least partly responsible for the economic downturn, according to the Times/Siena poll - a reflection of how frustrated many Americans have been by his refusal to coordinate a national response to the pandemic.\n\nForty-nine per cent said that the federal government had not done enough to support the economy amid the outbreak, while just 9 per cent said it had done too much.\n\nAnd in a sign of the country's appetite for government relief, 72 per cent of likely voters said they thought Congress should pass a new, US$2 trillion stimulus package to combat the pandemic's effects.\n\nELECTION SECURITY\n\nTrump has employed an ever-growing list of narratives to cast doubt on the electoral process - whether he is questioning the security of mail-in voting or encouraging supporters in North Carolina to vote twice, which would be a felony. He has also downplayed the threat posed by foreign countries, particularly Russia, that are seeking to interfere in the election.\n\nFifty-one per cent of Americans said in the recent NPR/PBS/Marist poll that they thought Trump was encouraging election interference, versus just 38 per cent who said he was working to make elections more safe.\n\nIn a CNN poll last month, 51 per cent of Americans disapproved of how the president had handled matters of election security, while just 40 per cent approved.\n\nStill, Trump's sowing of doubt may have had the desired effect, in at least one sense: Americans have broadly lost faith in the electoral process.\n\nIn the CNN poll, just 22 per cent of voters described themselves as very confident that all votes would be counted fairly, a 13-point drop from 2016.\n\nAt least in theory, voters continue to broadly back expanding the means of voting. Asked about whether they would support their state allowing universal access to voting by mail this fall, 73 per cent of Americans said they would, according to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll last month.\n\nTRUMP'S AND BIDEN'S RECORDS\n\nOne segment of Tuesday's debate will be devoted to the respective records of each candidate - and, presumably, both will get the opportunity to attack the other over their pasts.\n\nFor Trump, this could be the moment when close scrutiny is turned toward his decades of tax avoidance, as detailed in a recent New York Times investigation - a narrative that Biden is likely to take up in his own attacks.\n\nThose tax revelations surfaced too recently for polls to address them, but we do know that Trump has never received high marks for honesty (3 in 5 likely voters called him generally dishonest in a Quinnipiac University poll this month), and that 56 per cent of Americans told the Pew Research Centre in June they thought he had a responsibility to publicly release his tax returns.\n\nFor Biden, his 36-year career in the Senate provides ample fodder for the president to seize upon - from his support for the 1994 crime bill to his vote to authorise the Iraq War.\n\nBut Trump has seemed most intent on painting the former vice-president as a tool of the far left, an argument that runs counter to much of his Senate track record, and one that has largely proved unsuccessful in peeling away support among swing voters.\n\nFor instance, when Americans were asked by Pew this month whether they thought Biden had voiced support for defunding police departments (he hasn't), just over a quarter said yes.\n\nRACE AND CITIES\n\nTrump has pounced on the Black Lives Matter demonstrations across the country - and the conflicts that have occasionally flared up around them - in his attempts to convince voters that a vote for Biden would be dangerous.\n\nBut while public support for Black Lives Matter and the protests did plateau this summer after rising in the spring, Trump does not appear to have gained from this line of attack. When asked whom they trust more to handle crime, voters are about evenly split in most polling. In the NPR/PBS/Marist poll, 47 per cent said Biden would handle crime better, while 44 per cent chose Trump.\n\nAnd when asked in a different way in a Monmouth University poll this month, Americans delivered a decisive rebuke to the president's combative approach.\n\nSixty-one per cent said they thought Trump's handling of the protests had made the situation worse, while just 24 per cent said he had made things better.\n\nForty-five per cent of Americans said Biden would have handled the situation better, according to the poll, while just 28 per cent said he would have done worse.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/rk_dt-jb-collage_300920_0.jpg?VersionId=9947JFlDQit.0c1fuaehYwa22GJQH388", "alt_text": null}]}

Joe Biden wants to restore the soul of America.\n\nBut there is much more to discuss beyond those two slogans.\n\nThe long-anticipated\n\nfirst debate between Trump and Biden on Tuesday (Sept 29) night\n\nis expected to put a spotlight on pressing issues like the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 200,000 people in the United States, and the fight over the Supreme Court vacancy, whose outcome could affect American society for decades to come.\n\nThe debate will include six 15-minute segments on different topics selected by the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News.\n\nHere's a look at where Trump and Biden stand on those issues.\n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that his administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic was exceptional, saying he acted early to impose travel restrictions from China; worked with states to acquire equipment like ventilators; and pushed for the development of treatments and vaccines.\n\nThe record, however, reveals that the president consistently played down the threat from the virus in the early days when it could have been contained, and ignored or resisted advice from his top health officials. The United States failed to provide enough testing to know how the virus was spreading, and Trump clashed with governors over the need for protective equipment.\n\nThere is also mounting evidence of the ways in which Trump and the White House put immense political pressure on the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies to accept Trump's demands that the country reopen more quickly than they thought was safe.\n\nAnd the president's demands for a vaccine that could be announced before the election have left the public health community wary of the effectiveness and safety of a vaccine when one is ready.\n\nFor many months, Biden has put a major focus on the virus, condemning Trump's handling of the pandemic and making that a central argument as he asks voters to deny the president a second term.\n\nThat is almost certain to be a major focus of Biden's in the debate, too. He has promised a starkly different approach to combating the virus, stressing the importance of deferring to scientific experts, and he has called for a national mask mandate, which Trump does not support. He has taken care to model good behaviour in his campaign, wearing a mask himself and refraining from holding rallies.\n\nTHE ECONOMY\n\nUntil the pandemic, one of Trump's strongest arguments for reelection was the powerful performance of the economy, which had achieved low unemployment, strong growth and a soaring stock market.\n\nFollowing the virus-induced shutdowns, the economy's growth has stalled and unemployment has soared, even with some recovery in recent months. On the campaign trail, Trump promises that the economy will recover - and get even better - if he is given a second term.\n\nThe president has also promised a future tax cut for the middle class, though he has not offered specifics, and he has said he wants to reduce the capital gains tax.\n\nThough the economy has been a source of enduring strength for Trump in the polls, Biden is trying to chip away at the president's standing. He can point to Trump's handling of the pandemic to argue that the president's mismanagement has worsened Americans' economic pain. And he has portrayed Trump as fixated on the performance of the stock market and concerned only about wealthy people.\n\nThis summer, Biden rolled out his own set of economic proposals under the slogan \"Build Back Better\", including plans to invest in clean energy and to ensure that procurement spending goes toward American-made products.\n\nOne area where Biden may come under attack from Trump is tax policy. Biden is calling for tax increases on corporations and high-earning individuals, but he has said that no one earning less than US$400,000 (S$548,000) would face a tax hike.\n\nTHE SUPREME COURT\n\nThe intense push to seat Judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court before Election Day is part of the president's four-year effort to remake the federal judiciary, adding conservative-leaning judges to the bench at all levels. With the help of a Republican-controlled Senate, Trump is succeeding in that goal.\n\nThe president has already installed two other Supreme Court justices - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh - and more than 200 federal district and appeals court judges, shifting the ideological balance for years to come.\n\nBiden has pledged to nominate a black woman to the Supreme Court, though he has declined to follow Trump's lead and release a list of potential nominees. He has called for Senate Republicans to hold off on confirming a successor to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until after the election, noting that early voting is already underway.\n\nBiden has sought to tie the court vacancy to the fate of the Affordable Care Act, arguing that health coverage for millions of Americans is at stake in November's election. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments a week after Election Day in a challenge to the health law, and the Trump administration is asking the court to strike it down.\n\nRACE AND VIOLENCE IN AMERICAN CITIES\n\nThe president has seized upon unrest over racial justice as a defining difference between him and Biden, calling the protesters \"rioters\" and \"anarchists\" and overtly siding with the police in a bid to cast himself as a \"law and order\" leader.\n\nThe president and his campaign are using episodes of violence against the police to generate fear and support among his base. He has called for much more aggressive use of the National Guard to control disturbances, and has dismissed the Black Lives Matter organisation as a radical, violent group.\n\nWhen he is pressed for accomplishments, Trump cites the First Step Act, which makes some reforms to federal sentencing laws, benefiting minorities. The bipartisan bill passed in 2018 and was signed into law by Trump.\n\nTrump has attacked Biden as anti-law enforcement, often in exaggerated terms - though at times the president has also tried to cast him as overly punitive because of his work on the 1994 crime bill that encouraged incarceration.\n\nBiden has repeatedly said that he opposes defunding the police, though Republicans have still falsely claimed that he supports that movement. He has condemned violence as well.\n\nBiden has called for racial healing and pledged to confront systemic racism, a starkly different approach from Trump's. In July, Biden released a plan to address racial inequities in the economy.\n\nBiden's message ties back to the origin of his campaign and themes of American values, as he often talks about being motivated to run by Trump's comments after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nTRUMP'S AND BIDEN'S RECORDS\n\nTrump's campaign has sought to highlight his \"promises kept\" during almost four years in the White House, telling voters that he has done what he said he would do as a candidate in 2016.\n\nAt his campaign rallies, the president focuses on trade, including his renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and imposition of tariffs on China and other countries. He boasts about his 2017 tax cuts and the growth in jobs before the coronavirus pandemic. He cites increases in military funding, his elimination of environmental regulations, peace agreements in the Middle East and actions to shut down immigration.\n\nMany of the president's promises fell short, a point that Biden may highlight. Despite saying he would build a \"big, beautiful wall\" across the entire border with Mexico, the president has built only about 200 miles of wall, most of it replacements for existing barriers. He failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and he has not controlled federal spending.\n\nIn addition to Trump's record in the White House, another issue likely to come up is his taxes. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, and The New York Times reported on Sunday that he paid only US$750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and in 2017.\n\nBiden spent 36 years as a senator and eight years as vice president, so he has a voluminous record - giving him achievements to brag about, but also leaving him vulnerable over other aspects of his lengthy career.\n\nBiden can point to accomplishments like the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, as well as the enactment of the Affordable Care Act and his work on the implementation of the 2009 stimulus package.\n\nTrump has portrayed Biden's record in a very different light, and Biden has faced criticism over a number of votes during the 2020 campaign, including his support for the Iraq War, the 1994 crime bill and NAFTA.\n\nTHE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTION\n\nTrump has spent much of the last year overtly questioning the integrity of the coming election, laying the groundwork for a legal and public relations assault if the initial count shows that he has lost the race. The president's primary focus in the past several months has been on mail-in ballots, which he claims - without any evidence - are subject to widespread fraud and should not be allowed.\n\nBiden has warned that Trump is seeking to undermine the legitimacy of the election. \"This president is going to try to indirectly steal the election by arguing that mail-in ballots don't work,\" he said in July.\n\nBiden has also warned about possible foreign interference, vowing that as president, he would impose significant consequences for any meddling by foreign powers. Last week, he called Trump's refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power a \"typical Trump distraction\".\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_jpdt_300920.jpg?VersionId=QXbZOPbB9J30QXnjzmt3VXnQfjhuWrQZ", "alt_text": null}]}

Disney's California locations remain closed because of state restrictions, while the Florida parks have been operating with limited capacity and weaker attendance than Disney anticipated. It's clear that for families weighing the risks of travel and crowds over the reward of getting out of the house, the virus won out.\n\nWhile Disney has pointed a finger at California Governor Gavin Newsom, upticks in the virus in pockets of the country may keep many consumers fearful of venturing to crowded venues anyway. Of the 500 millennials recently surveyed by Morning Consult, only 26 per cent said they feel comfortable going to an amusement park. The same was true of only 16 per cent of baby boomers. As far as when they would consider a visit, 42 per cent of the US adults polled said it would be more than six months from now. The movie-theater industry has encountered a similar setback: Doors opened, the hit film \"Tenet\" was showing, and few people showed up. As I wrote then, people won't necessarily resume their normal activities just because they can.\n\nIn fairness to Disney, visitors and journalists who have gone to the reopened Disney World in Orlando say the safety protocols - and adherence to them - are downright impressive. Still, consumers are understandably apprehensive, even if it's just about traveling there. That there is a recession and high unemployment also doesn't help when Disney is counting on people spending more than US$100 per person (S$136.80) per day just to enter one of its parks. Neither does the lack of federal relief. Last year, Disney's business unit comprising theme parks, cruises and consumer products accounted for 37 per cent of total company revenue - more than its television networks or film business (though both ultimately fuel the global fascination with the Disney brand). It furloughed 100,000 theme-park and resort workers in April, holding out hope that the recovery would be quick and strong enough to bring them back.\n\nDisney CEO Bob Chapek ran the theme parks before he took over Disney's top job in February. That was just before the pandemic took hold. He replaced Bob Iger, who retired after 15 years at the helm. Mr Chapek's experience is especially fitting for this moment, but it's also a bit incongruous with the direction the company was heading even before Covid: a future dominated by streaming-video entertainment. It hasn't changed course because of the virus. In fact, Disney has pushed deeper into streaming in recent weeks, having its highly anticipated live-action remake of \"Mulan\" skip theaters to premiere directly on the Disney+ app for a US$30 viewing fee.\n\n\"Normal\" is starting to fade from the vocabulary, and we must let it go. But the question is, if theme parks and movie theaters don't rebound, or at least not for some time, will Disney even be the same company anymore?\n\nTara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

Of these, 15 were found to have breached safe management measures.\n\nAgencies are reviewing the breaches and the appropriate enforcement action to be taken, including temporary closure of the outlets and issuing fines.\u200b\n\nDespite some diners not masking up, a Restaurant Association of Singapore spokesman said most customers wear masks in restaurants and remove them only when food and drinks are served.\n\nMost of those who forget to put on their masks after meals will comply when reminded.\n\nBut as \"servers are often busy making sure orders are taken and meals are served on time, there may be gaps in time between checks and reminding diners to wear their masks after they complete their meals\", he said.\n\nFor entrepreneur Chen Jiaxin, 29, it is not uncommon to see diners talking to one another without masks on after finishing their meals.\n\n\"I think people are starting to get complacent now that community cases are low,\" she said.\n\n\"While we should not let our guard down, I can see why people (don't mask up right) after their meal because of the discomfort of talking with a mask on.\"\n\n8 more F&B outlets ordered to close\n\n1. Brewerkz at Riverside Point was ordered to close after officers saw a group of eight diners mingling across two tables on Sept 12. It will stay closed for 10 days from last Friday to Oct 4.\n\n2. Siam Square Mookata in Punggol Point Road was told to shut its doors after patrons at two tables were seen consuming alcohol on Sept 16, at 10.45pm. It closed from Sept 19 until Monday.\n\n3. The operator of a drink stall in the outdoor refreshment area in New Upper Changi Road was ordered to close from Sept 19 until Monday. Individuals at four tables were seen consuming alcohol at 10.50pm.\n\n4. Korean casual dining restaurant Ggang Tong in Tanjong Pagar Road was ordered to close last Friday until Oct 4. This comes after the restaurant admitted 12 diners who were seated across two tables. The patrons sat in groups of six, mingled and shared food across tables.\n\n5. On Sept 18, the Chicken Up outlet in Tanjong Pagar was found to have admitted 10 patrons who sat across two tables and intermingled. The outlet will be closed for 10 days until Oct 5.\n\n6. Another drink stall, at Block 26 Jalan Membina, was ordered to close until Friday, after a patron consumed alcohol on Sept 19, at 11.20pm.\n\n7. The Jamboree Bar & Cafe at Orchard Towers will stay shut from last Saturday to Oct 5. Last Friday, individuals intermingled with different groups of diners who were seated across different tables.\n\n8. Groups of individuals were seen queueing at the entrance of Cafe de Muse at Shaw House last Friday without keeping a safe distance of 1m. The cafe will stay closed until Oct 5, after it was observed that temperature screening for diners was not in place and seats were placed less than 1m apart.\n\nJessie Lim\n\nLISTEN TO GREEN PULSE PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of Sustainability and the Environment\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/rk_siamcollage_290920.jpg?VersionId=1OMh1Pacw_QoEBACVsADe8CFUUGbDYOO", "alt_text": null}]}

That includes executives and salaried employees, although 67 per cent of those being terminated are part-time workers. Disney is offering benefits to the workers, including 90 days of job-placement services.\n\nThe cutbacks jarred investors, who sent the shares down almost 2 per cent in late trading on Tuesday. The stock was already down 13 per cent this year.\n\nIt's the latest sign that travel and other experiences will be slow to recover from the pandemic. Disney joins airlines and other travel-reliant businesses in scaling back their workforces. American Airlines Group has\n\nwarned that it could furlough 19,000 employees\n\n, while United Airlines Holdings is planning to cut about 12,000.\n\nDisney's move also spotlights its troubles with California,\n\nwhich has been slower than other areas\n\nto lift restrictions on theme parks.\n\nThe company's domestic parks employed more than 100,000 before the pandemic, but that doesn't include the cruise lines and other divisions. Its workforce totaled 223,000 at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended in September 2019.\n\n\"As heartbreaking as it is to take this action, this is the only feasible option we have in light of the prolonged impact of Covid-19 on our business,\" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of the parks division, said in a memo to workers.\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis closed Disney parks around the world. Although the resorts in other areas have reopened -\n\nincluding Florida, in July\n\n- Disney still hasn't received clearance to restart operations at its two theme parks in Anaheim, California.\n\nMr D'Amaro said Disney had tried to hold out as long as possible before making the cuts permanent, but after seven months with some attractions still closed, Disney couldn't wait any longer.\n\nLOWER CAPACITY\n\nEven those that have reopened, such as the four theme parks in Florida, are operating at much lower capacity due to social-distancing requirements. The number of visitors, particularly those who arrive via air travel, has been disappointing, the company has said.\n\nDisney also has been adopting more technology in response to the pandemic, allowing guests to get around the parks with fewer human interactions. The changes include online restaurant menus and mobile-pay systems. Some of those new approaches require fewer employees.\n\n\"We've cut expenses, suspended capital projects, furloughed our cast members while still paying benefits, and modified our operations to run as efficiently as possible,\" D'Amaro said. \"However, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while operating at such limited capacity.\"\n\nThe situation has been exacerbated in California by the state's unwillingness to lift its restrictions, Mr D'Amaro said.\n\nNineteen California legislators sent Governor Gavin Newsom a letter on Monday urging him to reopen the state's theme park industry.\n\n\"Your administration has been rightfully reliant on data and science and, to date, the data and science do not point to theme parks as sources of transmission,\" they wrote.\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nTheme parks\n\nJob cuts", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/us-downtown-disney-district-in-anaheim-begins-gradual-reopening-200053.jpg?VersionId=yJQdRLtK0kdgUtam1vb8pHbY9vzSPAJg", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_disneylandd_300942.jpg?VersionId=dLbiDrlxdUHPn.IJka1wDqqQAdCrF_xs", "alt_text": null}]}

In a handicapped toilet on the fourth floor, he began touching her under her shirt. The court heard that the girl told him to stop and he withdrew his hands, but soon started licking her.\n\nThe ordeal lasted 15 minutes and the girl felt \"shocked and disgusted\" but did not shout for help because she was afraid of what Lim would do. Afterwards, she took a bus home, showered and told her mother. They made a police report the next day.\n\nUpskirt videos of two women were later found on Lim's phone. He had taken them at Bukit Panjang MRT station on Jan 8 and 11, 2018.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Joshua Phang noted that Lim had committed \"three serious offences of a sexual nature\".\n\nLim's lawyer Richard Lim argued that his client had met the girl at a cosplay event, and seeing as this entailed role-playing characters in costume, his client did not believe his acts were sexual in nature. He said Lim was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health in June last year for adjustment disorder and has been seeing psychiatrists regularly.\n\nDistrict Judge Sripathy noted that Lim showed \"an escalation of sexual (offences) over a period of more than one year\".\n\nLim's case is scheduled to be heard next on Nov 10.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts\n\nSingapore crime\n\nChildren and youth", "images": []}

The Covid-19 pandemic has shown that the workforce's adoption of technology can be sped up if there is a strong enough impetus, noted the minister.\n\nPrioritising workplace safety and health, including the fight against virus transmission, is also of growing importance and an area of consensus, she said.\n\nLastly, tripartite collaboration in designing practical solutions to address emerging challenges is ever more critical amid a continuing economic crisis.\n\n\"Whether it is creating new jobs and training opportunities, implementing cost-cutting measures or managing excess manpower, governments, employers' and workers' organisations must work together to ensure that businesses and workers can continue to thrive during this pandemic and beyond, especially those in lower-end and more precarious jobs,\" said Mrs Teo.\n\nShe said the centre's first initiative is the Asean Future of Work conference track, part of the HR Tech Festival Asia event.\n\nNEW CENTRE'S AREAS OF FOCUS\n\n1\n\nEmbracing technology for inclusive growth.

The proxy can also vote on an owner's behalf on the election of members of the collective sale committee.\n\nMr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty, said the changes will be positive for the collective sale process.\n\nThere have been instances where those with strong motivation to vote one way or the other at such meetings persuade their fellow strata title owners to give them their proxy votes, he said.\n\nThese parties could gather significant numbers of proxy votes and influence the sale process in a way that may run counter to the proxy givers' wishes, he added.\n\nSeparately, MinLaw said that real-time electronic voting will be an option for some meetings such as general meetings of companies, charities and registered societies amid the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThis option kicks in from tomorrow and will also apply for insolvency-and bankruptcy-related meetings.\n\nWhile voting electronically is already prescribed for governing board meetings for some organisations, the ministry said doing so in real time is not yet provided for as an alternative arrangement for most meetings.\n\nMinLaw said this option can be exercised as long as certain prescribed safeguards are adopted and the entity still allows attendees to vote by appointing the chairman or convenor as their proxy to vote.\n\nLim Min Zhang\n\nMore information on alternative arrangements for meetings and who to contact for inquiries can be found at\n\nhttps://go.gov.sg/alternativemeetings\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nLaw and legislation", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/af_electronic-voting_290920.jpg?VersionId=SX3aByV8xVo42OU34SDL7Fr6ZwTPwWt4", "alt_text": null}]}

In 2018, he co-founded food business Beef Bro, which has three outlets.\n\nThe court heard that the woman was a primary school classmate of Tan's sister, and the two had met friends for drinks on Christmas Day evening in 2016. When the two women arrived at Tan's flat at about 5.40am, he was in his room with two friends after a night of drinking.\n\nAfter helping the alleged victim to the toilet, Tan's sister asked him to leave his room so she could speak to one of his friends. According to the prosecutors, Tan carried the woman out of the toilet and placed her on the living room sofa but she went back to the toilet to vomit.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Ng Yiwen said Tan then carried the woman to his sister's room, put her on the bed, touched her breast and inserted his finger into her. The woman ran back to the toilet to throw up again, and felt someone pull down her shorts and underwear. She recognised Tan's voice and struggled, but he sodomised her and then left, said the DPP. Tan's sister went to the toilet later and took the woman back to her room.\n\nThe woman told her friends about the incident after that and her suspicions that Tan had sexually assaulted her. She texted Tan's sister, who said he admitted having \"fingered\" the alleged victim.

Over two years, Ms Tan, a clerk in her 50s, was not only cheated of $80,000 by her online \"lover\", but she had also been manipulated into being a money mule.\n\nShe first met the man on Facebook in mid-2018. He claimed to be a 59-year-old American-Chinese businessman working for \"Keppel\" and doing so overseas.\n\nHe proceeded to spin tales, claiming, among other things, that his money had been \"taken by the CIA\", and that he and his staff were \"trapped at Customs and needed money to get out\". He also sent images of \"himself\" in hospital, feigning serious medical emergencies.\n\n\"I started falling in love with him. I also took pity on him and wanted to help,\" she said.\n\nThis ruse went on until October last year, during which Ms Tan transferred $80,000 of her savings to him over multiple transactions.\n\nBut it was not over. The man asked her in May this year to allow him to use her account to purchase bitcoin credits. He made three transfers of $5,000 to her account between May and June, telling her to keep $500 each time she bought bitcoin credits on his behalf.\n\n\"Every transaction, I kept $500 for my own usage. As he owed me so much money, I thought it is only right for me to keep $1,500 for myself,\" Ms Tan said.\n\nThe police stepped in after they detected the suspicious transfers. It later came to light that she had not only been the victim of an Internet love scam, but was also being made use of to launder illegal monies.\n\nMs Tan was one of 2,500 people investigated between January and August this year for acting as money mules. Investigations into her case have concluded, and she has been issued an advisory.\n\nDeputy Superintendent Jane Lim of the Commercial Affairs Department said: \"When scammers forge relationships with their targets and build trust over time, it becomes easy to get someone to give up their bank information or transfer funds.\"\n\nThe police in separate statements cited two cases involving money mules. \"Nelson\", a 26-year-old Singaporean man, was sentenced to 10 months in jail for using his bank account to receive $36,400 between March and April 2017 via 27 bank transfers and cash deposits. He became a money mule after procuring sexual services from an unknown woman on online classifieds website Locanto and subsequently made multiple cash transfers on behalf of a man said to be her \"boss\". He converted $34,489.25 into Alipay credits for this \"boss\" over 63 transactions. Nelson then kept the balance for his personal use.\n\nLast Friday, hotel cleaner Noorhudah Sa'ad, 47, was sentenced to 22 months and three weeks' jail over money laundering offences.\n\nShe had been acting as a money mule for her online lover \"Lucky Mentus\" and a friend known to her as \"Lynn\", by withdrawing the funds received to hand to contacts in Singapore or Malaysia.\n\nAbout $187,560, derived from various business e-mail scams and Internet love scams, was laundered in this way from December 2015 to September 2016.\n\nDSP Lim cautioned against agreeing to receive or transfer any money on behalf of others, especially if the sources of the funds are unknown. \"Never share your one-time PIN, or allow anyone to use your bank account, e-wallet, or cryptocurrency account, as you are responsible for all the transactions made through your accounts.\"\n\nFor acting as a money mule to help a criminal retain benefits from illicit activities, one can be fined up to $500,000, jailed for up to 10 years, or both.\n\nSee more on\n\nPolice\n\nScams\n\nMoney laundering", "images": []}

If we miss cases, we will have more outbreaks.\"\n\nThe NCID will continue to look for test kits that are fast and accurate, he added.\n\nMore than 120 Covid-19 diagnostic test kits have received provisional authorisation from the Health Sciences Authority, ranging from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kits to antigen and serology ones.\n\nAll three work differently.\n\nPCR tests look for fragments of the virus' genetic material in a patient sample and are considered the \"gold standard\" test for Covid-19.\n\nBut the entire process - from swabbing a patient to sending the sample to a laboratory and the PCR process itself - can take up to a day.\n\nIt can also be costly, and requires trained personnel and specialised equipment to administer.\n\nAntigen test kits, on the other hand, are point-of-care tests that look for proteins on the virus surface and can yield quick results, usually within minutes.\n\nSerology tests, which detect the presence of antibodies, are mainly used to tell if a person has been infected in the past, and not to diagnose patients.\n\nHowever, experts have noted that because rapid diagnostic tests are cheaper and less invasive than PCR tests, their prudent and repeated deployment could supplement national measures to control Covid-19.\n\nLISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus\n\nPublic health and hygiene", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_rapidtest_300949.jpg?VersionId=nKaIZ1IgUhegzmxtXlqODG9yjzBKEhFQ", "alt_text": null}]}

He is accused of committing the offences in the early hours of May 19, 2018.\n\nThe married father of three admitted he had fondled the victim, inserted his finger into her and tried to have sex with her in his Kia Carens but claimed she participated in some acts, the High Court heard.\n\nProsecutors said Tan's likely defence is that he believed that the woman consented to the acts.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Chew Xin Ying contended that the woman was clearly intoxicated and Tan must have known that she was not capable of giving consent.\n\nThe court heard that a male friend of the woman had booked a Grab car to pick her up from a bar at Seletar Aerospace Park and take her home to a condominium at Jalan Loyang Besar. The friend told Tan that the woman was drunk.\n\nAfter the woman boarded Tan's car, she lay down in the back seat and started crying. During the ride, Tan tried to engage her in conversation but she did not respond.\n\nAt her destination, the woman could not enter the condominium despite tapping her pouch against the card reader at the side gate. She began crying and Tan took her back to his car. According to him, she became agitated and banged her head against the window, so he went to the back seat to console her.\n\nHe tried to have sex with her but could not perform sexually, the court heard. He then drove to a more secluded area, got into the back seat again and fondled her, but she pushed him away. After some time, she regained some of her senses, and Tan helped her to get into the condominium. But, instead of going home, she went to a toilet near the pool, left her things there and walked out of the condo.\n\nShe was later found lying on the the road by another private-hire driver who called the police.\n\nSee more on\n\nSex offences\n\nRape\n\nSingapore courts", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/ST_20200930_SEGRABRTLA_5997570.jpg?VersionId=4c2qTmX2RWlKBgwZSHJTOnur8D.AHtI5", "alt_text": "Tan Yew Sin is also charged with sexual assault by penetration and outrage of modesty.

These can include redesigning the customer journey from check-in to landing, for instance, incorporating the wearing of personal protective equipment.\n\nMore immediately, airlines must ensure the ease of refund and the quality of their interactions with customers to retain loyalty, said Mr Chen.\n\nHe added: \"This is especially important because the dynamics keep changing. Passengers will remember good service during this confusing period and will choose the airline again when recovery comes.\"\n\nWhen the land and air sectors were compared, people gave Changi Airport the highest rating at 8.08 points on a scale of 10 when it came to perception of efforts to keep people safe from Covid-19.\n\nTrain operators got the lowest rating, at 7.06 points.\n\nMs Neeta Lachmandas, executive director of the Institute of Service Excellence, said: \"This is not surprising. The airports are emptier because of the lack of tourists, while the trains are more crowded after the circuit breaker restrictions were lifted.\"\n\nShe added: \"When we enter very crowded indoor spaces, we all have a voice in the back of our heads that goes, 'I hope it's safe and I don't catch something'.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nPublic transport\n\nLimited-time offer\n\nGet a FREE Xiaomi vacuum cleaner (worth $109) with your subscription!\n\nBilled at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Singapore saw some of the pilots taking significant pay cuts in exchange for the company committing not to retrench any more pilots until 2022.\n\n\"The ability to reach this successful agreement shows that tripartite trust remains unshaken despite the very challenging conditions that all parties have had to face this year,\" Mr Kam said.\n\nSee more on\n\nEmployment\n\nAsean\n\nCovid-19\n\nJosephine Teo", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/nz_nwc_300924.jpg?VersionId=vgx0ESTzCVc_6P_PfZVn23cCSEXW6XzC", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign -

Previously, this process could take four to eight hours, said Senior Minister of State for Transport and Foreign Affairs Chee Hong Tat, who attended the exercise.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the exercise, he said: \"That is a good first response, to allow MPA, when they arrive on site, to be able to contain the oil spill before further reinforcements are called upon.\"\n\nThe exercise involved around 100 people from the MPA, the Police Coast Guard, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and private companies including ExxonMobil Asia Pacific, Oil Spill Response and Singapore Salvage Engineers.\n\nSome 15 vessels were involved in the exercise, including four next-generation patrol craft, and the SCDF's Marine Rescue Vessel and Rapid Response Fire Vessel, which put up a water curtain to prevent \"fires\" from erupting, and to disperse toxic fumes.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It also said it will not be launching\n\nflights to nowhere.\n\nThe Straits Times had reported on Sept 11 that SIA was looking into launching such flights that would depart and land at Changi Airport.\n\nBut the idea was criticised by environmentalists who said it would cause unnecessary pollution.\n\nA movement to suggest alternatives quickly gained traction, with more than 2,000 ideas collated and submitted to SIA earlier this month.\n\nSIA said it decided on its new offerings based on a market study and comprehensive review. \"(SIA) considered factors such as the attractiveness of the initiatives to SIA's customers and members of the public, the environmental implications, and their financial viability,\" it said.\n\n\"An idea for a one-off short tour flight, or a 'flight to nowhere', was also initially considered but not pursued after the review.\"\n\nIts chief executive Goh Choon Phong said the initiatives will let SIA engage customers even as most flights remain grounded.\n\nHe also thanked those who gave feedback to SIA about its customer engagement initiatives.\n\n\"We are very encouraged by and grateful for the enthusiasm and passion that we have seen,\" he said.\n\nSenior lecturer Boey Yew Tung of Nanyang Technological University's Nanyang Business School said the new initiatives will bolster SIA's standing. \"Reinforcing brand awareness and recall are important tactics for companies, especially when they cannot actively present themselves to the public when their regular mode of operations is severely curtailed,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the training centre tours will likely be especially popular, based on observations from air shows and other open-house tours.\n\nAssociate Professor Nitin Pangarkar from the National University of Singapore Business School said none of the initiatives will significantly offset SIA's losses.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Chevon Low, 30, a member of environmental non-profit organisation PM Haze, said she was very happy to hear of SIA's decision not to launch flights to nowhere. She and three others had canvassed suggestions, many of which were similar to the ones SIA is now launching.\n\nShe added: \"SIA did make sustainability goals before the flights-to-nowhere proposal, so it's great to see they are committing to them.\n\n\"I would love to go for any of the experiences offered and we are sure they'll be very well received.\"\n\nAviation enthusiast and engineer Gavin Ang, 25, welcomed SIA's decision to open its training centre.\n\n\"We should do more to stop pollution - but there is much more we can do than stop a few flights to nowhere. I thought such flights were a great opportunity to fly the aircraft, to generate income and minimise job losses,\" he said.\n\nSingapore Management University transport analyst Terence Fan said flights to nowhere would have given pilots much needed practice in handling planes.\n\nBut he welcomed SIA's new initiatives, even as he noted that they could have been introduced a few months earlier to try to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.\n\nHe added that SIA could do more in incentivising customers to book tickets by offering discounts for future trips. \"I think if people are willing to book ahead, they ought to be rewarded a bit more.\"\n\nExperiencing SIA's services on the ground\n\nSingapore Airlines will be launching three new initiatives in the coming weeks which will allow customers to experience its services on the ground.\n\nBookings can be made on the KrisShop website.\n\nThe cost of each option will be announced at a later date.

Everyone wants to put the emphasis on my body. I think it is disgraceful... I was going swimming - do you mean I can't wear a bikini to go swimming?\"\n\nAsked if the reports had changed her dog-walking attire in any way, she replied: \"Is there a problem with the clothes I wear? Why should I pay attention to what I wear?\"\n\nNo stranger to the limelight, Chen started out as a child star at age six, singing and dancing on Australian national television.\n\nAs a child, she also performed the role of young Nala in The Lion King stage musical in Melbourne, and appeared as a child model for the Australian version of television game show The Price Is Right.\n\nAfter moving to Taiwan, she competed in Taiwanese singing competition One Million Star. In 2012, she released her self-titled debut album, with the effervescent track Love You becoming a runaway hit.\n\nWith another two albums - Kimbonomics (2013) and #Tag Me (2017) - under her belt, Chen joined record label ChynaHouse Digital earlier this year, and has since released the singles 9 Million and 4am Calls. These deal with more mature subjects than her previous work.\n\nFor example, the spunky R&B track 4am Calls is about staying away from men who toy with women's emotions.\n\nIn the music video, Chen plays an employee in a diner when one such man, played by her real-life boyfriend, Taiwan-born singer Albert Lin, enters.\n\nChen believes everyone will see the humour in casting Lin in the role. After all, their relationship is \"very good\", she said.\n\nHowever, she has had experiences with \"rubbish men\".\n\nFor example, she once fancied a man who was not serious about relationships. \"I stopped liking him because I saw through him,\" she revealed, adding that this experience inspired the song.\n\nIn the groovy number 9 Million, Chen sings about doing what she wants and having nine million dollars in her bank account.\n\nWhen asked if this amount was in US dollars or New Taiwan dollars, she laughed and replied good-naturedly: \"Both, both.\" She said she used the figure nine because she felt it was a \"nice\" number.\n\nChen's future plans include releasing an album around the end of the year. It will include a variety of musical styles, such as ballads.\n\nGiven her background as a child star, who grew up in the public eye, might there be different expectations of her, compared with other celebrities?\n\n\"I do not really know what expectations audiences have of me. I only know what expectations I have for myself,\" she replied.\n\n\"I think the fans who really support me - the very loyal fans - they will want me to be truly myself and not pretend.\"\n\n\u2022 9 Million and 4am Calls are available on online music platforms such as KKBox, Spotify and Apple Music.

This goes down to 30 per cent in the second year. This will cost the Government $360 million.\n\nThis is on top of the existing subsidies of 15 per cent to 50 per cent given to middle-and lower-income groups, and 40 per cent to 60 per cent for the Pioneer Generation.\n\nThe\n\nMerdeka Generation receives additional age-based subsidies\n\nof 5 per cent to 10 per cent.\n\nIn all, subsidies for the next three years will amount to $2.2 billion.\n\nThe proposal will allow for wider benefits, including:\n\n\u2022 Higher coverage for sub-acute care at community hospitals - such as for someone recovering from a heart attack - as this is 20 per cent more expensive than normal rehabilitative care.\n\n\u2022 Higher annual claim limit of $150,000, from the current $100,000.\n\n\u2022 Higher claim limits for some charges, such as for intensive care, which will be raised from $1,200 a day to $2,200 a day, dialysis and psychiatric care\n\n.\u2022 An additional $200 a day claim for daily ward charges for the first two days of hospitalisation, when most tests and investigations are done.\n\n\u2022 MediShield Life will in future also cover treatment for attempted suicide, self-injury, substance abuse and alcoholism.\n\n\u2022 Lower deductible of $2,000 (down from $3,000) for people 80 years and older for day surgery. This brings it in line with their deductible amount in a C-class ward, so patients will not need to be hospitalised just to qualify for insurance cover.\n\nHowever, the cap on claims for people treated at private hospitals will be reduced from 35 per cent of the bill to 25 per cent.\n\nBased on recent bills, 35 per cent of private hospital care amounts to far higher sums than bills incurred by subsidised patients.\n\nThe new claim limits should bring MediShield Life back in line with its original mandate to cover 90 per cent of subsidised bills beyond the initial deductible.\n\nIt was revealed last year that only 80 per cent of subsidised bills were fully covered.\n\nThese changes are expected to get rolling some time in the first quarter of next year.\n\nMediShield Life Council chairman Fang Ai Lian said: \"We have to periodically review and update the scheme benefits and premiums to keep pace with evolving medical practice, healthcare cost inflation and actual claims experience, so that it continues to provide assurance for Singaporeans, while remaining sustainable.\"\n\nFrom now, reviews will be carried out every three years.\n\nDr Tan Wu Meng, head of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, supports the changes, although he said some of the premium increases are \"significant\".\n\nHe told The Straits Times: \"The revised policy year claim limit and the ICU claim limits are consistent with supporting Singaporeans through catastrophic illness.\"\n\nAs for the removal of some exclusions, he said: \"This would also be a key statement about inclusivity and the tone we want in our society.\"\n\nLISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nMediShield Life\n\nMinistry of Health\n\nGan Kim Yong\n\nInsurance", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/eb_medishield_290920.jpg?VersionId=hXmT8tz8lNN6W4ljBN5.mhEjM4qClWZk", "alt_text": null}]}

Inspectors were unable to evaluate this as restaurants were closed for about 11 weeks, and dining in was not allowed until June 19.\n\n\"Although we've been impressed to observe how the chefs and their teams were able to re-invent their activity and to develop takeaways or delivery concepts, our policy is to evaluate dining-in experiences,\" said the statement.\n\nOther judging criteria include quality of the products, mastery of flavour and cooking techniques, and the personality of the chef in his or her cuisine.\n\nIt added: \"Under no circumstances will there be any question of sanctioning an establishment in this particular economic and health climate and we will do everything possible in terms of human and technological engagement to highlight the dynamism of international culinary scenes, as we have been doing for over 120 years.\"\n\nOnce its inspectors have conducted sufficient checks on the restaurants, the guide will announce \"in the upcoming months\" its 2021 selection.\n\nSingapore's Michelin Guide started in 2016 and has been an annual affair featuring a gala dinner and award ceremony.\n\nLast year's event, held at Capella Singapore, saw 44 eateries bagging Michelin stars. French fine-dining restaurants Odette and Les Amis received the maximum of three Michelin stars each - \"for exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey\".\n\nNot all editions of the Michelin Guide have been cancelled.

Temasek-backed fund Big Idea Ventures, which was a seed investor, did not take part in the latest round.\n\nStart-ups and food giants around the world are racing to invent and improve alternatives to traditional meat production as consumers become more careful about nutrition and the environment.\n\nWhile fake-meat companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat are raising the lion's share of funding as they expand into new markets, other start-ups are working on lab-grown alternatives for a potential pool of customers that want to eat real meat and seafood that does not come from living animals.\n\nShiok Meats has raised US$20.2 million in total funding, and a person familiar with the fund raising said its post-money valuation is about US$50 million.\n\nIt takes the stem cells from shrimp before multiplying them in a \"culture media\", a solution filled with nutrients. It is an expensive product used to make things like vaccines and is primarily sold by pharmaceutical and chemical companies. It is also a key reason why Shiok's prawn meat now costs US$3,500 per kilogram.\n\nThe start-up is researching alternative and cheaper plant-based ingredients with the goal of bringing the cost down to US$50 per kilogram in 2022, when its products will be sold to businesses like restaurants.\n\nChallenges remain: Without finalising the recipe, it cannot lock down the exact ingredient suppliers. And the process of acquiring bioreactors, the vessels in which the shrimp meat will grow, will take a year.\n\n\"We can see so many new players coming up,\" Dr Sriram said of the cell-based meat sector. \"The next five years will be about who survives, who makes the cut and who is able to support companies like ours make that step over to large-scale manufacturing.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nStart-ups\n\nInvestment", "images": []}

This costs $2,470 in a B2 subsidised ward and $10,314 in a private hospital, according to the Ministry of Health.\n\nA 35 per cent MediShield Life claim for the private hospital bill comes to $3,610 - which is $1,140 more than the B2 bill.\n\nAt 25 per cent, MediShield covers only $2,579 of the private hospital bill, which makes it just slightly higher than the B2 bill.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Most IP insurers continue to make a net loss since the launch of MediShield Life in November 2015.\"\n\nIt added that its priority is to ensure that Singaporeans \"continue to have access to affordable quality healthcare with the additional coverage provided by IPs\" and at the same time, for the insurers, that it remains financially sustainable so they are able to continue offering these policies.\n\nSee more on\n\nMediShield Life\n\nInsurance\n\nHospitals\n\nPatients\n\nLimited-time offer\n\nGet a FREE Xiaomi vacuum cleaner (worth $109) with your subscription!\n\nBilled at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

There was also an upsize option to issue additional units that would have lifted total gross proceeds to around $675 million.\n\nThe placement \"drew strong demand from new and existing institutional and other accredited investors\", said the manager.\n\nIt had announced on Monday that it was undertaking an equity fund raising comprising the private placement and a non-renounceable preferential offering.\n\nThe preferential offering's issue price was also fixed at the low end of its range, at $2.34 per new unit - a 7 per cent discount to the VWAP.\n\nThe indicative price range had been $2.34 to $2.42 per unit for the offering, which is expected to raise about $759.7 million.\n\nAbout 324.6 million new units will be issued, based on 290 preferential offering units for every 1,000 existing units held as at 5pm on Oct 6.\n\nIn addition, some 244.7 million new units will be issued under the private placement.\n\nIn connection with the private placement, the manager plans to declare - in respect of the existing FCT units - a cumulative distribution for the period from April 1 to the date immediately before the new units are issued under the placement. The private placement units are expected to be issued on or around Oct 7.\n\nIt will also declare a distribution of the Reit's distributable income that was earlier retained for the periods from Oct 1 to Dec 31 last year, and Jan 1 to March 31 this year.\n\nThe aggregate distribution is estimated to be 4.485 cents per existing unit. This is made up of the cumulative distribution of about 2.804 cents and the retained distribution of about 1.681 cents.\n\nThe manager said it will announce the actual distribution level later.\n\nAssuming the preferential offering is fully subscribed, the fund raising's gross proceeds will total about $1.33 billion. This will comprise more than 45 per cent of FCT's present market capitalisation, said Mr Richard Ng, chief executive officer of the Reit manager.\n\nAbout $1.02 billion of this will finance FCT's acquisition of the rest of AsiaRetail Fund, while $284.9 million will go into paring down debts.\n\nTHE BUSINESS TIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore stocks\n\nStocks and shares", "images": []}

It said that close to 90 per cent of its retail banking customers use digital platforms for their daily banking needs, and less than 1 per cent of transactions take place in Citi branches.\n\nIt added that the hub will allow Citibank Singapore to have deeper conversations about wealth with customers while serving their simple transaction needs digitally. Clients can meet their relationship managers and have access to a team of specialists at a central location.\n\nThe hub will also have facilities to host investment seminars and events for clients.\n\nMr Brendan Carney, chief executive of Citibank Singapore and head of consumer banking for Citi in Asean, said: \"We see a great opportunity for us to serve the growing affluent segment in Singapore... As we continue to grow our business, we will look to open more of such hubs in the future.\"\n\nThe bank said it aims to achieve double-digit growth in market share and number of clients in the wealth segment in the next few years.\n\nThe hub will have a biophilic design and will aim to be green-certified. Biophilic design is based on the idea that humans have an inherent need to connect with nature, even in modern settings.\n\nClient meeting rooms will be named after national flowers and trees found in places where Citi has a presence, with some rooms transformed into \"garden pods\".\n\nAn antimicrobial coating will be applied on all high-touch surfaces, and safe distancing of at least 2m will be enforced. All rooms will be disinfected after each use, and plexi-guard shields will be installed as a precaution against the transmission of the coronavirus.\n\nThe United States bank is among several players in the wealth management scene here. HSBC in March launched a new global business - wealth and personal banking - that combines retail banking, wealth management and global private banking. It is in the midst of recruitment for wealth teams in Singapore, China and Hong Kong.\n\nAs for local banks, United Overseas Bank last year launched its first high-street wealth banking branch at Faber House in Orchard Road to complement its online channels in a bid to better equip \"emerging affluent\" customers with investment knowledge. It defines this group as those aged between 25 and 44, with between $100,000 and $350,000 in investible assets.\n\nDBS Wealth Management comprises three client segments - Treasures, Treasures Private Client and Private Bank - for customers with investible assets ranging from $350,000 to $5 million.\n\nOCBC Premier Banking and Premier Private Client offer customers access to 13 premier banking centres here, and investment advisory services from the OCBC Wealth Panel, which has experts from across the group's units.\n\nThis article has been edited for clarity.\n\nSee more on\n\nCitigroup\n\nBanks and financial institutions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/ST_20200930_PACITI_5997569.jpg?VersionId=oUd.wEyQfYajSscTAafOu70Vjow9STdQ", "alt_text": "An artist's impression of the client meeting space at the Citi Wealth Hub at 268 Orchard, which will open in December.

It also came in spite of RHB Research and HSBC both raising their calls on the stock to \"buy\" last week.\n\nThe top performer was Keppel Corp, which rose 2.6 per cent to $4.30. The firm announced after the market closed that it is reviewing its offshore and marine (O&M) business and intends to unlock $3 billion to $5 billion in value of its assets over the next three years.\n\nThe most active counter of the day was Sembcorp Marine. It added just 0.7 per cent to 14.4 cents but on a volume of close to 70 million shares traded, likely on renewed market chatter about a potential merger with Keppel's O&M division that looks increasingly likely to come to pass.\n\nRegional markets finished mixed.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.85 per cent and Malaysia's KLCI fell 0.51 per cent, but the Shanghai Composite added 0.21 per cent.\n\nOther winners were Japan's Nikkei 225, ahead 0.12 per cent, and the Kospi in Seoul, which added 0.86 per cent.\n\n\"Trading was thin ahead of the Chuseok holiday...

The Lightning won every play-off game in which he lit the lamp. He led all National Hockey League players in goals during this postseason, edging out Dallas' Joe Pavelski (13).\n\nThe Stars managed only four shots on goal in each of the first two periods, a testament to the Lightning's strong defensive play. Dallas managed to generate an attack during the third period, but Vasilevskiy blocked all 14 shots that came his way.\n\nAt the other end, Stars' Anton Khudobin made 27 saves, but it was not enough.\n\nREUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nWinter sports\n\nSports and recreation\n\nHockey\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/ST_20200930_SPTSTAN_5997272.jpg?VersionId=y4qG8IXBQzZfEVG21qA7r7JNXJ3lSNUu", "alt_text": "\"One of the greatest feelings in the world\" for centre Steven Stamkos, as he hoists the Stanley Cup after Tampa Bay beat Dallas 2-0 in Edmonton to win the finals series 4-2 for their second title."}]}

The blaze erupted on Sunday near Redding, about 320km north of San Francisco.\n\nNo further details about the victims or how they perished were immediately provided.

Even as the coronavirus continued to spread, fewer people were winding up in the hospital because of Covid-19, and fewer were dying.\n\nBut now, as the seasons turn, there are signs suggesting there will be more deaths and serious illness ahead. Data collected by the Covid Tracking Project shows the number of people hospitalised has plateaued at about 30,000 in the past week, after a fall from nearly 60,000 that began in late July.\n\nDeaths, meanwhile, averaged about 750 over the seven days through Sunday, higher than the roughly 600 deaths a day in the first week of July.\n\nScientists had hoped that a warm-weather reprieve could soften an expected re-emergence of the coronavirus in the colder months. Instead, the contagion continued to spread across the country after Memorial Day, with early summer outbreaks in Sun Belt states followed by the recent surge in the Upper Midwest and on college campuses nationwide.\n\nHistory and science suggest the second winter with coronavirus is likely to be worse than the first.\n\n\"We haven't had exposure to Covid throughout an entire winter, when more people are indoors and close together for prolonged periods,\" said Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. \"We are certainly concerned that Covid could spread even more readily in the winter than it has so far.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has pointed to the increasing availability of coronavirus tests as the reason the number of new cases in the United States remains high.\n\nIncreased testing has also made it possible to catch coronavirus cases earlier. That, combined with improved hospital care and medicines like Gilead Sciences' remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, allowed more patients to survive their infections this summer.\n\nHowever, a week-long plateau in new cases, hospitalisations and deaths are an early warning that things could be about to get worse.\n\nAlong with the resumption of school, more states are easing curbs on restaurants and bars, giving the virus more chances to find vulnerable people to infect.\n\n750\n\nAverage number of deaths in the US over the seven days through Sunday, higher than the roughly 600 deaths a day in the first week of July.\n\nStates that had been doing well, including New York, are seeing a new surge. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said there were 868 new cases on Sunday, an 18 per cent increase from two weeks earlier. Also, the percentage of Covid-19 tests taken in New York state that has come back positive has inched up to 1.5 per cent, Mr Cuomo said on Monday, a worrisome trend for the former epicentre of the country's coronavirus epidemic. New York's positivity rate had hovered around 1 per cent for weeks, a hard-won metric after the state tallied thousands of cases per day during the peak of its outbreak in the spring.\n\nCountry-wide, the number of new cases has risen for two weeks in a row in 27 out of 50 states, with North Carolina and New Mexico reporting increases above 50 per cent last week.\n\nSeparately, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention released detailed data on Monday that showed almost 280,000 children of school-going age were infected with the coronavirus between March 1 and Sept 19.\n\nThe figure accounted for roughly 4 per cent of the total US caseload over this period, with children aged 12-17 approximately twice as likely to be infected as those aged 5-11.\n\nBLOOMBERG, REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": []}

It also marks the vindication of his decision in 2018 to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Lakers, a faded superpower of the NBA who were floundering before his arrival.\n\nAlthough James' first season in Los Angeles ended in disappointment, with injury restricting his appearances and the team once again failing to make the play-offs, the bolstering of the squad with Anthony Davis last year returned the team to dominance.\n\n\"This is what I came here for,\" he said on Saturday after the Lakers defeated the Denver Nuggets 4-1 to clinch the Western Conference championship.\n\nStanding in the way of his bid for a fourth NBA championship are a Miami team happy to be cast in the role of underdogs.\n\nThe Heat have excelled through the play-offs with Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic outstanding, routing the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks 4-1 in the Eastern Conference semi-finals before accounting for the Boston Celtics 4-2.\n\n10th\n\nNBA Finals LeBron James has reached in his 17-year career.\n\nButler, who joined Miami last year from the Philadelphia 76ers, says the team must neutralise James to have any chance against the Lakers.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nNBA\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nLeBron James\n\nBasketball players", "images": []}

He owes hundreds of millions of dollars to creditors due in the next four years.\n\nThe tax data analysed by the Times further undercuts the image of a wildly successful businessman long projected by Mr Trump while he was reporting expansive and chronic losses by many of his marquee properties - losses that he then used to reduce or eliminate his tax liabilities.\n\nHow the revelations may change the presidential campaign was an open question.\n\nThe race has remained remarkably steady and without major shifts through all sorts of seismic developments.\n\nBut with only 35 days before the election on Nov 3, every day that the President does not transform the dynamics of a campaign - that polls show he is currently trailing in - is a missed opportunity.\n\n\"We know the vast majority of Americans long ago made up their minds about President Trump, either for or against him, so the tax revelations are not likely to shift the election in any fundamental way,\" said Republican pollster Whit Ayres.\n\nFOLLOW DEBATE ON ST WEBSITE\n\nThe first presidential debate between US President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden starts at 9am today, Singapore time. The 90-minute debate is being held at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and will be moderated by Fox News anchor Chris Wallace. Follow the debate on The Straits Times website:\n\nwww.straitstimes.com\n\n\"That said, they could play a role in giving Joe Biden some ammunition for the debate and at the margins for some people who feel that US$750 is not enough to pay in taxes regardless of the circumstances.\"\n\nMr Trump who, unlike other presidents since Watergate has adamantly refused to release his tax returns and fought efforts to obtain them all the way to the Supreme Court, took to Twitter on Monday to attack the Times report but without actually denying any of its particulars.\n\n\"The Fake News Media, just like Election time 2016, is bringing up my Taxes & all sorts of other nonsense with illegally obtained information & only bad intent,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation & tax credits.\"\n\nHe later refused to take questions at his only public event of the day.\n\nBut there was quiet concern within the campaign, where aides took note of daily tracking numbers from Rasmussen Reports, a typically rosy assessment of how the President is faring, that showed support falling after the tax story.\n\nAmong Mr Trump's circle, there was finger-pointing about how the issue was handled and a hesitancy to discuss with him an issue they know he is sensitive about.\n\nMany of the President's advisers argued that such stories have never harmed his standing with core supporters in the past and that this would be no exception.\n\nThey recognised, however, that Mr Trump would have to have an effective response prepared for the debate, the first encounter between the two candidates.\n\nSome aides suggested that he try to finesse an answer similar to what he has said previously, that taking advantage of the tax code is simply \"smart\" for a business person, while also painting himself as a creator of jobs.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York tweeted that she paid thousands of dollars in federal taxes in 2016 and 2017 - when she was still working as a bartender in New York City.\n\n\"He contributed less to funding our communities than waitresses & undocumented immigrants,\" the Democrat wrote.

As a result, Tiffany assumed the risk of a virus outbreak, LVMH added.\n\nThe French company also said Tiffany breached its agreement to operate as usual by paying out the highest possible dividend.\n\nLVMH said it could not close the deal with Tiffany because it received a letter from the French government asking the conglomerate to delay the transaction until next year, beyond the Nov 24 contractual deadline the companies had agreed to.\n\nTiffany did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has disputed LVMH's assertion that the French government intervention prevented it from closing the deal and that a material adverse effect had occurred. It also defended its ability to pay out dividends under its contract with LVMH.\n\nLVMH also said Tiffany stands to profit \"far more\" if the deal proceeds than as a standalone company.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The players and officials will be at the forefront of the football action and thus we are prioritising them for this initial testing.\"\n\nInfectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said that it is the right time to consider a resumption of the SPL, noting that Singapore has \"done well\" in its management of the Covid-19 situation, with few community cases recently.\n\nHe said testing players once before every game would be ideal, with fortnightly tests also workable.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

In total, 20 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus since the new season began on Sept 12.\n\nST reported last Saturday that the SPL could return on Oct 10, should the multi-ministry task force give the go-ahead, and FAS president Lim Kia Tong had noted there were \"some healthy signs\" that raised the possibility for a \"resumption in the first part of October\".\n\nGames will be played without fans and precautions in place will be similar to when the SPL moved to closed-door matches shortly before its suspension.\n\nThere will also likely be changes to the format of domestic league and Cup competitions, with a view to reducing the total number of games played. Originally, each side in the nine-team league were scheduled to play one another thrice.\n\nThere are still question marks over the participation of defending champions Brunei DPMM, with the team's head coach Adrian Pennock telling ST last week the situation was \"out of their hands\" as they have yet to resume full training.\n\nThe SPL fraternity welcomed the news of the imminent resumption.\n\nTampines Rovers chairman Desmond Ong said: \"Clearly we are happy at the news of a proposed resumption but we remain cautious and guided by the task force as to how to go about matters.\n\n\"We mustn't let anything put to waste all the hard work put in by all our healthcare workers.\"\n\nCheng Tim Nee, general manager of Balestier Khalsa, said that swab testing is a \"positive step\" towards a restart, adding: \"We hope all will go smoothly and we can resume league action under safe conditions for everyone involved.\"\n\nFor Hougang United midfielder Fabian Kwok, the league's return cannot come soon enough. \"After training for months over Zoom during the circuit breaker, then two months of training in groups of five, and now almost a month of normal training, it's starting to get a bit mundane,\" he said.\n\n\"Ultimately, we look forward to competition again\u2026 and since the end of the circuit breaker we have heard so many rumours of when the league might restart. We are tired of them (the rumours) already.\"\n\nAnother player, who asked not to be named, said he was thrilled by the news as the players had felt as if they were training hard \"without a real direction\".\n\n\"I also applaud the move for testing, because this is a move that will keep all players and officials even safer,\" he added.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore football\n\nSingapore Premier League\n\nSingapore sports\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/ST_20200930_SPTYAS_5991570.jpg?VersionId=.VHvrNNFfctGhq_J0Atu3pV5yTEGD37C", "alt_text": "Yasir Hanapi training with his Singapore Premier League team Tampines Rovers, who led the standings before the hiatus in March.

She hit 46 winners but committed 37 unforced errors. PHOTO: AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nFollow topic:\n\nFrench Open (Tennis)\n\nPublished\n\nSep 30, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nPARIS \u2022 It has been pretty much boom or bust for Jelena Ostapenko at Roland Garros but she believes she can return to the world's top 10 with a little more consistency in her game, after she secured her first French Open victory yesterday since lifting the trophy in 2017.\n\nThe Latvian, 23, blasted 46 winners en route to a 6-2, 6-1 defeat of Madison Brengle - her only win at Roland Garros since her shock run to the title three years ago.\n\nOstapenko's raw talent and fearless approach powered her to a stunning French Open triumph that saw her become the first unseeded player to win the Suzanne Lenglen Cup since Britain's Margaret Scriven in 1933.\n\nBut she admitted she struggled to cope with increased expectations following that fairy-tale run in Paris, and has added just two minor titles to her collection since beating Simona Halep in the 2017 final.\n\n\"After I won it was a tough time. I had to get used to the pressure but now it's all gone, and finally I won my first match after two years (of losing),\" she said yesterday. \"I feel like much better than the years before. I was practising a lot. I didn't play the US swing and I was practising all the time on clay. I was kind of waiting for this clay season. Finally, here we are. Yeah, just taking one match at a time, but really happy with my performance today.\"\n\nShe hit 40 more winners than Brengle, while also committing 22 unforced errors more than her 78th-ranked opponent.\n\nOstapenko reached a career-high ranking of No. 5 in March 2018 and made both the quarter-finals and semi-finals at Wimbledon in the two appearances directly after her French Open breakthrough.\n\nBut she entered this year's concluding Grand Slam again unseeded, at No. 43 in the world.\n\n\"I just have to be more confident in my game and more consistent,\" said Ostapenko, who could pose a test for fourth-ranked Karolina Pliskova - who beat Egyptian qualifier Mayar Sherif 6-7 (9-11), 6-2, 6-4 - in the second round.\n\n\"If there is a consistency in my game, I think I'm going to be a very dangerous player and it's going to be very, like, not easy to beat me... If I get my consistency back like in 2017 and beginning of 2018 also, I think I'll be back in like top 10.\"\n\nConsistency is something world No. 1 Novak Djokovic is all too familiar with. The Serb notched his 32nd win in 33 matches this year by beating Sweden's Mikael Ymer 6-0, 6-2, 6-3.\n\nDAY 3 SELECTED RESULTS\n\nMEN 1ST RD\n\nChristian Garin (Chi) bt Philipp Kohlschreiber (Ger) 6-4 4-6 6-1 6-4, Marc Polmans (Aus) bt Ugo Humbert (Fra) 6-2 6-2 3-6 6-3, Matteo Berrettini (Ita) bt Vasek Pospisil (Can) 6-3 6-1 6-3.\n\nWOMEN 1ST RD\n\nNao Hibino (Jpn) bt Marta Kostyuk (Ukr) 6-4 6-0, Elena Rybakina (Kaz) bt Sorana Cirstea (Rou) 6-0 6-3, Karolina Pliskova (Cze) bt Mayar Sherif (Egy) 6-7 (9-11) 6-2 6-4.\n\nWhile Ostapenko and Djokovic cruised, it was not the same for others in Paris. On Monday, Italian qualifier Lorenzo Giustino finally outlasted France's Corentin Moutet 0-6, 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 18-16 in the second longest match in French Open history at 6hr 5min.\n\nThe clash featured 459 points won, 145 winners and 184 unforced errors.\n\nWorld No. 157 Giustino secured his first Grand Slam main draw and Tour-level win after a final set lasting 180 minutes in a match held over from Sunday.\n\nMoutet won more points than Giustino - 242 to 217 - but the 29-year-old journeyman emerged the victor in a contest that fell 28 minutes short of the tournament's record marathon tie between Fabrice Santoro and Arnaud Clement in 2004.\n\nAlso on Monday, Rafael Nadal started his quest for a record-extending 13th French Open title with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 first-round win against Belarusian Egor Gerasimov. The Spaniard, looking to equal Roger Federer's record of 20 Grand Slam men's singles titles, will face American Mackenzie McDonald today.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS\n\nFRENCH OPEN\n\nDay 4: Singtel TV Ch114/115 & StarHub Ch208/209, 4.50pm\n\nSee more on\n\nFrench Open (Tennis)\n\nWomen's tennis", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/ST_20200930_SPTOSTA_5998324.jpg?VersionId=zha6p9RuW_sOyB_y6esGfQgH86wlYSqz", "alt_text": "Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko going for broke against Madison Brengle in their first-round clash at Roland Garros yesterday.

He's a fantastic player, and he was terrific tonight.\"\n\nVilla displayed clinical finishing but their victory was also made easier by continued shambolic defending from Fulham, who have conceded 10 goals in their opening three matches and look out of their depth in the top flight.\n\nGrealish fired Villa ahead in the fourth minute when he took a simple pass from McGinn into his stride and drilled a low shot past goalkeeper Alphonse Areola from a tight angle.\n\nHourihane doubled their lead in the 15th minute after a lightning-quick move down the left flank as McGinn racked up another assist when he teed up the Ireland midfielder to side-foot the ball into the bottom corner.\n\nThe match was over as a contest in the 48th minute when Villa's England centre-back Mings ghosted into the penalty area and turned in a cross from the left with Fulham's defenders positioned like statues.\n\nThe home team's manager Scott Parker rued their poor defending.\n\n\"I've stood in this position for the first three games and it's a common theme of what I'm saying. You can't give up goals like we are, I've highlighted it and we know where we are,\" he said.\n\n\"It's tough to fix the defensive frailties.

Sonego prevailed 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 6-1, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3 in just over four hours.\n\n\"That's how tennis goes,\" Andres Gomez said by telephone. \"I'm still happy. Obviously, I would have wanted a different result today, but clay is not his best surface. Good things are coming for him, I think.\"\n\nJust reaching the main draw was quite a journey for Emilio Gomez, a former collegiate player at the University of Southern California. He is 28 and nearly quit the game in 2018 after a string of disappointing results, only deciding to push on after winning two satellite events in Ecuador. But in this strange and disjointed season, he finally broke through in Paris, coming through three rounds of qualifying.\n\nThirty years after his father won the French Open in 1990, defeating Andre Agassi, Emilio made it into the main draw, breaking into tears.\n\n\"To be on the courts where my father won is something special,\" said Emilio, ranked 155th. \"I'm not a first-level player like him, but I enjoy it.\"\n\nChoosing the same path as a champion parent is not without its perils. \"Emilio had to carry the name on the back, and it was a heavy load, sometimes even heavier because he thought it was heavy,\" Andres said.\n\n\"But I think Emilio started to enjoy being my son. Everybody is the son of somebody, and there's always expectations and sometimes expectations are a little tougher on some of them.\"\n\nThe next challenge for the late-bloomer: Making the main draw at another Grand Slam tournament on a surface better suited to his tight-to-the-baseline game.\n\nEmilio is not the only child of a Grand Slam champion making his main-draw debut at this year's French Open. There is also Sebastian Korda, a 20-year-old American who will face John Isner in the second round of men's singles today.\n\nKorda's father and coach is Petr Korda, the 1998 Australian Open champion from the Czech Republic who also reached the French Open final in 1992, losing to Jim Courier.\n\nBut the next-generation Kordas are not just tennis players.\n\nPetr Korda and his wife, Regina, who was also a leading Czech player, also have two older daughters: Jessica, 27, and Nelly, 22, who are two of the leading women's professional golfers and each has won multiple LPGA Tour titles.\n\n\"They are having a good year this year, so we're always in contact, and we're always talking about what we can do better, and how we're doing it,\" Sebastian said of his sisters.\n\nSebastian, nicknamed Sebi, started out with a passion for ice hockey but decided to focus on tennis at age nine after travelling to the US Open in 2009 with his father when Petr was coaching the Czech player Radek Stepanek.\n\n\"He played Djokovic on Ashe at like 10.30 at night,\" Sebastian said of Stepanek.\n\n\"It was completely packed, and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I went home and said, this is exactly what I want to do, just kind of fell in love with it.\"\n\nThe Korda parents taught Sebastian the tennis fundamentals, which included a two-handed backhand, which has developed into his best shot and is quite a contrast to his father's flat one-hander.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nFrench Open (Tennis)\n\nMen's tennis\n\nGrand Slam\n\nSports and recreation", "images": []}

I'm not sure I heard it right, maybe he was speaking about another game... it cannot be this game, sorry!\n\n\"That is an incredible description of this game. Nothing was sloppy, absolutely nothing. Alisson had to make one save, they had two balls in behind, you cannot avoid that. You need a goalie in these situations. Apart from that, the football we played was absolutely exceptional tonight. There is nothing bad to say. It was the opposite of sloppy.\"\n\nArsenal had taken the lead through Alexandre Lacazette after poor control from Andy Robertson in his own area and the French striker could have equalised in the second half when he was one-on-one against goalkeeper Alisson.\n\nBut Klopp insisted he has been blown away by the standards his team have set at the start of their title defence.\n\nGoals from Sadio Mane, Robertson and new signing Diogo Jota saw off the Gunners, who had won their opening two league games of the season.\n\nWhile Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and now Arsenal have all lost in the first three weeks of the new term, Liverpool have laid down an early marker that they are the team to beat.\n\n\"It's really early in the season and with this performance it is absolutely 'wow',\" said Klopp.\n\n\"From the first second, (we were) dominant against a team in form.\"\n\nArsenal followed the game plan that had brought them two victories over Liverpool in recent months, as they dropped deep then looked to play around the Reds' press when in possession.\n\nHowever, unlike when they met at the back end of last season when Klopp's men had already won the league or the Community Shield last month, Liverpool were far sharper in pulling the Gunners out of position.\n\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said that his team have lots of work to do to reach the Reds' standards.\n\n\"We are in a different journey to Liverpool.

The box runs on Android TV (based on version 10), a variant of the popular mobile operating system made for television.\n\nBecause the apps have to be optimised for the big screen, the Google Play Store for the Android TV platform has only a fraction of the apps for the mobile version.\n\nBut essential streaming apps such as Netflix and HBO Go are available and preloaded on the TV+ Box I tested. I was glad to see Netflix - a glaring omission from StarHub's previous streaming box. The Netflix app on the TV+ Box supports up to 4K resolution with high dynamic range, which is available with the streaming service's premium plan ($19.90).\n\nBut Netflix is not the reason to get the TV+ Box. After all, the app is already found in most smart TVs.\n\nThe TV+ Box comes with a custom launcher that displays StarHub's pay TV offerings prominently on the home screen. They are bundled into six categories (or passes), such as Western TV shows and Asian fare. The passes can be purchased via the \"Store\" tab at the top of the screen.\n\nUnlike a standard Android TV box, you cannot customise the interface, like adding YouTube to the home screen, which is annoying.\n\nThe device is slightly bigger than my palm. A USB port supplements the limited internal storage (there was only 4.7GB free in my review set).\n\nI like the remote control, which feels more solid than the one for the previous media streaming box.

I think it's really something I have to cherish every day.\"\n\nOn campus, where classes resumed in the middle of this month partially online, reminders for students to maintain social distancing are everywhere. Access to the library is one-way, the route is peppered with hand sanitiser stations and students must reserve a place - then disinfect their workstation with the wipes provided.\n\nWearing a mask is encouraged but not obligatory.\n\nStudents' social lives are also limited, with many welcoming events held virtually, which is a challenge for new arrivals trying to settle in, said Mr George Okata, a member of Coventry's student body.\n\nBritain has had some 42,000 deaths in the outbreak - the worst in Europe - and millions of people are under renewed local restrictions due to a surge in cases.\n\nThe British government has tightened restrictions on socialising in parts of north-east England.\n\nFrom today, residents in seven areas including urban centres such as Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland and Durham will be barred from socialising indoors with people from outside their household or strictly defined social bubble.\n\nThe curbs will apply in homes, pubs and restaurants, and people who fail to comply will face fines enforceable by law, the Health Ministry said. Coronavirus incidence rates were above 100 per 100,000 in six of the seven areas last week.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the number of cases continues to rise sharply,\" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said, announcing the new restrictions in Parliament on Monday.\n\n\"We know a large number of these infections are taking place in indoor settings outside the home. And so, at the request of the local councils, with whom we've been working closely, we will introduce legal restrictions on indoor mixing between households in any setting,\" he said.\n\nSchools and workplaces will not be affected by the restrictions.\n\nOver 30 universities around Britain have reported more than 717 Covid-19 cases among students and staff since the new school term started earlier this month, with thousands of students in self-isolation, local media said on Monday.\n\nManchester Metropolitan University, for instance, has asked around 1,700 students to self-isolate after 127 cases were confirmed. The University of Glasgow has 172 confirmed cases, with 600 students self-isolating, said Sky News.\n\nUp until now, Coventry University has not experienced the clusters of cases seen at other British universities, which - often after illegal parties - caused them to isolate hundreds of students.\n\nForeign students from outside the European Union pay significantly more than British or EU students, and their fees are a major source of income for universities.\n\nIn Coventry University, they normally make up one-third of the 35,000-strong student body. The number of foreign registrations has halved this month. However, provost Ian Dunn said many were taking up the option offered routinely by the university to start in January, or even wait until May.\n\nDespite pessimistic predictions that foreign student numbers might collapse this autumn, applications body Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) has seen a 9 per cent increase in international undergraduate admissions, although EU applications fell 2 per cent.\n\nHowever, this is not enough to relieve the pressure on universities, which have invested heavily in online learning and are also preparing for the end of the post-Brexit transition period in December.\n\nMr Nick Hillman, from the Higher Education Policy Institute think-tank, cautioned that registration data \"doesn't necessarily mean all those people will actually turn up\". He also pointed out that a lot of international students were post-graduates, who were not included in the UCAS figures.\n\nAnd there was a \"real worry that dropout rates might go up this year, because when they (the students) get to university, their experience might not be quite what they expected\", he said.\n\nUniversities UK, which represents higher education institutions, said it was unclear how many international students who had received offers would take up their places.\n\nSome institutions, like Queen's University Belfast, have decided to leave nothing to chance, chartering a flight to bring in hundreds of Chinese students, The Times reported.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, XINHUA, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nEU\n\nUniversities - overseas\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/st_20200930_vnstudent1_5997406.jpg?VersionId=2.iO5MegPvCP3bRIND2pyFNTpHtZL2Bz", "alt_text": "Above: Students in Coventry University at the beginning of the new academic year on Sept 23.

But this fast-tracked pace is not synonymous, as some media have suggested, with corners being cut. No way,\" said Dr Gintsburg, adding that all the guidelines for testing Sputnik V's safety and efficacy had been followed.\n\nThe plan to publish interim results based on the first 42 days of monitoring volunteers means Russia has a high chance of becoming the first worldwide to announce any data from a final-stage trial, which is known as phase three.\n\nThe first of 5,000 volunteers was vaccinated on Sept 9, which means interim results could be issued some time after Oct 21.\n\nSeveral Western developers are conducting final-stage trials that have been going on for more than 42 days but have not published any interim results.\n\nDr Gintsburg said there was a public interest argument for sharing interim results after 42 days as they would show the general trend in the data. \"For me, it is too short. But for people who are interested in how things are going, it is already too long.\"\n\nHe said volunteers would be monitored for 180 days after the last of 40,000 participants was vaccinated. Six months on, his team planned to tally final results and publish them. Their early-stage trial results were peer-reviewed and published in The Lancet.\n\nIn parallel with the trial, Russia began inoculating members of the general public considered at high risk on Sept 8, another unconventional move by Moscow in the race for a vaccine.\n\nAbout 400 people have since been inoculated. A government source said the interim phase three trial results would likely inform a decision on whether to expand this mass inoculation drive, starting with people aged over 60.\n\nMoscow registered 642 new Covid-19 cases on the day the trial began. The infection rate has risen since, with 2,217 new cases on Monday, though it is well below a peak of around 6,000 daily infections in the capital in early May.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nRussia\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nVaccines", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/eb_russia_290920.jpg?VersionId=iUEpbR3bXEiqQcOP.AHxsQ1gb7WzzSnC", "alt_text": null}]}

They comprised 33 million who would have otherwise escaped poverty and 5 million who had escaped but were pushed back into poverty by the pandemic and its effects.\n\nUnlike elsewhere in the region, poverty in China is projected to decrease by 8.1 million to 9.6 million people this year.\n\nBut the estimate is far lower than the roughly 25 million Chinese who would have escaped poverty if not for the pandemic.\n\n\"Sickness, unemployment and school closures could lead to the erosion of human capital and earning losses that last a lifetime,\" the World Bank said in its report.\n\nIt estimated that as a result of school closures due to Covid-19, the average student in the region could face a reduction of 4 per cent in expected earnings every year of his working life.\n\nThe twice-yearly report focuses on nearly two dozen developing countries in the region: Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Vietnam and 11 Pacific Island countries. It was previously released in April.\n\nWhile many countries have been successful in containing the coronavirus, with many governments having stepped in to give fiscal support to households and companies, they will struggle to recover and grow, said Dr Mattoo.\n\nAmong its key recommendations, the report called for countries to develop testing, tracing and isolating capacities to contain further disease surges, as well as a safe way of reopening schools and a fair and efficient vaccine distribution system.\n\nIt also urged governments to widen their tax bases to avoid excessive borrowing, boost social protections and equip workers with skills to adapt to digital technologies and services that the pandemic accelerated.\n\nSupport for firms is also needed to prevent bankruptcies and unemployment, but these firms should have the potential to thrive in the future, the World Bank said.\n\nSee more on\n\nWorld Bank\n\nPoverty\n\nEconomic growth", "images": []}

The other 80 per cent remains available for procurement.\n\nDr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, said that more tests were undergoing evaluation and would come online.\n\nThey would be particularly useful in remote settings and to investigate clusters quickly and bring them under control, as well as in areas with widespread community transmission.\n\n\"This will be really, really helpful for communities and countries to be able to know where is the virus and who is infected with the virus,\" she said.\n\nREUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nWHO\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nPoverty\n\nLimited-time offer\n\nGet a FREE Xiaomi vacuum cleaner (worth $109) with your subscription!\n\nBilled at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

And as more information comes in, the authorities need to be \"humble enough and flexible enough\" to change some of the original policies.\n\n\"But some of the media who like to make hay of that, keep saying 'Oh you keep changing your mind all the time. Well, you were incorrect'. No, we were correct at the time that statement was made. But when the scientific data made it clear that we had to change that recommendation, we did,\" said Dr Fauci, citing the example of mask-wearing.\n\nDr Fauci also said that some media outlets \"give opposing perspectives on what seems to be a pretty obvious fact or a body of data\", citing American outlet Fox News as having good reporters but noting that \"some of the things that they report there are outlandish, to be honest with you\".\n\nThe session, which was moderated by CNN's chief media correspondent Brian Stelter, was part of the two-hour World News Day closing show organised by the Canadian Journalism Foundation and World Editors Forum.\n\nThe World News Day celebrations had begun earlier in Singapore with a webinar titled Covid-19: How Can You Contribute? that was live-streamed from The Straits Times newsroom.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

I've never been under attack as much as I have today, just for doing my job. It is worse than a war zone, it's worse than any conflict zone.

You get the same rectangular watch case with a crown and button on the right side.\n\nWhile this might disappoint some, it does mean all the watch bands that current Apple Watch users have are compatible with the new smartwatch.\n\nThe Series 6 comes in four new case colours: blue and red aluminium, as well as stainless steel in graphite and gold.\n\nThe Straits Times reviewed the graphite stainless steel model, which comes in a lighter shade of black compared with the space-black stainless steel of previous models. This subtle change makes the watch look even more sleek and exquisite.\n\nThe Series 6's always-on display is 21/2 times brighter than that of the Series 5, according to Apple. It does look brighter to me and I find it much easier to read the time and notifications on this display under bright sunlight.\n\nInside, the Series 6 has several upgrades - including the new S6 chip, which offers faster performance than Series 5's S5 chip.\n\nThe Series 6's always-on altimeter, a new feature, is able to measure elevation change in real time. It was fun watching the readings going up as I rode the lift to my flat.\n\nBut, while it is mostly accurate, there are fluctuations at times. For example, one reading is 60m when I am at home, but at other times, it measures 30m or 40m.\n\nThe Series 6 is able to measure oxygen saturation, also known as SpO2, with the new blood oxygen sensor and app. It will continue measuring even when you are asleep.\n\nThis is in addition to the same health and fitness features - such as heart-rate monitoring and electrocardiogram (ECG) screening - that can already be found in the Series 4 and 5. And with Apple's new watchOS 7, the Series 6 can track your sleep as well.\n\nWhile the new watchOS is supported on models as old as the Series 3, the faster S6 chip makes everything in the Series 6 more responsive and intuitive.\n\nOther new features include a hand-washing reminder. The built-in sensors will automatically detect when you start washing your hands. A timer will appear, counting down from 20 seconds - the recommended duration of hand-washing - which is a handy feature to have in this pandemic.\n\nFOR\n\n\u2022 Sleek design\n\n\u2022 Superb performance\n\n\u2022 Old watch bands can fit\n\n\u2022 Faster charging time\n\nAGAINST\n\n\u2022 Same design as its predecessors\n\n\u2022 Sleep tracking needs improvement\n\nSPECS\n\nPRICE:\n\nFrom $599\n\nCASE MATERIAL:\n\nAnodised aluminium, stainless steel, titanium\n\nCONNECTIVITY:\n\nBluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi or cellular\n\nWATER RESISTANCE:\n\n50m\n\nWEIGHT:\n\n47.1g (44mm graphite stainless steel case, without strap)\n\nRATING\n\nFEATURES:\n\n4.5/5\n\nDESIGN:\n\n4.5/5\n\nPERFORMANCE:\n\n4.5/5\n\nBATTERY LIFE:\n\n3.5/5\n\nVALUE FOR MONEY:\n\n4/5\n\nOVERALL:\n\n4.5/5\n\nPlus, you can set reminders to wash your hands when you reach home by using geo-location with the built-in GPS.\n\nBut, due to GPS triangulation limits, the reminder does not work if you are not far enough from home.\n\nFor instance, after getting lunch at a coffee shop a block away, the watch does not remind me to wash my hands. But it sends me a reminder after my grocery run at a supermarket farther away.\n\nThe watchOS 7 offers several new options for watch faces, such as Chronograph Pro and Typograph. But my favourite is the GMT face, where the digital bezel comes in Pepsi blue and red - the same colours of my dream timepiece, the Rolex GMT Master II.\n\nWith the GMT face, you can select the second world-time by rotating the crown to find the city you want. And the second hour hand will point to the bezel to show the selected time. This is great for video-conferencing meetings with people in other countries - and, potentially, for travelling in the post-pandemic future.\n\nIn terms of fitness tracking, the Series 6 is as good as it gets. For step tracking, the readings are very close to those of my own calibrated Series 4, with a mere difference of 50 steps.\n\nOn my usual 5km jogging route, the GPS-tracked runs by the Series 6 are only around 10m to 20m off.\n\nHowever, the watch's sleep tracking can be better. It does not automatically track sleep, like what Fitbit and Garmin's fitness trackers and smartwatches do. You have to set the time you sleep and wake, or manually turn the sleep mode on and off.\n\nPlus, it only shows your sleeping hours. There is no breakdown of light and deep sleep, which is not very insightful.\n\nBattery life is slightly better than that of the Series 5. When I have the watch paired to an iPhone with notifications turned on and a 5km run recorded, the battery has around 50 per cent power remaining by bedtime, compared with 40 per cent in the Series 5.\n\nThe Series 6 also offers faster charging, juicing up from zero to 80 per cent in an hour. I also found that only 6 per cent of its battery life was depleted after six hours of sleep.\n\nFor those using the Series 5, the Series 6 is not much of an upgrade. For users of the older models, like myself, it is probably time to upgrade to the Series 6.\n\nHowever, if the price - which starts at $599 - is a concern, Apple has introduced the more wallet-friendly Apple Watch SE, which is priced at $419 and up. It looks like the Series 6, and has the same S5 chip as the Series 5 and an always-on altimeter like the Series 6.\n\nIt lacks the SpO2 and ECG features of the Series 6, but if you just need basic smartwatch and fitness functions, the SE should do the job.\n\nSee more on\n\nTech review\n\nApple Watch\n\nSmartwatches\n\nApple", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/st_20200930_ttnew30b85c_5993790a.jpg?VersionId=4XvAu2TIRJtZtML0t04De3tm.EQbdf7n", "alt_text": null}]}

No problem\n\nGamers can learn a lesson or two from the mad rush to grab Sony and Microsoft's latest consoles\n\nSign up now:\n\nGet ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox\n\nBryan De Silva\n\nFollow topic:\n\nTech life hacks\n\nPublished\n\nSep 30, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nAre you one of those gamers who regularly pre-order consoles and games before they hit the stores?\n\nIf you are, you can learn something from the pre-order mayhem that arose during the latest video game console wars.\n\nI'm a hardcore gamer who has never believed in pre-orders. And after what happened, I'm convinced I have been doing the right thing.\n\nThis month, both Sony and Microsoft said they would open pre-orders for their new consoles, which are due to be released in November.\n\nBut things did not go well at all.\n\nAt Sony's PlayStation 5 (PS5) showcase event on Sept 17, it was announced that pre-orders for the console would start a day later.\n\nThen, a few hours after the event, online retailers opened pre-orders and all available consoles were snapped up within hours.\n\nIn Singapore, the PS5 retails at $729 for the regular version and $599 for one without an Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive. On the Sony Singapore website, both models, which will launch on Nov 19, are listed as out of stock.\n\nFour days after the fiasco, Sony apologised to fans on Twitter, admitting that the process could have been a lot smoother and promising to have more consoles for pre-order.\n\nRival Microsoft, which is releasing the Xbox Series X - the successor to the Xbox One X - appeared to be gloating when it assured fans not to worry, because it would \"let (them) know the exact time\" the orders would begin.\n\nThe pre-order started on Tuesday last week. It was no bungle like Sony's, but it turned out to be a disaster too. Reports said Amazon customers had trouble loading the pre-order page and instead saw only error pages.\n\nThe good news for Microsoft was that sales of the Xbox One X reportedly rose - but probably because some gamers, in a state of panic buying, mistakenly thought they were getting the Xbox Series X. After all, the names of the old and new consoles are pretty close.\n\nOn the Microsoft Singapore website, the Series X ($699.99) and the Series S ($459), a disc-less, non-4K option, are also listed as out of stock. They launch on Nov 10.\n\nMicrosoft tweeted on Wednesday last week that it was \"humbled\" by the \"record-breaking demand\" for its new consoles and that gaming fans could expect more consoles to be available at launch.\n\nWhile I understand the joy of being among the first to own a new product, a new console is only as valuable as the games you play on it.\n\nBoth Sony and Microsoft are offering new titles when they launch their consoles, as well as subscription gaming services for fans to stream or download games.\n\nBut experienced gamers will tell you the best games will not come so soon.\n\nXbox's Gears Of War 5 was released to good reviews last year, six years after the Xbox One X hit the market. And when The Last Of Us Part 2 came out this year for the PS4, it broke sales records and bowled fans over with gorgeous graphics that might have been expected only in the new PS5.\n\nDevelopers tend to produce better games when they have had more time to assess the hardware's capabilities.\n\nSo, no matter which console you're a fan of, you're not missing out if you do not secure a pre-order.\n\nGive it a couple of years. The next console is likely to be better, with higher-quality games to boot.\n\nSee more on\n\nTech life hacks\n\nCommentary", "images": []}

Dozens have been reported killed and hundreds wounded since clashes between Azerbaijan and its ethnic Armenian mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh broke out on Sunday in a new eruption of a decades-old conflict.\n\nIn a sign that the fighting was spreading, Armenia's Foreign Ministry reported the first death in Armenia proper - a civilian it said was killed in an Azeri attack in the town of Vardenis more than 20km from Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nThe Armenian Defence Ministry said an Armenian civilian bus caught fire in the town after being hit by an Azeri drone. It was not clear if the reported civilian death was from that incident.\n\nAzerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said 10 civilians had been killed by Armenian shelling since Sunday. There was no official information about casualties among Azeri servicemen.\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is a breakaway region inside Azerbaijan that is run by ethnic Armenians and supported by Armenia. It broke away from Azerbaijan in a war in the 1990s, but is not recognised by any country as an independent republic.\n\nAn all-out war could drag in major regional powers Russia and Turkey. Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, which is the enclave's lifeline to the outside world, while Ankara backs its own ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.\n\nThe Kremlin said Moscow was in constant contact with Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan over the conflict. Any talk of military support for the opposing sides would only add fuel to the fire, it said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

The seven-day rolling average for positive coronavirus tests was 1.38 per cent.\n\nDe Blasio's announcement came as many\n\nelementary school students returned to public schools for the first time\n\non Tuesday, an effort to provide a mix of in-person and virtual learning that had twice been pushed back as teachers and principals raised concerns about the city's pandemic preparedness.\n\nThe city has said it will shut schools again if the seven-day average reaches 3 per cent or more.\n\nPlans to allow restaurants to begin seating customers indoors at 25 per cent capacity were still under way for Wednesday, de Blasio said.\n\nIn a Tuesday news conference, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo raised the possibility of stopping indoor dining again or reimposing other economic restrictions.\n\n\"I don't believe we're at the point of rolling back anything,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"If the local governments do not do the compliance and attack the clusters, you will be there in the short-term future.\"\n\nCuomo, who has repeatedly feuded with de Blasio over who has authority to impose or loosen containment measures, said he would meet this week with leaders of Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn as well as Nassau, Orange and Rockland counties, where infections have also ticked up.\n\nElsewhere, in the past seven days Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin reported record numbers of hospitalised Covid-19 patients.

It is the first of three scheduled debates.\n\nMr Trump arrived in Cleveland aboard Air Force One, and finished a 20-minute preview visit to the debate venue shortly before Mr Biden landed in the city at about 5pm EDT (2100 GMT) with some of his top advisers: Mr Jake Sullivan, Mr Ron Klain, Mr Mike Donilon, and sister Valerie Biden Owens.\n\nMr Biden went directly to the debate pavilion for his own walk-through.\n\nThe Biden tax-returns gambit ahead of the debate shows that the former vice-president is seeking political advantage on an issue that could resonate with voters: a wealthy real estate developer-turned-politician who has, according to the New York Times report, often avoided paying federal income taxes.\n\nDemocrats have sought to portray Mr Trump as a tax dodger.\n\nMr Trump's persistent refusal to release his taxes has been a departure from standard practice for presidential candidates.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh issued a statement responding to Mr Biden's disclosure, accusing him of being dishonest in public statements about his own past earnings. But Mr Murtaugh did not address whether Mr Trump would release his returns.\n\nThe Times also reported that Mr Trump was currently embroiled in a decade-long Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit over a US$72.9 million tax refund he claimed after declaring large losses. If the IRS rules against him, he could have to pay over US$100 million, according to the newspaper.\n\nBIDEN INCOME\n\nMr Biden's 2019 return showed most of his income came from a company he has said handles payments from his speaking and writing engagements and from a University of Pennsylvania teaching post from which he took an unpaid leave of absence after launching his candidacy.\n\nThe 2019 tax returns for Mr Biden's running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, also were released.\n\nMs Harris and her husband, lawyer Doug Emhoff, reported paying about US$1.2 million in total federal taxes on US$3.3 million of income for the year, according to the tax returns released on Tuesday. Vice-President Mike Pence released a decade of returns before the 2016 election but no tax information since then.\n\nThe combustible Trump and more low-key Biden will debate an array of urgent political challenges, including\n\na pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 people in the United States\n\nand thrown millions out of work, a brewing battle over\n\nMr Trump's nomination of conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett\n\nto the Supreme Court, and continued protests for racial justice.\n\nMr Biden, 77, has held a consistent lead over Mr Trump, 74, in national opinion polls, although surveys in the battleground states that will decide the election show a closer contest.\n\nThe debate will be divided into six segments: the records of Mr Trump and Mr Biden, the Supreme Court, the pandemic, the economy, election integrity and \"race and violence\" in US cities.\n\nA senior Trump campaign official told reporters aboard Air Force One that the president \"knows exactly what he wants to communicate\" and hopes to get into his differences with Mr Biden on trade, \"endless wars,\" the issue of America's \"haves and the have-nots\" and Mr Biden's long career in elected office.\n\nMr Biden is certain to press his criticism of Mr Trump's response to the pandemic, and highlight Mr Trump's efforts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, the law known as Obamacare, which has helped millions of Americans obtain health insurance.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nJoe Biden\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUS presidential election 2020", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/fhbidentrump30.jpg?VersionId=iSPfgO2xOe6xVd5lmMHou20v2uGJ3EfU", "alt_text": null}]}

I don't see how the umpire could not see it. Unfortunately, she continues at Roland Garros but I do not.\"\n\nIt was a second successive miserable Grand Slam for the 27-year-old Frenchwoman who was withdrawn from the doubles at the US Open earlier this month in a row over coronavirus.\n\nDespite her disappointment, Mladenovic refused to blame Siegemund for not calling the incident on herself.\n\n\"Well, she would have been the best and most fair player on the tour if she would have done that. Unfortunately, she didn't. I didn't expect her to do it,\" added Mladenovic.\n\n\"But if she would have done it, she would have all my respect and be super-fair play. She's not the one responsible.

So I think in that situation, that was a close call,\" said the 66th-ranked player.\n\n\"That's what the umpire is there for. I think she has better chances than me to see what has happened exactly.\"\n\nSiegemund backed Mladenovic's call for video replays which would allow controversial calls to be reviewed courtside and, if necessary, overturned.\n\n\"If we have the technical devices to get a quick replay, I think that's a good thing for all sports,\" she said.\n\nHowever, Siegemund insisted that Mladenovic had plenty of chances to kill off the first set even before the controversy erupted.\n\n\"I can understand her frustration. I can maybe understand a little bit that she's getting at me, but I think she should get at the umpire.\n\n\"She had plenty of other opportunities. It was just the wrong call, and that happens in sport.\"\n\nMladenovic has seen crucial leads disappear before - at the US Open, she led Russia's Varvara Gracheva 6-1, 5-1 and had four match points but still went on to lose in three sets.\n\nSee more on\n\nFrench Open (Tennis)\n\nWomen's tennis", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/tennis-fra-open-women-135015.jpg?VersionId=83NZFpq8Zj_hsStJZZS1nXMAUP7y7g1T", "alt_text": null}]}

But Mr Haney said vintners would likely scale back production of certain wines due to smoke exposure to grapes still on the vines when the fires struck.\n\n\"I do know there are wineries saying we have been impacted and we won't be making as much wine,\" he said. Several Napa Valley growers said recently they would forgo a 2020 vintage altogether due to smoke contamination of their crop.\n\nThe blazes in Shasta County and wine country marked the latest flashpoints in a destructive spate of wildfires this summer across the Western United States.\n\nCalifornia fires have scorched over 15,378 sq km since January - far exceeding any single year in state history. They have been stoked by increasingly frequent and prolonged bouts of extreme heat, high winds and dry-lightning sieges that scientists attribute to climate change.\n\nMore than 7,000 homes and other structures have burned statewide this year.\n\nRed-flag warnings for extreme wildfire risk remained posted for much of northern California.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nWildfires\n\nEmergencies", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-calisatoga-29092024.jpg?VersionId=VtqC0efdwMIMlg3uq_Lx9txxdTeSc.NF", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign - DBS Wellness space 1 (CREDIT DBS Bank)\n \nCredit: Photo of DBS Bank office"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ababd7adbab5ef95d4223806a015c648e9803c8d554289cc24869840a46a74ae", "alt_text": "Enforcement action by the Health Sciences Authority netted a suspect and various vapes on July 10."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7f73688fa163929df2c176d392b660d82a63b73e970c811e2339978d254a5fcd", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo, with retirees Chong Hock Loo, 75, and Shirley Tan, 68, during the PCF Family Day event on July 13."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0748316b0c8c0488543313beecbd97ee6f6260fce547cdce53f76f53d9d6a49f", "alt_text": "From left: Pathlight School students Marcus Goh, Nurdaanya Mohamed Hafiz and Brennan Tay with their respective artwork, part of a total of 30 artwork that are selected in the Wing Tai X Pathlight School art competition to be displayed on a construction hoarding along Kim Seng Linear Park, on July 11, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0f74970f823073d68c58dca22ef69d6312f85ec19cd11cccf600d0046eabbb32", "alt_text": "Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - July 13, 2025 Italy's Jannik Sinner celebrates with the trophy after winning the men's final against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz REUTERS/Andrew Couldridge"}]}

More than 104,000 cases have been registered in Kuwait so far, including some 605 deaths.\n\nDuring a recent absence as he underwent medical treatment in the United States, his half-brother, Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, 83, was acting ruler.\n\nSheikh Nawaf, an elder statesman who has held high office for decades including the defence and interior portfolios, is now expected to succeed him.\n\nIRON HAND\n\nSheikh Sabah operated as a political maverick, which helped to shield his regional reputation despite turmoil at home.\n\nHe took his first government post in 1962, at the age of 33, before being named foreign minister the following year - a position he held for nearly 40 years, before a brief interruption to his service.\n\nHe was without a Cabinet portfolio between April 1991 and October 1992, against a backdrop where many felt he could have done more as foreign minister to prevent Iraq's invasion.\n\nBut the break did not hinder his rise through the ranks, and in 2003 he was named prime minister, moving one step closer to the throne.\n\nHe was quick to assert his authority after being appointed Emir in 2006, dissolving Parliament after four months in power over a feud between legislators and the government.\n\nDuring his first year in the throne, mass protests created pressure for an elected government. The demonstrations quickly turned violent and were speedily repressed.\n\nThere were also a record number of political arrests under his tenure, mainly of dissidents charged with criticising the ruler.\n\nParliament was a frequent arena of contention, with two rounds of Islamist-led election boycotts.\n\nKuwait's legislative assembly was dissolved seven times by court order or under the instruction of Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, most recently in October 2016.\n\nThe following year saw one of Kuwait's most infamous court cases: a mass trial in which 67 activists, including three lawmakers, were jailed for storming Parliament six years earlier.\n\nDozens more have been put on trial for publicly criticising the ruler in person or on social media, both banned by law. Many of them have ended up behind bars.\n\nFOREIGN POLICY ARCHITECT\n\nThe Emir was widely regarded as the architect of modern Kuwait's foreign policy.\n\nAs the country's top diplomat for nearly four decades, he fostered close ties with the West, most notably the United States, which was at the helm of the international coalition that freed Kuwait from Iraqi occupation in 1991.\n\nThe sheikh had stood by Iraq during its 1980-1988 war with Iran before steering Kuwait through the 1990 invasion by its former ally.\n\nHe later emerged as mediator between the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iran, and between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, following Riyadh's 2017 decision to cut ties with Doha.\n\nThe early years of his tenure saw relative financial prosperity, with the emirate's fiscal assets topping US$600 billion (S$821.29 billion) for the first time thanks to high oil prices.\n\nBut the 2014 oil market crash hit Kuwait hard, forcing the government to hike charges on public services and fuel.\n\nHe had three children - fewer than many other Arab monarchs. One of his two sons is a businessman, and the other is a former defence minister.\n\nHis death comes in the same year as the passing of another famed regional mediator, Oman's long-reigning sultan Qaboos.\n\nSee more on\n\nKuwait\n\nObituary\n\nProfiles\n\nRoyal families", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-emirsabah-29092024.jpg?VersionId=Rj1Hq9A.gf0taDnBeJUTvWuLt2q9jvsT", "alt_text": null}]}

Turkey and Azerbaijan called the claim \"absolutely untrue\".\n\nDozens of people have been reported killed and hundreds wounded since clashes broke out.\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but is run by ethnic Armenians and is supported by Armenia. It broke away from Azerbaijan in a war in the 1990s, but is not recognised by any country as an independent republic.\n\nA descent into all-out war could drag in regional powers Russia and Turkey. Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, which is the enclave's lifeline to the outside world, while Ankara backs its own ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.\n\nPLANE DISPUTE\n\nAn Armenian defence ministry spokesman said the Armenian Sukhoi Su-25 warplane had been on a military assignment when it was downed by an F-16 fighter jet owned by the Turkish air force.\n\nTurkey's communications director Fahrettin Altun said: \"Armenia should withdraw from the territories under its occupation instead of resorting to cheap propaganda tricks.\"\n\nAzeri presidential aide Hikmat Hajiyev told Reuters: \"The Su-25 was not even detected by our radars. Let Armenia present evidence.\"\n\nThe Kremlin said earlier that Moscow was in constant contact with Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan over the conflict. Any talk of providing military support for the opposing sides would only add fuel to the fire, it said.\n\nAzerbaijan's prosecutor's office said 12 Azeri civilians had so far been killed and 35 wounded by Armenian fire. The Azeri side has not disclosed military casualties.\n\nNagorno-Karabakh has reported the loss of at least 84 soldiers. Armenia said on Tuesday that a 9-year-old girl was killed in shelling, while her mother and a brother were wounded.\n\nA mother and her child were killed on Sunday, the defence ministry of Nagorno-Karabakh said.\n\nFIGHTING SPREADS\n\nIn a sign that fighting was spreading, Armenia's foreign ministry reported the first death in Armenia proper - a civilian it said was killed in an Azeri attack in the town of Vardenis more than 20km from Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nThe Armenian defence ministry said an Armenian civilian bus caught fire in the town after being hit by an Azeri drone. It was not clear if the reported civilian death was from that incident.\n\nAzerbaijan's defence ministry said that from Vardenis the Armenian army had shelled the Dashkesan region inside Azerbaijan. Armenia denied those reports.\n\nThe clashes have reignited concern over stability in the South Caucasus region, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.\n\nAzerbaijan's defence ministry said both sides had attempted to recover lost ground by mounting counter-attacks in the directions of Fizuli, Jabrayil, Agdere - Armenian-occupied areas of Azerbaijan that border Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nArmenia reported fighting throughout the night, and said that Nagorno-Karabakh's army had repelled attacks in several directions along the line of contact.\n\nSee more on\n\nArmenia\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nWars and conflicts", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/18/ak-placeholder2.jpg?VersionId=0PeQHizGzT6pTUWYqhLF0OTqfP9jv3I8", "alt_text": null}]}

Bush to the White House.\n\nPence, McConnell and some other Republican senators did not reply to questions about recusal. Democrats are likely to seek a pledge that she do so.\n\nTrump announced Barrett on Saturday as his nominee to replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Sept 18.\n\nThus far, Barrett has met only with Republican senators.\n\nWith Democrats opposing her nomination, Pence said Barrett, should receive a \"respectful hearing\" before the Judiciary Committee, followed by swift Senate confirmation. The Republican president has asked that the Senate confirm her before the election.\n\nTrump named Barrett in 2017 to the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the regional federal appeals courts that are a step below the Supreme Court.\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley, who served as Judiciary Committee chairman during the confirmation hearings for Trump's first Supreme Court two appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, said of Barrett: \"With her reputation, I would say that she's got a good chance of getting my vote.\"\n\nShe was due to meet current Judiciary Committee chairman Lindsey Graham later in the afternoon.\n\nRepublicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate and her confirmation appeared a virtual lock. But Democrats could try to make the process as rocky as possible with the election looming.\n\nIf Barrett is confirmed as expected, the court's conservative majority would widen to 6-3.\n\nConfirmation hearings are set to begin on Oct 12. Graham has said that his committee will likely vote on the nomination on Oct 22, setting up a final confirmation vote on the Senate floor by the end of the month.\n\nDemocrats including the party's presidential nominee Joe Biden have said the court's vacancy should be filled by the winner of the election, a view shared by a majority of Americans, according to recent opinion polls.\n\nSenate Republicans in 2016 refused to consider a Supreme Court nomination by Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama because they said it would be inappropriate to do so during an election year.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, interviewed on ABC TV's talk show The View, said \"no one disputes\" Barrett's personal characteristics, but that her presence on the court could threaten healthcare, the environment and other issues.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nPolitics and government\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/30/08706101.jpg?VersionId=EPfVFSZPjVf8fiHCrnhvEfnajrZycLR9", "alt_text": null}]}

Mr Kor knew that.\"\n\nThe judge made clear that Mr Kor was liable, as he furnished the funds \"for the purpose of obtaining a profit from the fruits of the litigation\", based on the facts of the case.\n\nHe further said that Mr Kor's position was different from a lender who extends general-purpose interest-bearing loans to people with little or no money who then use the funds to finance litigation.\n\nSuch lenders, unlike Mr Kor, should not be liable to bear the litigation costs, he added.\n\nBut in the case of Mr Kor, the judge noted that he sought to recover exorbitant profits, as shown by the 30 per cent annual interest rate on the loan.\n\nHence, he could not be deemed a \"pure funder\", said Justice Kannan in his oral judgment.\n\nThe judge found the basis for giving the loans hinged on the money being recovered from the outcome of Mr Rakesh's lawsuit (Suit 963) against his brother, with the interest rate designed in a manner for Mr Kor to enjoy a share of the proceeds.\n\n\"Accordingly, I find that Mr Kor had the requisite 'close connection' with Suit 963,\" Justice Kannan said.\n\nThe saga began in October 2013 when Mr Rakesh was made a bankrupt for the second time.\n\nIn 2014, he asked Mr Kor for the loan to travel to India to stake his claim on his father's properties there and to start litigation against Mr Ashok Kumar Sharma and his wife in relation to his inheritance.\n\nMr Kor, whose business is in ship chandling and textiles, gave $100,000 initially to clear the second bankruptcy and agreed to further sums at a monthly interest rate of 2.5 per cent.\n\nBoth bankruptcies were annulled in 2015, with Mr Kor disbursing $316,750 altogether to Mr Rakesh.\n\nIn May 2017, Mr Rakesh lost his suit and was ordered to pay $156,000 in costs to the couple.\n\nHe did not pay and his brother made him a bankrupt and sued Mr Kor for the money.\n\nMr Ashok's lawyer Mahmood Gaznavi argued, among other things, that Mr Kor, although a non-party in the suit between the brothers, exercised control over it.\n\nMr Kor's lawyers Rabi Ahmad and Varsha Krishnan countered, among other things, that he was merely a disinterested party who provided a personal loan to be repaid with interest, regardless of the outcome of Suit 963.\n\nJustice Kannan found the evidence showed the prospect of Mr Rakesh repaying the loan was \"inextricably linked to the success of Suit 963\".\n\nHe said: \"By providing funds to annul both bankruptcies, Mr Kor removed the only obstacle to Mr Rakesh commencing Suit 963. As such, it is plain beyond peradventure that had Mr Kor not done so, none of the costs in Suit 963 would have been incurred.\"\n\nMr Kor was also ordered to pay another $18,994 for the costs of the hearing before Justice Kannan.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore law\n\nCivil lawsuits", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/tl-court-s290920.jpg?VersionId=gl5DNg4fUnQ8XrUV_tfIseuUoTUD_zBk", "alt_text": null}]}

The players and officials will be at the forefront of the football action and thus we are prioritising them for this initial testing.\"\n\nInfectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam said that it is the right time to consider a resumption of the SPL, noting that Singapore has \"done well\" in its management of the Covid-19 situation, with few community cases recently.\n\nHe said testing players once before every game would be ideal, with fortnightly tests also workable.\n\n\"The swabbing is a form of assurance to the public and players that care and prudence have been exercised,\" he said.\n\nMost leading overseas leagues such as the English Premier League (EPL) and Spanish La Liga, among others, conduct regular testing for Covid-19 among players and officials.\n\nJust on Monday, the EPL announced that\n\n10 people had tested positive for Covid-19\n\nand would need to self-isolate for 10 days.\n\nLast week, West Ham manager David Moyes and two of his players\n\nalso tested positive\n\n- they were asymptomatic. In total, 20 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus since the new season began on Sept 12.\n\nST had reported last Saturday\n\nthat the SPL could return on Oct 10,\n\nshould the multi-ministry taskforce give the go-ahead, and FAS president Lim Kia Tong had noted there were \"some healthy signs\" that raised the possibility for a \"resumption in the first part of October\".\n\nGames will be played without fans and precautions in place will be similar to when the SPL moved to closed-door matches shortly before its suspension.\n\nThere will also likely be changes to the format of domestic league and Cup competitions, with a view to reducing the total number of games played. Originally, each club in the nine-team league were scheduled to play each other thrice.\n\nThere are still question marks over the participation of defending champions Brunei DPMM, with the team's head coach Adrian Pennock telling ST last week the situation was \"out of their hands\" as they have yet to resume full training.\n\nThe SPL fraternity welcomed the news of the imminent resumption.\n\nTampines Rovers chairman Desmond Ong said: \"Clearly we are happy at the news of a proposed resumption but we remain cautious and guided by the taskforce as to how to go about matters.\n\n\"We mustn't let anything put to waste all the hard work put in by all our healthcare workers.\"\n\nCheng Tim Nee, general manager of Balestier Khalsa, said that swab testing is a \"positive step\" towards a restart, adding: \"We hope all will go smoothly and we can resume league action under a safe condition for everyone involved.\"\n\nFor Hougang United midfielder Fabian Kwok, the league's return cannot come soon enough. \"After training for months over Zoom during the circuit breaker, then two months of training in groups of five, and now almost a month of normal training, it's starting to get a bit mundane,\" he said.\n\n\"Ultimately, we look forward to competition again\u2026 and since the end of circuit breaker we have heard so many rumours of when the league might restart. We are tired of them (the rumours) already.\"\n\nAnother player, who asked not to be named, said he was thrilled by the news as the players had felt as if they were training hard \"without a real direction\".\n\n\"I also applaud the move for testing, because I think this is a move that will keep all players and officials even safer,\" he added.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore football\n\nSingapore Premier League\n\nSingapore sports\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-spl-29092024.jpg?VersionId=pMxlJB6pDfuZfiscKsNMyJz_BOOsEYPG", "alt_text": null}]}

The parliamentary speaker tweeted that Sheikh Nawaf, 83, would be sworn in on Wednesday.\n\nSheikh Sabah had ruled the wealthy oil producer and US ally since 2006, and steered its foreign policy for more than 50 years.\n\n\"With hearts filled with pain and sadness for the Kuwaiti people, the Islamic and Arab world and nations of the world, and with faith in the will of God, the Cabinet mourns... Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al- Sabah who died in the United States on Tuesday at 4pm Kuwait time,\" the statement said.\n\n\"In line with the constitution... the Cabinet names Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al- Sabah emir of Kuwait,\" it said.\n\nThe emir had been in hospital in the United States since July following surgery for an unspecified condition in Kuwait that month.\n\nFlags were flying at half-mast in Kuwait, which announced 40 days of mourning. Condolences poured in from the Arab world for \"the emir of humanity\", and several countries in the Gulf and wider region announced mourning periods.\n\nSheikh Sabah sought to balance relations with Kuwait's bigger neighbours - forging close ties with Saudi Arabia, rebuilding links with former occupier Iraq and keeping open dialogue with Iran.\n\nHe tried to mediate in a Gulf dispute that saw Riyadh and its allies impose a boycott on Qatar, and made fund-raising for humanitarian aid in Syria one of Kuwait's priorities.\n\n\"Today, we lost a big brother and a wise and loving leader... who spared no effort for Arab unity,\" Jordan's King Abdullah said on Twitter.\n\nSabah kept strong ties with the United States, which led a coalition that ended Iraq's 1990-91 occupation of Kuwait and used the Gulf state as a launch pad for the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\nPresident Donald Trump earlier this month awarded the US Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, to Sheikh Sabah in what the White House said was the first time the honour has been given since 1991. The emir's eldest son, Sheikh Nasser, accepted the award.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised the emir as \"an extraordinary symbol of wisdom and generosity, a messenger of peace, a bridge builder\".\n\nSMOOTH SUCCESSION\n\nThe Kuwaiti dinar fell against the US dollar in the forward market on Tuesday and Kuwaiti stocks plunged, ahead of the official announcement of the emir's death.\n\nUnder Kuwait's constitution the crown prince automatically becomes emir but assumes power only after taking an oath in parliament, for which elections are due this year.\n\n\"I don't see a major change in foreign policy under the new emir, largely because Kuwaiti foreign policy is pretty popular domestically and regionally and is seen as effective,\" Courtney Freer, Research Fellow at LSE Middle East Centre, told Reuters.\n\nThe succession is not expected to affect oil policy or foreign investment strategy through the Kuwait Investment Authority, one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds.\n\nOil policy is set by the Supreme Petroleum Council, appointed by the emir.\n\nThe new emir's choice of crown prince and prime minister - who would be tasked with managing the government's often difficult relationship with parliament - will be watched closely, at a time when Kuwait's finances have been strained by low oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAlthough most political power in Kuwait is in the hands of the emir, its parliament is one of the most influential elected bodies among Gulf monarchies.\n\nSee more on\n\nKuwait\n\nRoyal families", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/tl-kuwait-r290920.jpg?VersionId=7klRsyklCFCYn1hJAXt7c1OJxi_iQ7b_", "alt_text": null}]}

At the upper end, the proposed hike will exceed $500 a year.\n\nBut given the difficult times Singaporeans are facing now, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said the Government will\n\nsoften the impact of the premium increase with a special Covid-19 subsidy for the first two years.\n\nIn the first year, all Singaporeans will get a 70 per cent subsidy on the increase. This goes down to 30 per cent in the second year. This will cost the Government $360 million.\n\nThis is on top of the existing subsidies of 15 to 50 per cent given to middle- and lower-income groups, and 40 to 60 per cent for Pioneers. The Merdeka Generation receives additional subsidies of 5 to 10 per cent.\n\nIn all, the subsidies for the next three years will amount to $2.2 billion.\n\nThe proposed higher premiums will allow for better benefits, including:\n\n- Higher coverage for sub-acute care at community hospitals - such as for someone recovering from a heart attack - and for outpatient radiotherapy. The daily claim limit at community hospitals is currently adequate to cover rehabilitative care, but not sub-acute care, which costs about 20 per cent more. The claim limit is proposed to be raised to $430 a day for sub-acute care.\n\n- Higher annual claim limit of $150,000, from the current $100,000. About 100 people hit the limit last year and got no further coverage for their large hospital bills.\n\n- Higher claim limits for some charges, such as for intensive care, which will be raised from $1,200 a day to $2,200 a day, dialysis and psychiatric care, among others.\n\n- An additional $200 a day claim for daily ward charges for the first two days of hospitalisation, when most tests and investigations are done.\n\n- MediShield Life will in future also cover treatment for attempted suicide, self injury, substance abuse and alcoholism.\n\n- Lower deductible of $2,000 (down from $3,000) for people 80 years and older for day surgery. This brings it in line with their deductible amount in a C class ward, so patients will not need to be warded just to qualify for insurance cover.\n\nHowever, the cap on claims for people treated at private hospitals\n\nwill be reduced from 35 per cent of the bill to 25 per cent.\n\nBased on recent bills, 35 per cent of private hospital care amounts to far higher sums than bills incurred by subsidised patients.\n\nThe change in pro-ration does not impact people getting private care at public hospitals.

It was revealed last year that only 80 per cent of subsidised bills were fully covered.\n\nThe MediShield Life Council said: \"MediShield Life claim limits should be refreshed to cover nine in 10 subsidised bills, and should be reviewed more regularly to ensure that they offer adequate protection in light of inflation and medical advancements.\"\n\nThese proposed changes are expected to get rolling sometime in the first quarter of next year.

Some 300 relationship managers, advisers, specialists and staff will move from the bank's existing branches to the wealth hub when it opens.\n\nThe bank has 12 branch locations in Singapore, down from 14 at the start of this year. The bank said that close to 90 per cent of its retail banking customers use digital platforms for their daily banking needs, while less than 1 per cent of transactions take place in Citi branches.\n\nIt added that the hub will allow Citibank Singapore to have deeper conversations about wealth with customers, while serving their simple transaction needs digitally.\n\nAt the hub, clients can meet their relationship managers and have access to a team of specialists at a central location.\n\nCitibank's International Personal Bank clients may also use the hub if they wish to transact cash services while visiting Singapore.\n\nThe hub will also have facilities to host investment seminars and events for clients.\n\nMr Brendan Carney, chief executive officer of Citibank Singapore and head of consumer banking for Citi in Asean, said: \"We see a great opportunity for us to serve the growing affluent segment in Singapore, and believe in the need to continue enhancing our client value proposition by investing in this new wealth hub. As we continue to grow our business, we will look to open more of such hubs in the future.\"\n\nThe bank said it aims to achieve double-digit growth in market share and number of clients in the wealth segment in the next few years.\n\nThe new hub will have a biophilic design and it will target to be green-certified. Biophilic design is based on the idea that humans have an inherent need to connect with nature, even in modern settings.\n\nClient meeting rooms will be named after national flowers and trees found in countries and jurisdictions where Citi has a presence in, with some transformed into \"garden pods\".\n\nAn antimicrobial coating will be applied on all high-touch surfaces and safe distancing of at least 2m will be enforced. All rooms will be disinfected after each use and plexi guard shields will be installed throughout the hub as a precaution against the transmission of the coronavirus.\n\nThe US bank is among several players in the wealth management scene here. HSBC in March announced the launch of a new global business - wealth and personal banking - which combines retail banking as well as wealth management and global private banking. It said it is in the midst of recruitment for wealth teams in Singapore, China and Hong Kong.\n\nAs for local banks, United Overseas Bank last year\n\nlaunched its first high street wealth banking branch model at Faber House in Orchard Road\n\nto complement its online channels in a bid to better equip \"emerging affluent\" customers with investment knowledge.\n\nIt defines this group as those aged between 25 and 44, with between $100,000 and $350,000 in investible assets.\n\nDBS Wealth comprises three client segments - Treasures, Treasures Private Client and Private Bank - for customers with minimum investible assets ranging from $350,000 to $5 million.\n\nOCBC Premier Banking and Premier Private Client offer customers access to 13 premier banking centres here.

Most IP insurers continue to make a net loss since the launch of MediShield Life in November 2015.\"\n\nIt added that its priority is to ensure that Singaporeans \"continue to have access to affordable quality healthcare with the additional coverage provided by IPs\" and, at the same time, it remains financially sustainable for the insurers so they are able \"to continue offering these policies\".\n\nLISTEN TO THE BIG STORY PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nMediShield Life\n\nInsurance\n\nHospitals\n\nPatients", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/fhprivhospital290920_0.jpg?VersionId=8.Xb39QWVeOGkDKkAP8BYW5GjDz0C5vR", "alt_text": null}]}

Only California, however, has confirmed that it will end its contribution to heating the planet. China may still have a ways to go after 2060.\n\nConfused? You're not alone, and you can blame the use of imprecise words.\n\nCalifornia's goal includes cutting all greenhouse-gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, and offsetting what it cannot cut, according to the California Air Resources Board.\n\nChina's goal is only focused on carbon dioxide, according to Mr Jiang Kejun, a researcher at the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic body.\n\nThat's not a small difference, even if then Governor Jerry Brown, in his 2018 executive order, and\n\nPresident Xi Jinping, in his speech last week\n\nto the United Nations, both used the phrase \"carbon neutrality\".\n\nCarbon dioxide accounts for only three-quarters of the warming impact that humans are having on the planet. Other greenhouse gases (GHG) have different impacts based on their specific chemistries.\n\nFor example, methane can trap many times more heat per molecule than carbon dioxide, but lives in the atmosphere for a much shorter period of time. Methane's global warming potential is about 86 times that of carbon dioxide's over a 20-year period and 28 times over 100 years.\n\nWe often hear more about carbon dioxide not just because it's the most impactful greenhouse gas, but also because it's likely the easiest to cut and thus targeted first in \"neutrality\" goals. Reducing some non-CO2 greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide produced from fertiliser run-offs, can be much harder than finding replacements for fossil fuels.\n\nHere's one way to quantify the difference between CO2 goals and GHG goals: to have a 50 per cent chance of stabilising global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the world\n\nhas to reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions in 2050\n\nand net-zero greenhouse gases in 2067, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, including the use of negative emissions later in the century.\n\nThat's why Mr Oliver Geden, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, says that China's net-zero CO2 by 2060 goal \"can't be directly compared\" with net-zero greenhouse gas target set by California (2045), Britain (2050) and the European Union (2050).\n\nIt should also not be a surprise, because the Paris climate agreement acknowledges that rich countries have a higher historical burden of emissions and thus ought to cut emissions sooner than poor countries.\n\nMany European leaders have been using another phrase to differentiate between these goals. \"We work towards climate neutrality in 2050, which is not only about carbon, it's also about other gases,\" said Mr Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission, in March.\n\nBut even that's not good enough for climate scientists. \"I don't know what climate neutrality means actually,\" said Mr Glen Peters, research director at the Centre for International Climate Research. \"There's potential for misinterpretation.\"\n\nHumanity's impact on the climate system goes beyond just pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Vehicles and factories also eject particulate matter or aerosols into the atmosphere that can reflect sunlight and even, surprisingly, lower the impact of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. To be climate neutral, then, would mean also stopping any particulate matter pollution, but that's not something the EU has promised.\n\nMr Peters and Mr Geden both prefer the use of \"net-zero carbon dioxide\" or \"net-zero greenhouse gases\" because the terms have a more precise meaning. That won't mean everyone will stop using other terms, but it would make it easier to be on the same page when such commitments are clearly explained on first mention.\n\nMr Geden says the confusion around these climate terms is \"widespread\" among journalists, non-governmental organisations and policymakers. And communicating in different languages only makes things worse.\n\nWhen German environment minister Svenja Schulze translated European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's reaction to China's 2060 pledge, she called it a commitment to \"climate neutrality\" (klimaneutralitat) rather than \"carbon neutrality\" (kohlenstoffneutralitat). The difference in the long term could mean living on two different planets.\n\nSee more on\n\nClimate change\n\nFossil fuels\n\nChina\n\nScience", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/tl-carbon-r-290920.jpg?VersionId=yytK.eOLLUKzr342cFMuMQlfHbgwiklZ", "alt_text": null}]}

He pays $441 annually now.\n\nThe amount of subsidy a person gets depends on per capita household income, age and the annual value of the homes they live in.\n\nThe Covid-19 subsidy kicks in after the premium subsidy.\n\nSo in real terms, the premium he needs to pay next year will be $477, or $36 more - although the premium for that age group goes up by $170.\n\nThe Covid-19 subsidy is only for Singaporeans and does not apply to the more than half million permanent residents.\n\nHowever, PRs who qualify are entitled to the permanent premium subsidies, but at half the rate that Singaporeans get.\n\nMediShield Life premiums can be paid entirely with Medisave. Those who do not have enough in their Medisave account may also tap the Medisave accounts of their immediate family members, such as a spouse or parents.\n\nIf, in spite of that, they still cannot afford the premiums, they can apply to the Additional Premium Support scheme for help.\n\nThe Government has promised that every Singaporean and PR will be covered by MediShield Life from birth to death, with no one left out.\n\nSee more on\n\nMediShield Life\n\nMediSave\n\nInsurance\n\nPatients", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/af_sengkang-hospital_290920.jpg?VersionId=aOpMBggudSfwSVEJP_I0u8wwQ8Z.JO_Y", "alt_text": null}]}

Inspectors were unable to evaluate this as restaurants were closed for about 11 weeks, and dining in was not allowed until June 19.\n\n\"Although we've been impressed to observe how the chefs and their teams were able to reinvent their activity and to develop takeaways or delivery concepts, our policy is to evaluate dining-in experiences,\" said the statement.\n\nOther judging criteria include quality of the products, mastery of flavour and cooking techniques, and the personality of the chef in his or her cuisine.\n\nIt added: \"Under no circumstances will there be any question of sanctioning an establishment in this particular economic and health climate and we will do everything possible in terms of human and technological engagement to highlight the dynamism of international culinary scenes, as we have been doing for over 120 years.\"\n\nOnce its inspectors have conducted sufficient checks on the restaurants, the guide will announce \"in the upcoming months\" its 2021 selection.\n\nSingapore's Michelin Guide started in 2016 and has been an annual affair featuring a gala dinner and award ceremony.\n\nLast year's event, held at Capella Singapore, saw 44 eateries bagging Michelin stars. French fine-dining restaurants Odette and Les Amis\n\nreceived the maximum of three Michelin stars each\n\n\"for exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey\".\n\nNot all editions of the Michelin Guide have been cancelled.

The box runs on Android TV (based on version 10), a variant of the popular mobile operating system that is made for television.\n\nBecause the apps have to be optimised for the big screen, the Google Play Store for the Android TV platform has only a fraction of the apps compared to the mobile version.\n\nBut the essential streaming apps such as Netflix and HBO Go are all available and preloaded on the TV+ Box I tested. I was glad to see Netflix - a glaring omission from StarHub's previous streaming box. The Netflix app on the TV+ Box supports up to 4K resolution with high dynamic range (HDR), which is available with the streaming service's premium plan ($19.90).\n\nBut Netflix is not the reason to get the TV+ Box. After all, the app is already found in most smart TVs.\n\nThe TV+ Box comes with a custom launcher that displays StarHub's pay TV offerings prominently on the home screen. They are bundled into six categories (or passes), such as Western TV shows and Asian fare. The passes can be purchased via the \"Store\" tab at the top of the screen.\n\nUnlike a standard Android TV box, you cannot customise the interface, like adding YouTube to the home screen, which is annoying.\n\nThe device is slightly bigger than my palm. An USB port supplements the limited internal storage (there was only 4.7GB free in my review set).\n\nI like the remote control, which feels more solid than the one for the previous set-up box. It also comes with shortcut buttons for Netflix and StarHub's store, and a microphone for Google Assistant.\n\nIf you plan to play Android games, you'll probably need a gamepad. While the TV+ Box's gaming performance outshines its predecessor's, it still has laggy moments. Try less graphically-intensive games for a start.\n\nIn terms of performance and customisation, the media streaming box - despite the improvements - is still not as good as a top Android media player like the Nvidia Shield TV.\n\nBut it is a convenient all-in-one device for families with members who still watch StarHub's pay TV content as well as those who have already cut the cord.\n\nFOR\n\nPerforms better than previous media streaming box\n\n4K Netflix support\n\nHandy remote control with useful shortcuts\n\nAGAINST\n\nHome screen cannot be customised\n\nMiddling performance\n\nSPECS\n\nPRICE:\n\n$5 a month (with one-year contract)\n\nINTERFACES:\n\nEthernet, USB, HDMI\n\nSTORAGE:\n\n8GB (4.7GB user-accessible)\n\nWIRELESS:\n\nWi-Fi 802.11ac dual-band, Bluetooth\n\nRATING\n\nFEATURES:\n\n4/5\n\nDESIGN:\n\n3.5/5\n\nPERFORMANCE:\n\n3.5/5\n\nVALUE FOR MONEY:\n\n3.5/5\n\nOVERALL:\n\n4/5\n\nSee more on\n\nStreaming - music/video/content\n\nTech review\n\nStarHub", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/af_starhub-tv-box_290920.jpg?VersionId=gvEfW_zZO_MfqccsgNqVjJUIurkObAQ1", "alt_text": null}]}

You get the same rectangular watch case with a crown and a button on the right side.\n\nWhile this might disappoint some, it does mean all the watch bands that current Apple Watch users have are compatible with the new smartwatch.\n\nThe Series 6 does come in new four new case colours - in blue and red aluminium as well as graphite and gold stainless steel.\n\nWe reviewed the graphite stainless steel model, which has a lighter shade of black compared with the space black stainless steel of previous models. This subtle change makes the watch look even more sleek and exquisite.\n\nThe Series 6's always-on display is 2\u00bd times brighter than that of Series 5, according to Apple. It does look brighter to me and I find it much easier to read the time or notifications with this display under bright sunlight.\n\nInside, the Series 6 offers several upgrades, including the new S6 chip, with faster performance than the S5 chip in the Series 5.\n\nThe Series 6's always-on altimeter, a new feature, is able to measure elevation change in real time. It was fun watching the readings going up as I rode the lift to my flat.\n\nBut while it is mostly accurate, I do find fluctuations at times. For example, I found one reading to be 60m when I was home, but there were times it was 30m or 40m.\n\nThe Series 6 is now able to measure your oxygen saturation, also known as SpO2, with the new blood oxygen sensor and app. It will continue measuring even when you are asleep.\n\nThis is in addition to the same health and fitness features - such as heart-rate monitoring and electrocardiogram (ECG) screening - that are already found in Series 4 and 5. And with Apple's new watchOS 7, the Series 6 can track your sleep as well.\n\nWhile the new OS is supported on as old a model as the Series 3, the faster S6 chip makes everything in the Series 6 more responsive and intuitive.\n\nOther new features include a handwashing reminder.\n\nThe built-in sensors will automatically detect when you start washing your hands. A timer will appear, counting down from 20 seconds - the recommended duration of hand washing. A handy feature to have in this pandemic.\n\nPlus, you can set reminders to wash your hands when you reach home by using geo-location with the built-in GPS.\n\nBut due to GPS triangulation limits, the reminder does not work if you are not far enough from your home. For instance, after getting lunch at a coffee shop a block away, the watch did not remind me to wash my hands. But it did after my grocery run at a supermarket further away.\n\nThe watchOS 7 offers several new options for watch faces, such as Chronograph Pro and Typograph. But my favourite is the GMT face, where the digital bezel is in Pepsi blue and red - the same colours found on my dream timepiece, the Rolex GMT Master II.\n\nWith the GMT face, you can select the second world time by rotating the crown to find the city you want. And the second hour hand will point to the bezel to show the selected world time. Great for video-conferencing meetings with people in other countries. And for travelling in the post-pandemic future.\n\nIn terms of fitness tracking, the Series 6 is as good as it gets. For step tracking, the readings were very close to those of my personal calibrated Series 4 - with a mere difference of 50 steps. On my usual 5km jogging route, the GPS-tracked runs by Series 6 were only around 10m to 20m off.\n\nHowever, the sleep tracking can be better. It does not automatically track your sleep like what Fitbit and Garmin fitness trackers and smartwatches do. You have to set the time you go to sleep and wake , or manually turn the sleep mode on and off.\n\nPlus, it shows only your sleeping hours. There is no breakdown of light and deep sleep, which is not very insightful.\n\nBattery life is slightly better than the Series 5's. When I had the watch paired to an iPhone with notifications turned on and a 5km run recorded, the power was at around 50 per cent by bedtime, compared with the 40 per cent in the Series 5.\n\nBut the Series 6 offers faster charging, juicing up from zero to 80 per cent in an hour. I also found that only 6 per cent of its battery life was depleted after a six-hour sleep.\n\nFor those using the Series 5, the Series 6 is not much of an upgrade. But for users of the older models, like myself, it is probably time to upgrade to the Series 6.\n\nHowever, if the price, which starts from $599, is a concern, Apple has also introduced the more wallet-friendly Apple Watch SE, which is priced from $419.\n\nIt looks like the Series 6, has the same S5 chip as Series 5 and an always-on altimeter like the Series 6.\n\nBut it lacks the SpO2 and ECG features of the Series 6, so if you just need basic smartwatch and fitness functions, the SE should do the job.\n\nFOR\n\n\u2022 Sleek design\n\n\u2022 Superb performance\n\n\u2022 Old watch bands can fit\n\n\u2022 Faster charging time\n\nAGAINST\n\n\u2022 Same design as its predecessors\n\n\u2022 Sleep tracking needs improvement\n\nSPECS\n\nPRICE:\n\nFrom $599\n\nCASE MATERIAL:\n\nAnodised aluminium, stainless steel, titanium\n\nCONNECTIVITY:\n\nBluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi or cellular\n\nWATER RESISTANCE:\n\n50m\n\nWEIGHT:\n\n47.1g (44mm graphite stainless steel case, without strap)\n\nRATING\n\nFEATURES:\n\n4.5/5\n\nDESIGN:\n\n4.5/5\n\nPERFORMANCE:\n\n4.5/5\n\nBATTERY LIFE:\n\n3.5/5\n\nVALUE FOR MONEY:\n\n4/5\n\nOVERALL:\n\n4.5/5 (ST Tech Editor's Choice)\n\nSee more on\n\nTech review\n\nApple\n\nApple Watch\n\nSmartwatches", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/dw-applewatch-series6-200928.jpg?VersionId=qGRkUAc3dXN32TNDp6svj.zirboG6ZBn", "alt_text": null}]}

Well, you were incorrect'. No, we were correct at the time that statement was made. But when the scientific data made it clear that we had to change that recommendation, we did,\" said Dr Fauci.\n\nFor example, he explained, there were not enough masks for essential workers initially, so not everyone was advised to wear one. But when the authorities learnt that asymptomatic individuals could also spread the virus, along with the resolved mask shortage, they began strongly recommending the wearing of masks.\n\nThe session, which was moderated by CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter, was part of the two-hour World News Day closing show organised by the Canadian Journalism Foundation and World Editors Forum.\n\nThe World News Day celebrations\n\nhad begun earlier in Singapore with a webinar titled Covid-19: How Can You Contribute?\n\n, live-streamed from the newsroom of The Straits Times.\n\nMr Stelter, who also hosted the closing webcast, said in his opening remarks: \"When it feels like the answers have been in short supply, we have relied on journalists to chase the truth, we've relied on journalists to convey this truth through, and try to cut through the daily flurry of misinformation that surrounds us more than ever.\"\n\nThe two-hour show included discussions on a variety of topics, such as the media coverage of police and protests, urgency and agency in covering the climate crisis, and press freedom in the modern age.\n\nIt featured panellists such as journalists and newsmakers, including protesters and professional athletes.\n\nMr Oscar Jimenez, a CNN correspondent based in Chicago, shared about his experience getting arrested while reporting on live television about a protest in Minneapolis over the death of an unarmed black man in police custody.\n\nHe said it was a reminder that press credentials really mean nothing when you are on the ground. \"Because you - in that moment, whether you like it or not, as a member of the press - are now just part of whatever volatile situation is actually happening,\" he said.\n\nNational Geographic's senior environment editor Robert Kunzig and senior executive editor Indira Lakshmanan also had a chat about the ongoing climate crisis.\n\nThe impact of local news, misinformation and the pressures big technology firms face was another topic discussed, with Google's vice-president of news Richard Gingras sharing his views.\n\nThe show also featured performances by artistes, such as Grammy winner Macy Gray, who sang her hit song I Try.\n\nDuring his segment on the Covid-19 crisis, Dr Fauci also stressed that it is \"extraordinarily critical\" for the authorities to work closely with the media to get accurate information out to the public.\n\n\"Now, for at least 36 or more years since I have been the director of the institute, the one thing that is different right now is that some of the media that I deal with really kind of, I wouldn't say 'distort' things, but certainly give opposing perspectives on what seems to be a pretty obvious fact or a body of data. And so I try not to get too perturbed by that,\" he said.\n\nHe said that American outlet Fox News has good reporters, but noted that \"some of the things that they report there are outlandish, to be honest with you\".\n\nHe also added that he has always kept his political leanings separate from his professional work.\n\nIn the webcast's closing segment, Philippine news website Rappler co-founder Maria Ressa spoke to ABC7 News reporter Kris Reyes about the current state of press freedom.\n\nMs Ressa said that while social media started off very promisingly, it went south as authoritarian regimes were able to control people's behaviour based on data collected, and by suppressing the spread of information by targeting journalists.\n\n\"By next year, I would have been a journalist for 35 years. I have never been under attack as much as I have today, just for doing my job. It is worse than a war zone, it is worse than any conflict zone. And I guess that brings it home - that is the conflict zone, that is the war zone.

They will likely be implemented in early 2021.\n\nHere are some answers to frequently asked questions about the scheme.\n\nQ: What is MediShield Life and who does it cover?\n\nA:\n\nMediShield Life is a compulsory universal health insurance scheme administered by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board that helps cover large hospital bills, including surgery and ward charges, and some costly outpatient treatments, such as dialysis for kidney failure and chemotherapy for cancer.\n\nIt came into effect in 2015, replacing the older MediShield scheme.\n\nThe scheme offers all Singaporeans and permanent residents automatic lifetime coverage from birth, regardless of age or pre-existing health conditions.\n\nIf the MediShield Life Council's recommendations are accepted, the annual policy claim limit will be raised from the current $100,000 to $150,000.\n\nBefore patients can get MediShield Life payouts, they must first pay a deductible of between $1,500 and $3,000 once each policy year, depending on their age and the class of hospital ward they chose.\n\nThis sieves out smaller hospital bills because MediShield Life is meant to cover large bills.\n\nPatients will also have to pay co-insurance on top of the deductible, which is calculated as a percentage of the bill. The co-insurance rate is between 3 and 10 per cent, depending on the size of the bill.\n\nQ: How is it different from Medisave, Medifund and other government insurance schemes?\n\nA:\n\nMediShield Life is a medical insurance scheme, while Medisave and Medifund are medical financing schemes.\n\nMedisave is a medical savings scheme that helps individuals set aside part of their income in their CPF accounts to pay for their personal medical expenses or that of their approved dependants.\n\nIt can be used to pay the premiums for MediShield Life and other government insurance schemes like ElderShield and CareShield Life - which cover only those above a certain age - as well as Integrated Shield Plans (IPs), which include MediShield Life.\n\nMedifund is an endowment fund that provides a safety net for Singaporeans who face financial difficulties in paying their medical bills even after receiving government subsidies and tapping other means of payment, including MediShield Life and Medisave.\n\nMediShield Life does not subsidise visits to a general practitioner, polyclinic or most other specialised outpatient clinics. These are covered by the Community Health Assist Scheme (Chas), a different scheme for which all Singaporeans can apply.\n\nQ: What if I do not have enough in my Medisave account to pay the MediShield Life premiums? Are there any grant schemes I can apply for? Can my family members top up my Medisave account?\n\nA:\n\nMoney can be deducted from the Medisave accounts of your immediate family members, including your spouse or children, to pay premiums on your behalf. You can also top up your Medisave account with cash.\n\nThere are premium subsidies available for individuals from lower- to middle-income households. This refers to households with a monthly income of $2,800 or less.\n\nThese subsidies apply automatically and are higher for those who are older. PRs also receive these subsidies, but at half the amount a Singaporean would get.\n\nSubsidies are higher for Singaporeans from the Merdeka Generation, and those from the Pioneer Generation also qualify for additional subsidies.\n\nBoth Merdeka and Pioneer Generation seniors also receive annual Medisave top-ups of $200 to $800, depending on age, which can be used to pay for the premiums.\n\nPatients who have limited family support and still need help paying their premiums even after subsidies can apply for Additional Premium Support.\n\nThe Health Ministry has said that even with the increase in premiums, a typical household's total premium after subsidies is expected to be within their annual Medisave contributions and inflows. This will continue to be the case even after the one-off Covid-19 subsidy is phased out in 2023.\n\nNo one will lose MediShield Life coverage due to financial difficulties, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said.\n\nQ: When do the higher premiums kick in?\n\nA:\n\nIf the Council's recommendations are accepted, the changes are expected to be implemented in early 2021.\n\nThe council has recommended that annual premiums be increased by 11.5 to 35.4 per cent, or between $15 and $525 a year, depending on the patient's age.\n\nHowever, a one-off Covid-19 subsidy for Singaporeans will help cushion this increase for the first two years after the change. This will cover 70 per cent of the increase in 2021 after other subsidies are taken into account, and 30 per cent of the increase in 2022.\n\nThis means Singaporeans can expect to pay about 10 per cent more in premiums next year, compared with this year.\n\nLISTEN TO THE BIG STORY PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nMediShield Life\n\nInsurance", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/hzelderly0929.jpg?VersionId=b1AKy_ZOYV90nvCBA4Gg_yVmKoL.qUpx", "alt_text": null}]}

Obviously, I would have wanted a different result today, but clay is not his best surface. Good things are coming for him, I think.\"\n\nJust reaching the main draw was quite a journey for Emilio, a former collegiate player at the University of Southern California.\n\nHe is 28 and nearly quit the game in 2018 after a string of disappointing results, only deciding to push on after winning two satellite events in Ecuador.\n\nBut in this strange and disjointed season, he finally broke through in Paris, coming through three rounds of qualifying and saving two match points in the final round against Dmitry Popko.\n\nThirty years after his father won the French Open in 1990, defeating Andre Agassi, Emilio made it into the main draw, breaking into tears.\n\n\"To be on the courts where my father won is something special,\" said Emilio, ranked 155th. \"I'm not a first-level player like him, but I enjoy it.\"\n\nChoosing the same path as a champion parent is not without its perils.\n\n\"Emilio had to carry the name on the back, and it was a heavy load, sometimes even heavier because he thought it was heavy,\" Andres said.\n\n\"But I think Emilio started to enjoy being my son. Everybody is the son of somebody, and there's always expectations and sometimes expectations are a little tougher on some of them. Being the son or daughter of a neurosurgeon, which maybe doesn't get the recognition or exposure of an athlete, for sure in that family you're going to have a big, big bag to carry.\"\n\nEmilio is not the only child of a Grand Slam champion making his main-draw debut at this year's French Open.\n\nThere is also Sebastian Korda, a 20-year-old American who will face John Isner in the second round of men's singles on Wednesday.\n\nKorda's father and coach is Petr Korda, the 1998 Australian Open champion from the Czech Republic who also reached the French Open final in 1992, losing to Jim Courier.\n\nAndres said he and Petr Korda had compared notes on the art of parenting and coaching.\n\nBut the next-generation Kordas are not just tennis players.\n\nPeter and his wife, Regina, who was also a leading Czech player, also have two older daughters: Jessica, 27, and Nelly, 22, who are two of the leading women's professional golfers.\n\nEach has won multiple LPGA Tour titles, with Nelly tying for second in the ANA Inspiration, a Major championship held earlier this month.\n\n\"They are having a good year this year, so we're always in contact, and we're always talking about what we can do better, and how we're doing it,\" Sebastian said of his sisters.\n\n\"But yeah, they're a big help, and I love them a lot.\"\n\nSebastian, nicknamed Sebi, started out with a passion for ice hockey but decided to focus on tennis at age nine after travelling to the US Open in 2009 with his father when Petr was coaching the Czech player Radek Stepanek.\n\n\"He played Djokovic on Ashe at like 10.30 at night,\" Sebastian said of Stepanek.\n\n\"It was completely packed, and I thought it was the coolest thing ever after that. I went home and said, this is exactly what I want to do, just kind of fell in love with it.\"\n\nHome was Bradenton, Florida, which is also home to IMG Academy, the sprawling multisport academy where his sisters developed their golfing talents and where he honed his tennis skills.\n\nFor the Kordas, juggling the travel to support their children's careers has long been complicated and is only getting more complicated: Petr chose not to travel to Paris in part because of French Open restrictions on player entourages and in part because of Nelly's and Jessica's golf schedule.\n\n\"It's challenging,\" he said. \"But once this year will be over and hopefully life will go back to the normal direction and the schedule will be much more firm in tennis and then golf, then I will make my schedule and try to balance it so I can always be between the girls and Sebastian.\"\n\nThe Korda parents taught Sebastian the tennis fundamentals, which included a two-handed backhand, which has developed into his best shot and is quite a contrast with his father's flat one-hander.\n\nPetr is a lefty. Sebastian, like his mother, is a right-hander.\n\nBut both father and son are tall and wiry, and since winning the 2018 Australian Open boys junior title, Sebastian has grown to be taller than 1.9m Petr.\n\nHe is now 1.96m and starting to make inroads on the main Tour.\n\nLike Emilio, he qualified here for his first French Open, and on Sunday he upset Andreas Seppi, a 36-year-old Italian with much more experience on clay and every other surface.\n\nSebastian is ranked No. 213, but not for long.\n\nHis next hurdle: John Isner, the thunderous server who is still the top-ranked American at age 35.\n\nThe next challenge for the late-blooming Gomez: Making the main draw at another Grand Slam tournament on a surface better suited to his tight-to-the-baseline game, although that may not be quite as symbolic for him, his family and those who remember what happened at Roland Garros in 1990.\n\n\"To be here and get through qualifying was already a privilege for me,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the story of my father and our country. I can't be too hard on myself. It's something that means more now. If it had come earlier, I wouldn't have been able to appreciate it as much.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nFrench Open (Tennis)\n\nMen's tennis", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-c1-29092020_0.jpg?VersionId=GakmTx9tuABrvta1knTtVF8xZ.9Up4be", "alt_text": null}]}

Previously, this process could take four to eight hours, said Senior Minister of State for Transport and Foreign Affairs Chee Hong Tat, who attended the exercise.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the exercise, he said: \"That is a good first response to allow MPA, when they arrive on site, to be able to contain the oil spill before further reinforcements are called upon.\"\n\nThe exercise involved around 100 people from the MPA, the Police Coast Guard and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), as well as private companies, including ExxonMobil Asia Pacific, Oil Spill Response and Singapore Salvage Engineers.\n\nSome 15 vessels were involved in the exercise, including four next-generation patrol craft, and the SCDF's Marine Rescue Vessel and Rapid Response Fire Vessel, which put up a water curtain to prevent \"fires\" from erupting, and to disperse toxic fumes.\n\nAn \"octopus\" skimmer system was also used to skim the oil off the surface of the water, while drones were deployed to assess the situation from above.\n\nMr Chee said it is important to do such exercises regularly, as the agencies have to practise responding to different kinds of scenarios and incorporate new technology in their operations.\n\nWhen asked if Singapore would be able to manage large-scale incidents like the Mauritius oil spill in July, which saw more than 1,000 tonnes of leaked fuel, Mr Chee said the authorities can learn from the best practices and mistakes that have been made.\n\n\"Learning and sharing, I think, are very important ways to help everyone... deal with oil spills better.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nMaritime and Port Authority of Singapore\n\nOil spills", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-oils3-29092024.jpg?VersionId=to3aiPV23avpHCaxrW.bejICmKOnm3KB", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-oils-29092024.jpg?VersionId=75ZSvvSj3h1pb4UY3HEMIkolEtD.JZxw", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-oils2-29092024.jpg?VersionId=ZlaDSmuhQhKSPmw9TJ0qhHcZi6ZNuFxV", "alt_text": null}]}

The remainder of federal revenues are made up from customs duties on imported goods, excise taxes such as those on gasoline, estate taxes and other miscellaneous taxes and fees.\n\nWHO PAYS THE MOST?\n\nW2 wage earners - those with a regular pay cheque from a business, government entity or non-profit - make up the largest share of tax revenue through income tax and social insurance withholdings, like the payroll tax that funds Social Security, the government retirement programme.\n\nThose withholdings can reduce Americans' take-home pay by nearly 40 per cent, depending on income, and have made up about 73 per cent of total revenue over the past two fiscal years through August.\n\nDespite high unemployment because of the coronavirus pandemic, withheld income taxes in 2020 have fallen by less than 1 per cent from 2019 levels, partly due to higher earnings early in the year and aid to small businesses that kept pay cheques coming to many idled employees over the spring and summer months.\n\nSelf-employed people, including many business owners, and those paying capital gains or other taxes not withheld from their pay cheques, make up the second-largest category, funding around 19 per cent of the total tax revenue during fiscal 2020 through August.\n\nTAXES BY INCOME LEVEL\n\nThe US tax system has been described as \"progressive\", meaning that the share of taxes paid rises with income, through seven tax brackets.\n\nThe very poorest, those making under US$9,875 a year, are taxed at a 10 per cent rate, while the wealthiest, or those making US$518,400 and over are taxed at a 37 per cent rate. But what the wealthiest pay is often much lower due to a variety of complicated tax loopholes, which can benefit hedge fund managers, private equity firm partners and real estate investors.\n\nThe 2017 tax cuts passed by Republicans and signed by Mr Trump largely kept that relationship intact, but shifted more of the tax burden to wealthy and upper-middle-class wage earners. But income deductions for mortgage interest and state and local taxes paid, the biggest middle-class tax breaks, were reduced considerably.\n\nAmerica's 37 per cent top marginal tax rate is lower than the top rates for many wealthy and developing countries, including the OECD average of 41.2 per cent, according to KPMG.\n\nCorporations got a major tax cut in the Republican bill, when their tax rate before deductions was slashed to 21 per cent from 35 per cent.\n\nIS THE UNITED STATES COLLECTING ENOUGH TAX?\n\nNo. Even before the coronavirus pandemic sparked a deep recession this year, the federal budget deficit in fiscal 2019 was US$984 billion and was forecast in January to top US$1 trillion in fiscal 2020, which ends on Wednesday (Sept 30).\n\nMassive spending to keep businesses and households from collapsing is expected to drive the fiscal 2020 deficit to US$3.3 trillion, dwarfing the previous record of US$1.4 trillion in 2009 and making up the largest share of gross domestic product since the end of World War II.\n\nIf action is not taken to shrink deficits in future years through spending cuts or tax increases, the Congressional Budget Office has warned that federal debts as a percentage of GDP will double by 2050.\n\nSee more on\n\nIncome tax\n\nUS news\n\nDonald Trump\n\nEconomic affairs", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-dtrump-29092024.jpg?VersionId=9Tz3z4m5WUWXSlqqwBKIlBF8k40bfeJL", "alt_text": null}]}

However, he was authorised to use the system only to evaluate his customers' risk level in order to recommend financial products to them.\n\nGoh offered Tang $100 for every four screening requests that he performed.\n\nThe court heard that Tang neither verified nor looked into the nature of Goh's business. He also did not find out what Goh intended to do with the personal information.\n\nDespite knowing that he was not authorised to access the computer system for this purpose, Tang then logged in to DBS' secure computer system and keyed in the identifying details, generating the individual's personal information.\n\nHe then supplied Goh with the personal information over WhatsApp under the name \"Ted Fat\" before being arrested on Aug 5.\n\nCourt documents did not reveal how Goh was dealt with.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Andre Chong argued for Tang to be sentenced to 15 weeks' imprisonment, noting that he \"exploited his position and breached the trust reposed in him by virtue of his capacity as an officer of the bank\".\n\nAlthough defence counsel Kalidass Murugaiyan urged the court to consider a community-based sentencing for Tang, Deputy Presiding Judge Jennifer Marie said that this was \"not appropriate\".\n\nShe called Tang's acts a \"breach of trust\", adding that his use of a moniker showed premeditation to commit the crimes.\n\nIn sentencing, she said: \"(Tang is) not someone to have been so naive to have been misled or misguided.\"\n\nResponding to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman from DBS said: \"We take a zero-tolerance approach towards any breach of our code of conduct, and our employees are expected to conduct business in an honest and ethical manner.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore crime\n\nDBS\n\nCOMPUTER MISUSE ACT\n\nBanks and financial institutions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-statecourts-29092024.jpg?VersionId=Xmalq8nEi7dd64lqLEyd83RmVxpjMYTs", "alt_text": null}]}

Temasek-backed fund Big Idea Ventures, which was a seed investor, did not take part in the latest round.\n\nStart-ups and food giants around the world are racing to invent and improve alternatives to traditional meat production as consumers become more careful about nutrition and the environment. While fake-meat companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat are raising the lion's share of funding as they expand into new markets, other start-ups are working on laboratory-grown alternatives for a potential pool of customers that want to eat real meat and seafood that do not come from living animals.\n\nShiok Meats has raised US$20.2 million in total funding and a person familiar with the fund-raising said its post-money valuation is about US$50 million. It\n\ntakes the stem cells from shrimp before multiplying them in a \"culture media\"\n\n, a solution filled with nutrients. It is an expensive product used to make things like vaccines that is primarily sold by pharmaceutical and chemical companies. It is also a key reason why Shiok's prawn meat now costs US$3,500 per kg.\n\nThe start-up is researching alternative and cheaper plant-based ingredients with the goal of bringing the cost down to US$50 per kg in 2022, when its products will be sold to businesses like restaurants. Challenges remain: Without finalising the recipe, Shiok cannot lock down the exact ingredient suppliers. And the process of acquiring bioreactors - the vessels in which the shrimp meat will grow - will take a year.\n\n\"We can see so many new players coming up,\" Dr Sriram said of the cell-based meat sector. \"The next five years will be about who survives, who makes the cut and who is able to support companies like ours make that step over to large-scale manufacturing.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nStart-ups\n\nInvestment", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-shiokmeats-29092024.jpg?VersionId=VW7NIvZNKLq_NZsXzVCSNYqKNtf12DDL", "alt_text": null}]}

Individuals at four tables were seen consuming alcohol at 10.50pm.\n\n4. Korean casual dining restaurant Ggang Tong in Tanjong Pagar Road was ordered to close last Friday until Oct 4. This comes after the restaurant admitted 12 diners who were seated across two tables. The patrons sat in groups of six, mingled and shared food across tables.\n\n5. On Sept 18, the Chicken Up outlet in Tanjong Pagar was found to have admitted 10 patrons who sat across two tables and intermingled. The outlet will be closed for 10 days until Oct 5.\n\n6. Another drink stall, at Block 26 Jalan Membina was ordered to close until Oct 2, after a patron consumed alcohol on Sept 19, at 11.20pm.\n\n7. The Jamboree Bar & Cafe at Orchard Towers will remain shut between last Saturday to Oct 5.

Vulnerable workers in informal and low-wage work were the hardest hit.\n\n\"We (Asean countries) face common challenges related to the digital transformation of industries, implementing safe workplace measures and adapting HR (human resources) strategies to enable workers to fulfil their potential,\" said the minister in her keynote address at the start of the three-day HR Tech Festival Asia conference.\n\nThe new regional centre was mooted by Singapore and discussed by Asean labour ministers at a conference regarding the future of work that was held last year, with the ministers adopting a joint statement on the future of work.\n\nThe centre will support Asean in putting the statement into action by focusing on three areas that have become even more relevant during the pandemic, said Mrs Teo.\n\nThe first involves embracing technology for inclusive growth. Covid-19 has shown that the workforce's adoption of technology can be sped up if there is a strong enough impetus, noted the minister.\n\nPrioritising workplace safety and health, including the fight against virus transmission, is also of growing importance and an area of consensus, she said.\n\nLastly, tripartite collaboration in designing practical solutions to address emerging challenges is ever more critical amid a continuing economic crisis.\n\n\"Whether it is creating new jobs and training opportunities, implementing cost-cutting measures, or managing excess manpower, Governments, employers' and workers' organisations must work together to ensure that business and workers can continue to thrive during this pandemic and beyond, especially those in lower-end and more precarious jobs,\" said Mrs Teo.\n\nShe said the centre's first initiative is the Asean future of work track as part of the HR Tech Festival Asia event.\n\nIt is also working with the Workplace Safety and Health council to organise the Singapore Workplace Safety and Health e-Conference 2020 in November, and plans to organise a workshop called \"Leaders in Tripartism\" early next year.\n\nIt will have as advisers Asean secretary-general Lim Jock Hoi, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency president Park Doo Yong and Singapore's National Trades Union Congress president Mary Liew, who is a deputy member of the workers' group of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Governing Body.\n\nMrs Teo said Singapore will do its part to support the Asean labour community in answering the ILO's call to \"work for a brighter future\".\n\n\"With everyone's support, we hope that the Centre's activities will help all of us realise our collective vision of a region that is ready for the future of work - one that leverages a skilled workforce, provides safe and decent work for all, and is founded upon harmonious industrial relations,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking about the impact of Covid-19 on labour markets, Mrs Teo said workers in Singapore have not been spared,\n\nwith overall unemployment rising to 2.8 per cent in June\n\n, the highest in more than a decade. The proportion of retrenched residents who were able to secure a new job within six months also fell to an all-time low of 58 per cent in the second quarter.\n\nBut in managing the crisis, there is also the opportunity to prepare for an eventual economic recovery and for the future of work, said Mrs Teo.\n\n\"We can do this by helping workers stay employed and employable, ensuring safe working and transforming our economy and businesses to seize opportunities. These continue to be priorities for Singapore, even as we focus on battling the threat of Covid-19 due to the public health crisis,\" she said.\n\nPermanent Secretary for Manpower Aubeck Kam also said in a speech at the conference that Singapore has pivoted from relying entirely on wage support through the Jobs Support Scheme to opening up the new Jobs Growth Incentive, signalling that the Government will support businesses to create jobs early if they have confidence in their business models and that they should not hold back from hiring locals.\n\nIt has become clearer that industries and businesses across the world are adapting to Covid-19, and some are unlikely to return anytime soon to operating as they did before the pandemic, said Mr Kam.\n\nIn comparison, it had been unclear earlier this year whether demand would quickly rebound as it did in 2003 once the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus was successfully contained, and it made sense then to focus on wage support to help companies keep their workers, he added.\n\nHe gave an update on the deliberations of the tripartite National Wages Council, saying that the issue of flexibility, as well as how wages should adjust as and when businesses recover, are being discussed.\n\nThe council had made its annual recommendations in March but was reconvened in August, as the labour market had changed significantly since then.\n\nMr Kam, a council member, said the group is making good progress on coming to an agreement in the weeks to come. It had originally aimed to release its updated guidelines by this month.\n\nSee more on\n\nEmployment\n\nAsean\n\nCovid-19\n\nJosephine Teo", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/yq-workersgeneric-29092024.jpg?VersionId=OD.OLcpJDez4gQoQno811g1jpgfZQWiN", "alt_text": null}]}

The proxy can also vote on an owner's behalf on the election of members of the collective sale committee.\n\nMr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty, said the change will be a positive development for the collective sales process.\n\nThere have been instances where parties with strong motivation to vote one way or the other at collective sale meetings persuade their fellow strata-title owners to give them their proxy votes, he said.\n\nThese parties could gather significant numbers of proxy votes and influence the sale process in a way that may run counter to the proxy-givers' wishes, he added.\n\n\"The proxy-givers may not be aware of all the items to be voted on during the meeting or the impact of the outcome. The proxy-collectors may vote on certain items in the meeting in a way to which the proxy-giver may not agree.\"\n\nSeparately, real-time electronic voting will be an option for some meetings such as general meetings of companies, charities and registered societies amid the Covid-19 pandemic, said MinLaw on Tuesday.\n\nThis option kicks in from Thursday and will also apply for insolvency- and bankruptcy-related meetings.\n\nWhile voting electronically is already prescribed for governing board meetings for some organisations, the ministry said that doing so in real-time is not yet provided for as an alternative arrangement for most meetings.\n\nMinLaw said this option can be exercised as long as certain prescribed safeguards are adopted and the entity still allows attendees to vote by appointing the chairman or convenor as their proxy to vote.\n\nAmendments to the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings) Orders came into force on Tuesday.\n\nThey allow alternative arrangements for virtual meetings such as annual general meetings (AGMs) to continue until June 30 next year.\n\nCertain entities such as charities, management corporations and registered societies can also\n\ndelay their annual general meetings until Dec 31.\n\nThis would give them a grace period to overcome practical difficulties in organising meetings, physical or virtual, the ministry added on Tuesday.\n\nWith regard to matters that attendees may wish to raise at meetings, MinLaw said the amendments have made it clearer that organisations can allow this to be done at real-time question-and-answer sessions via electronic means.\n\nOrganisations must continue to accept such submissions made via post or e-mail prior to the meeting.\n\nThe ministry also clarified that organisations are already allowed to use virtual AGM platforms or other electronic means to accept submissions in advance of the meeting.\n\nIt reiterated that organisations can rely on meeting arrangements permitted by their governing instruments, such as physical meetings, as long as they comply with the prevailing safe distancing regulations.\n\nMore information on how to conduct alternative arrangements for meetings as well as the authorities to contact for inquiries can be found\n\nat this website.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ang Qing\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nLaw and legislation", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/af_electronic-voting_290920.jpg?VersionId=SX3aByV8xVo42OU34SDL7Fr6ZwTPwWt4", "alt_text": null}]}

He claimed to be a 59-year-old American Chinese businessman working for \"Keppel\", who wanted to come to Singapore to see her.\n\nBut the man proceeded to spin tall tales regarding his \"business\". He claimed, among other things, that his money had been \"taken by the CIA\", and that he and his staff were \"trapped at Customs and needed money to get out\". The man also sent her images of \"himself\" lying in hospital, feigning serious medical emergencies.\n\n\"I started falling in love with him. I also took pity on him and wanted to help,\" Ms Tan said.\n\nThis ruse went on until October 2019, during which she transferred $80,000 of her savings to him in multiple transactions varying from $2,000 to $5,000.\n\nBut it was not over. The man asked her in May this year to allow him to use her account to purchase bitcoin credits. He made three transfers of $5,000 to her account between May and June, telling her that she could keep $500 per transaction as long as she bought $4,500 bitcoin credits on his behalf.\n\n\"Every transaction, I kept $500 for my own usage. As he owed me so much money, I thought it is only right for me to keep $1,500 for myself,\" Ms Tan said.\n\nThe Singapore Police Force stepped in when a series of suspicious transfers were detected between Ms Tan's account and other local bank accounts. It later came to light that she had not only been the victim of an Internet love scam, but that she was also being made use of to launder illegally obtained monies.\n\nMs Tan was one of 2,500 people investigated between January and August this year for acting as money mules. Investigations on her case have concluded, and she has been issued an advisory.\n\n\"When scammers forge relationships with their targets and build trust over time, it becomes easy to get someone to give up their bank information or transfer funds,\" said Deputy Superintendent (DSP) Jane Lim from the Commercial Affairs Department.\n\nThe police have also seen other cases where money mules have landed themselves in hot water for being part of a larger network, sometimes consisting of different layers of money mules who launder the criminal proceeds to make these transactions look legitimate.\n\nFor instance, \"Nelson\", a 26-year-old Singaporean man, was sentenced to 10 months in jail for using his bank account to receive $36,400 between March and April 2017 via 27 bank transfers and cash deposits. He was roped in to being a money mule after procuring sexual services from an unknown woman on online classifieds website Locanto, and subsequently made multiple cash transfers on behalf of a man who he believed was her \"boss\".\n\nThis was done by converting $34,489.25 into Alipay credits for this \"boss\" over 63 transactions. Nelson then kept the balance for his personal use.\n\nDSP Lim cautioned against agreeing to receive or transfer any money on behalf of others, especially if the sources of the funds are unknown.\n\n\"Never share your one-time PIN, or allow anyone to use your bank account, e-wallet, or cryptocurrency account, as you are responsible for all the transactions made through your accounts,\" she said.\n\nFor acting as a money mule to help a criminal retain benefits from illicit activities, one can be fined up to $500,000, jailed for up to 10 years, or both.\n\nSee more on\n\nScams\n\nMoney laundering\n\nPolice", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/eb_scammer_290920.jpg?VersionId=Ib0wKFLdpdz2hjhsxLOatwVUKeZu87SJ", "alt_text": null}]}

We weren't thinking about anything, but the game ahead of us.\"\n\nThere was no panic from Tampa Bay in a dominating game six performance, even though they were coming off a gruelling double overtime loss to Dallas in game five on Saturday night.\n\nCaptain Steven Stamkos accepted the Stanley Cup trophy from league commissioner Gary Bettman on the ice.

I am speechless. It's magical to be part of this,\" Canadian Stamkos said.\n\nSwedish defenceman Victor Hedman was named the most valuable player of the playoffs. Hedman finished with 10 goals and 11 assists in the postseason.\n\n\"It is a dream come true. The best thing I have ever experienced in my hockey career,\" said Hedman.\n\nBlake Coleman scored the other goal for the Lightning, who stormed out the gates and outshot the Stars heavily in the first two periods of game six in front of an almost empty Rogers Place stadium in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nThe Lightning's title run culminated an unprecedented 11-month 2019-20 season that was suspended on March 12 due to the Covid-19 pandemic before resuming on August 1 in a quarantine bubble in Edmonton and Toronto, Canada.\n\nDespite being one of the league's most consistent winning franchises over the past few years, the Lightning have a reputation of coming up short in the postseason.\n\nTampa Bay were in the finals for the first time since 2012, when they lost to the Chicago Blackhawks in six games.\n\nThey were heavy favourites to win the Stanley Cup in 2019 but were unceremoniously swept in the first round in four straight by the Columbus Blue Jackets.\n\n\"Sometimes in failure you find success,\" Tampa coach Jon Cooper said. \"It doesn't come easy. I truly believe the heartbreak we suffered brought us here today.\"\n\nThis time history was on their side, as the Lightning have never lost a series in which they have held a 3-1 lead, including all three previous rounds this year.\n\nPoint opened the scoring on the powerplay at 12:23 of the first period for Tampa Bay.\n\nPoint took a shot, got his own rebound and fired the puck high over the glove of Stars goalie Anton Khudobin. It was Point's 14th goal of the playoffs.\n\n\"The beauty of our team is everyone stepped up. We had a tremendous determination. That is what makes this so special,\" Point said.\n\nColeman scored on a blistering one-timer just over seven minutes into the second period to make it 2-0 for Tampa Bay.\n\nThe play started with a faceoff in the Tampa end and a lucky bounce off the foot of the referee for the Lightning that gave them a quick possession of the puck.\n\nPatrick Maroon carried the puck over the Stars' blue line and passed to Cedric Paquette, who found a wide open Coleman with a perfect cross-ice pass.\n\nKhudobin made 27 saves in game six.

No way.\"\n\nSitting in his wood-panelled office at the institute in Moscow, Dr Gintsburg said his team had been set a tight deadline to produce a vaccine but all the guidelines for testing Sputnik V's safety and efficacy had been followed.\n\nThe plan to publish interim results based on the first 42 days of monitoring volunteers means Russia has a high chance of becoming the first worldwide to announce any data from a final-stage trial, which is known as Phase III.\n\nThe first of 5,000 volunteers was vaccinated on Sept 9, which means interim results could be issued some time after Oct 21.\n\nRussia's sovereign wealth fund, which has invested in the vaccine's roll-out, has said it expects interim results to be published in October or November.\n\nPublic interest\n\nSeveral Western developers are conducting final-stage trials that have already been going on for more than 42 days but have not published any interim results.\n\nDrugmakers have said they would wait until they have enough infections to get a reliable read-out from the data before publication, rather than assigning a specific date.\n\nDr Gintsburg said there was a public interest argument for sharing interim results after 42 days as they would show the general trend in the data.\n\n\"For me, for example, it is too short. But for people who are interested in how things are going, it is already too long.\"\n\nDr Gintsburg said volunteers would be monitored for 180 days after the last of 40,000 participants was vaccinated. Six months on, his team planned to tally up final results and then publish them in an international journal.\n\nTheir early-stage trial results were peer-reviewed and published in The Lancet.\n\nIn parallel with the trial, Russia began inoculating members of the general public considered at high risk on Sept 8, another unconventional move by Moscow in the race for a vaccine.\n\nAbout 400 people have been inoculated so far, according to the health ministry. They undergo a less rigorous medical exam than trial volunteers, though they can submit data about their health following inoculation via an online platform.\n\nA government source told Reuters the interim Phase III trial results would likely inform a decision on whether to expand this mass inoculation drive, starting with people over 60.\n\nRussian roulette\n\nDr Gintsburg said no serious side-effects had been reported during the Phase III trial so far, while minor, anticipated side-effects had occurred among just 14 per cent to 15 per cent of the volunteers. A quarter of the participants receive a placebo.\n\nHe also defended the vaccine's early registration for public use, saying it was the most ethical approach.\n\n\"The choice was between giving people the opportunity to protect themselves, or letting them play roulette with this deadly infection.\"\n\nHe also said Russia was aiming for the vaccine to be about 75 per cent more effective than a placebo, which is above the 50 per cent threshold for Covid-19 vaccines set by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nDr Gintsburg said having 40,000 trial participants meant the trial would be effective even with low levels of Covid-19 transmission in the Russian capital.\n\n\"It guarantees that even with a low infection rate, we would still have statistically significant data.\"\n\nMoscow registered 642 new cases of Covid-19 the day the trial began. The infection rate has risen since, with 2,217 new cases on Monday (Sept 28), though that's still well below a peak of around 6,000 daily infections in the capital in early May.\n\nOther vaccine-makers have launched mass trials in countries such as Brazil, South Africa and the United States, searching for places where the disease is still rife after the epidemic came down from its peak in Europe.\n\nRussia also plans to test in several countries, including Belarus, Brazil and India.\n\nImpossible and unethical\n\nDrugmakers have also pledged to ensure their larger clinical trials include diverse sets of volunteers in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, age and other factors.\n\nRussia is setting Phase III quotas by age to ensure a sufficient number of elderly participants, Dr Gintsburg said, but no other special groups were being formed. Over a fifth of those vaccinated in the trial so far have been over 50, he said.\n\nThe rate of transmission among trial participants affects the timing of when many vaccine-makers plan to publish interim results as they need to record a certain number of Covid-19 infections before early data can be shared.\n\nBritish drugmaker AstraZeneca launched a Phase III trial for its vaccine in May and has not yet disclosed any trends.\n\nUS pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which is developing a vaccine with German partner BioNTech, and US vaccine maker Moderna both began their trials in late July. Neither has made any preliminary disclosures yet.\n\nBioNTech has said it may have data for a regulatory filing by the end of October or early November.\n\nIn a bid to speed up the process of finding a vaccine, Britain is planning to host trials where volunteers are deliberately infected with Covid-19.\n\nDr Gintsburg said this kind of trial was impossible in Russia and considered unethical: \"We were surprised by the news.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nRussia\n\nVaccines\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/eb_russia_290920.jpg?VersionId=iUEpbR3bXEiqQcOP.AHxsQ1gb7WzzSnC", "alt_text": null}]}

He is accused of committing the offences in the early hours of May 19, 2018.\n\nThe married father-of-three admitted that he had fondled the victim, inserted his finger into her and tried to have sex with her in his Kia Carens, but claimed that she participated in some of the acts, the High Court heard.\n\nProsecutors said Tan's likely defence is that he believed that the woman consented to the acts.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Chew Xin Ying contended that there were \"clear and obvious signs\" that the woman was so intoxicated that Tan must have known that she was not in a position to consent to any sexual activity with him.\n\nThe DPP said the prosecution will be seeking to admit two police statements to prove that Tan observed the woman's \"erratic behaviour\" before committing the offences.\n\n\"Driven by lust, the accused took advantage of the victim. The accused cannot argue that he, in good faith, believed that she consented, even if his claim that she participated in the sexual acts is accepted,\" said the DPP.\n\nThe woman cannot be named because of a gag order to protect her identity.\n\nThe court heard that a male friend of the woman had booked a Grab car to pick her up from a bar at Seletar Aerospace Park and take her home to a condominium in Jalan Loyang Besar.\n\nTan accepted the booking and when he reached the bar, the friend told the driver that the woman was drunk and that he had passed her a plastic bag in case she needed to throw up.\n\nAfter the woman boarded Tan's car, she lay down in the backseat and started crying.\n\nDuring the ride, Tan tried to engage her in conversation and asked if she had just broken up, but she did not respond.\n\nShe fell asleep during the journey and was woken by Tan when they reached her destination.\n\nDespite tapping her pouch against the card reader at the side gate, the woman could not enter the condominium. She ended up squatting on the ground and began crying.\n\nTan took her back to his car, as she continued crying.\n\nAccording to Tan's statements to the police, she became agitated and banged her head against the window, so he went to the backseat to console her.\n\nHe then went through her things and found her identity card.\n\nInstead of helping her return to the address stated on the card, he put it back into her handbag and tried to have sex with her, but could not perform sexually.\n\nTan then drove to a more secluded area and after stopping the car, he got into the backseat again and fondled her, but she pushed him away.\n\nAfter some time, she regained some of her senses, and Tan helped her to enter the condominium through the side gate.\n\nBut, instead of going home, the woman \"inexplicably\" went to the toilet near the swimming pool, left her things there, and walked out of the condominium.\n\nShe was later found lying in the middle of the road some distance away by another private-hire driver, who called the police and waited for paramedics to arrive.\n\n\"She was barely conscious, and her panties and safety shorts were missing. The victim did not know who removed them or how, or where they were,\" said the DPP.\n\nA blood test later showed that she had 26mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.\n\nAn Institute of Mental Health report estimated that her blood alcohol content at about 3am ranged between 132.2mg and 155.9mg per 100ml of blood.\n\nDr Christopher Cheok's opinion was that she was significantly intoxicated and not capable of giving consent at the time.\n\nTan's DNA was found on the interior of the woman's bra, while the interior of his underwear tested positive for semen and was found to contain the victim's DNA.\n\nSee more on\n\nRape\n\nSex offences\n\nSingapore courts", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/kc-tan2909.jpg?VersionId=6M9v.ziDFlHkgxiKhW8dI_yV59wGY0IZ", "alt_text": null}]}

It has disputed LVMH's assertion that the French government intervention prevents it from closing the deal and that a material adverse effect had occurred.

The Government may do more to encourage measures like flexible work arrangements.\"\n\nWhile factors like cleanliness were most important in May, more perennial concerns like service reliability and accuracy of travel information are now also returning to the fore of commuters' considerations, Mr Chen added.\n\nIt will take a while more before the new normal for consumer satisfaction stabilises in a post-pandemic world, he said, and more conclusions can then be drawn.\n\nAs for the air sector,\n\nthe huge reduction in flights due to the coronavirus\n\nmade the results for airports and airlines more insignificant.\n\nThe lack of tourists meant results collected this year were not comparable with last year's, with only Singaporeans and permanent residents surveyed.\n\nStill, the SMU survey found that 85.6 per cent of respondents are willing to fly within a year of air travel restrictions being lifted, and that 39 per cent are willing to fly within a month of flights being allowed to resume.\n\nTheir top destinations: Australia, Japan, Malaysia and China.\n\nMr Chen said that\n\nwith more flights grounded and the travel situation unpredictable,\n\nairlines may have to focus more on service and branding rather than the flights themselves to be \"best poised to capture pent-up demand when passenger numbers rebound\".\n\nThese include the redesigning of the customer journey from check-in to landing - to incorporate the wearing of personal protective equipment, for instance - to make it suitable for\n\na Covid-19 world.\n\nMore immediately, airlines must ensure the ease of refund and the quality of their interactions with customers to retain their loyalty.\n\nHe said: \"This is especially important because the dynamics keep changing. Passengers will remember good service during this confusing period, and will choose the airline again when recovery comes.\n\n\"Otherwise, they may no longer choose the airline again.\"\n\nWhen the land and air sectors were compared, people gave Changi Airport the highest rating at 8.08 points on a scale of 10 when it came to perceptions of efforts to keep customers safe from Covid-19.\n\nTrain operators got the lowest rating, at 7.06 points.\n\nMs Neeta Lachmandas, the executive director of SMU's Institute of Service Excellence, said: \"This is not surprising. The airports are emptier because of the lack of tourists while the trains are more crowded after the circuit breaker restrictions got lifted.\n\n\"When we enter very crowded indoor spaces, we all have a voice in the back of our heads that goes 'I hope it's safe and I don't catch something.'\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nConsumer culture", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/nz_mrt_290957.jpg?VersionId=ArQZ.OcAz1b5ZyrFZhPDcNM6bi3X2.r3", "alt_text": null}]}

I think it's really something I have to cherish every day.\"\n\nShe added that university was \"a new experience, a new way of living. I'm willing to learn and to adapt\".\n\nVIRTUAL SOCIAL LIFE\n\nOn campus, where classes resumed in mid-September partially online, reminders for students to maintain social distancing are everywhere.\n\nAccess to the library is one-way, the route is peppered with hand sanitiser stations, and students must reserve a place - then disinfect their workstation with the wipes provided.\n\nWearing a mask is encouraged but not obligatory.\n\nStudents' social lives are also limited, with many welcoming events held virtually, which is a \"challenge\" for new arrivals trying to settle in, according to George Okata, a member of Coventry's student body.\n\nBritain has seen some 42,000 deaths in the coronavirus outbreak -\n\nthe worst in Europe - and millions of people are under renewed local restrictions due to a surge in cases.\n\nUp until now, Coventry University has not experienced the clusters of cases seen at other British universities, which - often after illegal parties - caused them to isolate hundreds of students.\n\nCHARTER FLIGHTS\n\nForeign students from outside the European Union pay significantly more than UK or EU students, and their fees are a major source of income for universities.\n\nIn Coventry, they normally make up one third of the 35,000-strong student body. The number of foreign registrations has halved this September.\n\nHowever, provost Ian Dunn said many were taking up the option offered routinely by the university to start in January, or could even wait until May.\n\n\"Applications were very high and very strong but people are differing when they wish to start... January is looking positive,\" he told AFP.\n\nHe added: \"We're a strong university, we have healthy reserves that allow us to weather particular storms like this.\"\n\nDespite pessimistic predictions that foreign student numbers might collapse this autumn, applications body UCAS has reported a nine-per-cent increase in international undergraduate admissions - although EU applications fell two per cent.\n\nHowever, this is not enough to relieve the pressure on universities, which have invested heavily in online learning and are also preparing for the end of the post-Brexit transition period in December.\n\nNick Hillman, from the Higher Education Policy Institute think tank, cautioned that registration data \"doesn't necessarily mean all those people will actually turn up\".\n\nHe also pointed out that a lot of international students were post-graduates, who were not included in the UCAS figures.\n\nAnd, he told AFP, there was a \"real worry that drop-out rates might go up this year, because when they (the students) get to university, their experience might not be quite what they expected\".\n\nUniversities UK, which represents higher education institutions, noted that it was still unclear how many international students who had received offers would take up their places.\n\n\"We have a short window to convince undecided applicants that they can plan with confidence to study in the UK,\" a spokesperson said in e-mailed comments.\n\nSome institutions such as Queen's University Belfast have decided to leave nothing to chance, chartering a flight to bring in hundreds of Chinese students, according to The Times.\n\nSee more on\n\nBritain\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nUniversities - overseas", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/af_agnes-genoveva_290920.jpg?VersionId=OGOqle8tyq53pefM6J_RWRdpS96Qhyng", "alt_text": null}]}

This led some netizens to criticise her attire as inappropriate, while others complimented her on her figure.\n\nDuring an interview over Google Meet with Singapore media last Wednesday (Sept 23) to promote her recent singles, the singer responded to reports about the incident.\n\nThe 26-year-old said: \"I was bringing my dogs to go swimming, so I was wearing swimwear. Everyone wants to put the emphasis on my body, I think it is disgraceful... I was going swimming, do you mean I can't wear a bikini to go swimming?\"\n\nAsked if the reports had affected how she dresses now when walking her dogs, she replied: \"Is there a problem with the clothes I wear? Why should I pay attention to what I wear?\"\n\nNo stranger to the limelight, Chen started out as a child star at age six, singing and dancing on Australian national television.\n\nAs a child, she also performed the role of young Nala in The Lion King stage musical in Melbourne, and appeared as a child model for the Australian television game show The Price Is Right.\n\nAfter moving to Taiwan, she competed in the Taiwanese singing competition One Million Star; and in 2012, released her debut self-titled album, with the effervescent track Love You becoming a runaway hit.\n\nWith another two albums - Kimbonomics (2013) and #Tag Me (2017) - under her belt, Chen joined record label ChynaHouse Digital earlier this year, and has released the singles 9 Million and 4am Calls. These deal with more mature subjects than her previous work.\n\nFor example, the spunky R&B track 4am Calls is about staying away from men who toy with women's emotions, and who call only when they need you.\n\nIn its music video, Chen plays an employee in a diner when one such man, played by her real-life boyfriend, Taiwan-born singer Albert Lin, enters.\n\nChen believes everyone would see the humour in casting Lin in the role. After all, their relationship is \"very good\", she said.\n\nHowever, she has had past experiences with such \"rubbish men\", For example, she once liked a man who was not very serious about relationships.\n\n\"So I stopped liking him because I saw through him. That is why there is this song,\" she revealed.\n\nIn another new work, the groovy 9 Million, Chen sings about doing what she wants, and having $9 million in her bank account.\n\nWhen asked if this amount was in US dollars or New Taiwan dollars, she laughed and replied good-naturedly: \"Both, both.\" She explained that she used the figure nine because she felt it was a \"nice\" number.\n\nChen's future plans include releasing a new album around the end of 2020, which will include a variety of musical styles, including sentimental songs.\n\nGiven her background as a child star, might the public have different expectations of her, compared with other celebrities?\n\n\"I do not really know what expectations audiences have of me. I only know what expectations I have for myself,\" she replied.\n\n\"I think the fans who really support me - the very loyal fans - they will want me to be truly myself, and not pretend.\"\n\n9 Million and 4am Calls are available on online music platforms such as KKBox, Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nSee more on\n\nMusic\n\nMusicians\n\nTaiwan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/af_kimberley-chen_290920.jpg?VersionId=E1OqSMGQdhOvb8Hq8FMlHJ3nJFN4TwMn", "alt_text": null}]}

The group plans to bring together digital assets across various Tata businesses to create the new entity, according to the people.\n\nA Tata Sons representative declined to comment on the stake sale discussions.\n\nTata's platform - an e-commerce gateway for its consumer products and services ranging from beverages to jewellery and resorts - may seek to compete with the ambitious plans of Mr Ambani, Amazon.com and Walmart's Indian venture Flipkart to tap the nascent market of more than 1 billion consumers. Mr Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, is looking to forge a digital empire, raising more than US$20 billion from big-name partners including Facebook and Google for his newly formed technology venture, Jio Platforms.\n\nDiscussions with potential investors are at a very early stage and there's no certainty they will result in a deal, the people said.\n\nWhile bringing in outside investors would lend credence to Tata's digital ambitions, it may also help the group pare debt after the coronavirus pandemic hammered its flagship businesses. Tata Steel's group net debt was at US$14 billion as of June 30, while the net automotive debt of Tata Motors, which owns Jaguar Land Rover, was around US$6.5 billion.\n\nTata Group already has a bunch of entrenched consumer businesses, many of which also have an online presence. These include Tanishq's jewellery stores, Titan watch showrooms, Star Bazaar supermarkets, chain of Taj hotels and a joint venture with Starbucks in India. The intention is to consolidate these currently fragmented web operations.\n\nAs part of that drive, the conglomerate is building an all-in-one e-commerce app for its swathe of consumer products and services, Bloomberg News reported last month. It is expected to be launched by end-2020 or early next year.\n\nMr Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Tata Sons' chairman and a long-time chief executive officer of Tata Consultancy Services before that, is championing the group's digitisation drive and Tata Digital's head Pratik Pal is in charge of building this all-in-one app, a person said last month.\n\nMr Pal has three decades of experience at TCS, where he was global head of retail, and helped with the digital transformation of some of the world's largest retail chains including Walmart, Tesco, Aldi., Target, Best Buy and Marks & Spencer.\n\nSee more on\n\nBillionaires/Millionaires\n\nIndia\n\nE-commerce", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/rk_digital-tata_290920.jpg?VersionId=CCGZBCKk0F8xeHPjyGC7hyPH8_Pd0BW5", "alt_text": null}]}

United's deal with ALPA would be delayed if lawmakers vote for a second aid package.\n\nUnited jumped 5.9 per cent to US$36.23 at 2.44pm in New York amid a broad market rally. The shares tumbled 61 per cent this year through last week, the worst drop on a Standard & Poor's index of major US airlines.\n\nUnder ALPA's agreement with United, company pilots will fly less and earn less in order to keep all 13,000 aviators on the payroll. Pilots will remain in their existing aircraft type and retain their rank as captain or first officer.\n\nUnited had planned to furlough 2,850 pilots in November and about 1,050 in 2021.\n\nThe agreement reduces pilots' minimum guaranteed monthly hours to 60, 52 or 35 from 70. The cut depends on seniority and how a pilot's aircraft type is scheduled.\n\nThe deal prevents any pilot furloughs until June and comes with a second early-separation programme for United aviators who are 50 and older and have at least 10 years' experience.\n\nIt will also avoid a major displacement in which United had planned to transfer pilots to new aircraft types, which would have required a major training effort, among other changes.\n\nThe agreement will help the airline to respond quickly to any signs of recovery in customer demand, said Bryan Quigley, United's senior vice-president of flight operations.\n\n\"While we still face a difficult path to recovery, your support of this creative and unique agreement puts us in an unparalleled position of strength when demand recovers,\" Mr Quigley said in a memo to pilots.\n\nDelta Air Lines and ALPA are still discussing measures to avoid more than 1,700 pilot job cuts at the company.

Tens of thousands of probable Covid-19 deaths in the US weren't captured by official statistics between March and May, a study in July found, frustrating efforts to track and mitigate the pandemic's progression.\n\nThe dearth of accurate data undermines the ability of governments to implement timely strategies and policies to protect public health and promote economic recovery.\n\nIf the mortality from Covid-19 reaches 3 million as Prof Lopez predicted, it would rank the disease among the world's worst killers. An undercount in deaths could also give some people a false sense of security, and may allow governments to downplay the virus and overlook the pandemic's burden.\n\nNO SYSTEM\n\nIndia has confirmed\n\nmore than 6 million Covid-19 cases\n\n, but accounts for only about 95,000 of the 1 million reported deaths worldwide, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe country, which has the highest number of infections after the US, lacks a reliable national vital statistics registration system to track deaths in real time.\n\nMeanwhile, in Indiana in the US researchers found that although nursing home residents weren't routinely tested for the virus, they represented 55 per cent of the state's Covid-19 deaths.\n\n\"Yes, cases are reported daily everywhere, but as soon as you get to the next tier down, like how many were admitted to hospitals, there have just been huge gaps in the data,\" said Dr Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nMedical data, including duration of illness and symptoms, help to ascribe a probable cause of death, he said.\n\nPatients with heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other chronic conditions are at greater risk of dying from Covid-19. Some governments, including Russia, are attributing the cause of deaths in some of these patients to the pre-existing condition, raising questions about the veracity of official mortality data.\n\nWHO GUIDELINES\n\nIn July, Russia recorded 5,922 fatalities due to Covid-19. At least 4,157 other deaths were linked to the coronavirus, but not included in the tally because of how the nation defines such deaths. Overall, it recorded 29,925 more deaths in July than in the same month of 2019.\n\nThe WHO laid out guidance for classifying coronavirus deaths in June, advising countries to count fatalities if patients had symptoms of the disease regardless of whether they were a confirmed case, and unless there was a clear alternative cause.\n\nA Covid-19 fatality should be counted as such even if pre-existing conditions exacerbated the disease, said the organisation. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released similar guidelines.\n\nStill, it may take health workers certifying deaths time to adopt the methodology, the University of Melbourne's Prof Lopez said. His research has received funding by Bloomberg Philanthropies, set up by Mr Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News' parent Bloomberg LP.\n\n\"Doctors often are learning as they go along, so they're not certifying all the deaths that are due to Covid as Covid deaths,\" Prof Lopez said.\n\nJAPAN DROP\n\nAlthough the pandemic has altered mortality patterns worldwide, not all of the changes are a direct result of the pandemic, he said. Physical distancing measures may have reduced road fatalities and deaths caused by influenza. In Japan, which has been scrutinised for its lack of widespread testing and relatively lax containment efforts, deaths fell by 3.5 per cent in May from a year earlier even as Covid-19 cases peaked.\n\n\"The pandemic actually works in contradictory ways to affect mortality,\" Prof Lopez said.\n\nLikewise, the economic cost of the pandemic - which may top US$35.3 trillion (S$48.42 trillion) through 2025 - will be driven more by changes in people's spending patterns than number of deaths and government-mandated \"lockdown\" measures, according to Prof Warwick McKibbin, an economics expert at the Australian National University and a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\n\"We estimate this outbreak is going to cost tens of trillions to the world economy,\" Prof McKibbin said in an interview. \"The change in economic outcomes is caused by individuals changing their behaviour, not because the government mandated a shutdown.\"\n\nWorldwide, the growth in the number of daily deaths has eased since spiking in March and April, helped by improved medical care and ways to treat the disease. But as resurgences flare in Europe and North America ahead of winter and the flu season, Covid-19 fatalities may rise sharply again.\n\nIt took nine days for cases in the UK to double to 3,050 in mid September, compared with the previous doubling time of five weeks, the BMJ journal said last week.\n\nCovid-19 patients between ages 75 to 84 are 220 times more likely to die from the disease than 18-to-29-year-olds, according to the CDC. Seniors over 85 years have a 630 times higher risk of dying. The older age of fatal Covid-19 cases has made some people think \"they're old people, they're going to die anyway,\" said Dr Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\"I have a really hard time with that,\" Dr Osterholm said in an interview. \"That's an unfortunate and very sad way to come to understand this pandemic.

Teens aren't so lucky\n\nSign up now:\n\nGet ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox\n\nTeenagers are about twice as likely to become infected with the coronavirus as younger children.\n\nPHOTO: AFP\n\nFollow topic:\n\nCoronavirus\n\nPublished\n\nSep 29, 2020, 11:03 AM\n\nNEW YORK (NYTIMES) - Teenagers are about twice as likely to become infected with the coronavirus as younger children, according to an analysis released Monday (Sept 28) by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe report is based on a review of 277,285 cases among children aged 5 to 17 whose illness was diagnosed from March to September. The findings come as 56 million\n\nchildren in the United States resume schooling amid contentious debates about their safety.\n\nScientists are scrambling to understand how often children are infected and how often they transmit the virus, but the findings have been inconsistent. Much of the national debate has centred on children in primary schools.\n\nBut the new study adds to a body of evidence suggesting that older teenagers, in high school and college, are more likely to be infected and more likely to transmit the coronavirus than are children under age 10, said Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\n\"Less emphasis had been put forward on high schools or universities, compared to younger classes, but I think that may be much more of a problem,\" she said.\n\nChildren often have mild symptoms, if any, so researchers have suggested that the low reported numbers of confirmed cases in children may result from a lack of access to testing.\n\nIn support of this idea, the incidence of infections in children climbed as tests became more widely available, the CDC analysis found.\n\nThe number of children tested increased to 322,227 on July 12 from 100,081 on May 31; the incidence of children found to be infected rose to 37.9 per 100,000 children from 13.8 per 100,000.\n\n\"It's not necessarily that the incidence in children has gone up,\" said Dr Helen Jenkins, an expert in infectious diseases and statistics at Boston University. \"It's just that our testing has improved.\"\n\nYet the dissimilar rates of infection between younger children and adolescents may partly be explained by testing.\n\n\"If adolescents are more likely to have symptomatic disease, then they will be more likely to get tested,\" Dr Jenkins said.\n\nThat may have led to greater numbers of confirmed cases among adolescents.\n\nIn the CDC study, 58 per cent of school-aged children with confirmed infections reported at least one symptom; only 5 per cent reported having no symptoms. Information on symptoms was missing for 37 per cent of the children.\n\n\"The chances are that this is just catching kids that are symptomatic,\" said Dr Megan Ranney, an expert in adolescent health at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nOther studies have suggested that half of children infected with the coronavirus have no symptoms. The number of cases among children could be twice as high as those reported by the CDC, Dr Ranney suggested.\n\nThe incidence of confirmed coronavirus infections increased threefold among those under age 19 from May to July, and was highest among young adults 20 to 29 years old.\n\nThese data suggest that \"young persons might be playing an increasingly important role in community transmission,\" the CDC researchers wrote.\n\nThe number of tests and the incidence of infections decreased after July, but may again be on the rise, they added.\n\nThe rate of infection during the study period varied by age. The weekly incidence among adolescents was 37.4 per 100,000, compared with 19 per 100,000 among younger children.\n\nChildren who had pre-existing medical problems were more likely to become severely ill, the analysis also found. Among school-aged children who were hospitalised, who were admitted to an intensive care unit or who died, 16 per cent, 27 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively, had at least one underlying medical condition.\n\nBut many of the children had no such conditions. By comparison, about half of children who die after getting the flu have an underlying condition.\n\nIn the case of the coronavirus, \"a kid doesn't necessarily have to be sick already to die,\" Dr Ranney said. \"They don't have to have a preexisting condition in order to get really sick from Covid-19,\" the illness caused by the coronavirus.\n\nOf 161,387 infected children whose race and ethnicity were known, 42 per cent were Hispanic, 32 per cent were white and 17 per cent were Black, the CDC researchers reported. Deaths among children were rare overall, but Hispanic and Black children were more likely to be hospitalised or admitted to an ICU.\n\nThese data are consistent with studies among adults showing that communities with a high proportion of frontline workers are hardest hit by the pandemic, Dr Cevik said.\n\nHow often children are infected and how efficiently they transmit the virus have been among the most contentious issues of the pandemic.\n\nRecently in JAMA Pediatrics, researchers reviewed 32 studies worldwide comprising 41,640 children and adolescents under age 20, as well as 268,945 adults. The analysis also included 18 studies, including three based in schools, in which scientists had traced the contacts of infected individuals.\n\nThe analysis found - like the new CDC study - that younger children are roughly half as likely as adults to become infected, and that children older than 14 may be just as likely as adults to be infected. Antibody studies also suggested that adolescents seemed to be similar to adults in terms of their risk of infection.\n\nExperts praised the scientists for trying to make sense of studies that vary widely in methods, in cultural milieu and even in how they defined children - ranging anywhere from 10 years to 20 years as the outer limit.\n\nThe evidence overall from these studies suggested that younger children are relatively protected from the virus, but older teenagers - those aged 15 and older - are roughly at the same risk as adults, said Dr Cevik, who led a similar analysis.\n\n\"I think we need to consider the older adolescent group, over the age of 15, as an adult, because they have similar social patterns,\" she said. \"Also, they have potentially much larger networks, compared to adults.\"\n\nOther experts said it was clear that younger children could transmit the virus, even if less efficiently than older teenagers and adults - and thus might help perpetuate an outbreak, particularly in communities with high levels of infections.\n\n\"We know that they can get the virus,\" said Dr Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University in New York, referring to children. \"And if we know that they are able to pass it on, if we presume that they're not complete dead ends, then they're participating in the transmission cycle.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nChildren and youth", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/rk_teenagers_290920.jpg?VersionId=r.lbH8KDz6JblICu9MDEbPpDXs2GyytX", "alt_text": null}]}

There was also an upsize option to issue additional units, which would have increased the placement's total gross proceeds to around $675 million.\n\nThe placement \"drew strong demand from new and existing institutional and other accredited investors\", said the manager on Tuesday.\n\nThe manager on Monday afternoon announced an equity fund-raising comprising the private placement and a non-renounceable preferential offering.\n\nFor the preferential offering, the issue price was likewise fixed at the low end of its range, at $2.34 per new unit. This is at a 7 per cent discount to the VWAP and, for illustrative purposes, at a 5.3 per cent discount to the adjusted VWAP.\n\nThe indicative price range had been $2.34 to $2.42 per unit for the offering.\n\nOn Tuesday, the manager said the preferential offering is expected to raise about $759.7 million.\n\nAbout 324.6 million new units will be issued, based on 290 preferential offering units for every 1,000 existing units held as at 5pm on Oct 6.\n\nIn addition, some 244.7 million new units will be issued under the private placement.\n\nIn connection with the private placement, the manager plans to declare - in respect of the existing FCT units - a cumulative distribution for the period from April 1, 2020, to the date immediately before the new units are issued under the placement. The private placement units are expected to be issued on or around Oct 7.\n\nAlso, the manager will declare a distribution of the Reit's distributable income that was earlier retained for the periods from Oct 1, 2019, to Dec 31, 2019, and from Jan 1, 2020, to March 31, 2020.\n\nThe aggregate distribution is thus estimated to be 4.485 Singapore cents per existing unit. This is made up of the cumulative distribution of about 2.804 cents and the retained distribution of about 1.681 cents.\n\nThe manager said it will announce the actual quantum of the aggregate distribution in due course.\n\nAssuming the preferential offering is fully subscribed, the equity fund-raising's gross proceeds will total about $1.33 billion. This will comprise more than 45 per cent of FCT's present market capitalisation, said Mr Richard Ng, chief executive officer of the Reit manager.\n\nAbout 76.3 per cent or $1.02 billion of the gross proceeds will finance FCT's acquisition of the rest of AsiaRetail Fund, while some 21.3 per cent or $284.9 million will go into paring down existing debts.\n\nFCT units closed at $2.52 last Friday, before the manager called for a trading halt on Monday morning.

But the world's most indebted real estate company has a series of funding options that could help it avoid\n\na market-destabilising cash crunch.\n\nAsset sales, stock listings and\n\na boost in holiday condo sales\n\nare among ways that the property developer can restore investor confidence\n\nafter its stock and several bonds plunged last week.\n\nEvergrande units could raise as much as US$9.3 billion from stock sales alone, according to estimates from Glenn Ko at HSBC Holdings.\n\nThe developer doesn't have a lot of time. Strategic investors have the right to demand repayments for the US$19 billion they poured into the company three years ago unless Evergrande is able to win a listing in China by Jan 31. The timing for a decision isn't clear, but some analysts doubt Evergrande will get approval as policymakers restrict funding options for developers to cool market speculation.\n\nEvergrande shares fell 6.9 per cent at 10.05am in Hong Kong, after soaring 21 per cent Monday. Its US dollar bond due in 2025 rose 1.6 US cents on the dollar to 75.6 US cents, Bloomberg-compiled prices show. The onshore note due 2024 jumped to 82 yuan.\n\nWithout the Shenzhen listing, here are some of the alternatives for Evergrande to raise money or reduce costs to pare its US$120 billion debt load.\n\nHong Kong IPO: Evergrande is planning to tap the soaring demand for property management companies by spinning off its services business via a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The Shenzhen-based developer won approval last week for the sale, which could raise US$1 billion to US$2 billion, people familiar with the matter said. HSBC said the initial public offering could raise as much as 30 billion yuan (S$6.03 billion) by year end.\n\nThe unit is valued at about US$11 billion based on a recent funding round that raised US$3 billion, and could soon join service firms such as Times Neighbourhood Holdings that are winning lofty valuations from demand for butler-like services from the millions of condos in China.\n\nHong Kong sale: If the China listing fails, Evergrande could look to a secondary stock sale in Hong Kong, where it already trades. Any additional sales in Hong Kong wouldn't be subject to the mainland securities regulators, according to Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) analysts Kristy Hung and Patrick Wong. \"Evergrande's aim for a backdoor listing in mainland China could backfire, with Chinese developers increasingly looking to Hong Kong for equity raising instead of at home.\"\n\nEvergrande would join developers that have raised US$12.9 billion in additional equity in Hong Kong since 2017, the BI analysts note. That dwarfs the US$58 million raised by the sector in China over the same period.\n\nSell condos: Evergrande is counting on a surge in real estate sales to raise additional cash for its debt obligations and possibly repay the strategic investors. The firm has raised 452 billion yuan in cash from property sales this year to Sept 24, an increase of 51 per cent from a year earlier, according to HSBC. More condo sales are expected from the \"golden week\" holidays, which start Oct 1.\n\nLast month, Evergrande targeted 200 billion yuan of project sales in September and October, led by a sales promotion with deep discounts. The developer may also reduce its land purchases to preserve cash, according to a report by analysts at CGS-CIMB in Hong Kong.\n\nRefinance: Beijing is looking to tighten access to funding across China's highly indebted property sector. The widely circulated \"three red lines\" policy restricting bank borrowing for real estate firms may impact some lower-rated issuers, according to S&P.\n\nEvergrande has probably crossed the \"red lines\", meaning selling new bonds will be difficult if the policy is implemented, though they could continue to refinance existing debt, HSBC said.\n\nThe developer will have to repay about US$5.8 billion of bonds and loans over the next two months, raising the prospect of sharply higher refinancing costs if investors balk.\n\nTap bank assets: Banks and trust firms, with almost 600 billion yuan of outstanding debt, have turned more cautious on Evergrande, threatening to cut off its biggest source of funding. Several banks have decided not to allow the developer to draw on unused credit lines, while some trust firms called Evergrande last week to gauge the prospect of repaying the investors on time, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nEvergrande has a trove of financial assets it could sell to ease the immediate crunch. Last year it raised its stake in Shengjing Bank, a lender with over one trillion yuan of assets in the north-east province of Liaoning. It owns 36 per cent and is the largest shareholder, with a stake worth about HK$22 billion (S$3.89 billion). It also holds 50 per cent of Evergrande Life Insurance, with assets of 189 billion yuan.\n\nOther assets: Billionaire Hui Ka Yan, who controls Evergrande and has amassed a fortune worth US$22 billion, has other asset levers to pull if he chooses. Among his prized possessions is the Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao soccer team, the most valuable club in China, according to Forbes. The developer could also look to sell a portion of its massive land holdings.\n\nMr Hui has aspirations to take on Elon Musk in the electric vehicle business, through China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group. The auto unit plans to list shares in Shanghai, a transaction that CGS-CIMB analysts said could reduce net gearing by 30 percentage points. The stock sale could raise 34 billion yuan, according to HSBC estimates. Unlike the parent company's shares, which are down about 23 per cent this year, the electric vehicle stock has jumped 160 per cent in Hong Kong.\n\nBuy time: While one of the strategic investors - Suning Appliance Group - has indicated it won't extend the deadline for repayment beyond January, it's not clear if the other investors will be as rigid. Many of them are Evergrande suppliers with long-standing relationships.\n\n\"Suning's case is a bit unique as the company's liquidity is tight,\" HSBC said in its note. \"The request for full redemption\" by Jan 31 is unlikely.\n\nAnother option for the strategic investors is to accept shares of Evergrande or the other units, HSBC said. With a 72 per cent stake, Mr Hui could dilute his shares and still maintain control.\n\nFrank Pan at JPMorgan Chase & Co agrees on the potential extension: \"Our base case remains that Evergrande would reach a mutual agreement with the investors should it miss the extended deadline again, leading to another extension.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nBond/Debt market\n\nChina\n\nProperty market/sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/rk_evergrande_290920.jpg?VersionId=OtLZdMuo1dDuVvMbuYRgL_uxW7r8W7_h", "alt_text": null}]}

I'd expect the markets to be weak, volatile, and have some downside here as we're waiting to find out who our next president is.\"\n\nIn early trade, Hong Kong and Tokyo were in negative territory along with Wellington and Manila, though Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore and Jakarta all posted nice gains. Sydney and Taipei were also up.\n\nTuesday sees\n\nthe first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden,\n\nwhich will be closely watched as the president comes under pressure after a report at the weekend said he had paid barely any federal income tax for years.\n\nBut while Biden continues to lead in polls, AxiCorp's Stephen Innes said: \"Prediction markets show that Joe Biden's lead over Trump has narrowed from +24 in late July to +10-6, depending on which cohorts you follow.\n\n\"A more convincing showing by the incumbent could drive concerns around negative US foreign policy implications for China.\"\n\nThe imposition of new, lighter, lockdown measures is also keeping traders on their toes, with London and parts of northern England facing stricter rules, while France, Spain and Germany are also battling against a new surge in virus infections. The moves are raising concerns that the tentative recovery from the near-global shutdown earlier in the year could be derailed.\n\nHowever, a top International Monetary Fund official said the economic outlook was not as bad as it had previously feared.\n\n\"Recent incoming data suggests that the outlook may be somewhat less dire\" than projected in the Washington-based crisis lender's World Economic Outlook published in June, spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters, noting \"parts of the global economy (are) beginning to turn the corner\".\n\nOn currency markets, the pound extended Monday's rally on hopes for a breakthrough in\n\npost-Brexit trade talks between Britain and the European Union.\n\nDespite Prime Minister Boris Johnson pressing ahead with a controversial bill that would override parts of a divorce treaty signed last year, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen insisted that a deal was still possible ahead of an EU summit on October 15.\n\nSee more on\n\nStock market\n\nGlobal economy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/nz_nikkei_290952.jpg?VersionId=x0FywCNlmSZtQi2VrSmmhizfhhCngzeR", "alt_text": null}]}

But the figure is far less than the roughly 25 million Chinese who would have escaped poverty if not for the pandemic.\n\n\"Sickness, unemployment and school closures could lead to the erosion of human capital and earning losses that last a lifetime,\" the World Bank said in its report.\n\nIt estimated that as a result of school closures due to Covid-19, the average student in the region could face a reduction of 4 per cent in expected earnings every year of his working life.\n\nThe twice-yearly report focuses on nearly two dozen developing countries in the region: Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Vietnam, and 11 Pacific Island countries. It was previously released in April.\n\nWhile many countries have been successful in containing the coronavirus, with many governments having stepped in to give fiscal support to households and companies, they will struggle to recover and grow, said Dr Mattoo.\n\nAmong its key recommendations, the report called for countries to develop testing, tracing and isolating capacities to contain further disease surges, as well as a safe way of reopening schools and a fair and efficient vaccine distribution system.\n\nIt also urged governments to widen their tax bases to avoid excessive borrowing, boost social protections, and equip workers to adapt to digital technologies and services that the pandemic accelerated.\n\nSupport for firms is also needed to prevent bankruptcies and unemployment, but these firms should have the potential to thrive in the future, the World Bank said.\n\nSee more on\n\nWorld Bank\n\nPoverty\n\nEconomic growth", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/rk_china-poverty_290920.jpg?VersionId=9hmNlmIbwsyaEyFWIaz90VkvopvAOMsq", "alt_text": null}]}

Dr Redfield later told NBC that he was speaking about Dr Atlas.\n\nDr Atlas, a neuroradiologist with no background in infectious diseases, has faced scrutiny for downplaying the importance of face masks and his reported views on \"herd immunity,\" an approach that holds that once enough individuals have been infected and become immune, others are less likely to be infected.\n\nThe White House insists it is not pursuing such a strategy, although Mr Trump has mentioned it himself, and repeated on Monday his view that the United States was \"rounding the corner\" on the pandemic.\n\nDr Atlas' views on handling the pandemic have been denounced by his peers at Stanford University's medical school and other health experts.\n\nDr Atlas on Monday defended his advice to the president. \"Everything I have said is directly from the data and the science,\" he said in a statement released by the White House.\n\nIn a statement, the CDC said comments about Dr Atlas overheard by NBC were just one side of a \"private discussion regarding a number of points he has made publicly about Covid-19.\"\n\nThe agency said Dr Redfield differed with Dr Atlas on mask wearing, youth Covid-19 infections and herd immunity status, but agreed with him on many other issues.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said Mr Trump's advisers sometimes disagreed, and that the president made policy decisions based on all the information he received.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment when asked if Dr Redfield's position was in jeopardy.\n\n\"When the president loses confidence in somebody, you will know it,\" said one senior administration official.\n\n'NOWHERE NEAR THE END'\n\nThe United States, which has not had a coordinated federal-led response to the virus, has recorded more than 7.1 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 205,000 deaths, both the highest in the world.

On Sept 19, US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco blocked a similar ban on Tencent Holding Ltd's WeChat.\n\nThe court decisions show that, while judges may agree with the notion that China poses a threat, the administration hasn't yet shown that the apps themselves are a problem. It's at least a temporary setback for President Donald Trump, who has argued that the Chinese owners of TikTok and WeChat are collecting personal data on Americans.\n\nMr Nichols acknowledged in his ruling that the US provided \"ample evidence\" that China is a risk to national security, but said the government's evidence of the threat posed by TikTok \"remains less substantial.\"\n\nMs Beeler reached a similar conclusion. \"While the government has established that China's activities raise significant national security concerns - it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all US users addresses those concerns,\" she said in her Sept 19 order.\n\nBoth companies sued to delay the bans and then asked judges for more time to resolve the disputes.\n\nIn the WeChat case, the US government said in a court filing it will submit classified information to support its request that Ms Beeler lift her injunction blocking the ban. The Trump administration has yet to make a similar filing in the TikTok case, where Mr Nichols on Sunday blocked a ban that was set to go into effect at midnight.\n\nTikTok's Chinese owner would likely succeed in proving the Trump administration exceeded its legal authority, Mr Nichols said in his ruling.\n\nThe emergency powers invoked by Mr Trump don't allow him to prohibit \"information materials and personal communications,\" given that TikTok is used mostly to share videos, photographs, art and news, the judge said. And it is \"not plausible\" that any of that content would fall under the nation's Espionage Act, he said.\n\nThe judge's reasoning for his Sunday ruling remained sealed until Monday because some of the government's filings in the case contained confidential business information.\n\nWhile Mr Nichols granted a preliminary injunction against the ban on new downloads, he declined to halt a separate set of prohibitions scheduled for Nov 12, which are designed to further curb the app's use unless the company finds a US buyer for the assets.\n\nThe download ban would have removed TikTok from stores run by Apple Inc and Google's Android, the most widely used marketplaces for apps.\n\nPeople who didn't yet have the app wouldn't have been able to get it, and those who already had it wouldn't have had access to updates needed to ensure its safe and smooth operation. TikTok has been downloaded by more than 100 million Americans.\n\nIn his opinion, Mr Nichols said the ban would have done \"irreparable harm\" to TikTok, which has been growing at a rate of 424,000 new users a day in the US.\n\n\"Barring TikTok from US app stores would, of course, have the immediate and direct effect of halting the influx of new users, likely driving those users to alternative platforms and eroding TikTok's competitive position,\" Mr Nichols wrote.\n\nThe Nichols ruling provided a reprieve for TikTok, but it is not the end of the legal battle. TikTok still faces a Nov 12 deadline to agree on a deal to sell its US business to an American buyer, or face the next set of prohibitions.\n\nByteDance is seeking government clearance to sell a stake of its US business to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. But while Mr Trump has said he's given the deal his \"blessing,\" the proposal requires formal approval from a government panel that oversees foreign investment in the US.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nTikTok\n\nSecurity issues", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/nz_tiktokwechat_290935.jpg?VersionId=pwoqMDBi98_xtG1oNfQjMQKuhn4vlCV7", "alt_text": null}]}

Even as the new coronavirus continued to spread, fewer people were winding up in the hospital because of Covid-19, and fewer were dying.\n\nNow, as the seasons turn, there are signs suggesting there will be more deaths and serious illness ahead.\n\nData collected by the Covid Tracking Project shows that the number of people hospitalised has plateaued at about 30,000 in the past week, after a decline from nearly 60,000 that began in late July. Deaths, meanwhile, averaged about 750 over the seven days through Sunday (Sept 27) , higher than the roughly 600 deaths a day in the first week of July.\n\nScientists had hoped that a warm-weather reprieve could soften an expected re-emergence of the coronavirus in the colder months. Instead, the contagion continued to spread across the country after Memorial Day, with early-summer outbreaks in Sun Belt states followed by the recent surge of new infections in the Upper Midwest and on college campuses nationwide.\n\nAny indication hospitals are attending to more coronavirus patients is likely to reignite concerns that the healthcare system could be overwhelmed by new cases as the weather cools and more activities, including school and holiday socialising, move indoors.\n\nHistory and science suggest the second winter with coronavirus is likely to be worse than the first. The pathogen is more entrenched and most respiratory viruses circulate primarily in the winter months.\n\n\"We haven't had exposure to Covid throughout an entire winter, when more people are indoors and close together for prolonged periods,\" said Professor William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. \"We are certainly concerned that Covid could spread even more readily in the winter than it has so far.\"\n\nMORE TESTING\n\nThe Trump administration has pointed to the increasing availability of coronavirus tests as the reason the number of new cases in the US remains high. Diagnostics manufacturers are now shipping more than 1.2 million tests nationwide each day, up from 600,000 at the start of May, according to AdvaMed, a trade group for the medical-technology industry.\n\nIncreased testing has also made it possible to catch coronavirus cases earlier. That, combined with improved hospital care and medicines like Gilead Sciences Inc's remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, allowed more patients to survive their infections this summer.\n\nHowever, a week-long plateau in new cases, hospitalisations and deaths are an early warning that things could be about to get worse. Along with the resumption of school, more states are easing curbs on restaurants and bars, giving the virus more chances to find vulnerable people to infect. Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis lifted capacity limits on restaurants and other businesses.\n\n\"It's not complicated to explain. All of that opening up, so many people taking off their masks, gathering together in bars and parties, going back to the old normal,\" Prof Schaffner said. \"We should not be surprised that we are seeing an increase in Covid again. Covid loves that environment.\"\n\nStates that had been doing well, including New York, which was wracked early on by the virus, are seeing a new surge. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said there were 868 new cases in the state on Sept 27, an 18 per cent increase from two weeks earlier. A higher percentage of those getting tested are now coming back positive, suggesting the amount of virus in the community is on the rise.\n\nCASES IN KIDS\n\nSimilar increases are happening among the nation's children, as more than 56 million returned to school this month. More than a quarter of a million children were infected with coronavirus from March through Sept. 19, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nWhile those hardest hit were more likely to have other conditions, about three of every four who were hospitalised, needed intensive care or died had no other health concerns, the CDC said.\n\nThe number of cases among children has increased dramatically since the start of September, when many went back to school in person at least part time.\n\nCoronavirus cases in those 19 and younger have increased three-fold since May, according to the CDC, suggesting they may play an increasingly important role in community transmission even if their individual risk of serious illness is low.\n\n\"School studies suggest that in-person learning can be safe in communities with low Sars-CoV-2 transmission rates, but might increase transmission risk in communities where transmission is already high,\" the agency said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/nz_nyc_290937.jpg?VersionId=_kPhJTuvnf4SGpt4Oz1vDHgBA07rcAMl", "alt_text": null}]}

The last vote was on the bigger, US$3.4 trillion Heroes Act back in May.\n\nMs Pelosi said earlier Monday that the White House will have to agree to \"much more\" spending for a fresh round of stimulus if there is any hope of striking a deal before the election.\n\n\"We can get this done,\" Ms Pelosi said Monday on MSNBC, while emphasising the need for more money.\n\nA key source of division has been Democrats' push for large-scale aid to state and local authorities. The plan released Monday has US$436 billion for one year of assistance, less than a previous demand for US$915 billion, which had triggered scorn among Mr Trump administration officials who called it a bailout for poorly run states.\n\nThe Democratic plan includes new aid for airlines, restaurants and small businesses that wasn't in in the original package passed by the House in May, and it has more than double the amount for schools.\n\nThe Bill would provide another round of $1,200 direct relief payments to individuals and US$500 per dependent - less than the US$1,200 for dependents Democrats originally proposed.

Many called the pandemic a hoax - even as the global death toll neared 1 million.\n\n\"No more lies, no more masks, no more lockdown,\" one sign read.\n\nIn Berlin, Brussels, Dublin and Paris, similar gatherings have gone ahead in recent weeks as coronavirus cases are again rising across much of Europe.\n\nBut with health experts warning that a second wave has already arrived in some places and with many governments moving to reintroduce restrictions, the ranks of those dismissing the dangers of the virus and others calling it a government-led hoax have swelled.\n\nDaniel Jolley, a senior lecturer in psychology at Northumbria University and an expert in conspiracy theories, said the emergence of a growing, vocal contingent of people who believed governments were not being truthful about the pandemic was unsurprising.\n\n\"People are drawn to conspiracy theories in times of crisis,\" Jolley said. \"When there is something happening - a virus outbreak, rapid political change, the death of a celebrity, a terrorist attack - it breeds conspiracy theories.\"\n\nThe prolonged nature of the pandemic and the prospect of a new round of government restrictions, he believes, have only deepened that distrust and potentially spurred on the naysayers.\n\n\"People are trying to understand the world in which we live,\" he said, whether or not that explanation is rooted in reality. \"But when you have this belief, you hold on to it, and you ascribe to evidence that supports your viewpoint.\"\n\nThis was the mentality on display at recent protests against the coronavirus restrictions that have popped up in cities across Europe, which have at times turned violent.\n\nOn Saturday, at least four police officers were injured in clashes in Trafalgar Square.\n\nAt another protest in the square a week earlier, Kate Shemirani - a nurse placed on an interim suspension by Britain's Nursing Council this summer after complaints about her claims that the coronavirus is fake or linked to 5G mobile networks, and about her outspoken anti-vaccine stance - told the crowd: \"They want you all wearing a mask, there's no science behind that mask. That mask is going to make you sick.\"\n\nScience has long shown that wearing a mask can prevent a person from spreading airborne illness, and new research suggests that it also protects the person wearing it. But Shemirani, and many others, are unswayed.\n\nThe movement has attracted some prominent supporters. This month, singer Van Morrison released three new lockdown protest songs, recorded in Belfast and England in recent weeks, criticizing the government's measures but also claiming scientists are \"making up crooked facts\" about the virus.\n\nNorthern Ireland's health minister, Robin Swann, called the songs \"dangerous\" in an interview with BBC Radio Ulster.\n\n\"I don't know where he gets his facts,\" Swann said of the new songs. \"I know where the emotions are on this, but I will say that sort of messaging is dangerous.\"\n\nIn France, where infections have skyrocketed with a daily average of 12,000 new cases reported over the past week, critics have questioned the effectiveness of masks and new measures to control the spread, while others have urged people to ignore the government's guidance entirely.\n\nA study released in early September by Fondation Jean Jaur\u00e8s, a Paris-based research institute, found that many opponents of mask-wearing believed it was useless or dangerous to their health and a tool of oppression by the government.\n\nAs many as 90 per cent of the anti-maskers surveyed - and 43 per cent of the wider French population - believed that the country's Health Ministry was colluding with pharmaceutical companies to hide information about the harmfulness of vaccines.\n\n\"There is a significant part of the population that does not believe or no longer believes in the noxiousness of the virus,\" said Antoine Bristielle, the sociologist who conducted the study.\n\nBristielle said that the pandemic had provided \"an extremely fertile ground\" for conspiracy theories because of its many uncertainties.\n\nAround 200 people demonstrated in Brussels against coronavirus restrictions in early September, taking particular aim at mask requirements. The protest was the second organised in the Belgian capital by a fringe group called \"Viruswaanzin,\" or \"Virus Madness,\" and was quickly dispersed by police.\n\nThe group, which staged similar protests in the Netherlands, does not deny the existence of Covid-19 but believes that measures taken by the governments are \"disproportionate to the scale and threat of the disease,\" said Michael Verstraeten, one of the organisers, in an interview with Radio 2, a public radio station.\n\nVerstraeten, a lawyer, is representing a group of Belgian citizens who sued the government for infringing on their freedoms by imposing coronavirus restrictions. The presiding judge dismissed the case in July, saying that \"the intellectual poverty of their argument is mind-boggling.\"\n\nAn estimated 50,000 people attended a protest in Berlin last month, among them some far-right extremists and QAnon conspiracy theorists. Yet the group that organized the event, Querdenken-711, tends to be more moderate, for the most part claiming that the severity of the virus is overblown, although some call it a hoax.\n\nSimilar threads can be seen throughout many of the protests in Europe, with links to similar conspiracy theories in the United States, and experts agree that the protests seem to be gaining strength. But they warn that the growing support for these once fringe theories poses a growing threat.\n\nJolley, the conspiracy theory expert, warned that while it was easy to dismiss such theories, their adherents could have a real effect on public health.\n\n\"If people don't vaccinate or wear their masks,\" he cautioned, \"that is going to impact us all, not just individuals.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/nz_trafalgar_290929.jpg?VersionId=g2l3Hi9Ni8CVZktoWXDvy2L6_Ga9HPBd", "alt_text": null}]}

Nearly 1 million will be sent to historically Black colleges and universities and tribal nation colleges.\n\nHe said 100 million tests would be given to states and territories to \"support efforts to reopen their economies and schools immediately and (as) fast as they can\".\n\n\"The support my administration is providing would allow every state on a very regular basis test every teacher who needs it,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nHe said 6.5 million tests will go out this week and the rest in coming weeks.\n\nMr Trump is trying to show progress in the battle against the pandemic as he campaigns for re-election on Nov 3 against Democrat Joe Biden.

The session was moderated by chief executive of Strategic Moves and former Nominated MP Viswa Sadasivan.\n\nProf Fisher, an infectious diseases expert, said a lack of good risk communication and community engagement could lead to people failing to do their part to curb the spread of disease.\n\n\"People always think of case management, infection prevention and control, testing, epidemiology and the epidemic curves that we have to flatten... but the final pillar is always risk communications, community engagement.\n\n\"And if you get that wrong, this leads to a failed response,\" said Prof Fisher, who chairs the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network steering committee for the World Health Organisation.\n\nMr Fernandez said that World News Day was an opportunity to make the case that having credible media organisations is important to the process of public communication, and the health and well-being of societies.\n\n\"You need good public information going out, you need the experts. But to complete that circle, you need good, credible journalism as well,\" said Mr Fernandez, who is also president of the World Editors Forum and editor-in-chief of Singapore Press Holdings' English/ Malay/Tamil Media Group.\n\nDuring this Covid-19 period, there has been a surge in the number of people accessing news from sources like ST, he said. This hunger for information speaks to the issue of trust and credibility.\n\nWhat the newsroom has done is to invest in correspondents, building up their authoritativeness and credibility over the years so that they can step up when such a crisis breaks out, he said.\n\nHe said a decision was made by ST to put all content related to Covid-19 outside of the paywall as a public service.\n\n\"We did that with some trepidation as it has commercial implications, but what we found was our subscriptions actually went up, and that says to me that people do value the information,\" he added.\n\nDr Tay, from SUSS' School of Science and Technology, said that Covid-19 has brought not just risks and challenges, but also opportunities in the digital space.\n\nResponding to a question from the audience about how people can adapt as certain jobs are wiped out with the advent of the digital economy, Dr Tay said it was important to harness creativity and the \"human touch\" to create more compelling products and services.\n\n\"If you see some durian sellers who do live streaming, it's actually very exciting.

It also had three workplace deaths.\n\nAcross all sectors, the second-most common cause of injuries was machinery-related, with 809 such cases in the first half of this year. There were 1,119 machinery-related cases from January to June last year.\n\nThe 12-month fatality rate for the transportation and storage industry also increased, from 3.1 per 100,000 workers as at end-December last year, to 3.8 as at end-June this year.\n\nMOM and the WSH Council said the industry accounted for the highest number of deaths at the workplace, with five cases in the first half of this year.\n\nOverall, the leading cause of fatal injuries continued to be falls from height and vehicular-related incidents. These accounted for four and three deaths respectively in the first half of this year.\n\nThe construction industry, which ground to a near-complete halt in April during the circuit breaker period, saw three workplace deaths in the first six months of this year - half of the sector's fatalities in the same period last year. All three deaths occurred in the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe industry also saw 26 cases of major injuries in the first six months, compared with 61 cases in the same period last year.\n\nThere were four workplace incidents where many lives were at risk - classified as dangerous occurrences - from January to June. Two were fire and explosion cases, while the other two were crane-related incidents.\n\nThe number of occupational diseases also fell by about a quarter, from 264 cases in the first half of last year to 195 cases in the same period this year.

Some time after midnight the following month, Nuur was awakened by her daughter's cries and found that Ms Sulis had forgotten to apply ointment on the child's stomach.\n\nEnraged, Nuur spat at the maid and slapped her face twice.

They received sums ranging from $500 to $3,000, depending on their individual needs.\n\nA spokesman said that NTU has also launched a fund seeded by a personal gift of $100,000 from its president Subra Suresh and his wife Mary. The NTU Priorities Fund has since grown to $1.7 million in size, thanks to the generosity of more than 1,600 other donors, she said.\n\nA spokesman for the Singapore Management University (SMU) said the institution set up an SMU Resilience Fund in May to help students facing financial hardship because of Covid-19.\n\nThe fund, which started with $2.5 million, has since grown by another $1.14 million, which includes contributions from faculty and staff.\n\nThe spokesman added that the university management team has also pledged to contribute a proportion of their annual compensation to support students in need.\n\nNearly 200 SMU students have received financial support so far and it is expected that close to 600 more students will receive support over the next month.\n\nThe Singapore University of Technology and Design has set up an emergency fund, which has raised about $260,000 for students affected by the pandemic. This is on top of existing government bursaries.\n\nA spokesman said about $149,000 has been disbursed to 54 students so far, who received sums ranging from $1,500 to $15,000, with the higher quantum going towards covering tuition fees in the current academic year.\n\nNTU bioengineering undergraduate Wong Siaw Wen, 23, received $1,500 from the university's Priorities Fund earlier this year, after her father was forced to stop work as a subcontractor in the construction sector in March. He resumed work last month.\n\nMs Wong, a Malaysian whose mother is a housewife, said her parents had to borrow money from relatives to pay for their living expenses. \"The help from NTU reduced the burden on my family to support me and I also have my own savings,\" she said.\n\nNUS third-year communications and new media student Jillian Chang, 21, received a $700 grant from the NUS Students Solidarity Fund, on top of other bursaries.\n\nHer mother quit teaching last year due to poor health and is currently not working full time, while her father, who works in the engineering sector, had a pay cut.\n\n\"Covid-19 has made us a bit more cautious about spending.

It will move out in November, but remain in Singapore, co-founder Joanna Strumpf tells The Straits Times, adding that the ongoing Violent Attachments exhibition will be its last show there.\n\n\"Unfortunately at this stage, it is premature to share any further information until arrangements are in place,\" she says. She did not confirm if the move was the result of the fallout from Covid-19.\n\nThis comes after Chan + Hori Contemporary left at the end of June to focus on becoming a curatorial, advisory and artist management business. More recently, NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore, helmed by renowned curator Ute Meta Bauer, has also said it will close its exhibition hall and residency studio spaces in March next year.\n\nThe Gillman Barracks cluster off Alexandra Road was established by the National Arts Council (NAC), Singapore Economic Development Board and JTC Corporation.\n\nSince it opened in 2012, it has seen its share of setbacks. In 2015, five of 17 galleries decided not to renew their leases, citing low footfall and poor sales.\n\nMs Audrey Yeo, whose gallery Yeo Workshop is situated in the enclave, thinks the district could do with better marketing and support.\n\n\"These are the top galleries in the region... We love the beauty of Gillman Barracks and the beautiful high ceilings... We do (typically) get a lot of casual tourists and young people, but in terms of getting the crowd that can buy art... it just needs a rejuvenation, honestly.\"\n\nDoes the NAC plan to rejuvenate the arts district?\n\nMr Tay Tong, the council's director for sector development (visual arts), tells ST: \"A vibrant arts industry in Singapore will continue to need the collective energies of all stakeholders - arts patrons and collectors, artists and galleries - as well as the strong support of the public.\n\n\"This does not necessarily require the build-up of a designated precinct to cluster activities. As seen in the Singapore Art Week over the years, different segments of visual arts activities tend to zone together organically at the Civic District, Bras Basah/Waterloo, Gillman Barracks and so on.\"\n\nThe NAC will, where it can, support the galleries at Gillman Barracks for as long as they wish to maintain their business in Singapore, he said.\n\nHe added that former gallery tenants such as The Drawing Room and Silverlens Galleries were also invited to present shows at the S.E.A. Focus fair at Gillman Barracks in January this year.\n\nAt Singapore Art Week, the involvement of commercial galleries remains vital, he said.\n\nLast month, galleries at the enclave submitted a petition to the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), asking it to waive rent till next March and reduce it by about half after that.\n\n\"We asked for a rental waiver to keep some of our wonderful neighbours... If we can take away that bit of rent, that money can go into programming at a time like this, when it's uncertain,\" says Ms Yeo.\n\nHowever, SLA, which took over from JTC Corporation as landlord more than half a year ago, says it is \"unable to offer rental adjustments while the tenancies are ongoing\".\n\nIt told ST it had already granted four months' rental waiver to the galleries from April to July, and had offered a rental reduction for their two-year tenancy which had begun on March 1.\n\n\"For tenants which are facing cash-flow difficulty, flexible rental payments such as instalment plans can be offered to help tenants who wish to stay on. Tenants are also encouraged to tap the various government support packages available, including wage subsidies under the Jobs Support Scheme.\"\n\nIn March last year, Pearl Lam Galleries moved out of Gillman Barracks to Dempsey Hill. It has since closed that gallery space, but retains an office in Singapore with two full-time staff.\n\n\"We have been looking for the right opportunity to open a physical gallery and had planned it for this year, but given the Covid-19 situation, we are re-strategising our plans,\" says senior director of global sales Priya Mudgal.\n\nSee more on\n\nVisual arts\n\nExhibitions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_LIFVIO_5994257.jpg?VersionId=70HTcHomiqRC2qS3dHpGnPnwyId5SDWz", "alt_text": "Tracing History #2 (2010) by artist FX Harsono is part of the Violent Attachments show at Australian gallery Sullivan+ Strumpf, which will move out of Gillman Barracks in November but remain in Singapore."}]}

If this continues, it would become a longer-term funding issue for the sector,\" he said.\n\nHe urged companies to continue donating so that the Community Chest and SSAs can continue to provide their much-needed services.\n\nThe first round of funding from The Invictus Fund saw close to $6 million disbursed to 89 SSAs in June, said the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), which manages the fund.\n\nAbout 82 per cent of the funds went towards supporting agencies to keep their services accessible to service users, while the remaining 18 per cent went towards building SSAs' digital capability and infrastructure for better connectivity and IT security, said the agency.\n\nThis includes equipping practitioners with appropriate software and hardware to ensure service continuity and accessibility to their clients as they work from home during the circuit breaker period.\n\nVulnerable seniors and clients also received prepaid cards to ensure connectivity to critical services, and front-line practitioners and clients were given care packages to improve their well-being.\n\nOne SSA that benefited is Lutheran Community Care Services, which digitalised its work processes with the funding.\n\nIts clients can now submit child adoption applications digitally, instead of having to go in person, and they can also access support via virtual interviews through videoconferencing tools.\n\nNCSS has also set up one-stop technology hub Tech-and-GO! (www.go.gov.sg/tng) to help the SSAs with their transformation.\n\nIt aims to cut down the amount of time needed by the SSAs to search for suitable digital solutions, and will also offer consultancy services and curated training courses.\n\nGoh Yan Han\n\nSee more on\n\nSocial support\n\nDonations\n\nNational Council of Social Service (NCSS)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/rk_ncss-zoom_290920.jpg?VersionId=sHI3Jl7JsLF_pzHzPJcxlgXMK_uWnZG4", "alt_text": null}]}

It takes hard work, commitment and resources, he added, noting that Covid-19 has hit many newsrooms hard, with sharp falls in advertising revenues. This would impact their ability to serve their communities.\n\nDuring the webinar, two panel discussions explored how journalists are tackling the pandemic.\n\nThe first focused on the ongoing \"infodemic\"during the pandemic, with its surge of misinformation.\n\nIn the second panel discussion, moderated by Viswa Sadasivan, chief executive of consultancy firm Strategic Moves, Mr Fernandez; Dr June Tay, head of the digital media programme at the School of Science and Technology in SUSS, and infectious diseases expert Dale Fisher, spoke on issues of credibility and trust in media outlets.\n\nProfessor Fisher, who is group chief of medicine at the National University Health System and chairman of the steering committee for the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network at the World Health Organisation, highlighted the role of effective communications in a public health crisis and the need for a responsible media.\n\nEfforts to deliver quality coverage to readers during the Covid-19 outbreak were also highlighted in ST's specially produced video, Journalism Through A Pandemic, yesterday evening.\n\nThe half-hour documentary on ST's Facebook and YouTube pages features footage of its correspondents covering the scourge across Asia, showing how newsrooms adapted to social distancing and the ways in which news stories have made an impact on national policies.\n\nThe World News Day events will culminate in a virtual programme by the Canadian Journalism Foundation and World Editors Forum today at 7am (Singapore time).\n\nIt will feature US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci and Philippine news website Rappler's co-founder Maria Ressa.\n\nThe webcast will be hosted by CNN Worldwide's chief media correspondent Brian Stelter, and feature musical performances by singers like Grammy winner Macy Gray.\n\n\u2022 Those who are interested in the webcast can register for free on the World News Day website.

Mr Ong was there to witness the signing of the contract for 40 new trains from Bombardier Transportation.\n\nPHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO\n\nClement Yong\n\nFollow topic:\n\nOng Ye Kung\n\nPublished\u00a0Sep 29, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) yesterday bought 40 new trains for the North-South and East-West MRT lines (NSEWL), as renewal works for its two oldest train lines continue apace.\n\nThe trains, costing about $337.8 million, will replace the second-and third-generation trains supplied by Siemens and Kawasaki-Nippon Sharyo that have been running for at least two decades.\n\nThe first of these new trains will begin rolling on the tracks in 2024, and will have upgraded features such as more open spaces for strollers and wheelchair users, as well as new LCD screens displaying travel information.\n\nThis contract is the second such awarded to rail company Bombardier Transportation, which in 2018 was tasked to replace 66 trains on the NSEWL. This means that 106 of the 198 trains on these two lines, which have been in operation since 1987, will eventually be supplied by Bombardier Transportation.\n\nWith the latest move, the renewal project for Singapore's two oldest lines that began in 2012 has passed the halfway mark and the most difficult replacement processes have been completed, said Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung at the contract-signing event yesterday.\n\n\"The objectives of this renewal are to replace major parts of the system that have been subjected to wear and tear, and also to improve the capability and performance of the system. The Government and rail operators have invested billions of dollars and countless hours into this,\" Mr Ong said.\n\nIn the past decade, the signalling system, or the entire software of the MRT system, has been changed, allowing it to run trains at 100-second instead of 120-second intervals.\n\nMore than 100,000 track sleepers, or the parts on which the train wheels sit, have also been mechanically taken out and reinstalled during periods when the trains are not running. This enabled train services to be maintained despite some periods of higher frequencies of disruptions.\n\nThe Government's decision to work more closely with Bombardier Transportation is partly motivated by cost concerns, the LTA said yesterday. This way, trains can be bought at a cheaper price and the types of trains reduced, allowing engineers to know them more thoroughly and react better to faults.\n\nSMRT also signed a 10-year contract with Bombardier Transportation for the company to provide technical support and spare parts for train repairs and system upgrades or replacements for the first 10 years.\n\nThis can be extended for another 20 years later.\n\nThe LTA, in noting the \"significant economies of scale\" of such a move, said: \"Initiatives such as these are central to efforts by LTA and the rail operators to continue delivering reliable train services, while managing costs.\"\n\nThe Bombardier trains, all 106 of which are of the same design, will be assembled in China, with parts sourced from other countries including Sweden, France and Germany.\n\nMr Ong also noted the historical significance of the train replacement, with the latest move effectively phasing out the first three generations of trains by 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, the LTA is exploring ways to keep some of the carriages of these old trains in institutions such as schools and government agencies to preserve the country's transport heritage.\n\nIt is also open to the carriages being converted for other uses, such as for decor at MRT-themed hotels or cafes, and interested parties can contact the LTA for more details.\n\nMr Ong said of the old trains: \"These three generations of workhorses are important markers of the Singapore story, and we should find ways to commemorate their contributions.\n\n\"Many Singaporeans feel strongly about this, writing to me frequently asking me what will happen to our pioneering trains, hoping that they would be given alternate new leases of life.\"\n\nSingapore has six MRT lines, with more lines, including the Jurong Region and Cross Island lines, set to open.\n\nEarlier this month, the Government accepted the Public Transport Council's recommendation that fares not go up in the coming year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the council citing the affordability of train and bus rides as one of its key considerations.\n\nSee more on\n\nOng Ye Kung\n\nTransport policy\n\nMRT", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/st_20200929_cymrt_5994603.jpg?VersionId=RuXbv5DHJ7MJXvIx0kXCSRv2sICN.YMg", "alt_text": "Mr Ong Ye Kung getting a virtual look at the interior of the new North-South and East-West line trains.

They include the Setron television set, the first locally manufactured black-and-white TV set in 1964, as well as a photograph of the first Housing Board flats in Toa Payoh, a reminder for many seniors of their first home after moving out of kampungs.\n\nNHB's deputy chief executive (policy and community) Alvin Tan said: \"We noticed that our audience profile is changing as Singapore's population ages, and we wanted to create an age-friendly, customisable heritage resource that uses objects and images from our National Collection to serve as memory triggers and conversation starters for seniors, people living with dementia and their caregivers.\"\n\nOne user who found the app engaging was Mr Lau Han Cheong, a participant from NTUC Health Day Centre for Seniors (Bukit Batok West).\n\nThe 86-year-old said: \"Usually, we see pictures of people but not items. These are images of ordinary items from the old days, some of which are not around any more. It is easy to choose which photos to look at and some of them help me recollect the past.\"\n\nThe app is a result of a tie-up between the three parties to jointly develop and present the broader House of Memories dementia-awareness training programme in Singapore.\n\nAs part of this programme, the National Museums Liverpool will partner NHB and the Agency for Integrated Care to provide museum-led, dementia-awareness training for health and social care professionals, families and care partners of people living with dementia.\n\nReaders can download the My House of Memories app for free via the App Store and Google Play Store, as well as from https://go.gov.sg/silverhubs.\n\nThe content on the My House of Memories app will be translated into Chinese, Malay and Tamil next year to reach out to more seniors.\n\nSee more on\n\nDementia\n\nEldercare", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/st_20200929_mmapp_5994751.jpg?VersionId=L7T5cX5OJpEeIwWxAt376v9_C7Qie8a8", "alt_text": "Right: Mr Lau Han Cheong, 86, assisted by occupational therapist Kuo Yen Chun, 35, using the My House of Memories app (above), which contains multimedia features and images of relatable everyday items from Singapore's yesteryear.

This approach will help them to relax, said Ms Soh.\n\nApex Harmony staff nurse Karl Zamora said the programme has helped elderly residents sleep better, and reduced incidents of shouting and aggressive behaviour.\n\nMadam Ang Sew Chu, 95, who has been a resident at the lodge for many years, goes for Namaste Care sessions about three times a week. Ms Zamora said she is now more alert, able to communicate through sounds and sleeps through the night.\n\nThe lodge plans to roll out the project to 60 residents, up from 30 now, as more staff have been trained in it, said Ms Soh.\n\nThe funding for the programme's expansion is provided by the Lien Foundation, which has helped other charities and organisations with financial support during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAll in, it has committed $3.28 million in two tranches to 18 social service agencies and three hospitals under its Charitable Organisations Vital In Downturn (Covid) Fund.\n\nLien Foundation chief executive Lee Poh Wah said: \"Many of the disruptions and difficulties that have surfaced amid the pandemic are severe and unanticipated for our sector and grantee partners.\"\n\nThe services provided by the Lien Foundation are a key part of Singapore's social safety net, said Mr Lee, adding that the foundation had anticipated pain on the horizon for many charities.\n\nIn April, it gave $1.2 million to 18 social service agencies with no conditions attached on how the money must be used. This was to give agencies the freedom and flexibility to quickly respond to the crisis.\n\nThe second tranche of funds, awarded this month, aims to help charity organisations seed new programmes and test-bed solutions to meet changing needs as they transform and adapt to a \"new normal\".\n\n$3.28m\n\nThe total amount that Lien Foundation has committed to 18 social service agencies and three hospitals under its Charitable Organisations Vital In Downturn (Covid) Fund.\n\n$1.2m\n\nThe amount that Lien Foundation gave to 18 social service agencies in April, to help them respond to the crisis.\n\nAgencies have been given funds of up to $100,000 each, and most of them are using the money to adopt digital solutions, said Mr Lee.\n\nAnother organisation receiving funding from the Lien Foundation is HCA Hospice Care, which organised a \"make-believe outing\" for patients at its Serangoon day hospice in June.\n\nMany of the senior citizens had never been on a plane before, so the hospice decided to create the experience for them - from checking in and boarding a plane to watching in-flight entertainment, disembarking and going through immigration.\n\nMr Antony Lee, who is HCA's assistant day hospice centre manager, said one patient told him he was overjoyed with the experience and had \"no regrets\".\n\nThe hospice plans to roll out a digital platform for its volunteers using the funding from Lien Foundation, so they can better engage with their patients through virtual befriending. The hospice's communications manager Jemin Chua said HCA also hopes to use the platform to bring the make-believe outings to the next level, such as having volunteers provide live translation for the patients, some of whom do not speak English - the language sessions are usually conducted in.\n\nThe Salvation Army Peacehaven Nursing Home is another Lien Foundation beneficiary that will use the funds to upgrade itself.\n\nLast November, it launched for its residents a lifestyle club called the Jade Circle Arena on its premises, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, residents have not been able to use it as regularly.\n\nPeacehaven executive director Low Mui Lang said the home plans to have three smaller arenas by the end of November, featuring new machines with old-school games so that life still goes on for the residents and they can have fun.\n\nCorrection note: This article has been edited to reflect Ms Soh Mee Choo's correct name.

It came as the number of Covid-19 cases in the community remained low.\n\nEmployers, though, have to ensure that safe management measures are in place, and that flexible working hours and staggered reporting times are implemented.\n\nIn addition, employees must continue to work from home for at least half of their working hours, and no more than half the number of employees who are able to work from home are to be at the workplace at any point in time.\n\nFor many people like Mr Ang Chung Yuh, 33, returning to work in the CBD yesterday morning has been the case for several weeks now.\n\nThe fixed income manager said he has been back at the office since phase two of the reopening began in June and, for now, his company was unlikely to change plans for split operations for employees.\n\nMr Eric Neo, chief executive of investment company RF International Holdings, has been back in the office since the circuit breaker ended.\n\nAsked if he preferred working from home or in the office, the 46-year-old said: \"I'm a parent of two young kids so it's definitely more productive working from the office.\"\n\nMr Neo also felt that the returning CBD crowd in the past few weeks has created a sense that \"the market is coming alive\". This was particularly apparent during lunchtime when the sight of queues at food stalls was a positive sign for investors and traders alike, he said.\n\nThis was the case at Market Street Interim Hawker Centre which was packed during the lunch hour yesterday, but stall owners interviewed by ST insisted that they had seen fewer customers and much shorter lunch hours in the past few weeks.\n\nA stall owner who wanted to be known only as Mr Loke, 47, said: \"On good days, business is back to 60 to 70 per cent of what it used to be, but the crowd mainly comes on Mondays and Tuesdays. For the rest of the week, it's been relatively quiet.\"\n\nThough he saw slightly more customers than usual yesterday, he does not foresee that business will improve much in the coming weeks, saying that it would be \"perhaps around 10 per cent more than the current lunch crowd\".\n\nOn the shorter lunch hours, he said: \"In the past, queues would start to form as early as 11am, and the crowds would disperse by around 2pm, but the lunch crowd now seems to linger only from 12pm to 1.30pm.\"\n\nOther stall owners in the vicinity hope the lunch crowds will return as companies begin to implement staggered work arrangements.\n\nMr Gerald Gan, 49, who co-owns Taiwanese eatery Healthy Passion at The Arcade, said: \"I started seeing some of my regulars over the past few weeks, but many were saying that their companies needed more time to work out the logistics of split-work operations, such as getting cleaners in and ensuring that office pantries are stocked up.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCentral Business District", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_VNCBD3_5994833.jpg?VersionId=pHPtJU0t_XfzTtCK4xIUKq8TvMhVJiY9", "alt_text": "7.54am: Despite the Monday morning rush hour, empty seats were still available on this MRT train."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_VNMRT5_5994819.jpg?VersionId=2dOc4Ifl4cChkrQ0_GklJsS_2NnzCv0x", "alt_text": "8.22am: The area outside Raffles Place MRT station seemed empty, even as the workday was about to begin. 12.26pm:Diners at Lau Pa Sat (left) during lunchtime yesterday. 12.36pm: It was more crowded at Market Street Interim Hawker Centre (right), with"}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_VNLUNCH1_5994834.jpg?VersionId=vLnD3Fa.UnJWVookuetIIKYyu9cG3oim", "alt_text": "8.22am: The area outside Raffles Place MRT station seemed empty, even as the workday was about to begin. 12.26pm:Diners at Lau Pa Sat (left) during lunchtime yesterday. 12.36pm: It was more crowded at Market Street Interim Hawker Centre (right), with"}]}

Her gallery in Orchard, iPreciation, which deals in modern and contemporary Asian art, has been quiet amid the global pandemic.\n\nIn more normal times, art lovers - many of them collectors from other parts of Asia - would stroll in, pull out a chair and sit down with Ms Chan and her staff to find out more about the artworks and their artists. These days, footfall is down by about 80 per cent.\n\n\"The way we usually do business is person-to-person, but this model is not working anymore,\" Ms Chan says, noting that the gallery will do more to engage younger collectors via platforms such as social media. \"\n\nRent in Singapore is very high. I still believe you need a physical presence, a physical space. But do we need such a big space when people's behaviours have changed? We need to relook our business model.\"\n\nIn July, iPreciation launched an online showcase of paintings by Singapore ink master Zhuang Shengtao. Some collectors made appointments to view the art in person and bought pieces in the $6,000 to $9,000 range. This did not really help the bottom line, says Ms Chan.\n\nCovid-19 has hit galleries hard. Fairs have been cancelled or postponed, overseas collectors cannot travel, and buyers are more cautious. Of the 15 galleries The Straits Times spoke to, most say business has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, with varying degrees of loss in revenue.\n\nAt Tanglin Shopping Centre, some galleries have had a rough couple of months. Gnani Arts lowered its shutters and moved to 55 Genting Lane this month. Hai Hui Art Gallery, whose business has fallen by at least half, cut its operating hours to just two to three days a week. Kwan Hua Art Gallery, whose customers are largely foreigners, has seen its business plummet by at least 90 per cent. It will relocate to a smaller unit in the same building at the end of next month.\n\n\"Our art gallery has been established for 25 years,\" says Kwan Hua gallerist Sandy Tan, \"but this is the first time that business has been dismal for an extended period of time.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Government introduced a raft of measures to help arts groups tide through the pandemic. Among them are the Capability Development Scheme for the Arts, as well as a Digital Presentation Grant (DPG) for the Arts to support the efforts of artists and arts groups to go digital.\n\nYeo Workshop is one of a dozen galleries to have received the DPG so far. It mounted a solo show by local artist Wong Lip Chin, with paintings, a recorded performance and an interactive virtual exhibition in the form of a video game.\n\n\"We were very slow to the digital game,\" admits Yeo Workshop's Ms Audrey Yeo. \"A lot of our sales were done in person and we always were events-based, installations-based, so people had to come in to experience it.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, the gallery's strategy changed. It revamped its website, updated its social media profile and hired a full-timer and two freelancers to focus on digital marketing. It also now has active dealings with digital platforms Artsy and The Artling.\n\nMs Yeo adds: \"More people are discovering us online, but I wonder if that translates into them walking into the gallery, which then translates into sales.\"\n\nYeo Workshop is one of many galleries that have beefed up their online presence. While some are sceptical about how effective an online exhibition can be, those who have mounted such shows - which typically feature images of artworks on a website, or a 360-degree view - tend to see them as merely a complement to physical ones. Ultimately, nothing beats seeing a work of art in person.\n\n\"The greatest happiness for a dealer is when someone walks into his physical space,\" says Gajah Gallery founder Jasdeep Sandhu, who has launched several digital exhibitions.\n\nSome galleries which have sold art online find that collectors usually go for artists they are familiar with, or artworks at a lower price range.\n\nThis was the case for Gnani Arts co-founder P. Gnana, who recently revamped his website and introduced a new online payment gateway. He also noticed that some collectors expect bigger discounts these days. \"We will check with the artist. We have to be very careful, we can't bring down the artist's image and profile,\" he adds.\n\nREDISCOVER LOCAL ART\n\nAmid the pandemic, there are silver linings. A few galleries have noticed more interest from local collectors who, unable to travel, are looking homeward.\n\nRichard Koh Fine Art's recent A Decade Apart/Together exhibition, featuring Singapore artists born in the 1980s and 1990s, saw \"tremendous support from the Singapore community - we almost sold out\", says founder Richard Koh. Works sold were generally priced under $4,000. \"What I find interesting is that people are looking inwards and looking at local artists, instead of thinking 'foreign is best',\" says Mr Koh, who observes a similar trend in his Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok galleries. His business is still down by about 60 per cent.\n\nWith Singapore's push for domestic tourism, some galleries are seeing a more diverse crowd.\n\nAt Kampong Glam, gallery Coda Culture says recent exhibition sales have outdone expectations. Founder Seelan Palay says around half of the works by young painter Faris Heizer, whose debut solo show is ongoing, have been sold. These are priced from $900 to $1,400.\n\nHe adds: \"You don't expect people to focus on art at this point, but I guess it's also therapeutic.\"\n\nArt Porters Gallery, housed in a shophouse in Spottiswoode Park Road, is seeing more domestic tourists on weekends.\n\nCo-founder Guillaume Levy-Lambert says: \"Some people are looking more at art as an investment. Art is something tangible. If you put your money in the stock market it is a bit abstract.\"\n\nThe gallery is expanding the price range of its works. It will introduce more affordable pieces, but also sell more expensive master works from secondary markets to cater to would-be investors.\n\nCollectors cautious, but still on lookout for art\n\nLevy-Lambert, who will soon launch an exhibition on art information website MutualArt, believes art lovers will continue to buy art that speaks to them. He said that a fortnight before the circuit breaker, an expatriate couple walked into his gallery and told him they had lost most of their life savings in the stock market crash.\n\n\"They said, 'We woke up this morning and we decided to not be depressed. We're going to buy art.'\"\n\nThey left with two artworks - one of Levy-Lambert's, priced at $2,400, and another by young artist Priyageetha Dia, priced at less than $1,000.\n\nFrom Nov 20 to 22, Art Porters Gallery will join about 20 galleries for an SG Gallery Weekend, organised by the Art Galleries Association Singapore.\n\nArt fairs are a way for gallerists to reach out to new collectors, but not everyone is upset that many have been cancelled or postponed. \"We've been on this carousel for so many years - it's good to take a breather,\" says Mr Koh, whose gallery spends US$50,000 (S$68,800) to US$100,000 a fair. Before Covid-19, they had already attended fewer art fairs - down from about eight a year to five, as they had found it increasingly hard to meet new collectors that way.\n\nThe Affordable Art Fair is going digital. Utterly Art is one of 50 galleries from around the world that will take part in the Affordable Online Art Fair from Nov 4 to 30. Works at the fair cost no more than \u00a36,000 (S$10,600) each.\n\nCollectors may be more cautious these days, but many are still willing to collect good art if they see it.\n\nProminent Singapore collector Jackson See, 60, is keeping an eye out for young local artists responding to the pandemic in their work.\n\n\"If the artist can think outside the box and do something related to Covid-19, it would be very interesting,\" he says. \"This is history (in the making). The impact is so heavy and it affects everyone. In 20, 30 years, we'll look back and reflect on what the situation was like in the world.\"\n\nWith so much uncertainty over how long the pandemic will last, galleries hope collectors will continue to support them.\n\nKwan Hua Art Gallery's Ms Tan says: \"For those who enjoy art and have been fortunate to not be badly impacted by the pandemic, I hope they can continue to show support for local art galleries.

And I'm not sure when it's coming back,\" said Ms Lee, who only last year expanded her kitchen through a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nFrom Monday, 85 brands will showcase womenswear looks during Paris Fashion Week. Only 19 - among them Chanel and LVMH-owned Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton - are pressing ahead with socially distanced front rows.\n\nOthers are holding small presentations by appointment, or streaming videos.\n\nFledgling designers cannot afford to hire big venues for tiny audiences or risk a last-minute cancellation, said Mr Sebastien Vienne, from production and press firm Mephistopheles.\n\nNone of Mephistopheles' 14 most regular customers are staging full events next week. In a normal year, each event would have cost at least \u20ac30,000 (S$48,000) to \u20ac40,000.\n\n\"We used to do four shows a day, our whole budget comes from these events,\" Mr Vienne told Reuters.\n\nStill, he said he was optimistic revenues would pick up again in the longer run, as brands try to reach shoppers virtually.\n\nHis company is producing a fashion film, rather than a traditional show with an audience, inside the 19th-century Hotel Le Marois for Polish label La Metamorphose.\n\nThe palatial venue has also been reinventing itself, upgrading its systems to lure companies wanting to live-stream events from its ornate rooms, site manager Valerie Taieb said.\n\nBut even small parties are getting complicated as coronavirus cases in France rise and restrictions on gatherings tighten.\n\n\"The fashion sector and the events industry have really been forgotten in this crisis,\" Ms Taieb said. Her team of about 20 have returned to work only part-time and are still relying on the state's partial unemployment aid.\n\nAt the shoot for La Metamorphose at Hotel Le Marois, 25-year-old model Tiffany Fournier said some of her work had dried up too, although she still does magazine and advertising campaigns.\n\n\"I haven't done a catwalk show since February,\" Ms Fournier said.\n\nSome big brands have pushed to hold physical events where possible in part to support suppliers and other businesses. Designers also want to keep up connections with professional buyers and media.\n\n\"There's an energy and an excitement, there's music, the first model to appear on the catwalk, applause at the end,\" said Mr Alexandre Mattiussi, creator of French brand AMI. \"That doesn't exist in a digital format.\"\n\nAMI is planning to hold a show on Oct 3, with fewer than 150 guests rather than the usual 600 to 700.\n\n\"It will be like a very nice wedding,\" Mr Mattiussi said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nFashion shows\n\nFashion designers\n\nStyle", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_FASHION29_5994497.jpg?VersionId=FNSsBrHnuvsDuB4amhdQLpzsLp2OA.39", "alt_text": "French model Tiffany Fournier posing for a digital presentation as part of the spring/summer 2021 collections for Polish fashion house La Metamorphose, in Paris."}]}

It is particularly busy on weekends and during school holidays.\"\n\nMuseums reopened on June 26 after eight weeks of closure as part of circuit-breaker measures to curb the spread of Covid-19.\n\nNHB and NGS have reported good responses for guided tours, which resumed late last month with capacity caps. NGS has had \"a healthy take-up of our daily guided tours\", says Mr Lee.\n\nThere are daily English-language tours at both ACM and NMS, but Mandarin tours are available only on weekends at NMS and will resume at ACM from Saturday.\n\nMr Ting, 42, adds: \"The tours have been well-received and staff have observed that visitors are happy that the tours have resumed.\"\n\nMr Lee says NGS has also received encouraging response to its free, one-year Gallery Insider membership promotion. The membership for Singaporeans and permanent residents offers unlimited access to the museum's shows, access to selected programmes and discounts on museum merchandise and food and beverage outlets.\n\n\"Since its launch as part of the National Day celebrations in August, there have been more than 125,000 sign-ups online, with more than 25,000 visits made to the Gallery to activate the membership,\" Mr Lee adds.\n\nSingapore has been opening up gradually in the past two months.\n\nMice - meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions - events can now accept up to 250 participants, while up to 100 people are allowed at places of worship.\n\nMuseums and heritage institutions will offer a mix of limited on-site programmes and online options for the time being.\n\nMr Lee says NGS will take its cue from the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth.\n\nBut NHB's Mr Ting says: \"Taking guidance from Singapore Tourism Board's safe management measures for guided tours, we are also reviewing the number of participants in our museum-guided tours.\"\n\nSTB guidelines currently allow tour groups of 10, divided into two sub-groups of five which are not allowed to mingle.\n\nIn the meantime, all museums have amped up digital options.\n\nThe ACM has launched a digital version of its new Material and Design galleries, as well as ACM Treasures, which allows people to look at a selection of artefacts in augmented reality.\n\nBoth the ACM and Indian Heritage Centre offer self-guided tours, while NGS has introduced TEMI, a robot that can take a visitor on a 20-minute tour of four artworks at the DBS Singapore Gallery 1.\n\nMs Harger notes that the silver lining of the crisis has been the push to go digital, which has enabled museums to reach audiences beyond Singapore's shores while keeping local audiences close.\n\nArtScience @ Home, the museum's digital programme, offered more than 50 events, ranging from conferences to performances, during the circuit breaker.\n\nMs Harger adds: \"We feel that these kinds of online programmes represent a new chapter in our evolution as a museum and perhaps show one way that museums can work sustainably during Covid-19.\"\n\nEducation Minister Lawrence Wong said last Wednesday that the Government may present plans for moving into phase three, but caution is the keynote for museums at the moment.\n\nMr Ting says: \"It is still early days to predict how the numbers will change, as much will depend on what is happening at a national and global level.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nNational Heritage Board\n\nNational Gallery Singapore\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_SFVISIT29QIE8_5993661.jpg?VersionId=NtgpyzxpPtz_KUTQ6v8DNFhfaDm7wrs4", "alt_text": "The National Gallery Singapore lit up last month as part of this year's National Day celebrations.

The other members are retired therapist Ibrahim and Ron, a firebrand ex-trade unionist.\n\nTheir dialogue makes for some of the funniest moments in the story, which has plenty of laugh-out-loud humour. At one point, the club attempts to narrow down the identity of a killer who may be living in the village and has access to needles and drugs, to which Elizabeth replies: \"That's everyone here.\"\n\nOsman plays up his protagonists' age at every turn, though not without good reason. Old age is the superpower of the murder club. It affords the four Sherlocks a willingness to play fast and loose with the law, and a social advantage that demands people treat them kindly.\n\nTheir swashbuckling ways are balanced by the book's quieter moments, which give its elderly cast space to contemplate their final years.\n\nAgeing can be a cruel process - the sudden realisation that a spade will be too heavy to lift, or living in constant fear that your memory will soon slip away.\n\nThe story does get a little overly sentimental near its conclusion, giving every red-herring suspect a backstory, some of which skew towards the tragic. The big reveal is a tad predictable as well, but this novel, meant to be the first in a series, remains enjoyable nevertheless.\n\nThe Thursday Murder Club is not meant to keep you on the edge of your seat, but for curling up in an armchair with a cup of hot tea.\n\nIf you like this, read:\n\nBig Sky by Kate Atkinson (Transworld, 2019, $29.27, available at:\n\nbit.ly/bigskykateatkinson\n\n), the latest in the author's Jackson Brodie detective series.

More than 500 people had signed up for the webinar.\n\nFacilitated by The Straits Times' Asian Insider editor Shefali Rekhi, the panel took up the issue of the plague of misinformation in Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore, and weighed in on efforts of journalists to counter the infodemic.\n\nWith lack of accurate data from the Indonesian government, many Indonesians are turning to movements that have appeared in the grassroots and so-called \"experts\" to plug the information gap, said Mr Tama Salim, world news editor at The Jakarta Post.\n\n\"Misinformation creeps into the vacant spaces that are lacking attention by the government... This kind of information has resulted in even influencers and their tens of thousands of followers falling victim,\" he said.\n\nFellow panellist Zakir Hussain, ST's Singapore editor and vice-president of the Singapore Press Club, discussed the alarm in Singapore after falsehoods spread on social media channels.\n\n\"I think one area where fake news and misinformation spread quite rapidly was among migrant worker communities themselves because they didn't understand, or didn't have access to information in their own languages initially,\" he said.\n\nIn the Philippines, Ms Pam Rances, digital content manager at the Manila Bulletin, said several Filipino newsrooms had published explainers to give readers a better understanding of the virus.\n\nBut Mr Salim said journalists cannot know everything there is to know about Covid-19 in Indonesia.\n\nIn response to a question from the audience on how to coax readers to listen to information that is inconvenient to them, both Ms Rances and Mr Hussain agreed that news on Covid-19 must reach the audience on platforms familiar to them such as WhatsApp.\n\nWrapping up the session, Ms Rekhi said tapping credible media sources is one way to fight the infodemic. She said that legacy and traditional media are sources of credible information, while Mr Salim added that students should approach a mix of news outlets to fact-check any information.\n\nWorld News Day was created in 2018 and spotlights the relevance of good journalism.\n\nSee more on\n\nWorld News Day\n\nMedia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/rk_media-platform_290920.jpg?VersionId=UQ8haNSSJ5yeFwqJXKc2p4GV6MH8zWuh", "alt_text": null}]}

If he fails to solve the murder after eight hosts, his memory is wiped clean, and the process has been restarted innumerable times.\n\n\"That book was so intricately plotted, it drove me mad,\" says Turton. He had a huge spreadsheet that charted what was happening to each character every minute of the time loop and a map of the house on his bedroom wall on which to plot their movements.\n\nHe had always wanted to write a mystery in the style of Agatha Christie, the grande dame of crime fiction, but the obvious problem was that everything he thought of, she had already done.\n\nIt took him a decade to come up with the idea for Seven Deaths, at which point he was working as a travel journalist in Dubai and had to persuade his then-girlfriend, now wife, to move back to England with him so he could work on it in the appropriate atmosphere.\n\nThe book has been optioned for television and won the Best First Novel prize at the Costa Book Awards. Turton got the news while on a train. \"I wanted to scream and jump up and down, but they told me it was top secret, so I had to go into the train toilet to ring my wife.\"\n\nHaving done a Golden Age mystery, he wanted to try his hand at riffing off another great detective: Sherlock Holmes.\n\nTurton loves Christie's novels unreservedly, but has a more complicated relationship with Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary sleuth. \"Nobody ever seems to recognise that Holmes is a horrible human being,\" he says. \"And Watson (his sidekick) is a lovely, clever character, but he's just there to look stupid next to Sherlock Holmes.\"\n\nThe Devil And The Dark Water unfolds almost entirely on board a Dutch ship, the Saardam, which is sailing from Batavia to Amsterdam. Many ill omens begin to occur at sea: the disappearance of a valuable artefact, the apparition of a leper who died before the voyage began and the lantern of a ghostly ship that pursues the Saardam.\n\nThe novel has a Holmes-like character, the genius detective Samuel Pipps, but he spends most of the book in prison.\n\nInstead, it is up to other passengers, such as Pipps's bodyguard and best friend, Lieutenant Arent Hayes, or Sara Wessel, the governor general's abused wife, to solve the mystery of the curse, even as the murders come thick and fast.\n\nUnfortunately, writing The Devil And The Dark Water was also an awful experience, says Turton ruefully. \"I think it's just the way I write.\"\n\nHe began the novel two weeks after his daughter was born and finished it just after her second birthday, juggling writing with caring for a newborn. \"For the first year at least, I was writing words but they weren't connected to each other or making any sense.\"\n\nStill, he is looking forward to his next mystery novel, for which he might attempt the noir genre, in the vein of Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled detective Philip Marlowe.\n\n\"I would love to write in that style, but it's so American, I don't know if I could pull it off.

His name isRiver, so he cannot promote it now.\"\n\nThe name River also belonged to Phoenix's late brother, who died of a drug overdose in 1993 at the age of 23. River Phoenix, the star of films such as Stand By Me (1986) and My Own Private Idaho (1991), overdosed outside famous nightclub The Viper Room in West Hollywood. Joaquin, then 19, was with him at the time and called 911.\n\nWhen Joaquin Phoenix won the Best Actor Oscar earlier this year for Joker (2019), he paid tribute to his brother by quoting the lyrics he wrote, which said \"run to the rescue with love and peace will follow\".\n\nMara and Phoenix met on the 2013 film Her, but started dating only in 2016, after the filming of Mary Magdalene.

The move is aimed at encouraging financial prudence amid Singapore's worst recession and rising job losses.\n\nStarting yesterday, developers will no longer be able to re-issue a prospective buyer's option to purchase (OTP) a residential unit for multiple times on their own.\n\nUnder a standard OTP, new home buyers get around three weeks in which they reserve their rights to purchase a property in return for a booking fee. If they fail to exercise the option to purchase at the end of three weeks, they risk forfeiting 25 per cent of their booking fees - or 1.25 per cent of the total home price - analysts said.\n\nSome developers have been continually re-issuing OTPs to prospective home buyers for months on end, without forfeiting any portion of their booking fees, while these buyers try to secure finances to complete the purchase.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, developers can no longer re-issue an OTP to the same buyer for the same unit for 12 months after the earlier OTP expires. They also have to inform buyers of this condition upfront. This move will weed out those who are less confident of committing to a purchase, analysts said.\n\n\"The need for greater financial discipline in making property purchase decisions is especially pertinent given the current economic situation, where workers are facing uncertainties in the labour market. Purchasers should commit to a property purchase only when they are ready to exercise the OTP within the validity period,\" Ms Ling Hui Lin, controller of housing at the Urban Redevelopment Authority,\n\nsaid in yesterday's circular.\n\nThe URA observed that \"there have been instances where the OTP is re-issued multiple times to the same purchaser(s) for the same unit, which lengthens the option period significantly\".\n\nMs Tricia Song, head of research at Colliers international, said: \"This will probably instil greater financial discipline to home buyers in property-buying decisions with the following messaging: Do your sums first before you commit - if you are not able to get a loan or pay for it in three weeks, you probably should not agree to buy it now.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Karamjit Singh, chief executive of Showsuite Consultancy, said that for genuine buyers who can prove that they can sell their existing home within 12 weeks, the controller of housing is prepared to consider extending the three-week option validity period to 12 weeks. This is an increase from the eight weeks previously given.\n\nURA also said the new guidelines do not apply retrospectively to OTPs issued before yesterday where developers have an existing re-issue agreement with buyers.\n\nMeanwhile, the practice of reissuing OTPs had also raised concerns about whether data in the new home sales market could be distorted if many such buyers end up aborting the deals.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the developers' sales data, which is based on the number of OTPs issued to buyers, URA told The Straits Times that the sales data \"excludes any OTPs re-issued to the same purchaser(s) for the same units\".\n\nColliers' Ms Song said genuine buyers are more likely to step forward under the new guidelines, which would suit developers too.\n\nShowsuite Consultancy's Mr Singh believes the new rules will not likely be a major dampener for the new homes market, especially in the mass-market segment.\n\nHe pointed to last weekend's launch of Penrose condominium by Hong Leong Holdings.\n\nOf its 566 units, 341 were sold as at Sunday.\n\n\"Hong Leong practised a strict 'no re-issue' policy. This means all the buyers would be required to exercise their options within three weeks of being served the sale and purchase agreements,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nURA\n\nSingapore property", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/rk_privatehousing_290920.jpg?VersionId=ySTzsG4xaTbHl7n34OgrCrmGSCiJ.ssW", "alt_text": null}]}

Consumers can defer both principal and interest payments on residential mortgages. Individuals suffering a loss of income can ask for a lower interest rate on unsecured credit.\n\nAn extension of the debt moratorium would help mitigate the so-called \"cliff effect\" on consumers and businesses once relief measures end. The authorities are using both fiscal and monetary tools to provide support against what may be a record recession that came with the pandemic.\n\nThe Government introduced additional support measures of $8 billion last month to cushion the blow from the virus, bringing Singapore's total pledged pandemic aid to more than $100 billion.\n\nMAS managing director Ravi Menon in July said the regulator was talking to banks and finance companies about how to ease borrowers into gradually resuming repayments once the debt relief measures expire. \"We want to avoid 'cliff effects' of a sudden withdrawal of these reliefs,\" he told reporters during the publication of the MAS annual report.\n\nThe central bank has eased monetary policy to help stabilise the economy, and has ensured ample liquidity at financial institutions. It also asked Singapore banks to prioritise lending by capping their dividend payouts.\n\nWhile Singapore's rate of coronavirus infection is falling and the authorities are trying to gradually reopen the economy, many restrictions on businesses and travel remain in place.\n\nLike their global competitors, Singapore's largest lenders DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank (UOB) are bracing themselves for a wave of soured debts. Collectively, they have set aside about $4 billion in provisions for both general and problem loans in the first half of the year, according to data tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Rena Kwok.\n\nAs of June 30, debts under relief programmes accounted for about 5 per cent of DBS' total loan book, 10 per cent of OCBC's, and 16 per cent of UOB's, according to their second-quarter results.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nMAS/Monetary Authority of Singapore\n\nBanks and financial institutions\n\nLoans\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/yq-maslogo-28092024.jpg?VersionId=BWT9RNAo.reYTO6_whOFVAsJ3Hyr5U6X", "alt_text": null}]}

When she writes to a love interest about her \"wu yu\", he suggests that if she is losing one language, she must be gaining another.\n\n\"Why can't I hold on to one language while gaining another at the same time?\" she thinks. \"Why do I have to lose one first?\"\n\nLove, language and the lacunae between the two are themes that run throughout A Lover's Discourse, as they do Guo's first novel in English, A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary For Lovers, written dictionary-style in broken English in 2007.\n\nIn a way, A Lover's Discourse is a continuation of this earlier novel - both are about young Chinese women acclimatising to London and new lovers - just as they are offshoots of Guo's own story.\n\nGuo, 47, led a hardscrabble childhood in China and moved to London in 2002 to study documentary film directing.\n\n\"I was 30 years old and I began to write like a child in a second language,\" she recalls over Skype from her home in London.\n\nShe has lived in France, Germany, Switzerland and New York. \"All these places surrounded me with foreign languages, a third language, a fourth language, and it created this discourse, almost a disharmony, to think and write in. You could be completely lost. I found that very inspiring.\"\n\nGuo, who was named one of Granta's Best of Young British Novelists in 2013, is the author of seven books in Chinese and seven books in English.\n\nShe was shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction for A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary and won the National Book Critics Circle Award for her 2017 memoir Once Upon A Time In The East.\n\nLast year, she was one of the judges for the Booker Prize, which controversially named two winners, Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo. \"It was an amazing experience,\" she says, skirting a question on which side of the tie she had been on.\n\nIn A Lover's Discourse, the narrator and her partner, an Australian-German landscape architect, live on a canal houseboat to escape the strictures of urban living, although she discovers it is not as glamorously bohemian as it seems. Later, they have a baby and she navigates motherhood while struggling with her own sense of belonging.\n\nThe parents of Guo's partner, Australia-born philosophy lecturer Stephen Barker, lived for many years on a boat near Queensland in the Pacific Ocean. She and Professor Barker have a daughter, Moon, seven.\n\nBut it is not enough to write based on personal experience, she cautions. \"It's also extremely important to have the intellectual capacity to write something you have not lived.\"\n\nA Lover's Discourse is Guo's spin on French philosopher Roland Barthes' A Lover's Discourse: Fragments (1977). She says she loves Barthes' work, his \"off-centre way of thinking\".\n\nBarthes is best-known for his \"death of the author\" theory, which challenges the tradition of privileging the author's biography and intent as the controlling meaning of a text.\n\nThroughout her novel, Guo probes the notions of authorship and authenticity. As part of her PhD research, the narrator goes to the village of Dafen in Guangdong, China, where artisans - mostly self-taught - churn out reproductions of masterpieces by Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Leonardo da Vinci and more.\n\nGuo, who has made 11 films, went to Dafen to make her 2018 documentary Five Men And A Caravaggio, which follows a reproduction of Caravaggio's John In The Wilderness from its creation in Dafen to its critiquing in London.\n\n\"We're coming into this age where everything's reproduced, copied or interpreted in such different ways, where stuff is being mass-produced and democratised,\" says Guo, nodding to cultural critic Walter Benjamin's 1935 essay The Work Of Art In The Age Of Mechanical Reproduction. \"It's a great era to think about what is art.\"\n\nIn the novel, she says, the death of the author corresponds to the rebirth of the individual. \"We as individuals should be the authors of our own lives, which means we should refuse a mass-produced concept of commercial life. We should invent our own lives.\"\n\nGuo's father was an artist, which indelibly imprinted the value of art in her young mind. A state painter and a poet, he spent 15 years in a prison camp in the 1950s and during the Cultural Revolution. Her mother was a Red Guard and later a factory worker.\n\nBorn and raised in Zhejiang province, Guo was given away twice as a child, first to a poor peasant couple in the mountains, then two years later to her grandparents in the fishing village of Shitang. In that household, where there was little to eat, she watched her grandfather abuse her grandmother, who had been a child bride.\n\nIt was only when she was seven that she met her parents and went to live with them and her older brother in the city of Wenling.\n\n\"I think we children suffered as much as our grandparents who went through the war and our parents who went through the Cultural Revolution,\" she says. Both her parents have since died of cancer.\n\n\"First, there's the material deprivation and then there's the emotional deprivation. We grew up in this loveless, materialist, really bleak social environment. Somehow we survived. People say that Chinese people are tough and resilient, but I think we are still in this state of post-trauma.\"\n\nGuo had to forfeit her Chinese passport when she took British nationality. She says she has found Brexit a \"huge disappointment\".\n\n\"It gives the foreigners here in London a lot of uncertainty and a new question: Are we staying, or are we moving back? It wasn't a question before that London's one of the greatest cities in the world. But now I question it: Is London still worthy to grasp on to?\"\n\nIn A Lover's Discourse, the narrator moves out of London to a farm in Germany, but finds she misses the city. \"London was the place I had begun my adult life, the place I had finally realised that I had forever lost my parents and my home country,\" she says.

Even during the global market sell-off in March, private bankers told their wealthy clients not to worry. In the worst case, they could just hold those notes until maturity and enjoy the juicy coupon payments.\n\nChina Evergrande Group's recent tumble is a wake-up call. Beijing's latest policy shifts show it is confident that killing a dragon or two won't cause a wildfire.\n\nEvergrande, one of the country's largest developers with 2.3 trillion yuan (S$463 billion) in assets, faced a crisis of confidence late last week. A dramatic sell-off in its stocks and bonds followed reports that the company had sent a letter to the Guangdong government warning of a potential cash crunch if it couldn't carry out a backdoor listing in Shenzhen by next January. The company said in a filing that the document was \"fabricated\".\n\nNonetheless, investors were unnerved. The document, fake or not, struck the right note. Just over a month ago, Beijing proposed a \"three red lines\" approach for major developers. Those exceeding all three leverage metrics monitored by regulators are forbidden from borrowing more. Evergrande has solidly crossed that threshold.\n\nIn that \"fabricated\" document seen by Bloomberg Opinion, Evergrande threatened systemic risk (835.5 billion yuan in borrowings), bankruptcies of its business partners and job losses. These are among the reasons why it must go public.\n\nBut there is no systemic risk. Rather than cracking down on the entire industry, the new \"three red lines\" policy is very targeted.\n\nOut of the 334 developers likely subject to the new rules, only 50 of them, accounting for 36 per cent of total industry borrowing, failed all three criteria, according to Gavekal Dragonomics. Meanwhile, developers accounting for just under half of total debt passed all three tests. Similarly, of the 18 largest developers tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence, 11 are in the green zone and can raise their borrowings by 10 to 15 per cent each year.\n\nIn other words, even if Evergrande fell on hard times, other big developers could just come in and carve off its assets. In fact, this is what China Vanke is doing with Tahoe Group, the first large developer to default on a bond in five years. Developers have a lot of hard assets. Land banks can be sold, senior lenders will get paid, and the rest will have to soak up losses. They don't need to be bailed out by the state.\n\nAmid China's deleveraging campaign two years ago, Vanke said its goal for the next three years would be simply \"to survive\". That startling slogan turned out to be prescient and was followed by a broader bond sell-off in the sector. Last weekend, its chairman Yu Liang came out talking again.\n\nIn his view, China's real estate market can be divided into three stages. In the 1990s, those with the right political connections were able to get land cheaply. The auction system implemented in 2002 upended that. Since then, those with the appetite and access to bank loans and shadow financing were the winners. Starting next year, only good governance will matter, Mr Yu said.\n\nHeed his words. Over the years, Evergrande has seemed like a cat with nine lives, living dangerously with a whopping 47 per cent of its borrowings due within a year. Perhaps its good fortune is coming to an end.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\n\u2022 The writer is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nProperty market/sector\n\nCommentary", "images": []}

Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC was among the strategic investors and was set to be allotted 472.5 million yuan.\n\nAlthough the proposed listing is slated to take place by the middle of next month, Wilmar has again stressed that there is \"no certainty\" it will proceed as it is still subject to prevailing market conditions.

PayNow users were previously able to make daily transactions of up to $1,000 in total without adding the recipient as a payee.\n\nABS said the move to raise the limit will allow customers to use PayNow for a wider scope of payments to merchants and friends.\n\nThe higher limit applies to PayNow on both Internet banking and mobile application channels.\n\nIt includes scan-and-pay transactions and transfers initiated by entering the NRIC number, mobile number or Unique Entity Number of the recipient, without first going through the process of adding the recipient as a payee.\n\nThe nine participating banks are Bank of China (BOC), Citibank, DBS Bank, HSBC, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Maybank, OCBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and United Overseas Bank.\n\nThe transaction limit for retail customers has been raised to $5,000 for BOC and ICBC; $10,000 for Citibank and StanChart (with scan-and-pay transactions of up to $50,000 for StanChart); and $200,000 for UOB, DBS, HSBC, Maybank and OCBC.\n\nCustomers will be required to key in their two-factor authentication number for transactions above $1,000. They may also set their PayNow limit to a level that they are comfortable with, said ABS.\n\nThe association said it will continue to work with the industry to promote PayNow as a convenient and secure way to transfer funds.\n\nAs of August, more than 4.46 million registered PayNow users had collectively transferred nearly $34 billion since the launch of the service in June 2017.\n\nMs Andrea Lim, 23, who works in business development, said the increased limit will make it easier for her to make large payments such as for electronic items. \"Not having to use tokens makes the payment process a lot more convenient.\"\n\n>4.46m\n\nNumber of registered PayNow users, as of August, who had collectively transferred nearly $34 billion since the launch of the service in June 2017.\n\nProfessor Duan Jin-Chuan from the National University of Singapore Business School said the higher limit affects spontaneous transactions in higher amounts.\n\nWhile PayNow is convenient, it requires users to be linked to a bank account, he added. \"If PayNow adds a wallet function that can hold a cash balance without linking to any bank account, it will have potential to become a unified funds transfer system.\"\n\nAssistant Professor Aurobindo Ghosh from the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University said the increased limit will make it easier for cash-strapped small and medium-sized enterprises to use PayNow to receive payments for goods.\n\n\"This might reduce the working capital cycle or conversion of inventory to cash, critical for net working capital management and ultimately, in some cases, survival of some of these enterprises,\" he said.\n\nAssociate Professor Angie Low from Nanyang Technological University's Nanyang Business School said the higher PayNow limit might change the service's landscape. \"This will likely attract more users with differing purposes and where transaction values exceed $1,000.\"\n\nABS' latest announcement comes amid recent developments on the use of the funds transfer service. Last Wednesday, the Infocomm Media Development Authority said PayNow Corporate, an instant funds transfer service for businesses, will be integrated into Singapore's nationwide e-invoicing network.\n\nThe authority worked with DBS, OCBC and UOB to develop the solution, which aims to allow businesses to bill and make payments to one another seamlessly online.\n\nThe next day, it was announced that DBS PayLah and StanChart customers can now use Google Pay to transfer funds directly from their bank accounts to anyone registered with PayNow.\n\nSee more on\n\nPayment systems\n\nBanks and financial institutions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_PAYNOW29_5995060.jpg?VersionId=a4H4tSRd4j5k3PJAHmd4p_7_jJsCuDiU", "alt_text": "The increased limit will make it easier for cash-strapped small and medium-sized enterprises to use PayNow to receive payments for goods.

The property developer is not only Asia\u2019s biggest junk bond issuer, but it is also one of the most systemically important firms in China.\n\nPHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\nFollow topic:\n\nChina\n\nPublished\n\nSep 29, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nHONG KONG \u2022 China Evergrande Group said its debt-cutting measures were working and the Hong Kong bourse had approved its spin-off plan, sending the property developer's shares up yesterday after a sell-off last week.\n\nShares climbed 21 per cent at the close in Hong Kong, erasing last week's tumble.\n\nA volatile session for Evergrande's dollar bonds saw its note due next year end the day up 3.9 cents on the dollar at 90.4 cents, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The company's onshore bonds due 2024 rose 14.4 per cent to 75.3 yuan.\n\nInvestors had dumped China Evergrande's shares and bonds last Friday after a leaked document - later dismissed by the company as a fabrication - suggested the nation's second-biggest property developer by sales had sought government help to avert a cash crunch.\n\nThe company said total indebtedness had fallen by 53.4 billion yuan (S$10.8 billion) over the six months to last Thursday when the document appeared online, while financing costs had dropped 2.24 per cent and it had prepaid 43.5 billion yuan of loans due after last Friday.\n\nEvergrande's borrowings totalled 835.5 billion yuan at end-June, of which onshore trust loans and bank lending made up 41 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.\n\nCompany chairman Hui Ka Yan said in a statement: \"In the 24 years since the establishment of the company, the company has borrowed loans across 20,523 transactions. There has never been any late payment of interest nor overdue repayment of principal.\"\n\nThe developer is under pressure to slash debt as Beijing tackles what it considers excessive borrowing in the real estate development sector with new debt ratio caps.\n\nThe Hong Kong-listed stock had fallen over 25 per cent this year on concern over competition as the pandemic keeps offices shut and buyers at home.\n\nEvergrande said aggregated contracted sales amounted to 504.9 billion yuan as at last Thursday, up 11.4 per cent from the same period a year ago, and cash on hand was 204.6 billion yuan as at June 30.\n\nIt said it aimed to achieve 200 billion yuan contracted sales in this month and the next through nationwide sales promotions launched earlier in the month.\n\nThe company also said the Hong Kong stock exchange had approved its plan to spin off its property management business, providing the firm a channel to raise funds.\n\nThe proposed float is expected to raise about US$2 billion (S$2.8 billion), according to Reuters' International Financing Review.\n\nFurther capital could come from the proposed initial public offering and listing on Shanghai's Sci-Tech Board of its unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group.\n\nInvestors across Asia are watching Evergrande closely after losses in the company's offshore notes spread to high-yield debt around the region last week.\n\nThe developer is not only Asia's biggest junk bond issuer, but it is also one of the most systemically important firms in China, with 293 million sq m of land reserves and projects in 237 cities as at the end of last year.\n\nThe biggest near-term worry surrounding Evergrande relates to an agreement the company struck with some of its largest investors. It gives them the right to demand their money back if the company fails to win regulatory approval for a backdoor listing on the Shenzhen stock exchange by Jan 31.\n\nThe repayment could amount to 130 billion yuan, and at least one of the investors has signalled it would be unwilling to extend the deadline.\n\nEvergrande has said it will not raise new funds through the listing, but the transaction could allow it to achieve a higher valuation and thus easier access to future financing.\n\nChinese regulators have yet to comment publicly on Evergrande's latest troubles, but the government could play a decisive role in its future. Some analysts have speculated that the firm has failed to get a green light for its listing plan because policymakers are trying to tame sky-high home prices and restrain fund raising by developers.\n\nWhether the authorities will allow Evergrande to run into serious financial difficulties is now one of the key questions facing creditors, shareholders and customers.\n\nREUTERS, BLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nProperty market/sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/st_20200929_ever29_5995015.jpg?VersionId=8vnwbZf2av4cU7NRDutRqQhveQqPS_8y", "alt_text": null}]}

The school will see 300 students and 87 staff attempting the race from Oct 9 to 18.\n\nPhysical education lecturer Mark Daniel Govin, 34, said: \"What we did were live workout videos, but that was more strength training, not so much cardio. Because of the pandemic, we couldn't gather everyone, but for this virtual run, it is great because we can do it in our own time.\n\n\"It's safe but they also get to clock their distance. It's nice that we're doing it together so they are already excited for it, they're comparing (their runs) with each other.\"\n\nITE is also planning its own virtual run in November and Govin thought that the STVR was the perfect platform for them to experience what a virtual run was like.\n\nOn why she wanted to take part in the virtual race, first-year student Ng Li Yan said: \"We don't have to complete it within a day and we can run at own time and pace so you won't feel pressured by other runners' presence.\"\n\nThe 17-year-old has been running twice a week over distances of about 2km to train for event.\n\nOthers like Mikhail Raiyan Abdul Aziz have also been training for the run.

He blamed himself for the Miami Heat's inability to close out the Boston Celtics last Friday.\n\nOn Sunday, Adebayo had a career-high 32 points and 14 rebounds, and Miami booked their trip to the National Basketball Association Finals with a 125-113 win over the Celtics near Orlando.\n\n\"I was locked in. My family knows how I get when I play bad - especially if we lose - I put that on my shoulders,\" said the centre, who led the team with an average of 21.8 points per game during the Eastern Conference finals, but was held to 13 points in his previous outing.\n\n\"I let my teammates down in Game 5. So I just had to realign myself with who I really want to become, and I just showed that tonight. You say you haven't seen me be a scorer in the fourth before.\"\n\nHe scored 10 points in the final quarter, when teammate Tyler Herro came alive with 11 of his 19 points. Including dribble hand-offs, Adebayo was involved in 14 straight fourth-quarter points for the Heat.\n\nMiami trailed by six with 9min 18sec remaining. Midway through the final period, Adebayo was fouled on a lay-up and made the free throw to put them up 101-100 and they would not trail again.\n\n\"(Adebayo) in particular dominated that fourth quarter,\" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \"Even the plays where he didn't score, his presence was so impactful and it put us in a bind.\"\n\nJimmy Butler finished with 22 points and Andre Iguodala scored a season-high 15 as the Heat advanced to the Finals for the first time since 2014.\n\nThe fifth seeds will face 16-time champions Los Angeles Lakers in Game 1 tomorrow.

He touched the ball six times as Fati ran riot down the left-hand side - his electric pace, quick feet and directness causing the visiting defence no end of problems.\n\nThe 17-year-old, in his second season in Barca's first team, then won the penalty which captain Messi dispatched in the 35th minute.\n\nVillarreal defender Pau Torres scored an own goal at the end of the first half, with Barca continuing to dominate in the second half.\n\nFor years, Barca managers have been trying to limit the team's reliance on Messi - Messidependencia as it is known in Spain.\n\nThere had been a lot of talk about the 4-2-3-1 shape Koeman had been working on in pre-season and the formation could hardly have had a better first outing. The Dutchman deployed Messi in the false nine role that he had perfected a decade ago, with Fati on the left wing and Antoine Griezmann on the right, with a reborn Philippe Coutinho as an attacking midfielder to knit the offence together.\n\nBehind the front four, Sergio Busquets and Frenkie de Jong provided a solid base that saw Barca swarm all over Villarreal and move the ball with speed and purpose, a welcome contrast to the ponderous, slow football they had played for much of last season.\n\n\"It's always important to win games,\" said Koeman, who succeeded Quique Setien last month after the crushing 8-2 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-finals. \"You gain confidence.

That still hurts me.\"\n\nWith scientists still racing to find a working vaccine, governments are again forced into an uneasy balancing act: Virus controls slow the spread of the disease, but they hurt already reeling economies.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund earlier this year warned that the economic upheaval could cause a \"crisis like no other\" as the world's gross domestic product collapsed.\n\nEurope, hit hard by the first wave, is facing another surge in cases, with Paris, London and Madrid forced to introduce curbs to slow infections threatening to overload hospitals.\n\nMasks and social distancing in shops, cafes and public transport are now part of everyday life in many cities.\n\nThe middle of this month saw a record rise in cases in most regions and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned virus deaths could double to two million without more global collective action.\n\nThe Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the illness known as Covid-19 made its first known appearance in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and the city was shut down in January. How it got there is still unclear.\n\nBy March 11, the virus had emerged in over 100 countries and the WHO declared a pandemic, expressing concern about the \"alarming levels of inaction\".\n\nDr Patrick Vogt, a family doctor in Mulhouse, a city that became the outbreak's epicentre in France in March, said he realised the coronavirus was everywhere when doctors started falling ill, some dying.\n\n\"We saw people in our surgery who had really big breathing problems, young and not-so-young who were exhausted,\" he said.\n\nNor did the virus spare the rich or famous. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a week in hospital. Pop star Madonna tested positive after a tour of France, as did actor Tom Hanks and his wife who recovered and returned home to Los Angeles after quarantine in Australia.\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics, Rio's famed Carnival and the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca are among the major events postponed or disrupted by the pandemic. Premier League football has restarted but with empty stadiums.\n\nIsrael has gone into full lockdown again and Moscow's vulnerable have been ordered to stay home.\n\nAs the restrictions tighten, protests and anger are rising as businesses worry about their survival and individuals grow frustrated.\n\nAlong with the turmoil, though, lies some hope, with Wuhan now appearing to have controlled the disease. Crucially, nine vaccine candidates are in last-stage clinical trials, with hopes some will be rolled out next year, though questions remain about how and when they will be distributed around the world.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nGlobal Affairs\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nInfectious diseases", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_manaus_280920.jpg?VersionId=1jgwlNl.jjji6jiiYu3FlgF1hBjr8rlE", "alt_text": null}]}

The paper said all pubs, restaurants and bars would be ordered to shut for two weeks.\n\nAsked about The Times report, Mrs Whately said the country was at a really serious point and so Covid-19 had to be brought under control. She did not give a direct answer on the report that pubs would be closed.\n\n\"This is the moment when we have an opportunity - we have a choice for the country - to get this back under control. We have to break these chains of transmission,\" Mrs Whately said.\n\nIn Spain, protesters hit the streets of Madrid against coronavirus restrictions on Sunday, the day before a partial lockdown was extended to more areas of the capital region to curb a surge in coronavirus cases.\n\nThe city with its surrounding region is at the epicentre of a second wave of infections sweeping Spain. Covid-19 has already claimed more than 31,000 lives nationwide, the highest infection rate in the European Union.\n\nSince Sept 21, some 850,000 people in 37 mainly densely populated low-income districts in southern Madrid have been confined to their neighbourhoods, unable to leave except for work, school or medical reasons - although they are able to move freely within their own areas. Parks in the affected neighbourhoods are closed and restaurants and other businesses must shut at 10pm.\n\nThe regional government of Madrid, which is responsible for health, extended the restrictions from yesterday to eight more districts, home to another 167,000 people. Its latest move still falls short of a recommendation from Spain's government that the partial lockdown should cover the entire city.\n\nHundreds of people gathered outside the Madrid regional Parliament in southern district Vallecas, one of the neighbourhoods under partial lockdown since last week, to protest against the restrictions. Many complained of discrimination by the authorities.\n\n\"It's not lockdown, it's segregation!\" the crowd chanted. One of the signs on display stated: \"They don't confine the rich.\"\n\nSimilar smaller demonstrations were held in other parts of the city.\n\n\"It makes no sense that you can go to work in a wealthier area but can't go have a drink,\" Mr Marcos Ruiz Guijarro, 27, said. \"Infections are rising everywhere. The rules should be the same for everyone.\"\n\nMany demonstrators complained that the regional government had failed to improve public healthcare or do anything to reduce overcrowding in the transport system, where they said the virus could easily spread. The regional government said it has targeted areas where the contagion rate is above 1,000 cases per 100,000 people.\n\nOver the past week, Spain has registered the highest number of new cases within the EU, with a rate of nearly 300 per 100,000 inhabitants - but in the Madrid region, the figure is more than 700 per 100,000.\n\nREUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nBritain\n\nSpain\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_VNWALES_5994693.jpg?VersionId=4.6sSImeeonN0D5TY5eaOLL2aF2U1CGA", "alt_text": "People walking in the city of Cardiff, in the south of Wales, on Sunday.

It will also expand imports of safe meat products from more nations to supplement output.

That could cost millions of Americans their healthcare coverage.\n\nMr Biden said: \"The clear focus is: This is about your healthcare... This is about whether or not pre-existing conditions will continue to be covered. This is about whether or not a woman can be charged more for the same procedure as a man.

While he is consistently, if narrowly, leading in national polls, Mr Biden is pitching himself as the anti-Trump, who will bring decency, compassion and unity back to America.\n\nBut he also faces accusations of being weak and uninspiring. He has staged far fewer in-person campaign events than Mr Trump.\n\nHe also faces a President skilled in the arts of bludgeoning rivals and playing to the gallery of his own narrow but devoted base.\n\nMr Biden is likely to be the target of well-aimed barbs over the conduct of his son, Hunter Biden, who is alleged to have benefited from his father being vice-president.\n\nThe flip side is that expectations of Mr Biden are relatively low, so a passable performance will impress.\n\nAlso, he comes into the debate on the heels of potentially damaging revelations, in an apparently extensively researched New York Times article, that\n\nMr Trump has been paying startlingly low income tax on his family business empire.\n\nThe President, while deflecting blame to China, is also vulnerable on his pandemic record; last week, America passed the grim\n\nmilestone of 200,000 deaths.\n\nUnlike Mr Trump, who considers his almost daily prickly exchanges with reporters as adequate training, Mr Biden has been preparing extensively for the debates. After Ohio, they will meet in Florida on Oct 15 and in Tennessee on Oct 22.\n\n\"President Trump will definitely try to throw the (former) vice-president a bunch of curveballs that are designed to get him off his game,\" Mr Jay Carney, who was Mr Biden's communications director and also White House press secretary under president Barack Obama, told Bloomberg News.\n\n\"(Mr Biden) fully expects and is preparing for that and knows that taking that bait is not what he wants to do,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this month at a fund-raiser, Mr Biden said: \"I hope I don't get baited into getting into a brawl with this guy.\" He added: \"It's going to be hard, because I predict he's going to be shouting.\"\n\nLast Saturday, Mr Biden told MSNBC that Mr Trump \"doesn't know how to debate the facts. He's not that smart. He doesn't know that many facts. He doesn't know much about foreign policy. He doesn't know much about domestic policy. He doesn't know much about the detail\".\n\nIn an average of national polls maintained by the political analysis website FiveThirtyEight, Mr Biden has a roughly seven-point, 50.3 per cent to 43 per cent, lead over Mr Trump.\n\nBut six states - Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin and Ohio - are considered toss-ups, which is alarming for Mr Biden as it indicates that Mr Trump could repeat his 2016 triumph, in which he lost the popular vote but won a handful of key states to win the all-important Electoral College.\n\nThe 90-minute debate at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic will be moderated by Fox News host Chris Wallace.\n\nThe topics, each of which will get about 15 minutes, are Mr Trump's and Mr Biden's records; the Supreme Court; the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic; the economy, race and violence in American cities; and the integrity of the presidential election.\n\nAn obvious omission, climate change, will almost certainly figure in subsequent debates.\n\nThe issue of the Supreme Court has been thrown into sharp focus with\n\nthe death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,\n\nan icon for liberals and the left, and\n\nMr Trump's nomination last week of Judge Amy Coney Barrett,\n\na darling of religious conservatives, to fill the vacancy.\n\nHe is intent on Mrs Barrett's confirmation before the election to cement what would then be a principal domestic legacy - packing the court with conservatives.\n\nThe last topic is also fraught, and not unconnected with the push to fill the seat left vacant by Justice Ginsburg.\n\nMany analysts see America barrelling towards a constitutional crisis and possible violence if, as seems likely, the result of the election is either muddied by a long, drawn-out process involving court battles, or simply not accepted by one or the other candidate.\n\nMr Trump has\n\nrepeatedly and explicitly questioned the integrity of mail-in ballots,\n\nwhich have always been a feature of American elections - in some states more than others - and in this election assume greater importance given the risk of mingling in queues and groups in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nHe has stated more than once that the only way he can lose is if the election is \"rigged\".\n\nLike heavyweight wrestling matches, the presidential debates are part of the showbiz of American politics, an ecosystem in which Mr Trump, a former reality television star, thrives.\n\nAs a long-time senator and a veteran of the Barack Obama campaigns, Mr Biden's experience of debates is very substantial - but more traditional.\n\n\"Debates don't reward folks who speak in complete sentences and long paragraphs,\" Mr Carney said.\n\n\"They really reward one-liners and insults and zingers.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nJoe Biden\n\nDonald Trump\n\nElections", "images": []}

Mr Trump has reported a loss of over US$315 million on golf courses since 2000, with much of that centred on Trump National Doral near Miami.\n\nThe hotel he opened in the heart of Washington in 2016 has recorded more than US$55 million in losses, the report said.\n\nAn exception is Trump Tower in New York, which reliably earns him more than US$20 million in profits a year.\n\nA BIG AUDIT\n\nThe Times report also found that Mr Trump has been feuding with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the last decade over a nearly US$73 million tax refund he previously claimed.\n\nIf the IRS were to prevail in its audit, which has seemingly stalled in recent years, Mr Trump could be responsible for paying more than US$100 million to the government.\n\nBRAND IMAGE\n\nThe Times also found that a large amount of Mr Trump's profits came from selling Mr Trump himself.\n\nIt reported that the former reality television star made a combined US$427.4 million from 2004 to 2018 by selling his name and image through various endorsements and licensing deals.\n\nThe Times said Mr Trump used proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up some of his other businesses, including those which were losing money.\n\nAGGRESSIVE WRITE-OFFS\n\nMr Trump has been aggressive in claiming certain business expenses that further shrank his tax bill, according to the Times.\n\nThat includes US$70,000 in hair-styling expenses tied to The Apprentice, his former television programme, and classifying a New York property - described by the Trump Organisation as a family retreat - to be an investment property to write off millions in property taxes.\n\nLOANS COMING DUE\n\nIn the 1990s, Mr Trump nearly ruined himself by personally guaranteeing hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, and he has since said that he regretted doing so.\n\nBut he has taken the same step again, his tax records show.\n\nHe appears to be responsible for loans totalling US$421 million, most of which is coming due within four years.\n\nShould he win another term in office, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president.\n\nLARGE REFUND CRUCIAL TO TAX AVOIDANCE\n\nMr Trump did face large tax bills after the initial success of The Apprentice television show, but he erased most of these tax payments through a refund.\n\nCombined, Mr Trump initially paid almost US$95 million in federal income taxes over the 18 years. He later managed to recoup most of that money, with interest, by applying for and receiving a US$72.9 million tax refund, starting in 2010.\n\nThe refund reduced his total federal income tax bill between 2000 and 2017 to an annual average of US$1.4 million.\n\nBy comparison, the average American in the top 0.001 per cent of earners paid about US$25 million in federal income taxes each year over the same span.\n\nREUTERS, NYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTaxation\n\nTax evasion\n\nUS news", "images": []}

The notices affected at least 5,000 people, he added.\n\nBy evening, flames stoked by winds gusting up to 80kmh had scorched about 728ha of grassy rolling hillsides and oak woodlands, with little or no containment, Mr Zander said.\n\nThe cause of the fire is being investigated. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe blaze erupted midway through the traditional grape-harvesting period in the Napa Valley, world renowned as one of California's premier wine-producing regions. The area's 475 wineries account for just 4 per cent of the state's total annual grape harvest but half of the retail value of all California wines sold, according to the Napa Valley Vintners trade group.\n\nNapa and other wine-growing regions have been hit by wildfires in and around the Bay area for several years.

The increase coincides with the Jewish High Holidays, the most holy days in the Jewish calendar, that culminated yesterday with Yom Kippur.\n\n\"These areas account for over 23 per cent of new cases citywide... despite representing just under 7 per cent of the city's overall population,\" New York city health services said, adding that the data showed an increase in hospitalised patients in two Brooklyn hospitals, and at least one hospital in Queens.\n\nThe increase has raised fears of a second wave in New York, which reported a record 23,800 Covid-19 fatalities when the epidemic peaked in the spring.\n\nLast Friday, the health authorities organised a press conference in one of the most affected Brooklyn neighbourhoods, Borough Park.\n\n\"This may be the most precarious position with Covid-19 we have experienced in months,\" said health commissioner Dave Chokshi, urging people to wear face masks and respect social distancing measures.\n\nBut he and his colleagues were booed by at least two people in the crowd, including Orthodox Jewish radio host Heshy Tischler who is known for his anti-mask stance, video from NBC showed.\n\n\"There are people who refuse to believe the truth, this is a deadly virus and we have easy ways to avoid it,\" Dr Mitchell Katz, the chief of New York's municipal healthcare system, told the news station.\n\nThe health authorities announced a series of educational activities for neighbourhood residents in the coming days.\n\nWith the reopening of public schools scheduled for Thursday, the authorities also warned they would conduct inspections in non-public schools - including many yeshivas, or religion-focused Jewish schools - and would close facilities and impose fines if necessary.\n\nBut the restart of in-person learning has been a touchy subject and has already been postponed twice, as more parents of New York's some 1.1 million public school students opt instead for remote classes.\n\nThe Council of School Supervisors and Administrators (CSA) has called for management of the school system - traditionally the mayor's responsibility in the US - to be transferred to the New York state educational services during the pandemic.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio recently promised to hire some 4,500 additional teachers to facilitate both in-person and online learning.\n\nBut according to the CSA, a union that claims to represent about 6,400 officials for the city's 1,800 public schools, he and Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza failed to hire enough teachers.\n\nIt is unclear whether schools will reopen on Thursday as planned. Mr de Blasio and the State Department of Education have not responded to the CSA's statement.\n\nThe United States reported at least 267 new coronavirus deaths and 37,332 new cases on Sunday, according to a New York Times database. Over the past week, there was an average of 43,111 daily cases, a 23 per cent increase from a fortnight ago.

The Premier League, the referee, the coaches, the managers, the players, I don't know how we've allowed this type of situation, which we have at virtually every match at the moment, to occur because the rules of football are important,\" he said after the 2-1 loss to Everton on Saturday.\n\nA day later, Newcastle were given a stoppage-time penalty after the referee via the video assistant referee ruled that Tottenham's Eric Dier had handled the ball as he jumped up for an aerial challenge with Newcastle's Andy Carroll.\n\nMagpies manager Steve Bruce, despite benefiting from the decision, described it as \"nonsense\".\n\nHandful of problems\n\nQ What is the new handball law for this season?\n\nA\n\nStrictly speaking there is no \"new\" handball law in the Premier League this season. The Premier League is, however, enacting the same law and interpretation of it that was seen across other European leagues last season. English officials had previously taken a more liberal attitude towards that law.\n\nQ Why has it done that?\n\nA\n\nIn July, world governing body Fifa took charge of matters relating to video assistant referee (VAR) from the rule-making body, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), and Fifa officials, including former Italian referee, Pierluigi Collina, made it clear that all leagues should play by the same laws and interpretations of them.\n\nQ So why did Ifab change the handball law?\n\nA\n\nThe old law stated that deliberate handling of the ball, with hand or arm, was an offence. This was clearly a subjective matter involving an assessment of intent and led to much argument over decisions. The changes were an attempt to reduce the subjectivity and put the focus on what Ifab calls \"factual\" aspects - such as the position of the arm, which can be assessed through video review.\n\nQ How has this worked?\n\nA\n\nWe have seen handball decisions in the Premier League that were unlikely to have been given previously. For example, Eric Dier's offence for Tottenham against Newcastle on Sunday when he had his back turned to an opponent while he jumped and the ball was headed against his outstretched arm. Players have been penalised for shots at close-range which have struck their arm involuntarily.\n\nQ I thought it wasn't a foul if the defender was close to the attacker?\n\nA\n\nThat is the case only \"if the hand/arm is close to the body and does not make the body unnaturally bigger\".\n\nQ Doesn't a player tend to raise his arms when he jumps for a header?\n\nA\n\nThat has been argued by some former players. The law, however, states that the arms should not be raised above shoulder level to avoid the risk of a handball decision.\n\nQ So if this is causing controversy and more handball penalties in England, what happened when it was introduced elsewhere last season?\n\nA\n\nThe number of penalties for handball had already increased with the introduction of VAR. Yet last season in Italy's Serie A for example, the number of handball penalties rose from 37 to 57. In Spain, they rose from 35 to 48.\n\nQ There are calls for the law to be changed, is that likely?\n\nA\n\nIfab has been willing to tweak and alter laws with increasing frequency, so some change cannot be ruled out, but with VAR now part of the game, they are unlikely to return to the old law based purely on intent to handle.\n\nREUTERS\n\n\"Maybe Roy is right, maybe we all need to get together,\" he added. \"The decisions are ruining the spectacle. We have to get together as managers and say this must stop.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher, now a pundit with Sky Sports, also weighed in.\n\n\"Whether it's the Premier League, the FA, Fifa, Pierluigi Collina (chairman of the Fifa referees' committee), whoever's involved in this - stop it, because you are ruining football for everybody,\" he said.\n\nThere has been no indication from the Premier League or the FA that they intend to request a change to the law. The Premier League did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Ifab declined to comment.\n\nOne option to deal with the concerns would be for the referees body, Professional Game Match Officials Limited, to change its interpretation of the law back to last season's approach but that risks conflict with Fifa and its referee bodies.\n\nPundit Graeme Souness admitted the rules are harsh but could lead to more controversy and excitement.\n\n\"Maybe going forward, we'll think there's more goals being scored, more for us to talk about, more excitement in the stadiums,\" he said. The Premier League saw seven goals scored from penalties last weekend - the highest number after Sept 13-14 in 2003 (eight).\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nEPL\n\nFootball matches\n\nFifa\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nNewcastle United", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_SPTREF_5995401.jpg?VersionId=.amS6rCVFBMilb1Yor8iS_DmuJErYn04", "alt_text": "Referee Peter Bankes checking the video assistant referee monitor before awarding a hotly disputed penalty to Newcastle in added time, enabling the visitors to escape with a 1-1 draw at Tottenham on Sunday.

This means they can report tax losses while earning fat profits.\n\nTax campaigners have long argued the tax break was a giveaway not needed to spur real estate investment and should be abolished.\n\nOutside of the real estate sector, or in cases of real estate tycoons whose buildings no longer offer big depreciation deductions - something the Times said might apply to Trump - it is a maneuver that becomes more difficult to achieve.\n\n\"Wealthy people for the most part pay taxes,\" said Annette Nellen, professor of tax at the College of Business, San Jose State University.\n\nShe said that if Trump did not enjoy big depreciation deductions - applied against his earnings from his TV show \"The Apprentice\" and licensing his name to developers around the world - it would have been difficult to pay no tax whatsoever.\n\n\"You would think he had some income to pay taxes on,\" she added.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment In a series of Twitter posts, the Republican president responded on Monday to the New York Times report.\n\n\"I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation & tax credits,\" he wrote.\n\nThe United States has not published individuals' tax returns since a brief period in the 1920s so it is impossible to know how much wealthy people typically pay in tax.\n\nThe tax records published in 2012 by then presidential candidate Mitt Romney were a rare insight into the tax affairs of the wealthy.\n\nThe documents revealed he paid an effective federal tax rate of 14 per cent on US$14 million (S$19.21 million) of income. That result was largely because of the low tax rate applied to capital gains and dividends - something successive governments had confirmed in the hope that it may stoke business creation- but not aided by the business structure or potential deductions someone like Trump enjoys.\n\nIn his financial disclosures since 2016, Trump has reported gains from selling shares and land. Trump has not released his tax documents, bucking a decades-old tradition for US presidential candidates to make their returns public.\n\nBeyond his real estate dealings, another way Trump was reported to reduce his tax bill was by putting personal expenses through his businesses and designating a family estate outside New York City as a business.\n\nExperts said it was not uncommon for wealthy business owners to claim holiday homes or hobby farms were businesses whose running costs should be offset against other income, or that private jet flights for weekends away in Miami were business expenses.\n\n\"They are not alone. We see court cases on this in the US every year,\" Nellen said.\n\nHowever, experts said it was impossible to know the extent to which Trump's zero tax bill was due to generous breaks, tax avoidance - the bending of tax rules to pay less than the law intended - or the fact that he simply did not have a big income across the years involved.\n\nAt least several of Trump's properties have been loss-making in recent years, published accounts and property tax records show. A 2016 Reuters examination of his golf courses found that Trump had invested around US$1 billion building a portfolio of assets which were worth as little as half that value.\n\nTrump disputed that estimate.\n\nThe Times said Trump was coming under increasing financial pressure due to ongoing losses at some of his businesses and with debt repayments coming due over the next few years.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTaxation", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/bttrumpp20200928.jpg?VersionId=h8E6mbosv.CpFAUB1XIOjykxO31k4Fsc", "alt_text": null}]}

But that was as good as it got for City as Vardy tore their creaky defence to pieces with his pace and movement on Sunday.\n\nHe won two penalties on a night when Eric Garcia, Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy committed identical mistakes, getting caught out to concede three spot-kicks.\n\nVardy converted both penalties either side of a classy back-heel finish, while James Maddison added a fourth. Youri Tielemans completed City's embarrassment with a late penalty after new signing Nathan Ake scored his first City goal.\n\nGuardiola rued his team's lack of composure but vowed to bounce back after City conceded five goals in the league at home for the first time since a 5-1 defeat by Arsenal in February 2003.\n\n\"It's a tough result but I am not going to give up. I am going to find solutions for the team to be stable,\" said the Spaniard, who had attempted to protect his backline by deploying Fernandinho and Rodri in front of them.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The problem was that we put extra pressure on ourselves to score the second and third.\n\n\"We need to be more calm, we don't have the players to attack the box that we need.\"\n\nWith both natural strikers Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus out injured, City looked toothless despite having the lion's share of the possession. Former Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher believes the lack of a recognised finisher had a knock-on effect on their overall display, and with the duo set to remain unavailable for weeks, City have more puzzles to solve.\n\n\"Pep usually goes with a single pivot as part of a 4-3-3,\" he told the BBC. \"But with the players he had available, he went with two holding midfielders... and moved Kevin de Bruyne to more of a No. 10 position, behind Raheem Sterling who was playing as a central striker.\n\n3\n\nPenalties Leicester scored, making them the first team to score three times from the spot in one Premier League match.\n\n\"City had three, four or even five players out of position - or at least not playing in their best position - and, on top of that, their full-backs never offered anything attacking-wise down the flanks.\"\n\nAnother mitigating factor was the absence of their No. 1 centre-back Aymeric Laporte, who was only fit enough to make it to the bench, with his new partner set to be Dias once his move from Benfica is ratified.\n\nThe Portuguese club revealed they have agreed a deal to sell the 23-year-old for \u20ac68 million (S$108.9 million) plus add-ons, with City's Nicolas Otamendi going the other way in a separate transfer for \u20ac15 million.\n\nDias made 137 appearances during a four-year spell with Benfica, winning the league title last year.\n\nFormer England defender Gary Neville said Guardiola is facing the biggest challenge of his career with City's defence despite managing to add the Portugal international, who was part of the side that lifted the Nations League trophy last year.\n\n\"Some of the wounds from last season are reappearing.

Here are the key issues surrounding their conflict:\n\nNAGORNO-KARABAKH\n\nAt the heart of the stand-off between Yerevan and Baku is the contested Nagorno-Karabakh region.\n\nThe Soviet authorities merged the predominantly ethnic Armenian territory with Azerbaijan in 1921. After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenian separatists seized it in a move supported by Yerevan.\n\nAn ensuing war left 30,000 people dead and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes. Despite a ceasefire mediated in 1994 by Russia, the United States and France, peace negotiations struggle to move forward and fighting erupts frequently.\n\nThe latest clashes on Sunday saw Azerbaijan and Armenian separatists accuse each other of igniting the fighting that left both sides with casualties, including civilians. It followed a flare-up along the border in July which claimed the lives of 17 soldiers from both sides.\n\nIn April 2016, some 110 people were killed in the most serious fighting in years.\n\nREVOLTS AND DYNASTY\n\nArmenia, a Christian country since the fourth century, has been rocked by political and economic instability since it gained independence from the former USSR.\n\nThe country's post-Soviet leadership repressed opposition to its rule, was accused of falsifying ballot results, and was largely beholden to the interests of Russia. Mass street protests in 2018 brought current Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to power. He has since cracked down on corruption and introduced popular judicial reforms.\n\nMuslim-majority Azerbaijan, on the Caspian Sea, has been under the authoritarian grip of a single family since 1993. Mr Heydar Aliyev, a former officer of the Soviet security services, the KGB, ruled the country with an iron fist until October 2003. He handed over power to his son Ilham weeks before his death.\n\nLike his father, Mr Ilham has quashed all opposition to his rule and in 2017 made his wife, Mehriban, the country's first vice-president.\n\nRUSSIA AND TURKEY\n\nTurkey, with ambitions to be a regional power broker in the Caucasus, has thrown its weight behind oil-rich and Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan. Their alliance is fuelled by a mutual mistrust of Armenia, and Ankara routinely issues strongly worded statements in support of Baku's ambitions to reclaim Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nYerevan harbours hostility towards Ankara over the massacre of some 1.5 million Armenians by Turkey under the Ottoman Empire during World War I. More than 30 countries have recognised the killings as genocide, although Turkey fiercely disputes the term.\n\nRussia, which maintains close ties with Armenia, is the major power broker in the region. It leads the Collective Security Treaty Organisation military alliance of former Soviet countries that includes Armenia. Yerevan relies on Russian support and military guarantees because its defence budget is overshadowed by Azerbaijan's spending on arms.\n\nOIL AND DIASPORA\n\nAzerbaijan has recently begun leveraging oil revenues as part of an attempt to overhaul its image in the West. It has also tried to pitch itself to European countries as an alternative energy supplier to Russia.\n\nBaku has invested in massive sponsorship deals including with the Euro 2020 football championship, which was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Azerbaijan has held Formula 1 Grand Prix races since 2016.\n\nOn the international stage, Armenia has a vast and influential diaspora that fled during the Ottoman-era repressions.\n\nReality TV star Kim Kardashian, the late singer Charles Aznavour, and pop star and actress Cher all trace their roots to Armenia. Some have appointed themselves unofficial ambassadors, like Ms Kardashian, who has been outspoken on the issue of the Armenian genocide.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nArmenia\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nGlobal Affairs", "images": []}

Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, while Ankara backs its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.\n\nMs Angela Frangyan, a documentary film-maker living in Nagorno-Karabakh's capital Stepanakert, said residents had taken cover in bomb shelters and constant shelling could be heard.\n\nMajority-Christian Armenia and mainly-Muslim Azerbaijan have come to blows periodically in their decades-long conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has demanded that Armenia immediately withdraw from Azeri lands he said it was occupying and added that it was time to end the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis.\n\nArmenia's Parliament condemned what it said was a \"full-scale military attack\" by Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh that was receiving Turkey's help.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Its foreign minister said six Azeri civilians had been killed and 19 wounded.\n\nAn Armenian defence ministry representative said 200 Armenians were wounded, according to Interfax news agency.\n\nNagorno-Karabakh reported 15 more of its soldiers had been killed, after saying on Sunday that 16 of its servicemen had been killed and over 100 wounded. It also said it had recovered some territory it had lost control of on Sunday.\n\nInterfax quoted the press secretary of Azerbaijan's defence ministry, Mr Anar Evyazov, as saying that the Azeri military occupied several strategically important heights near the village of Talish.\n\n\"Missile, artillery and air strikes are being applied to the enemy's positions, which forced the enemy to surrender the held positions,\" he said, adding that Mr Lernik Babayan, commander of the Armenian military's airborne assault battalion, had been killed near Talish. It was not immediately possible to verify the report.\n\nThe clashes have spurred a flurry of diplomacy.\n\nChina urged both sides to show restraint. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire and Turkey said it would support Azerbaijan.\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres said on Sunday that he was \"extremely concerned over the fresh resumption of hostilities\". His spokesman said in a statement: \"The secretary-general strongly calls on the sides to immediately stop fighting, de-escalate tensions and return to meaningful negotiations without delay.\"\n\nMr Guterres \"condemns the use of force and regrets the loss of life and the toll on the civilian population\", the statement said, adding that the UN chief would speak to the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia.\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy and the European Union also urged an immediate ceasefire, while Pope Francis prayed for peace.\n\nUnder international law, Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised as part of Azerbaijan but the ethnic Armenians who make up most of the population reject Azeri rule.\n\nThey have run their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\n\nAlthough a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.\n\nREUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nArmenia\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nUN", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_ARMENIA1_5995497.jpg?VersionId=36nldl.zVsZLSj.lvFY2Jw2mpFpBxRHd", "alt_text": "An Armenian surveying the damage to his house in Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday, after recent shelling by Azeri forces.

It also said he earned US$73 million abroad in his first two years in the White House, including from countries such as the Philippines and Turkey, despite a pledge that he would pursue no new foreign deals while president.\n\nMr Trump said at a press conference on Sunday that the report is \"totally fake news\", adding \"I pay a lot\" but without offering specifics.\n\n\"They're under audit and when they're not, I would be proud to show you,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nMr Trump bucked tradition in refusing to release his personal tax records, which had become standard among candidates for office in recent decades. House Democrats have issued subpoenas for the documents, which have been mired in legal battles for more than a year. The Supreme Court said in July that lower courts needed to do more to scrutinise the tax return requests.\n\nThe Times did not disclose how it got the documents, but said they came from sources with legal access to the information. A lawyer for Trump Organisation told the Times that \"most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate\".\n\nThe revelations about Mr Trump's financial life are likely to be a key point of contention heading into the final month of the presidential campaign. Mr Trump, who has built his public image as a successful businessman and as a billionaire, faces a series of financial challenges, according to the Times.\n\nLOANS COMING DUE\n\nHis revenue from the NBC television series The Apprentice and from licensing deals is drying up. Several years ago, he sold nearly all the stocks that now might have helped him plug holes in his struggling properties, the Times reported. Within the next four years, more than US$300 million in loans - obligations for which Mr Trump is personally responsible - will come due, the newspaper said.\n\nMr Trump has previously said his tax returns are \"very beautiful\", but he cannot release the documents while they are under audit at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe President also indicated he preferred to minimise his tax bill, saying in a 2016 presidential debate it made him \"smart\".\n\nMr Trump's pick to run the IRS, Mr Chuck Rettig, has said there is no prohibition on making the documents public while an audit is ongoing.\n\nThe Times emphasised the documents reveal only what Mr Trump told the government about his businesses, and did not disclose his true wealth.\n\nThe report found that Mr Trump has written off a long list of things he classified as business expenses, including US$70,000 to his hair stylist while appearing on The Apprentice, and more than US$95,000 for hair and makeup services for his daughter, Ivanka Trump, who is now a top White House aide.\n\nThe Times also reported that Mr Trump has treated an estate in Westchester County, New York, as an investment property for tax purposes, despite listing it as a \"retreat for the Trump family\".\n\nCONSULTING FEES\n\nThe Times report also found that Mr Trump may be using consulting fees as a way to pay his children.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2018, he deducted US$26 million in \"consulting fees\" as a business expense. On her financial disclosure forms, Ms Ivanka Trump has reported consulting income that matched the figures on the tax returns.\n\nThat could potentially run afoul of IRS rules prohibiting exorbitantly overpaying consultants or regulations against skirting gift and inheritance taxes.\n\n\"It appears that the President has gamed the tax code to his advantage and used legal fights to delay or avoid paying what he owes,\" House Ways and Means chairman Richard Neal said in a statement.\n\nMr Neal's committee is engaged in ongoing litigation to obtain Mr Trump's tax returns.\n\nSince becoming president, Mr Trump has seen an increase in demand from some business groups for events and conferences at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, his Washington hotel, and the Doral resort in Miami.\n\nBank of America, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association are among various organisations that have hosted events at Trump properties in recent years, the Times documents show.\n\nBLOOMBERG, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTaxation\n\nTax evasion\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/ST_20200929_FDTRUMPTAX29_5994753.jpg?VersionId=kOV0jM0x.Ro60rDju.0Z8nAeIBlAFBz1", "alt_text": "A protester outside the Supreme Court in July as it ruled on two cases seeking to acquire President Donald Trump's financial records, including his tax returns.

WeChat users won a court injunction in California against a ban last week.\n\nThe bans are part of an increasingly hard line Mr Trump has taken on Beijing as the US presidential election approaches.\n\nThe TikTok order was issued with a sealed opinion, so the reasons for the judge's ruling were not immediately available. The judge also ordered both parties to submit a joint proposed schedule for further hearings \"on or before\" tomorrow.\n\nThe US Commerce Department said: \"The government will comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so, but intends to vigorously defend the EO (Mr Trump's executive order) and the secretary's implementation efforts from legal challenges.\"\n\nByteDance is fighting the Trump administration in court even as it pursues its approval for the sale of a stake in its US business to Oracle and Walmart.

This is an encouraging first step and a relief for the victims,\" she said.\n\nMarie left Elite Models, the world's biggest modelling agency, in 2012 and is today head of the Paris-based agency Oui Management.\n\n'No forgotten victims'\n\nBrinkworth's documentary caused a stir when it was screened in Britain in 1999.\n\nIt led to the suspension of Marie and fellow executive Xavier Moreau. But they were later reinstated and the agency pursued the BBC and other broadcasters of the programme for defamation.\n\nThe documentary, which filmed Elite's activities with a hidden camera, alleged that under-age models were pressured into having sex and using drugs.\n\nThe BBC told AFP it would not deny Brinkworth access to its archives.\n\n\"We have had extensive discussions with her lawyers to establish how we can make material available. We've always been clear the BBC will co-operate fully with any criminal investigation,\" it said.\n\nThe step to investigate Marie came months after a sex harassment probe was opened against French modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, a former associate of accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBrunel, founder of Karin Models and MC2 Model Management, is accused in American court documents of rape and of procuring young girls for Epstein, who was found hanged in his New York jail cell last year while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking.\n\nIn February, the prosecutor of Paris Remy Heitz said French authorities will not rule out opening investigations into crimes that happened outside of the statute of limitations, to ensure there are \"no forgotten victims\".\n\nSee more on\n\nFrance\n\nRape", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/btmarie20200928.jpg?VersionId=E85CJTRlEnLrFk6woQmjukYA.xip_bY_", "alt_text": null}]}

But they are not confined to home and can move freely within their district.\n\nAn initial confinement order affecting 850,000 people was rolled out a week ago, with another 167,000 people added on Monday.

The other 80 per cent remains available for procurement.\n\nDr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, said that more tests were undergoing evaluation and would come online.\n\nThey would be particularly useful in remote settings and to investigate clusters quickly and bring them under control, as well as in areas with widespread community transmission.\n\n\"This will be really, really helpful for communities and countries to be able to know where is the virus and who is infected with the virus,\" she said.\n\nSee more on\n\nWHO\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/bttest20200928.jpg?VersionId=vSMLrwWE.f4JUsQjFTsuj3AGe6NMRaLE", "alt_text": null}]}

The cause of each was under investigation.\n\nThey marked the latest flashpoint in a historically destructive wildfire season throughout the Western United States.\n\nIn California alone, wildfires far have scorched 1.5 million hectares since January - far exceeding any single year in state history.\n\nThey have been stoked by intense, prolonged bouts of heat, high winds and other weather extremes that scientists point to as signs of climate change.\n\nSince mid-August, fires in the state have killed 26 people and destroyed over 7,000 structures.\n\nThe Glass Fire broke out in Napa Valley before dawn near Calistoga before merging with two other blazes into a larger eruption of flames straddling western Napa County and an adjacent swath of Sonoma County.\n\nIn one notable property loss, the mansion-like Chateau Boswell winery in St. Helena, a familiar landmark along the Silverado Trail road running the length of the Napa Valley, went up in flames on Sunday night.\n\nAn estimated 60,000 residents have been placed under evacuation orders or advisories in Sonoma and Napa counties combined.\n\nNot everyone heeded evacuation orders.\n\nAs the small city of Santa Rosa emptied out around him, Jas Sihota stationed himself on his front porch with his garden hose close at hand, darting out every 15 minutes or so to douse spot fires around neighbouring houses seeded by wind-blown embers under a hazy red sun.\n\nSihota, a radiology technician at a nearby hospital, had not slept in some 24 hours since the blaze, since named the Glass Fire, ignited on Sunday morning near Calistoga about 60 miles (96.5 km) north of San Francisco.\n\n\"I wouldn't have a house if I didn't stay,\" said Sihota, adding that neither would some of his neighbours. At least 10 homes elsewhere on the street beyond the reach of his hose were destroyed.\n\nIn 2017, roughly 5 percent of Santa Rosa's homes were lost when downed power lines sparked a devastating firestorm in October that swept the region, killing 19 people.\n\nHARVEST-SEASON SMOKE\n\nThe Glass struck about midway through the region's traditional grape-harvesting season, already disrupted by a spate of large fires earlier this summer.\n\nSeveral Napa Valley growers said recently they would forgo a 2020 vintage altogether due to smoke contamination of ripening grapes waiting to be picked.\n\nThe 475 vintners in Napa Valley alone account for just 4 per cent of the state's grape harvest but half the retail value of all California wines sold. Sonoma County, too, has become a premiere viticulture region with some 450 wineries and a million acres of vineyards.\n\nThe full impact on the region's wine business remains to be seen and will differ for each grower, depending on how far along they are in production, said Ms Teresa Wall, spokeswoman for the Napa Valley Vintners trade group.\n\n\"It's completely variable,\" she said. \"There are some who were close to wrapping up (harvests), and some who were still planning to leave their grapes hanging out there for a while.\"\n\nStill, the fires were causing major disruptions to some of the area's most vulnerable residents in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe 151-bed Adventist Health St. Helena hospital was forced to evacuate patients on Sunday, the second time in a month following a lightning-sparked wildfire in August.\n\nOn Monday, residents at Oakmont Gardens, a retirement community in Santa Rosa, leaned on walkers as they waited to board a bus taking them to safety, their face masks doubling as protection against smoke and the novel coronavirus.\n\nAbout 37,000 homes and business have sustained power disruptions across the region, some from precautionary shutoffs of transmission lines to reduce wildfire risks in the midst of extremely windy, hot, dry weather, Pacific Gas and Electric Company reported.\n\nCalFire said 1,000-plus firefighters were battling the Glass Fire, with at least 18,000 on the front lines of more than two dozen major blazes across the state.\n\nRed flag warnings for extreme wildfire risks remained posted for much of northern California, forecasting low humidity and gale-force wind gusts.\n\nSee more on\n\nFires\n\nNatural disasters\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/btcalifornia20200928.jpg?VersionId=2MYhruFkHVTAcamGuKNztju2oA7v4l05", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/btcalifornia202009282.jpg?VersionId=5C0jcPsqRcl9YlS40amWuikwOxKE5doZ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/29/btcalifornia202009285.jpg?VersionId=DuIEopXagI9Y2MMNQH_4syeHomL17OrC", "alt_text": null}]}

He is facing hundreds of millions of dollars of personal debt that will come due in just a short period of time and he's had a string of business failures that he's propped up\" using his tax returns.\n\nDemocratic Representative Richard Neal, chairman of the US House of Representatives' powerful Ways and Means Committee, said the Times report underscored the importance of the committee's legal effort to seek Trump's tax returns, saying in a tweet on Sunday that Trump had \"gamed the tax code to his advantage.\"\n\nTrump has dismissed the report as \"fake news.\"\n\nIn a post on Twitter on Monday, he said he had paid \"many millions of dollars in taxes\" but was entitled to depreciation and tax credits and was \"extremely under-leveraged\" in terms of his debt and assets.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany described the report as a political hit job that was straight out of the Democratic playbook.\n\n\"We've seen this play out before ... purported tax information dropping the eve of a debate. They tried this in 2016 - it didn't work,\" she told Fox Business Network.\n\nFIRST DEBATE\n\nTrump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will square off in their\n\nfirst presidential debate in Cleveland on Tuesday,\n\njust five weeks before the Nov 3 general election.\n\nPolls show the former vice president leading Trump nationally and in a number of key battleground states that are likely to determine who wins the White House.\n\nDemocrats are trying to turn the tables on Trump, who ran successfully as an economic populist in 2016 and who is regarded by some observers as having an edge over his challenger on the issue of who would best manage the economy.\n\nIn recent days, Biden has characterised the race as a clash between Scranton, the working class Pennsylvania town where he spent part of his childhood, and Park Avenue. Trump Tower, which serves as the headquarters for the Trump Organization, is located near that tony boulevard in Manhattan.\n\nTrump has painted his economic record in glowing terms, saying his policies were responsible for boosting growth and reducing US unemployment to near 50-year lows prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHis message, however, has been badly dented by the recession triggered by the pandemic, which has led to the cratering of the economy and put millions of people out of work.\n\nDemocrats say Trump has mishandled the pandemic, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans, and embraced policies that have favoured corporations and the rich. The re-emergence of his tax history as an election issue could reinforce that theme.\n\n\"This is going to piss some voters off,\" John Anzalone, a pollster who works with Biden, said on Twitter on Monday, adding that the Democratic nominee \"will make the rich and big corporations pay their fair share of taxes.\"\n\nWithin hours of the Times report, Biden's campaign released a video listing the thousands of dollars in income tax typically paid by an elementary school teacher, firefighter, construction manager and registered nurse, before contrasting Trump's reported US$750 bill in 2017.\n\nThe campaign also started selling a two-pack of stickers that say, \"I Paid More In Taxes Than Donald Trump\" for US$7.50.\n\nBiden's tax plan includes hiking the corporate income tax and raising taxes on people making more than US$400,000.\n\nTrump, who signed a US$1.5 trillion Republican-sponsored tax cut package in late 2017, and his supporters accuse Biden of pushing a far-left agenda that they say will destroy the US economy just as it emerges from the pandemic.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nDonald Trump", "images": []}

The session was moderated by chief executive of Strategic Moves and former NMP Viswa Sadasivan.\n\nProf Fisher, an infectious diseases expert, said a lack of good risk communication and community engagement could lead to people failing to do their part to curb the spread of disease.\n\n\"People always think of case management, infection prevention and control, testing, epidemiology and the epidemic curves that we have to flatten... but the final pillar is always risk communications, community engagement.\n\n\"And if you get that wrong, this leads to a failed response,\" said Prof Fisher, who is also chairman of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network steering committee for the World Health Organisation.\n\nMr Fernandez said World News Day was an opportunity to make the case that having credible media organisations is important to the process of public communications.\n\n\"You need good public information going out, you need the experts. But to complete that circle, you need good, credible journalism as well,\" said Mr Fernandez, who is also president of the World Editors Forum.\n\nDuring this Covid-19 period, there has been a surge in number of people accessing news from sources like ST, he said.\n\nThis hunger for information speaks to the issue of trust and credibility.\n\nWhat the newsroom has done is to invest in correspondents, building up their authoritativeness and credibility over the years\n\nso that they can step up when such a crisis breaks out,\n\nhe said.\n\nMr Fernandez said that a decision was made by the daily broadsheet to put\n\nall content related to Covid-19\n\noutside of the paywall as a public service.\n\n\"We did that with some trepidation as it has some commercial implications, but what we found was our subscriptions actually went up, and that says to me that people do value the information and decided 'I do need to know, and I'm prepared to pay',\" he added.\n\nAsked how strong the trust between various institutions and the public is in Singapore and around the world, Prof Fisher said: \"You will notice when you don't have it.\"\n\nThis may not be an issue in Singapore, but other countries are struggling because of this lack of trust, he said.\n\nAs this is a community outbreak, it is the community that needs to be part of the solution.\n\n\"This is not going to be solved by politicians and healthcare workers. It's the community that needs to hear the messages... and be part of the response,\" added Prof Fisher.\n\nIn her opening statement, Dr Tay from SUSS' School of Science and Technology said that Covid-19 has brought not just risk and challenges, but also opportunities in the digital space.\n\nFor instance, some property agents started making virtual reality videos to showcase clients' houses. The pandemic also expedited the use of remote meeting tools like Zoom, she said.\n\nResponding to a question from the audience about how people can adapt as certain jobs are wiped out with the advent of the digital economy, Dr Tay said it was important to harness creativity and the \"human touch\", or emotional intelligence, into creating more compelling products and services.\n\n\"If you see some durian sellers that do live streaming, it's actually very exciting. They are able to engage the audience and show their personality. So we really have to think about how we do things in different ways,\" she said.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/dw-wnd-panel-200928.jpg?VersionId=owdFYYG_LNA4aAoETjWvLuILwDizMH.K", "alt_text": null}]}

The conversation was initially reported by an Iraqi news website.\n\nBy Sunday, Washington had begun preparations to withdraw diplomatic staff if such a decision is taken, those sources and the two Western diplomats said.\n\nThe concern among the Iraqis is that pulling out diplomats would be followed quickly by military action against forces Washington blamed for attacks.\n\nPopulist Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who commands a following of millions of Iraqis, issued a statement last week pleading for groups to avoid an escalation that would turn Iraq into a battleground.\n\nOne of the Western diplomats said the US administration did not \"want to be limited in their options\" to weaken Iran or pro-Iranian militias in Iraq.\n\nAsked whether he expected Washington to respond with economic or military measures, the diplomat replied: \"Strikes.\"\n\nThe US State Department, asked about plans to withdraw from Iraq, said: \"We never comment on the secretary's private diplomatic conversations with foreign leaders... Iran-backed groups launching rockets at our embassy are a danger not only to us but to the government of Iraq.\"\n\nPERENNIAL RISK\n\nIn a region polarised between allies of Iran and the US, Iraq is the rare exception: a country that has close ties with both. But that has left it open to a perennial risk of becoming a battle ground in a proxy war.\n\nThat risk was hammered home in January this year, when Washington\n\nkilled Iran's most important military commander, Qassem Soleimani,\n\nwith a drone strike at Baghdad airport. Iran responded with missiles fired at US bases in Iraq.\n\nSince then, a new prime minister\n\nhas taken power in Iraq,\n\nsupported by the US, while Teheran still maintains close links to powerful Shi'ite armed movements.\n\nRockets regularly fly across the Tigris towards the heavily fortified US diplomatic compound, constructed to be the biggest US embassy in the world in central Baghdad's so-called Green Zone during the US occupation after a 2003 invasion.\n\nIn recent weeks rocket attacks near the embassy have increased and roadside bombs targeted convoys carrying equipment to the US-led military coalition. One roadside attack\n\nhit a British convoy in Baghdad,\n\nthe first of its kind against Western diplomats in Iraq for years.\n\nTwo Iraqi intelligence sources suggested plans to withdraw American diplomats were not yet in motion, and would depend on whether Iraqi security forces were able to do a better job of halting attacks. They said they had received orders to prevent attacks on US sites, and had been told that US evacuations would begin only if that effort failed.\n\nDOUBLE-EDGED SWORD\n\nIraqis are concerned about the impact of November's presidential election on the Trump administration's decision-making.\n\nWhile Mr Trump has boasted of his hard line against Iran, he has also long promised to withdraw US troops from engagements in the Middle East. The US is already drawing down its force sent to help defeat Islamic State fighters in Iraq from 2014-2017.\n\nSome Iraqi officials dismissed Mr Pompeo's threat to pull out diplomats as bluster, designed to scare armed groups into stopping attacks. But they said it could backfire by provoking the militias instead, if they sense an opportunity to push Washington to retreat.\n\n\"The American threat to close their embassy is merely a pressure tactic, but is a double-edged sword,\" said Mr Gati Rikabi, a member of Iraq's parliamentary security committee.\n\nHe and another committee member said US moves were designed to scare Iraqi leaders into supporting Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who has tried to check the power of Iran-aligned militia groups, with scant success.\n\nHAWKS ON BOTH SIDES\n\nThe militias are under public pressure to rein in supporters who might provoke Washington. Since last year, public opinion in Iraq has turned sharply against political groups seen as fomenting violence on behalf of Iran.\n\nPublicly, the powerful Iran-backed Shi'ite militia groups which control large factions in parliament have tried to distance themselves from attacks on Western targets.\n\nUS officials say they think the Shi'ite militias or their Iranian backers have created splinter offshoots to carry out such attacks, allowing the main organisations to evade blame.\n\nA senior figure in a Shi'ite Muslim political party said he thought Mr Trump might want to pull out diplomats to keep them out of harm's way and avoid an embarrassing pre-election incident.\n\nMilitia attacks were not necessarily under Tehran's control, he said, noting that Iran's foreign ministry had publicly called for a halt to attacks on diplomatic missions in Iraq.\n\n\"Iran wants to boot the Americans out, but not at any cost.\n\nIt doesn't want instability on its Western border,\" the Shi'ite leader said. \"Just like there are hawks in the US, there are hawks in Iran who have contact with the groups carrying out attacks, who aren't necessarily following state policy.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nIraq\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nIran", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/yq-usembassy-28092024.jpg?VersionId=BmPhNUiabPQm2IUBik8BopH2fC51zXMQ", "alt_text": null}]}

Her gallery in Orchard, iPreciation, which deals in modern and contemporary Asian art, has been quiet amid the global pandemic.\n\nIn more normal times, art lovers - many of them collectors from other parts of Asia - would stroll in, pull out a chair and sit down with Ms Chan and her staff to find out more about the artworks and their artists. These days, footfall is down by about 80 per cent.\n\n\"The way we usually do business is person to person, but this model is not working any more,\" Ms Chan says, noting that the gallery will do more to engage younger collectors via platforms such as social media.\n\n\"Rent in Singapore is very high. I still believe you need a physical presence, a physical space. But do we need such a big space when people's behaviours have changed? We need to relook our business model.\"\n\nIn July, iPreciation launched an online showcase of paintings by Singapore ink master Zhuang Shengtao. Some existing collectors made appointments to view the art in person and bought pieces in the $6,000 to $9,000 range. This did not really help with the bottom line, says Ms Chan.\n\nCovid-19 has hit galleries hard. Fairs have been cancelled or postponed, overseas collectors cannot travel, and buyers are more cautious. Of the 15 galleries The Straits Times spoke to, most say business has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, with varying degrees of loss in revenue.\n\nAt Tanglin Shopping Centre, some galleries have had a rough couple of months. Gnani Arts lowered its shutters and moved to 55 Genting Lane this month. Hai Hui Art Gallery, whose business has fallen by at least half, cut its operating hours to just two to three days a week. Kwan Hua Art Gallery, whose customers are largely foreigners, has seen its business plummet by at least 90 per cent. It will relocate to a smaller unit in the same building at the end of next month.\n\n\"Our art gallery has been established for 25 years,\" says Kwan Hua gallerist Sandy Tan, \"but this is the first time that business has been dismal for an extended period of time.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Government introduced\n\na raft of measures to help arts groups tide over the pandemic.\n\nAmong them are the Capability Development Scheme for the Arts, as well as a Digital Presentation Grant for the Arts (DPG) to support the efforts of artists and arts groups to go digital.\n\nYeo Workshop is one of a dozen galleries to have received the DPG so far. It has mounted a solo show by Singapore artist Wong Lip Chin, with paintings, a recorded performance and an interactive virtual exhibition in the form of a video game.\n\n\"We were very slow to the digital game,\" admits Yeo Workshop's Ms Audrey Yeo. \"A lot of our sales were done in person and we always were events-based, installations-based, so people had to come in to experience it.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, the gallery's strategy changed. It revamped its website, it updated its social media profile, and it hired a full-timer and two freelancers to focus on digital marketing. It also now has active dealings with digital platforms Artsy and The Artling.\n\nMs Yeo adds: \"More people are discovering us online, but I wonder if that translates into them walking into the gallery, which then translates into sales.\"\n\nYeo Workshop is one of many galleries that have beefed up their online presence.\n\nWhile some are sceptical about how effective an online exhibition can possibly be, those who have mounted such shows - which typically feature images of artworks on a website, or a 360-degree view - tend to see them as merely a complement to physical ones. Ultimately, nothing beats seeing a work of art in person.\n\n\"The greatest happiness for a dealer is when someone walks into his physical space,\" says Gajah Gallery founder Jasdeep Sandhu, who has launched several digital exhibitions.\n\nSome galleries which have sold art online find that collectors usually go for artists they are familiar with, or artworks at a lower price range.\n\nThis was the case for Gnani Arts co-founder P. Gnana, 50, who recently revamped his website and introduced a new online payment gateway.\n\nHe has also noticed that some collectors expect bigger discounts these days. \"We will check with the artist. We have to be very careful, we can't bring down the artist's image and profile,\" he adds.\n\nAmid the pandemic, there are silver linings. A few galleries have noticed more interest from local collectors who, unable to travel, are looking homeward.\n\nRichard Koh Fine Art's recent A Decade Apart/Together exhibition, featuring Singapore artists born in the 1980s and 1990s, saw \"tremendous support from the Singapore community - we almost sold out\", says founder Richard Koh. Works sold were generally priced under $4,000.\n\n\"What I find interesting is that people are looking inwards and looking at local artists instead of thinking 'foreign is best',\" says Mr Koh, who observes a similar trend in his Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok galleries. His business is still down by about 60 per cent.\n\nWith\n\nSingapore's push for domestic tourism,\n\nsome galleries are seeing a more diverse crowd.\n\nOver at Kampong Glam, small gallery Coda Culture says recent exhibition sales have exceeded expectations. Founder Seelan Palay notes that around half of the works by young painter Faris Heizer, whose debut solo show is ongoing, have already been bagged by art lovers. These are priced between $900 and $1,400.\n\nHe adds: \"You don't expect people to focus on art at this point in time, but I guess it's also therapeutic.\"\n\nArt Porters Gallery, housed in a shophouse in Spottiswoode Park Road, is seeing more domestic tourists on weekends.\n\nCo-founder Guillaume Levy-Lambert adds: \"Some people are looking more at art as an investment... Art is something tangible. If you put your money in the stock market, it is a bit abstract.\"\n\nThe gallery is expanding the price range of its works - it will introduce more affordable pieces, but also sell more expensive master works from secondary markets to cater to would-be investors.\n\nMr Levy-Lambert, who will soon launch an exhibition on art information website MutualArt, believes art lovers will continue to buy art that speaks to them. He said that a fortnight before the circuit breaker, an expat couple walked in and told him they had lost most of their life savings in the recent stock market crash.\n\n\"They said, 'We woke up this morning, and we've decided to not be depressed. We're going to buy art.'\" They left with two works of art - one of Mr Levy-Lambert's, priced at $2,400, and another by young artist Priyageetha Dia, at less than $1,000.\n\nLater in the year, Art Porters Gallery will join about 20 other galleries for an SG Gallery Weekend, which is organised by the Art Galleries Association Singapore and runs from Nov 20 to 22.\n\nArt fairs are a way for gallerists to reach out to new collectors, but not everyone is upset that they have being cancelled or postponed.\n\n\"We've been on this carousel for so many years - it's good to take a breather,\" says Mr Koh, whose gallery spends around US$50,000 (S$69,000) to US$100,000 per fair. Before Covid-19, they had already attended fewer art fairs - down from about eight a year to five, as they had found it increasingly hard to meet new collectors that way.\n\nThe Affordable Art Fair\n\nis going digital,\n\nand Singapore's Utterly Art gallery is one of 50 galleries from around the world that will take part in the Affordable Online Art Fair from Nov 4 to 30. Works at the fair are no more than \u00a36,000 (S$10,500) each.\n\nCollectors may be more cautious these days, but many are still willing to collect good art if they see it.\n\nProminent Singapore collector Jackson See, 60, is keeping an eye out for young local artists responding to the pandemic in their work.\n\n\"If the artist can think outside the box and do something related to Covid, it would be very interesting,\" he says.\n\n\"This is history (in the making). The impact is so heavy, and it affects every one. In 20, 30 years, we'll look back and reflect on what the situation was like in the world.\"\n\nWith so much uncertainty over how long the Covid-19 pandemic will last, galleries hope collectors will continue to support them.\n\nKwan Hua Art Gallery's Ms Tan adds: \"For those who enjoy art and have been fortunate to not be badly impacted by the pandemic, I hope they can continue to show support for local art galleries.\n\n\"It would be a sad day if local art galleries put up their shutters because of the pandemic.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCulture\n\nVisual arts\n\nExhibitions\n\nCovid-19 Special", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/yq-ipre-28092024.jpg?VersionId=WTJaXZ_qtjkyuNweRe0cm3JnrJvFxUlf", "alt_text": null}]}

Details of the plan and what types of borrowers will be covered under an extension are still being finalised, they said.\n\nUnder the current measures announced in March,\n\nsmall and medium-sized firms can opt to postpone principal payments\n\non their secured term loans until the end of the year. Consumers can defer both principal and interest payments on residential mortgages. Individuals suffering a loss of income can ask for a\n\nlower interest rate on unsecured credit.\n\nAn extension to the debt moratorium would help mitigate the so-called \"cliff effect\" on consumers and businesses once relief measures end. Authorities are using both fiscal and monetary tools to provide support against what may be a record recession that came with the pandemic. The government introduced additional support measures of $8 billion last month to cushion the blow from the virus, bringing Singapore's total pledged pandemic aid to more than $100 billion.\n\nEASING BACK\n\nMAS managing director Ravi Menon in July said the regulator was talking to banks and finance companies about how to ease borrowers into gradually resuming repayments once the debt relief measures expire.\n\n\"We want to avoid 'cliff effects' of a sudden withdrawal of these reliefs,\" Mr Menon told reporters during the release of the MAS annual report. The central bank has eased monetary policy to help stabilise the economy, and has ensured ample liquidity at financial institutions. It also asked Singapore banks to prioritize lending by capping their dividend payouts.\n\nWhile Singapore's rate of coronavirus infection is falling and authorities are\n\ntrying to gradually reopen the economy,\n\nmany restrictions on businesses and travel remain in place.\n\nLike their global competitors, Singapore's largest lenders, DBS, OCBC and UOB, are bracing themselves for a wave of soured debts. Collectively, they've set aside about $4 billion in provisions for both general and problem loans in the first half of the year, according to data tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Rena Kwok.\n\nAs at June 30, debts under relief programs accounted for about 5 per cent of DBS' total loan book, 10 per cent of OCBC's, and 16 per cent of UOB's, according to their second-quarter results.\n\nSee more on\n\nMAS/Monetary Authority of Singapore\n\nBanks and financial institutions\n\nLoans\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/yq-maslogo-28092024.jpg?VersionId=BWT9RNAo.reYTO6_whOFVAsJ3Hyr5U6X", "alt_text": null}]}

I hope he can help us win another trophy for our fans, but we need to take each game as it comes.\"\n\nCosta, who fired Atletico to the La Liga title in 2014 but has struggled since returning from Chelsea in 2018, has been linked with a move away from the club but vowed to fight for his place, while declaring he will leave if necessary.\n\n\"I don't want to fight with them and become a drain on the club, I've spoken to the club and the coach, and told them I'm ready to leave if they think I should go,\" he said.\n\n\"But if I stay, I'm going to fight to play and I hope I don't get injured so I can get a good run of games. I have to make the most of my opportunities. Anything can happen this season, the important thing is to be ready and score goals.\"\n\nSuarez is also relishing his new challenge at Atletico and feels that switching clubs could be just what he needed.\n\n\"Barca reached a point where they decided they needed a change and some fresh air, so it was important to accept that and change club,\" the 33-year-old told Spanish network Movistar.\n\n\"For a player, sometimes, it's important to make a change and I've come to club who have given me a spectacular welcome. You can sense that there is a very good atmosphere around the club and today, we saw it on the pitch.\n\n\"The team were in a good place when I came on and I just wanted to kill the game off. I'm very happy with my debut and for the three points. When you make your debut and help the team with goals, you're always going to be happy.\"\n\nAtletico coach Diego Simeone highlighted Suarez's work off the ball as well as his goals.\n\n\"I'm not just pleased with his two goals but also his assist, his movement and his runs,\" said the Argentinian.\n\n\"His arrival will generate a lot of internal competition and if all 23 players in the squad accept the minutes they are given, then I'm sure we'll compete well.\n\n\"The arrival of an important player like Suarez will always improve the team but we were already working very well.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nLa Liga\n\nBarcelona", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/yq-luisdiego-28092024.jpg?VersionId=prOSBMPngHi.b6fwKGbzDFHFEfzB1b9s", "alt_text": null}]}

He suffered second- and third-degree burn injuries over 12 per cent of his total body surface area.\n\nThe court rejected Zareena Begun P. A. M. Basheer Ahamed's defence that it was an accident and convicted her on Monday (Sept 28).\n\nIn his submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Jun Chong said the couple began their relationship in 2006. Over the course of their tumultuous relationship, they had broken up a few times, each accusing the other of cheating.\n\nOn Jan 12, 2017, Zareena saw her boyfriend at the HarbourFront Centre ferry terminal with a woman with whom she had, since 2015, suspected he was having an affair.\n\nIn the wee hours of July 5 that year, Zareena took her boyfriend's mobile phone from his bag as he slept in her living room after supper. She read messages that the other woman had sent him, and \"was furious\", DPP Ng said.\n\n\"She wanted to teach him a lesson for letting her down over and over again. She wanted to teach him a lesson that he would never forget,\" DPP Ng submitted.\n\nThe DPP then argued that Zareena boiled water and poured a mugful on her boyfriend's pants, over the groin area.\n\nThe man woke up in extreme pain and asked Zareena why she did this to him, to which she replied \"serve you right\".\n\nZareena's lawyer, however, argued that the entire incident was an accident.\n\nAccording to her, on July 5, she woke him up and asked to check his phone, leading to an argument between the two.\n\nAfter this, she claimed, she boiled water to drink and he followed her into the kitchen and sat on a stack of stools.\n\nAs she held a mug of the hot water, the man then pulled on her left arm, causing the water to spill onto his groin area, she said.\n\nHowever, the doctor who tended to the victim, Dr Chew Khong Yik, that his burn injuries suggested that he was lying down when the hot water was poured onto him. Called as a witness, Dr Chew said there were sudden splash injuries on his upper torso, and none on his knees, calves, feet and toes, which would have been expected if he was sitting upright.\n\nFurthermore, there was a burn on his left buttock, consistent with the water flowing down from his groin.\n\nDPP Ng said it was the hospital which reported the matter to the police, and the man never made a police report against Zareena.\n\nZareena is expected to be sentenced on Oct 20.\n\nA person convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt faces imprisonment for life or up to 15 years, and a fine or caning. As a woman, Zareena will not be caned.\n\nSee more on\n\nAssault\n\nSingapore courts", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/21/court.jpg?VersionId=dUjIiqtxi5JwSBPTL_3rI9Fj3X6H_OBR", "alt_text": null}]}

With five weeks to go until the Nov 3 general election, the stakes are high.\n\nHere are five things to watch for during the 90-minute televised debate in Cleveland:\n\nFLASHPOINTS\n\nThe face-to-face match-up comes after the New York Times revealed that Mr Trump, a wealthy former businessman and reality television star,\n\npaid only US$750 (S$1,030) in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017,\n\nand no federal income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years through 2017.\n\nThe report, which Mr Trump called \"total fake news\", gives Mr Biden a fresh opening to make his case that his working-class roots better position him to understand the economic struggles of everyday Americans than the billionaire occupying the White House.\n\nMr Trump also faced persistent questions, based on his statements about a rigged election, about whether he will accept the voting results should he lose. With millions at home watching, how will he respond if Mr Biden pushes him to commit to a peaceful transfer of power?\n\nBoth candidates will scuffle over\n\nMr Trump's nomination of Mrs Amy Coney Barrett to the US Supreme Court.\n\nMr Trump is using his pick to rally his conservative voter base and distract from his record on the coronavirus and other matters, while Mr Biden is\n\nwarning of threats to health care and abortion rights.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

While he has held limited events in some states and given media interviews, the coronavirus pandemic has largely rendered him off stage for months.\n\nThat has allowed Mr Biden to keep the focus where he wants it: on Mr Trump and his performance in office. But on Tuesday, the Democratic nominee will have to make his own case for the presidency, while giving concise answers and avoiding some of the verbal mishaps that have plagued him throughout his political career.\n\nWith Mr Biden leading in polls, a strong outing could place Mr Trump in even worse shape. A weak one could reshape the race.\n\nOWNING IT\n\nFaced with alarming coronavirus statistics or unrest in the streets, Mr Trump is quick to blame Democratic officials, activists, scientists - anybody but him. One of Mr Biden's goals will be making sure the public understands that Mr Trump is the one in charge.\n\nMr Trump could use his office to his advantage, as he often tries to do with the economy. Voters like to see a president take responsibility - for the good and the bad.\n\nMr John Geer, an expert on voter opinion at Vanderbilt University, wonders if Mr Trump will react poorly to sharp or unfriendly queries from moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News.\n\n\"Will Trump have a tough time answering non-softball questions?\" Mr Geer said.\n\nTWISTING THE TRUTH\n\nAs Mr Trump's campaign rallies show, he can fire off falsehoods in machine-gun fashion. Examples include the Republican's common claim that the US economy was operating at historic levels before the pandemic (it wasn't) and that the virus has largely dissipated (it hasn't).\n\nAttempting to constantly pin Mr Trump to the truth could turn Mr Biden into a real-time fact-checker - possibly to the Democrat's detriment.\n\n\"It's a big mistake to try and do that,\" said Mr Aaron Kall, the director of debate at the University of Michigan. \"You have to focus on your own agenda.\"\n\nDOWN IN THE MUD\n\nMr Biden has worried aloud about reacting to Mr Trump's propensity for ad hominem attacks. On the campaign trail, the former vice president has sometimes shown flashes of temper, getting his \"Irish up\" as he calls it.\n\nMr Trump in a tweet on Sunday went as far as to\n\nsuggest Biden will be on performance-enhancing drugs\n\nduring the debate, signalling that perhaps there is little he will not do or say to rattle Mr Biden and disrupt the proceedings.\n\nPolls show that Mr Trump's frequent questioning of the 77-year-old Biden's mental fitness has registered with some voters. Mr Trump's team will be looking for moments where Mr Biden seems flustered or unsure to exploit as viral video.\n\n\"If the president lies, call it a lie. If he attacks Biden personally, just shrug it off and not get personal,\" Mr Geer said. \"Biden needs to continue to be presidential and tough, even if there is some mud on his suit jacket.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden\n\nElections", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/yq-usdebate-28092024.jpg?VersionId=9PNyYuhGub_pVoC2vZd4yF0kDSaPIOO3", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign - DBS Wellness space 1 (CREDIT DBS Bank)\n \nCredit: Photo of DBS Bank office"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ababd7adbab5ef95d4223806a015c648e9803c8d554289cc24869840a46a74ae", "alt_text": "Enforcement action by the Health Sciences Authority netted a suspect and various vapes on July 10."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7f73688fa163929df2c176d392b660d82a63b73e970c811e2339978d254a5fcd", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo, with retirees Chong Hock Loo, 75, and Shirley Tan, 68, during the PCF Family Day event on July 13."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0748316b0c8c0488543313beecbd97ee6f6260fce547cdce53f76f53d9d6a49f", "alt_text": "From left: Pathlight School students Marcus Goh, Nurdaanya Mohamed Hafiz and Brennan Tay with their respective artwork, part of a total of 30 artwork that are selected in the Wing Tai X Pathlight School art competition to be displayed on a construction hoarding along Kim Seng Linear Park, on July 11, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0f74970f823073d68c58dca22ef69d6312f85ec19cd11cccf600d0046eabbb32", "alt_text": "Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - July 13, 2025 Italy's Jannik Sinner celebrates with the trophy after winning the men's final against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz REUTERS/Andrew Couldridge"}]}

If he fails to solve the murder after eight hosts, his memory is wiped clean and he restarts the process again.\n\n\"That book was so intricately plotted, it drove me mad,\" says Turton. He had a huge spreadsheet that charted what was happening to each character every minute of the time loop and a map of the house on his bedroom wall on which to plot their movements.\n\nHe had always wanted to write a mystery in the style of Agatha Christie, the grande dame of crime fiction, but the obvious problem was that everything he thought of, she had already done.\n\nIt took him a decade to come up with the idea for Seven Deaths, at which point he was working as a travel journalist in Dubai and had to persuade his then-girlfriend, now wife, to move back to England with him so he could work on it in the appropriate atmosphere.\n\nThe book has been optioned for television and won the Best First Novel prize at the Costa Book Awards. Turton got the news while on a train. \"I wanted to scream and jump up and down, but they told me it was top secret, so I had to go into the train toilet to ring my wife.\"\n\nHaving done a Golden Age mystery, he wanted to try his hand at riffing off another great detective: Sherlock Holmes.\n\nTurton loves Christie's novels unreservedly, but has a more complicated relationship with Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary sleuth. \"Nobody ever seems to recognise that Holmes is a horrible human being,\" he says. \"And Watson (his sidekick) is a lovely, clever character, but he's just there to look stupid next to Sherlock Holmes.\"\n\nThe Devil And The Dark Water unfolds almost entirely on board a Dutch ship, the Saardam, which is sailing from Batavia to Amsterdam. Many ill omens begin to occur at sea: the disappearance of a valuable artefact, the apparition of a leper who died before the voyage began and the lantern of a ghostly ship that pursues the Saardam.\n\nThe novel has a Holmes-like character, the genius detective Samuel Pipps, but he spends most of the book in prison.\n\nInstead, it is up to other passengers, such as Pipps's bodyguard and best friend, Lieutenant Arent Hayes, or Sara Wessel, the governor general's abused wife, to solve the mystery of the curse, even as the murders come thick and fast.\n\nUnfortunately, writing The Devil And The Dark Water was also an awful experience, says Turton ruefully. \"I think it's just the way I write.\"\n\nHe began the novel two weeks after his daughter was born and finished it just after her second birthday, juggling writing with caring for a newborn. \"For the first year at least, I was writing words but they weren't connected to each other or making any sense.\"\n\nStill, he is looking forward to his next mystery novel, for which he might attempt the noir genre, in the vein of Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled detective Philip Marlowe.\n\n\"I would love to write in that style, but it's so American, I don't know if I could pull it off. But I would love to try.\"\n\n\u2022 The Devil And The Dark Water ($27.18) is available for pre-order at\n\nbit.ly/DevilDW_ST\n\nLISTEN TO BOOKMARK THIS!

While he is consistently, if narrowly, leading in national polls, Mr Biden is pitching himself as the anti-Trump who will bring decency, compassion and unity back to America.\n\nBut he also faces accusations of being weak and uninspiring. He has staged far fewer in-person campaign events than Mr Trump. He also faces a president skilled in the arts of bludgeoning rivals and playing to the gallery of his own narrow but devoted base.\n\nMr Biden is likely to be the target of well-aimed barbs over the conduct of his son Hunter Biden, who is\n\nalleged to have benefited from his father being vice-president.\n\nThe flip side is that expectations of Mr Biden are relatively low, so a passable performance will impress. Also, he comes into the debate on the heels of potentially damaging revelations in an apparently extensively researched New York Times article that Mr Trump has been paying startlingly low income tax on his family business empire. The President, while deflecting blame to China, is also vulnerable on his pandemic record. Last week America\n\npassed the grim milestone of 200,000 deaths.\n\nUnlike President Trump, who considers his almost daily prickly exchanges with reporters as adequate training, Mr Biden has been preparing extensively for the debates. After Ohio, they will meet in Florida on Oct 15 and in Tennessee on Oct 22.\n\n\"President Trump will definitely try to throw the (former) vice-president a bunch of curveballs that are designed to get him off his game,\" Mr Jay Carney, who was Mr Biden's communications director and also White House press secretary under President Barack Obama, told Bloomberg News.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

He's not that smart. He doesn't know that many facts. He doesn't know much about foreign policy. He doesn't know much about domestic policy. He doesn't know much about the detail.\"\n\nIn the average of national polls maintained by the political analysis website FiveThirty Eight, Mr Biden has a roughly seven point, 50.3 to 43.0 lead over Mr Trump. But six states - Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin and Ohio - are currently considered toss-ups, which is alarming for Mr Biden as it indicates that Mr Trump could repeat his 2016 triumph, in which he lost the popular vote but won a handful of key states to win the all-important Electoral College.\n\nThe 90-minute debate at Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, will be moderated by Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. The topics, each of which will get about 15 minutes, are Mr Trump's and Mr Biden's records; the Supreme Court; the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic; the economy, race and violence in American cities; and the integrity of the election.\n\nAn obvious omission, climate change, will almost certainly figure in subsequent debates.\n\nThe issue of the Supreme Court has been thrown into sharp focus with the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an icon for liberals and the left, and\n\nMr Trump's nomination last week of Judge Amy Coney Barrett,\n\na darling of religious conservatives. The President is intent on her confirmation before the election to cement what would then be a principal domestic legacy - packing the court with conservatives.\n\nThe last topic is also fraught, and not unconnected with the push to fill\n\nthe seat left vacant by Justice Ginsburg.\n\nMany analysts see America barrelling towards a constitutional crisis and potentially violence if, as seems likely, the result of the election is either muddied by a long, drawn-out process involving court battles, or simply not accepted by one or the other candidate.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly and explicitly\n\nquestioned the integrity of mail-in ballots,\n\nwhich have always been a feature of American elections - in some states more than others - and in this election assume greater importance given the risk of mingling in queues and groups in the midst of the pandemic. He has stated more than once that the only way he can lose is if the election is \"rigged.\"\n\nLike heavyweight wrestling matches, the presidential debates are part of the showbiz of American politics, an ecosystem in which President Trump, a former reality TV star, thrives. As a long-time senator and a veteran of the Barack Obama campaigns, Mr Biden's experience of debates is very substantial - but more traditional.\n\n\"Debates don't reward folks who speak in complete sentences and long paragraphs,\" Mr Carney said. \"They really reward one-liners and insults and zingers.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden\n\nElections", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/hztrumpbiden0928.jpg?VersionId=4itKKfnyW7Nzvg_TVR8i.esr0OU0OPT4", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign - DBS Wellness space 1 (CREDIT DBS Bank)\n \nCredit: Photo of DBS Bank office"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ababd7adbab5ef95d4223806a015c648e9803c8d554289cc24869840a46a74ae", "alt_text": "Enforcement action by the Health Sciences Authority netted a suspect and various vapes on July 10."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7f73688fa163929df2c176d392b660d82a63b73e970c811e2339978d254a5fcd", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo, with retirees Chong Hock Loo, 75, and Shirley Tan, 68, during the PCF Family Day event on July 13."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0748316b0c8c0488543313beecbd97ee6f6260fce547cdce53f76f53d9d6a49f", "alt_text": "From left: Pathlight School students Marcus Goh, Nurdaanya Mohamed Hafiz and Brennan Tay with their respective artwork, part of a total of 30 artwork that are selected in the Wing Tai X Pathlight School art competition to be displayed on a construction hoarding along Kim Seng Linear Park, on July 11, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0f74970f823073d68c58dca22ef69d6312f85ec19cd11cccf600d0046eabbb32", "alt_text": "Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - July 13, 2025 Italy's Jannik Sinner celebrates with the trophy after winning the men's final against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz REUTERS/Andrew Couldridge"}]}

We love the beauty of Gillman Barracks, and the beautiful high ceilings... We do (typically) get a lot of casual tourists, and young people, but in terms of getting the crowd that can buy art... It just needs a rejuvenation, honestly.\"\n\nDoes the NAC plan to rejuvenate the arts district? Mr Tay Tong, the council's director for sector development (visual arts),tells ST: \"A vibrant arts industry in Singapore will continue to need the collective energies of all stakeholders: arts patrons and collectors, artists and galleries, as well as the strong support of the public.\n\n\"This does not necessarily require the build-up of a designated precinct to cluster activities. As seen in the Singapore Art Week over the years, different segments of visual arts activities tend to zone together organically at the Civic District, Bras Basah/Waterloo, Gillman Barracks etc.\"\n\nThe NAC will, where it can, support the galleries at Gillman Barracks for as long as they wish to maintain their business in Singapore. He says that former gallery tenants such as The Drawing Room and Silverlens Galleries were also invited to present shows at the S.E.A. Focus fair at Gillman Barracks this year. At Singapore Art Week, the involvement of commercial galleries remains vital, he adds.\n\nIn August, galleries at the enclave submitted a petition to the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), asking it to waive rent till next March and reduce it by about half after that.\n\n\"We asked for a rental waiver to keep some of our wonderful neighbours... If we can take away that bit of rent, that money can go into programming at a time like this, when it's uncertain,\" says Ms Yeo.\n\nHowever, SLA, which took over from JTC Corporation as landlord more than half a year ago, says it is \"unable to offer rental adjustments while the tenancies are ongoing\". It told ST it had already granted four months' rental waiver to the galleries from April to July, and had offered a rental reduction for their two-year tenancy which had begun on March 1.\n\n\"For tenants who are facing cash-flow difficulty, flexible rental payments such as instalment plans can be offered to help tenants who wish to stay on. Tenants are also encouraged to tap on the various government support package available, including wage subsidies under the Jobs Support Scheme.\"\n\nIn March last year, Pearl Lam Galleries moved out of Gillman Barracks into Dempsey Hill. It has since closed that gallery space but retains an office in Singapore with two full-time staff.\n\n\"We have been looking for the right opportunity to open a physical gallery and had planned it for this year, but given the Covid-19 situation, we are restrategising our plans,\" says senior director of global sales Priya Mudgal.\n\nSee more on\n\nVisual arts\n\nExhibitions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/yq-sullivan-28092024.jpg?VersionId=2tUeI_yy2vgLyP_q7AF8mb8Rh83Makvz", "alt_text": null}]}

They received sums ranging from $500 to $3,000, depending on their individual needs.\n\nA spokesman said that NTU had also launched a fund seeded by a personal gift of $100,000 from its president Subra Suresh and his wife Mary. The NTU Priorities Fund has since grown to $1.7 million in size, thanks to the generosity of more than 1,600 other donors, she said.\n\nA spokesman for the Singapore Management University (SMU) said the institution had set up an SMU Resilience Fund in May to help students facing financial hardship because of Covid-19.\n\nThe fund, which started with $2.5 million, has since grown by another $1.14 million, which includes contributions from faculty and staff.\n\nThe spokesman added that the university management team has also pledged to contribute a proportion of their annual compensation to support students in need.\n\nNearly 200 SMU students have received financial support so far and it is expected that close to 600 more students will receive support over the next month.\n\nThe Singapore University of Technology and Design has set up an emergency fund, which has raised about $260,000 for students affected by the pandemic. This is on top of existing government bursaries.\n\nA spokesman said about $149,000 has been disbursed to 54 students so far, who received sums ranging from $1,500 to $15,000, with the higher quantum going towards covering tuition fees in the current academic year.\n\nNTU bioengineering undergraduate Wong Siaw Wen, 23, received $1,500 from its Priorities Fund earlier this year after her father was forced to stop work as a sub-contractor in the construction sector in March. He resumed work in August.\n\nMs Wong, a Malaysian whose mother is a housewife, said her parents had to borrow money from relatives for their living expenses. \"The help from NTU reduced the burden on my family to support me and I also have my own savings,\" she said.\n\nNUS third-year communications and new media student Jillian Chang, 21, received a $700 grant from the NUS Students Solidarity Fund, on top of other bursaries.\n\nHer mother had quit teaching last year due to poor health and is currently not working full-time, while her father, who works in the engineering sector, had a pay cut.\n\n\"Covid-19 has made us a bit more cautious about spending. We eat out less and try to plan ahead.

Click\n\nhere\n\nto sign up.\n\nHere are some of the works on display:\n\nReflections On The Lotus Pond (2002), a dynamic, rhythmic work by Chua Ek Kay , displays the freehand style of xieyi (\"write ideas\"). This lithograph on handmade paper work is part of his Lotus Pond series.\n\nPunggol wasn't always a concrete jungle: decades ago, the north-eastern neighbourhood was home to pig farms. Ong Kim Seng pays tribute to the estate's history in the watercolour on paper work Punggol Flats (2008), where a sow and her piglet appear in a shadow on a HDB block.\n\nGoh Beng Kwan's mixed media collage Rock Island (2000) was born of a stormy time in his life, when his wife was unwell and he had to be the rock of his family. The dark background of the work gives the illusion of a grid that moors, locks and traps the elements in place.\n\nThese white marble forms by Han Sai Por seem like mutations of organic shapes - gesturing, perhaps, towards the manicured artifice of the garden city. These sculptures, which have a remarkably animated, pliant quality, were sculpted last year (2019) as part of Han's Flora series.\n\nAmanda Heng's Another Woman series, created in the 1990s, explores the bond between Heng and her dialect-speaking mother, one of many older women who felt displaced in a rapidly changing Singapore.

When she writes to a love interest about her \"wu yu\", he suggests that if she is losing one language, she must be gaining another.\n\n\"Why can't I hold on to one language while gaining another at the same time?\" she thinks. \"Why do I have to lose one first?\"\n\nLove, language and the lacunae between the two are themes that run throughout A Lover's Discourse, as they do Guo's first novel in English, A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary For Lovers, written dictionary-style in broken English in 2007.\n\nIn a way, A Lover's Discourse is a continuation of this earlier novel - both are about young Chinese women acclimatising to London and new lovers - just as they are offshoots of Guo's own story.\n\nGuo, 47, led a hardscrabble childhood in China and moved to London in 2002 to study documentary film directing.\n\n\"I was 30 years old and I began to write like a child in a second language,\" she recalls over Skype from her home in London.\n\nShe has lived in France, Germany, Switzerland and New York. \"All these places surrounded me with foreign languages, a third language, a fourth language, and it created this discourse, almost a disharmony, to think and write in. You could be completely lost. I found that very inspiring.\"\n\nGuo, who was named one of Granta's Best of Young British Novelists in 2013, is the author of seven books in Chinese and seven books in English.\n\nShe was shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction for A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary and won the National Book Critics Circle Award for her 2017 memoir Once Upon A Time In The East.\n\nLast year, she was one of the judges for the Booker Prize, which controversially named two winners, Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo. \"It was an amazing experience,\" she says, skirting a question on which side of the tie she had been on.\n\nIn A Lover's Discourse, the narrator and her partner, an Australian-German landscape architect, live on a canal houseboat to escape the strictures of urban living, although she discovers it is not as glamorously bohemian as it seems. Later, they have a baby and she navigates motherhood while struggling with her own sense of belonging.\n\nThe parents of Guo's partner, Australia-born philosophy lecturer Stephen Barker, lived for many years on a boat near Queensland in the Pacific Ocean. She and Professor Barker have a daughter, Moon, seven.\n\nBut it is not enough to write based on personal experience, she cautions. \"It's also extremely important to have the intellectual capacity to write something you have not lived.\"\n\nA Lover's Discourse is Guo's spin on French philosopher Roland Barthes' A Lover's Discourse: Fragments (1977). She says she loves Barthes' work, his \"off-centre way of thinking\".\n\nBarthes is best-known for his \"death of the author\" theory, which challenges the tradition of privileging the author's biography and intent as the controlling meaning of a text.\n\nThroughout her novel, Guo probes the notions of authorship and authenticity. As part of her PhD research, the narrator goes to the village of Dafen in Guangdong, China, where artisans - mostly self-taught - churn out reproductions of masterpieces by Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Leonardo da Vinci and more.\n\nGuo, who has made 11 films, went to Dafen to make her 2018 documentary Five Men And A Caravaggio, which follows a reproduction of Caravaggio's John In The Wilderness from its creation in Dafen to its critiquing in London.\n\n\"We're coming into this age where everything's reproduced, copied or interpreted in such different ways, where stuff is being mass-produced and democratised,\" says Guo, nodding to cultural critic Walter Benjamin's 1935 essay The Work Of Art In The Age Of Mechanical Reproduction. \"It's a great era to think about what is art.\"\n\nIn the novel, she says, the death of the author corresponds to the rebirth of the individual. \"We as individuals should be the authors of our own lives, which means we should refuse a mass-produced concept of commercial life. We should invent our own lives.\"\n\nGuo's father was an artist, which indelibly imprinted the value of art in her young mind. A state painter and a poet, he spent 15 years in a prison camp in the 50s and during the Cultural Revolution. Her mother was a Red Guard and later a factory worker.\n\nBorn and raised in Zhejiang province, Guo was given away twice as a child, first to a poor peasant couple in the mountains, then two years later to her grandparents in the fishing village of Shitang. In that household, where there was little to eat, she watched her grandfather abuse her grandmother, who had been a child bride.\n\nIt was only when she was seven that she met her parents and went to live with them and her older brother in the city of Wenling.\n\n\"I think we children suffered as much as our grandparents who went through the war and our parents who went through the Cultural Revolution,\" she says. Both her parents have since died of cancer.\n\n\"First, there's the material deprivation and then there's the emotional deprivation. We grew up in this loveless, materialist, really bleak social environment. Somehow we survived. People say that Chinese people are tough and resilient, but I think we are still in this state of post-trauma.\"\n\nGuo had to forfeit her Chinese passport when she took British nationality. She says she has found Brexit a \"huge disappointment\".\n\n\"It gives the foreigners here in London a lot of uncertainty and a new question: Are we staying, or are we moving back? It wasn't a question before that London's one of the greatest cities in the world. But now I question it: Is London still worthy to grasp on to?\"\n\nIn A Lover's Discourse, the narrator moves out of London to a farm in Germany, but finds she misses the city. \"London was the place I had begun my adult life, the place I had finally realised that I had forever lost my parents and my home country,\" she says. She tells her partner: \"It might take me years to know where we will end up.\"\n\nHe responds: \"Or, perhaps never.\"\n\nA Lover's Discourse ($27.95) is available at bit.ly/LoverDiscourse_Guo\n\nLISTEN TO BOOKMARK THIS!

Nine other charges, mainly for similar offences, will be considered during sentencing.\n\nMs Sulis came to Singapore in mid-2017 and worked for another household. She began working for Nuur on Dec 1, 2017, and was paid $580 a month.\n\nSometime after midnight the following month, Nuur was awakened by her daughter's cries and found that Ms Sulis had forgotten to apply ointment on the child's stomach.\n\nEnraged, Nuur spat at the maid and slapped her face twice. The abuse continued in February 2018 by acts such as dragging the maid by her hair.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

She was angry and slapped the victim on her face with the phone and with her hand several times before throwing the phone to the ground, causing it to crack. The victim's face was bleeding and there was redness. She cried.\"\n\nThe court heard that Nuur confiscated the device and assaulted the maid almost daily for about a week after this.\n\nOn April 29 that year, Ms Sulis managed to retrieve her mobile phone and hid it as she wanted to call her agency to ask for a transfer.\n\nWhen Nuur realised that the phone was missing, she confronted the maid, who denied taking it.\n\nNuur used a comb to forcefully poke Ms Sulis' forehead, causing bruises. She also slapped the younger woman and pulled her hair.\n\nThat night, Nuur made Ms Sulis sleep in the living room. She locked the door of the maid's room and the flat's front door to prevent the maid from escaping.\n\nMs Sulis was sitting on the floor the next day when Nuur pulled her hair and kicked her head a few times before leaving for work.\n\nWhen Nuur returned home that evening, she called Ms Sulis a \"prostitute\".\n\nNuur also asked the maid if she wanted to seduce her husband and became angry when the maid misheard her and replied: \"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nNuur then used a broom to repeatedly strike the maid's head and back.\n\nMs Sulis decided to run away at around 2am the next day and escaped through the balcony as the front door was locked.\n\nThe DPP said: \"She climbed down 15 storeys, clambering down balcony by balcony, before she managed to reach the ground floor. The climb took her all of early morning.\"\n\nOn the advice of her agent, she lodged a police report that afternoon, said the DPP.\n\nShe later went to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, which found bruises and wounds on her.\n\nNuur's bail was set $10,000 and she will be sentenced on Nov 18.\n\nFor each count of maid abuse, she can be jailed for up to three years and fined up to $7,500.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts\n\nCrime", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/hznuur0928.jpg?VersionId=EGuHegl_TrknQ3NU6VmKBTKC3V_0eAD9", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign - DBS Wellness space 1 (CREDIT DBS Bank)\n \nCredit: Photo of DBS Bank office"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ababd7adbab5ef95d4223806a015c648e9803c8d554289cc24869840a46a74ae", "alt_text": "Enforcement action by the Health Sciences Authority netted a suspect and various vapes on July 10."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7f73688fa163929df2c176d392b660d82a63b73e970c811e2339978d254a5fcd", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo, with retirees Chong Hock Loo, 75, and Shirley Tan, 68, during the PCF Family Day event on July 13."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0748316b0c8c0488543313beecbd97ee6f6260fce547cdce53f76f53d9d6a49f", "alt_text": "From left: Pathlight School students Marcus Goh, Nurdaanya Mohamed Hafiz and Brennan Tay with their respective artwork, part of a total of 30 artwork that are selected in the Wing Tai X Pathlight School art competition to be displayed on a construction hoarding along Kim Seng Linear Park, on July 11, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0f74970f823073d68c58dca22ef69d6312f85ec19cd11cccf600d0046eabbb32", "alt_text": "Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - July 13, 2025 Italy's Jannik Sinner celebrates with the trophy after winning the men's final against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz REUTERS/Andrew Couldridge"}]}

Budget 2020 also provided a $18.3 million top-up.\n\nMr Masagos noted that the Community Chest has seen a significant drop in donations to its funded programmes that are not directly related to Covid-19.\n\n\"In fact, we project a 20 to 30 per cent drop in donations in 2020. If this continues, it would become a longer-term funding issue for the sector,\" he said.\n\nHe urged companies to continue donating, so that the Community Chest and SSAs can continue to provide their much-needed services.\n\nThe first round of funding from The Invictus Fund saw close to $6 million disbursed to 89 SSAs in June, said the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), which manages the fund.\n\nAbout 82 per cent of the funds went towards supporting agencies to keep their services accessible to users, while the remaining 18 per cent went towards building SSAs' digital capability and infrastructure for better connectivity and IT security, said the agency.\n\nThis includes equipping practitioners with appropriate software and hardware to ensure service continuity and accessibility to their clients as they work from home during the circuit breaker period.\n\nVulnerable seniors and clients also received prepaid cards to ensure connectivity to critical services, and front-line practitioners and clients were given care packages to improve their well-being.\n\nOne SSA that benefited is Lutheran Community Care Services, which digitalised its work processes with the funding.\n\nIts clients can now submit child adoption applications digitally, instead of having to go in person, and they can also access support via virtual interviews through videoconferencing tools.\n\nNCSS has also set up\n\na one-stop technology hub called Tech-and-GO!\n\nto help SSAs with their transformation.\n\nIt aims to cut down the amount of time needed by SSAs to search for suitable digital solutions, and will also offer consultancy services and curated training courses.\n\nSee more on\n\nSocial support\n\nDonations\n\nNational Council of Social Service (NCSS)", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_masagoszulkifli_280920.jpg?VersionId=WaGBqvvP73nkrCkMbbSiuaUXwa3pQTyB", "alt_text": null}]}

He has since cracked down on corruption and introduced popular judicial reforms.\n\nMuslim-majority Azerbaijan, on the Caspian Sea, has been under the authoritarian grip of a single family since 1993.\n\nHeydar Aliyev, a former officer of the Soviet security services, the KGB, ruled the country with an iron fist until October 2003. He handed over power to his son, Ilham, weeks before his death.\n\nLike his father, Ilham has quashed all opposition to his rule and in 2017 made his wife, Mehriban, the country's first vice president.\n\nRussia and Turkey\n\nTurkey, with ambitions to be regional powerbroker in the Caucasus, has thrown its weight behind oil-rich and Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan.\n\nTheir alliance is fuelled by a mutual mistrust of Armenia, and Ankara routinely issues strongly worded statements in support of Baku's ambitions to reclaim Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nYerevan harbours hostility towards Turkey over the massacres of some 1.5 million Armenians by Turkey under the Ottoman Empire during World War I.\n\nMore than 30 countries have recognised the killings as genocide, though Ankara fiercely disputes the term.\n\nRussia, which maintains close ties with Armenia, is the major powerbroker in the region. It leads the Collective Security Treaty Organisation military alliance of ex-Soviet countries that includes Armenia.\n\nYerevan relies on Russian support and military guarantees because its defence budget is overshadowed by Azerbaijan's spending on arms.\n\nOil and diaspora\n\nAzerbaijan has recently begun leveraging oil revenues as part of a bid to overhaul its image in the West.\n\nBaku has invested in massive sponsorship deals including with the Euro 2020 football championship, which was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBaku was due to host matches this year and Azerbaijan has held Formula 1 Grand Prix races since 2016.\n\nAzerbaijan has also tried to pitch itself to European countries as an alternative energy supplier to Russia.\n\nOn the international stage, Armenia has a vast and influential diaspora that fled during the Ottoman-era repressions.\n\nReality TV star Kim Kardashian, the late singer Charles Aznavour, and pop star and actress Cher all trace their roots to Armenia.\n\nSome have appointed themselves unofficial ambassadors, like Kardashian who has been outspoken on the issue of the Armenian genocide.\n\nSee more on\n\nArmenia\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nWars and conflicts\n\nRussia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/eb_armenia_280920.jpg?VersionId=cGOPngZqw.TrO1Xn3Me2cQur_T_B0eG4", "alt_text": null}]}

Both changes take effect immediately.\n\nThis latest move by the URA is aimed at curbing a property market practice believed to be inflating private home sales figures, while encouraging financial prudence in home buying amid a weak economy and\n\nuncertain employment climate\n\n.\n\nThe re-issuing of OTPs refers to an arrangement some private home buyers make with a developer, via a property agent, to continually re-issue OTPs upon expiry - without any forfeiture of the booking fee.\n\nIn the past, this can be done for up to a year - or even as long as up to 18 months - from the date of the first OTP. The idea is to give the buyer time, for instance, to sell his existing home.\n\n\"The need for greater financial discipline in making property purchase decisions is especially pertinent given the current economic situation, where workers are facing uncertainties in the labour market. Purchasers should only commit to a property purchase when they are ready to exercise the OTP within the validity period,\" Ms Ling Hui Lin, controller of housing, URA, said in\n\nMonday's circular\n\n.\n\n\"Therefore, the Controller of Housing will impose new conditions in the sale licences issued to developers with effect from today,\" she said.\n\nUnder the terms of a standard OTP, the option will expire three weeks after the sale and purchase agreement and copies of the title deeds are delivered to the intending purchaser.\n\nThe intending purchaser will have to exercise the OTP before it expires by signing the sales and purchase agreement and returning it to the developer. If the purchaser fails to exercise the OTP, 25 per cent of the booking fee may be forfeited to the developer. As the booking fee is typically 5 per cent of the sales price, the forfeited amount works out to 1.25 per cent of the total home price.\n\nThe three-week validity period for the OTP is put in place to encourage purchasers to exercise financial prudence and commit to purchasing a property only when they have the financial means to do so. Purchasers will be exposed to the risk of forfeiting 25 per cent of their booking fees if they commit to new property purchases without securing the necessary finances upfront.\n\n\"However, we have observed that there have been instances where the OTP is re-issued multiple times to the same purchaser(s) for the same unit, which lengthens the option period significantly,\" URA's Ms Ling noted.\n\nWhile the current validity period in the standard OTP is generally sufficient for most purchasers to exercise the OTP, the Controller recognises that there may be some buyers who require more time to finalise the necessary arrangements before exercising the OTP.\n\nFor example, purchasers may require more time to complete the sale of their existing property before exercising the OTP, Ms Ling said.\n\nUpon application by such purchasers or the developers, the Controller is prepared to extend the validity period of the OTP up to 12 weeks from the OTP date, provided that both parties (i.e. the buyer and the developer) are agreeable.\n\nBuyers or developers who wish to apply for an extension of the OTP validity period may submit their application to URA, with a copy and expiry date of the OTP; and reasons for requiring more time to exercise the OTP.\n\nMs Tricia Song, head of research, Colliers international, believes URA's move will lead to more accurate home sales numbers.\n\n\"We have observed that the monthly developer sales typically have 100-130 units `returned' every month, probably due to the indefinite re-issuance of OTPs, she told The Straits Times.\n\n\"In July,\n\n1,080 private homes excluding ECs were reported to be sold by developers.\n\nIn August, if we compare the sales tally of each project versus July's, there is a discrepancy of 127 units that appeared to have been returned during the month.\n\n\"There are of course real cases of need such as purchasers may require more time to complete the sale of their existing property before exercising the OTP. For these cases, URA now allows extension of validity of OTP by up to 12 weeks, subject to application and mutual agreement of developer and buyer,\" Ms Song noted.\n\nPrivate developers have nothing to lose if only genuine buyers come forward, and get to pocket the 25 per cent of the booking fees if buyers give up their OTPs, she added.\n\nMr Karamjit Singh, chief executive of Showsuite Consultancy, said URA's new directive will \"remove a segment of purchasers who don't have the capacity to make the second payment (amounting to 15 per cent of the purchase price) within 12 weeks of the purchase and to pay for stamp duties.\"\n\nURA also said the new restrictions do not apply retrospectively to OTPs issued before Monday where developers have an existing reissue agreement with buyers. \"This comes as a welcome relief to both parties,\" said Mr Karamjit.\n\nHe believes the new rules are not likely to be a major dampener to the market for new private homes, especially in the affordable mass-market segment.\n\nMr Karamjit pointed to last weekend's launch of Penrose condominium by Hong Leong Holdings. Of its 566 units,\n\n341 were sold as of Sunday,\n\nrepresenting 60 per cent of the development.\n\n\"Hong Leong practised a strict 'no-reissue' policy. This means all the buyers would be required to exercise their options within 3 weeks of being served the sale and purchase agreements,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore property\n\nURA\n\nNew home sales\n\nProperty market/sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/af_private-properties_280920_2x.jpg?VersionId=KxeRj07C.apWkcN.LcW6p8FK4zRi8yk4", "alt_text": null}]}

This enabled train services to be maintained despite some periods of higher frequencies of disruptions.\n\nThe Government's decision to work more closely with Bombardier Transportation is partly motivated by cost concerns, LTA said on Monday.\n\nBy more closely allying with one company, trains can be bought at a cheaper price and the types of trains reduced, allowing engineers to know them more thoroughly and react better to faults.\n\nSMRT also signed a 10-year contract with Bombardier Transportation for the company to provide technical support and spare parts for train repairs and system upgrades or replacements for the first 10 years.\n\nThis can be further extended for another 20 years later.\n\nSaid the LTA on the \"significant economies of scale\" of such a move: \"Initiatives such as these are central to efforts by LTA and the rail operators to continue delivering reliable train services, while managing costs.\"\n\nThe remaining 92 non-Bombardier Transportation trains on the NSEWL are mostly Japanese and Chinese.\n\nMr Ong also noted the historical significance of the train replacement, with the latest move effectively phasing out the first three generations of trains by 2026.\n\nThe LTA is exploring ways to keep some of the carriages of these old trains in institutions such as schools and government agencies to preserve the country's transport heritage.\n\nIt is also open to the carriages being converted to other uses, such as for the decor at MRT-themed hotels or cafes, and interested parties can contact the LTA for more details.\n\nMr Ong said of the old trains: \"These three generations of workhorses are important markers of the Singapore story, and we should find ways to commemorate their contributions.\n\n\"Many Singaporeans feel strongly about this, writing to me frequently asking me what will happen to our pioneering trains, hoping that they would be given alternate new leases of life.\"\n\nSingapore now has six MRT lines, and more lines, including the Jurong Region and Cross Island lines, are set to open.\n\nIn September, the Government accepted the Public Transport Council's recommendation that fares will not go up in the coming year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the council citing the affordability of train and bus rides as one of its key considerations.\n\nSee more on\n\nMRT\n\nOng Ye Kung", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/af_new-train-exterior_280920.jpg?VersionId=H_ZfmXkZ12zPgziJs68qRA8ePG_x8eV6", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign -

The company's onshore bonds due 2024 rose 14.4 per cent to 75.3 yuan.\n\nInvestors had\n\ndumped China Evergrande's shares and bonds on Friday\n\nafter a leaked document - later dismissed by the company as a fabrication - suggested the nation's second-biggest property developer by sales had sought government help to avert a cash crunch.\n\nThe company said total indebtedness had fallen by 53.4 billion yuan (S$10.8 billion) over the six months to Sept 24 when the document appeared online, while financing costs had dropped 2.24 per cent and it had prepaid 43.5 billion yuan of loans due after Sept 25.\n\nChina Evergrande's borrowings totalled 835.5 billion yuan at June-end, of which onshore trust loans and bank lending made up 41 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.\n\n\"In the 24 years since the establishment of the company, the company has borrowed loans across 20,523 transactions. There has never been any late payment of interest nor overdue repayment of principal,\" chairman Hui Ka Yan said in a statement.\n\nThe developer is under pressure to slash debt as China's government tackles what it considers excessive borrowing in the real estate development sector with new debt ratio caps.\n\nThe Hong Kong-listed stock had fallen over 25 per cent this year on concern over competition as the pandemic keeps offices shut and buyers at home.\n\nThe company said aggregated contracted sales amounted to 504.9 billion yuan as of Sept 24, up 11.4 per cent from the same period a year ago, and cash on hand was 204.6 billion yuan as at June 30.\n\nIt said it aimed to achieve 200 billion yuan contracted sales in September and October through nationwide sales promotions launched earlier in September.\n\nChina Evergrande also said the Hong Kong stock exchange had approved its plan to spin off its property management business, providing the firm a channel to raise funds. The proposed float is expected to raise about US$2 billion (S$2.75 billion), according to Reuters' publication IFR.\n\nFurther capital could come from the proposed initial public offering and listing on Shanghai's Sci-Tech Board of its unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group.\n\nInvestors across Asia are watching Evergrande closely after losses in the company's offshore notes spread to high-yield debt around the region last week. The developer is not only Asia's biggest junk bond issuer, it's also one of the most systemically important companies in China, with 293 million square metres of land reserves and projects in 237 cities as of the end of last year.\n\nThe biggest near-term worry surrounding Evergrande relates to an agreement the company struck with some of its largest investors. It gives them the right to demand their money back if Evergrande fails to win regulatory approval for a backdoor listing on the Shenzhen stock exchange by Jan. 31. The repayment could amount to 130 billion yuan (S$26.2 billion), and at least one of the investors has signaled it would be unwilling to extend the deadline.\n\nEvergrande has said it won't raise new funds through the listing, but the transaction could allow the company to achieve a higher valuation and thus easier access to future financing.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nProperty market/sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/af_evergrande_280920.jpg?VersionId=VPFUqK.vTPzC.FIB5S1Dx1KGgK5Y.HMe", "alt_text": null}]}

$10,000 for Citibank and StanChart (with scan-and-pay transactions of up to $50,000 for StanChart); and $200,000 for UOB, DBS, HSBC, Maybank and OCBC.\n\nCustomers will be required to key in their two-factor authentication (2FA) number for transactions above $1,000.\n\nThey may also set their PayNow limit to a level that they are comfortable with, said ABS.\n\nThe association said it will continue to work with the industry to promote PayNow as a convenient and secure way to transfer funds.\n\nAs at August, there were more than 4.46 million registered PayNow users who had\n\ncollectively transferred nearly $34 billion\n\nsince the service was launched in June 2017.\n\nMs Andrea Lim, 23, who works in business development, said the increased limit will make it easier for her to make large payments such as for electronic items and fitness studio packages.\n\n\u201cNot having to use tokens makes the payment process a lot more convenient.\u201d\n\nProfessor Duan Jin-Chuan from the National University of Singapore Business School said the higher limit affects spontaneous transactions in higher amounts.\n\nWhile PayNow is convenient, it requires users to be linked to a bank account, he added.\n\n\u201cIf PayNow adds a wallet function that can hold a cash balance without linking to any bank account, it will have potential to become a unified funds transfer system.\u201d\n\nAssistant Professor Aurobindo Ghosh from the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University said the increased limit will make it easier for cash-strapped small and medium-sized enterprises to use PayNow to receive payments for goods.\n\n\u201cThis might reduce the working capital cycle or conversion of inventory to cash, critical for net working capital management and ultimately in some cases, survival of some of these enterprises,\u201d said Prof Ghosh.\n\nAssociate Professor Angie Low from Nanyang Technological University\u2019s Nanyang Business School said the higher PayNow limit might change the service\u2019s landscape. \u201cThis will likely attract more users with differing purposes and where transaction values exceed $1,000.\u201d\n\nABS' latest announcement comes amid other recent developments for the use of the funds transfer service.\n\nLast Wednesday, the Infocomm Media Development Authority said PayNow Corporate, an instant fund transfer service for businesses, will be\n\nintegrated into Singapore's nationwide e-invoicing network.\n\nThe authority worked with local banks DBS, OCBC and UOB to develop the solution, which aims to allow businesses to bill and make payments to one another in a seamless online fashion.\n\nThe next day, it was announced that DBS PayLah and StanChart customers can\n\nnow use Google Pay to transfer funds directly\n\nfrom their bank accounts to anyone registered with PayNow.\n\nThe two banks are the latest to offer this payment option after OCBC introduced it in April.\n\nThrough the integration of Google Pay with the funds transfer service PayNow, customers of DBS PayLah, OCBC and StanChart can link their bank accounts to the Google Pay mobile app so that payments will be directly debited without needing a card.\n\nSee more on\n\nPayment systems\n\nBanks and financial institutions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_paynow-app_280920.jpg?VersionId=3TL4Lsm1v06wd82LXYAn420JiNd9BdSS", "alt_text": null}]}

These charges were linked to five victims.\n\nTen other similar charges involving the remaining amount were considered during sentencing.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Stephanie Chew said that Gill was called to the Singapore Bar in 2005.\n\nOne of the victims engaged him as her lawyer in 2018 when she was being investigated for offences which were not revealed in court documents.\n\nOn May 1 and June 18 last year, she entrusted him with legal fees totalling $4,000.\n\nGill later misappropriated the money. On July 5 last year, she tried but failed to contact him for an update of her case.\n\nThe victim contacted Hilborne Law and was told that he had gone overseas. She tried to contact him many times after this but to no avail.\n\nA representative from the firm lodged a police report against Gill on July 18 last year.\n\nThe representative told police that various people had contacted Hilborne Law, stating that they had engaged its services and paid legal fees to Gill.\n\nThe Hilborne representative said these people \"were not recorded in Hilborne's client register, and the monies collected were not deposited into Hilborne's client or office accounts\", said DPP Chew.\n\nOn July 23 last year, the victim received a letter from the firm, stating that Gill had been terminated. She alerted the authorities eight days later.\n\nGill also targeted four more people besides her, the court heard.\n\nHe was not in Singapore at the time of these complaints.\n\nAccording to him, he was then in Thailand where his partner, stepson and son live, and that he had broken his leg. Gill was later arrested when he returned to Singapore on Oct 14 last year.\n\nOn Monday, DPP Chew urged District Judge Toh Yung Cheong to sentence Gill to at least two years and three months' jail. She stressed that criminal breach of trust by lawyers is a \"grave offence\" and that he had made no restitution.\n\nDefence lawyer R. Shiever pleaded for judicial mercy and said his client was truly remorseful. Gill cried as he addressed the court and said that he had lost everything.\n\nBefore handing down the sentence, Judge Toh said that such offences could undermine public confidence in the legal profession.\n\nFor each count of criminal breach of trust as an attorney, an offender can either be jailed for life or jailed for up to 20 years and fined.\n\nOn Monday, The Straits Times asked the Law Society on what action will be taken against Gill. Its spokesman said: \"The Law Society will be reviewing the charges brought, statement of facts, mitigation plea and grounds of decision (if any) and will determine the appropriate disciplinary course of action thereafter.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts\n\nCrime", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_zamindersinghgill_280920.jpg?VersionId=lJnIQSvNl7fhp6VgcUnQplUbhBSTGIx2", "alt_text": null}]}

The most recent lightning rod struck on Sunday,\n\nwhen Newcastle United earned a 1-1 draw with Tottenham.\n\nNewcastle were given a stoppage-time penalty after the referee, using the VAR monitor, ruled that Spurs' Eric Dier had handled the ball as he jumped up for an aerial challenge with Newcastle's Andy Carroll.\n\nDier had his back to the ball and the header hit his outstretched arm at close range but referee Peter Bankes awarded the penalty, which was converted to give Bruce's team a 1-1 draw.\n\nNewcastle manager Steve Bruce, despite benefiting from the decision on Sunday, described the new interpretation of the handball law in the Premier League as \"nonsense\".\n\nThe\n\nPremier League had previously taken a slightly different approach to VAR\n\nand the interpretation of the handball law to many European leagues but it has fallen in line this season.\n\nIn practice, the new interpretation of the law, which allows less leeway for cases where the ball strikes an arm or hand, is resulting in more offences being given for what would once have been viewed as accidental handball.\n\nThe following is a Q&A on changes to the handball law:\n\nQ: What is the new handball law for this season?\n\nA: Strictly speaking there is no 'new' handball law in the Premier League this season. The Premier League is, however, enacting the same law and interpretation of it that was brought in across Europe and other leagues last season. The English competition had previously taken a more liberal attitude towards that law.\n\nQ: Why has it done that?\n\nA: In July, world governing body Fifa took charge of matters relating to VAR from the rule-making body, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), and Fifa officials, including former Italian referee, Pierluigi Collina, made it clear that all leagues should play by the same laws and interpretations of them.\n\nQ: So why did Ifab change the handball law?\n\nA: The old law stated that deliberate handling of the ball, with hand or arm, was an offence. This was clearly a subjective matter involving an assessment of intent and led to much argument over decisions. The situation intensified with the introduction of VAR video reviews when incidents could be scrutinised and highlighted. The changes were an attempt to reduce the subjectivity and put the focus on what Ifab calls 'factual' aspects - such as the position of the arm, which can be assessed through the video review.\n\nQ: So what does the new law say exactly?\n\nLaw 12 of the Laws of the Game can be found\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nThe biggest change related to handball committed by an attacking player where the handling led to a goal or created a goal-scoring opportunity. Any handling, deliberate or otherwise, results in the goal being disallowed.\n\nThis has not been hugely controversial, however, unlike the change of language in relation to another aspect of handball.\n\nThe law states that handball occurs when \"the hand/arm has made their body unnaturally bigger\".\n\nThere have been many debates about what is a \"natural\" or \"unnatural\" position for the arm.\n\nQ: So what has this meant in practice?\n\nA: We have seen handball decisions in the Premier League that were unlikely to have been given previously. For example, Eric Dier's for Tottenham Hotspur against Newcastle United on Sunday where he had his back turned to an opponent while he jumped and the ball was headed against his outstretched arm. Players have been penalised for shots at clos -range which have struck their arm involuntarily.\n\nQ: I thought it wasn't a foul/penalty if the defender was close to the attacker?\n\nA: That is the case only \"if the hand/arm is close to the body and does not make the body unnaturally bigger\".\n\nQ: Doesn't a player tend to raise his arms when he jumps for a header?\n\nA: That has been argued by some former players. The law, however, states that the arms should not be raised above shoulder level to avoid the risk of a handball decision.\n\nQ: What about when a player is sliding into a tackle and the ball is struck against his arm?\n\nA: It depends on the situation. It is not a penalty \"when a player falls and the hand/arm is between the body and the ground to support the body, but not extended laterally or vertically away from the body\".\n\nQ: So if this is causing controversy and more handball penalties in England, what happened when it was introduced elsewhere last season?\n\nA: The number of penalties for handball had already increased with the introduction of VAR. Yet last season in Italy's Serie A for example, the number of handball penalties rose from 37 to 57. In Spain, they rose from 35 to 48.\n\nQ: There are calls for the law to be changed, is that likely?\n\nA: Ifab has been willing to tweak and alter laws with increasing frequency, so some change cannot be ruled out but with VAR now part of the game they are unlikely to return to the old law based purely on intent to handle.\n\nSee more on\n\nEPL\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nNewcastle United", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_epl-penalty_280920.jpg?VersionId=G5.VBKxo8u7a6j0dUFohlFmG.RdxTTPa", "alt_text": null}]}

Even during the global markets selloff in March, private bankers told their wealthy clients not to worry. In the worst case, they could just hold those notes until maturity, and enjoy the juicy coupon payments.\n\nChina Evergrande Group's recent tumble is a wake-up call. Beijing's latest policy shifts show it is confident that killing a dragon or two won't cause a wildfire.\n\nEvergrande, one of the country's largest developers with 2.3 trillion yuan (S$464 billion) in assets,\n\nfaced a crisis of confidence late last week.\n\nA dramatic selloff in its stocks and bonds followed reports the company had sent a letter to the Guangdong government warning of a potential cash crunch if it couldn't carry out a backdoor listing in Shenzhen by January. The company said in a filing that the document was \"fabricated.\"\n\nNonetheless, investors were unnerved. The document, fake or not, struck the right note. Just over a month ago, Beijing proposed a \"three red lines\" approach for major developers. Those exceeding all three leverage metrics monitored by regulators are forbidden from borrowing more. Evergrande has solidly crossed that threshold.\n\nIn that \"fabricated\" document seen by Bloomberg Opinion, Evergrande threatened systemic risk (835.5 billion yuan in borrowings), bankruptcies of its business partners (8,441 companies) and job losses (3.1 million). These are among the reasons why it must go public.\n\nBut there is no systemic risk. Rather than cracking down on the entire industry, the new \"three red lines\" policy is very targeted.\n\nOut of the 334 developers likely subject to the new rules, only 50 of them, accounting for 36 per cent of total industry borrowing, failed all three criteria, according to Gavekal Dragonomics. Meanwhile, developers accounting for just under half of total debt passed all three tests. Similarly, of the 18 largest developers tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence, 11 are in the green zone and can raise their borrowings by 10 per cent to 15 per cent per year.\n\nIn other words, even if Evergrande fell into hard times, other big developers could just come in and carve off its assets. In fact, this is what China Vanke is doing with Tahoe Group, the first large developer to default on a bond in five years. Unlike financial conglomerates such as Anbang Group Holdings, developers have a lot of hard assets. Land banks can be sold, senior lenders will get paid, and the rest will have to soak up losses. They don't need to be bailed out by the state.\n\nAmid China's deleveraging campaign two years ago, Vanke said its goal for the next three years would be simply \"to survive.\" That startling slogan turned out to be prescient, and was followed by a broader bond selloff in the sector. Last weekend, the company's chairman, Yu Liang, came out talking again.\n\nIn his view, China's real-estate market can be divided into three stages. In the 1990s, those with the right political connections were able to get land cheaply. The auction system implemented in 2002 upended that. Since then, those with the appetite and access to bank loans and shadow financing were the winners. Starting in 2021, only good governance will matter, Yu said.\n\nHeed Mr Yu's words. Over the years, Evergrande has seemed like a cat with nine lives, living dangerously with a whopping 47 per cent of its borrowings due within a year.

Also listed in Shanghai, SMIC's stock there retreated as much as 5.8 per cent to the lowest level since its July debut.\n\nUS firms must now apply for a license to export certain products to the chipmaker, the US Commerce Department said in a letter dated Sept 25, reviewed by Bloomberg News. SMIC and its subsidiaries present \"an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end use,\" the department's Bureau of Industry and Security wrote.\n\nThe US stopped short of placing SMIC on the so-called entity list, which means the restrictions are not yet as severe\n\nas those imposed on China's Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nStill, the ruling against the chipmaker marks a further escalation in the tensions between the world's two most powerful countries that have already\n\nensnared other Chinese tech companies including ByteDance and Tencent Holdings.\n\n\"The restriction, once implemented, will severely damage SMIC's existing and future manufacturing capabilities, and customer trust,\" Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a note. \"Without steady supply and service from the US, the yield and quality of SMIC's capacity will degrade, as early as in a few months for more advanced nodes.\"\n\nSMIC said it has not received an official notice of the sanctions, has no relationship with the Chinese armed forces and does not manufacture goods for any military end-users or uses, in an emailed statement over the weekend. The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing didn't immediately respond on Monday to a request for comment on the latest US export restrictions.\n\nThe SMIC ruling was a compromise between the Departments of Defense and Commerce and moderates in the Trump administration, according to one person familiar with the negotiations. The US has reportedly said it was mulling a more severe blacklisting on SMIC - akin to the ones imposed on Huawei - that would affect exports from a broader set of companies.\n\n\"If SMIC is not included in the Entity List, this could merely be confirmation of the rule change announced on April 27 for 'civilian end-users' in US-unfriendly countries,\" Jefferies analyst Edison Lee wrote in a note. \"Instead of a blanket ban, the US will have sole discretion on what US companies can sell to SMIC.\"\n\nThe brokerage had previously estimated that as much as 50 per cent of SMIC's equipment is from the US.\n\nA formal statement that includes details of the restriction may be released by the US Commerce Department on Monday, Citigroup said.\n\nThere will be a comment period of 30 days before the ruling takes effect, with semiconductor equipment companies and industry groups expected to push back against the restrictions, analysts including Atif Malik wrote in a note.\n\nSee more on\n\nTechnology sector\n\nUS-China ties", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/af_smic_280920.jpg?VersionId=ryZ.PdI6drN8EqkHYc9Ld44ACQpdWwAz", "alt_text": null}]}

It travels up the nose to the brain, where it destroys brain tissue.\n\nThe boy's family believed he had been exposed to the single-celled organism from a water hose at his home or from a city splash pad, where water spurts up from the ground, city officials said in a news release.\n\nThe city closed the splash pad, and multiple tests were conducted with help from the CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nThree of the 11 samples collected tested \"preliminary positive.\" Those samples were from a \"dead end fire hydrant downtown,\" a \"splash pad storage tank\" and the boy's \"home hose bib,\" according to the city.\n\nOn Friday evening, the Brazosport Water Authority released a \"do not use\" water advisory for eight Texas cities, under direction from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nBy Saturday, the warning was lifted in all cities - except for Lake Jackson - and Mayor Bob Sipple of Lake Jackson issued a disaster declaration.\n\n\"The impact of this threat is severe,\" the mayor said in an emergency request to Governor Greg Abbott of Texas. \"The potential damages include: sickness and death.\"\n\nLater Saturday evening, the warning was lifted from the city, but officials placed a boil notice into effect. Over the weekend, Lake Jackson residents flocked to grocery stores, stocking up on water bottles in light of city advisories.\n\nPeople cannot be infected by drinking water containing the amoeba, according to the CDC.\n\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality recommends people avoid water-related activities and remain vigilant to water going into the nose while bathing. The agency said it was working with city officials \"on a plan to flush and disinfect the water system.\"\n\nMr Abbott released a disaster declaration Sunday afternoon for Brazoria County, which encompasses Lake Jackson. The designation authorises the use of additional state resources to deal with the emergency.\n\nMr Brian McGovern, a spokesman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said danger from the amoeba comes from water entering the body through the nose.\n\n\"If it gets up into the nose, that can cause a rare but lethal infection,\" Mr McGovern said.\n\nThe yearly number of cases ranges from zero to eight, the CDC reports.

In comparison, there were 22 workplace fatalities in the second half of last year.\n\nThe leading cause of fatal injuries continued to be fall from height and vehicular-related incidents, with these two concerns relevant last year as well.\n\nOf the total number of fatalities in the first half of this year, four deaths were from falls from height - same as the same period last year.\n\nVehicular-related deaths fell, from four cases in the first half of last year to three cases in the same period this year.\n\nMeanwhile, major and minor injuries were mostly caused by slips, trips and falls, though the number of such cases fell on the whole from 1,862 in the first half of last year to 1,508 in the same period this year.\n\nThe second-most common cause of major and minor injuries was related to machinery, with 809 cases this year compared to 1,119 cases in the same period last year.\n\nMOM and the WSH Council said the transportation and storage industry accounted for the highest number of deaths - five cases - at the workplace in the first half of this year.\n\nThe 12-month fatality rate for the industry also increased, from 3.1 per 100,000 workers as of end-December last year to 3.8 as of end-June this year.\n\nMeanwhile, workplace deaths in the construction industry fell from six cases in the first half of last year to three cases in the same period this year. There were also fewer major injuries in the industry with 26 cases this year, compared with 61 cases in the same period last year.\n\nThe manufacturing industry also had three workplace deaths in the first half of this year and was the top contributor for major and minor injuries with 40 and 971 cases respectively.\n\nIn addition, the number of dangerous occurrences - or incidents with a high potential for multiple fatalities - fell from nine cases in the first half of last year to four cases in the same period this year. Half were fire and explosion cases, while the other two cases were crane-related incidents.\n\nThe number of occupational diseases also fell by about a quarter from 264 cases in the first half of last year to 195 cases in the same period this year. The top two diseases were work-related musculoskeletal disorder and noise-induced deafness, accounting for about nine in 10 cases.\n\nThe WSH Council said it has been engaging industries on restarting work safely following the lifting of the circuit breaker, such as through virtual forums, webinars and campaigns as well as precautionary WSH measures.\n\nFrom the fourth quarter of this year, the WSH performance of companies will be published, starting with construction companies. Unsafe contractors will also be disqualified from public construction tenders.\n\nEmployers have also been required to report all work accidents that result in medical leave or light duty from Sept 1.\n\nMr Silas Sng, Commissioner for WSH and Divisional Director of MOM's Occupational Safety and Health Division, said it would be counter-productive if companies rush to make up for lost time as they restart, as much effort and resources have been invested to keep the workplace safe from Covid-19.\n\nResponding to the statistics on Monday, assistant secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, Mr Melvin Yong, urged companies to consider implementing a structured re-orientation programme for workers who have returned to work especially at high-risk worksites, and to conduct refresher WSH courses for all returning workers.\n\n\"As more workers return to their workplaces, there is a need to ease them back gradually into their jobs, as many have not returned to their worksites for months,\" he wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nAccidents - workplace\n\nWorkplace safety and health", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_workplace-injury_280920.jpg?VersionId=eSENTMUCrTGGC36029Hnu9fGPVw1UBqI", "alt_text": null}]}

For the rest of the week, it has been relatively quiet.\"\n\nThough the 47-year-old saw slightly more customers than usual on Monday, he does not foresee business improving much in the coming weeks, saying that it would be \"perhaps around 10 per cent more than the current lunch crowd\".\n\nOn shorter lunch hours, he said: \"In the past, queues would start to form as early as 11am and the crowds would disperse by around 2pm, but the lunch crowd now seems to only linger from 12 to 1.30pm.\"\n\nMadam Mary Lee, 55, owner of local eatery Mary Lee's Corner at The Arcade, said that her business remained at 35 per cent of what it used to be, as many of her regular customers turn up only on an ad hoc basis, such as to pick up documents.\n\n\"I thought that there may be more people coming in for lunch given that it is the first day of work, but it seems like the situation is no different compared to last week,\" she said in Mandarin.\n\nOther stall owners in the same mall shared the same sentiment, with many hoping that the lunch crowds would return as companies begin to implement staggered work arrangements.\n\nMr Gerald Gan, 49, who co-owns Healthy Passion, an eatery selling Taiwanese cuisine, said: \"I started seeing some of my regulars over the past few weeks, but many were saying that their companies needed more time to work out the logistics of split work operations, such as getting cleaners in and ensuring that office pantries are stocked up.\"\n\nMr Gan hoped that once these staggered arrangements were normalised, business would pick up.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCentral Business District\n\nWork from home\n\nLimited-time offer\n\nGet a FREE Xiaomi vacuum cleaner (worth $109) with your subscription!\n\nBilled at $29.90/month. 24-month contract.

Tesla's slice of the \"mainstream\" electric vehicle market will significantly decrease in five to 10 years, he said.\n\nWhere WM Motor will be by 2030 isn't certain either. The company earlier this month raised US$1.5 billion in a Series D round led by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. (Group), the parent of China's biggest automaker SAIC Motor. People familiar with the matter have said WM plans a stock-market listing in its hometown of Shanghai as soon as this year, something Shen indicated on Saturday sounded ambitious, but declined to comment on further.\n\nXpeng vice chairman Brian Gu meanwhile described Tesla as a partner, with both EV manufacturers trying to make sure more consumers are attracted by smart, environmentally friendly cars. EVs are \"less than 5 per cent of the market\" so together \"we are accelerating that change and conversion,\" he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\nFASTER GROWTH\n\nMr Gu also said Tesla's plan to expand its output in Shanghai to an annual capacity of one million vehicles in the coming years wasn't of concern. If CEO Musk \"achieves one million units, that means the market has grown so much faster and bigger than what we anticipated,\" Mr Gu said, adding that Xpeng's mid-range EVs come in around the US$25,000 mark already.\n\nXpeng, which reported a net loss of US$113 million on revenue of US$142 million for the six months ended June 30, raised US$1.5 billion in an initial share sale in the US in August. The firm is among a handful of Chinese car startups to tap the market, surfing a wave of investor demand for EV stocks. Li Auto, another Chinese EV company, increased the size of its US IPO in July to raise US$1.3 billion.\n\nTesla's presence at the Beijing Auto Show was primarily centered around displaying its China-made Model 3. The company plans to ship cars made at its Shanghai factory to Europe and other countries in Asia, including Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, as soon as the end of this year or early 2021, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.\n\nBATTERY CHALLENGE\n\nNIO chief executive officer William Li, when asked about Tesla's plans for a US$25,000 car, noted that battery costs have been steadily declining. Batteries currently represent about one-quarter of an EV's cost because of the expensive metals used.\n\n\"We reached a gross margin of 10 per cent in the second quarter and it will increase each quarter,\" he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Saturday. \"The overall battery cost decrease will help promote EVs. Our price tag is more than US$60,000 and even in China we have a lot of work to do for this niche market.\"\n\nShanghai-based NIO, which has received a municipal government cash injection and credit facilities from local banks this year, reported a positive gross margin for the first time in the second quarter.\n\nMr Li also talked about customer service being more important than volume.\n\n\"Auto products aren't only about producing cars but more importantly, serving your customers well,\" he said. \"For each family, buying a car isn't a small expense like buying clothes, and it's closely related to one's safety. Quality and service will be the biggest challenge for all automakers in rapid expansion.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nElectric and hybrid vehicles\n\nAutomobile sector\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_wm-motors_280920.jpg?VersionId=6TD_NZT3R2FyQlMn2uP7qQTbBAnGNj.I", "alt_text": null}]}

HSBC chief executive officer Noel Quinn last month warned bad loans could swell to US$13 billion this year. Quinn said the bank would attempt to hasten a shakeup of its global operations, accelerating a further pivot into Asia as its European operations lose money.\n\nIn response to the ICIJ report last week, the bank said that \"starting in 2012, HSBC embarked on a multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime across more than 60 jurisdictions.

The lack of creating chances made us nervous and anxious.\"\n\nWith both natural strikers Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus out injured, City looked toothless despite having the lion's share of the possession.\n\nAt the other end, they looked like conceding every time Leicester came forward purposefully, with Vardy's speed causing their defence all sorts of problems.\n\nThe striker won both penalties he converted either side of a classy back-heel finish, while James Maddison added a fourth with a superb shot and Youri Tielemans put the icing on the cake with a late penalty.\n\nGuardiola rued his team's lack of composure but vowed to bounce back after City conceded five goals in the league at home for the first time since a 5-1 defeat by Arsenal in February 2003.\n\n\"It's a tough result but I am not going to give up.

(American Bridge removed the claim that Ms Barrett was a member of the Thomas More Society after being asked about it by The New York Times.)\n\nThe research file also highlighted a scholarly paper Ms Barrett helped to write in the late 1990s about how the Catholic Church's campaign against capital punishment \"puts Catholic judges in a bind\" between their oath to enforce the death penalty and their obligation \"to adhere to their church's teaching on moral matters.\"\n\nBut some Democrats have been more pointed in calling attention to Ms Barrett's faith. Ms Katie Hill, a former congresswoman from California who runs a political action committee supporting Democratic women, wrote on Twitter last week that Ms Barrett \"comes from a religion that is straight out of 'The Handmaid's Tale'\" - the dystopian novel and television series about a totalitarian state that has overthrown the US government - \"because of course she does,\" adding an expletive for emphasis.\n\nMs Hill said in an email on Sunday that her political action committee, HER Time, was working to rally opposition to Ms Barrett's confirmation, and that questions about whether the judge \"will impose her faith on the American people\" were fair game.\n\n\"Someone's religion is important when their religious beliefs are part of the way they make decisions that come before that court,\" Ms Hill said, accusing Ms Barrett of holding \"anti-women, anti-LGBTQ positions, which are rooted in her religion\" and saying they would \"factor into her decisions on the court.\"\n\nRepublicans have eagerly highlighted similar attacks, as well as examples of liberals scrutinising Ms Barrett's family - she has seven children, including two adopted from Haiti.\n\nMr Trump, at a White House news conference on Sunday afternoon, accused Democrats of \"really brazenly attacking Judge Barrett for, again, her faith.\"\n\nSingling out Ms Feinstein, the president said, \"I think they ought to treat religion with much more respect.\"\n\nThe anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List on Saturday evening began a digital advertising campaign featuring a one-minute video that calls attention to Ms Barrett's legal bona fides and religious background, and accuses Democrats of \"attacking her faith.\" The ad is part of what the group says will be \"a seven-figure investment\" supporting Ms Barrett's confirmation.\n\nThe White House has encouraged social and religious conservative groups to focus on Ms Barrett's personal life in their campaigns supporting her confirmation.\n\nDuring a private conference call with more than 500 representatives of social and religious conservative groups an hour after her Rose Garden speech, senior White House staff members emphasized her family and pointed out social media posts from Republicans that did the same, including a tweet from Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia, praising her devotion to \"faith, family, and the US Constitution.\"\n\nMr Douglas Hoelscher, the director of the White House's office of inter-governmental affairs, urged the groups to pull out all of the stops in support of a frenzied push to speed the nomination through the Senate in the weeks before Election Day.\n\n\"We really appreciate our stakeholders already rolling up their sleeves and engaging to have their voice added to a positive echo for the president's nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett,\" Mr Hoelscher said. \"We will come back to you to help us along the way over the next month.\" He added, \"We need to have your voice in the fight and we know you're ready for that fight.\"\n\nAllied groups on the Democratic side are no less ready.\n\nAbout two minutes into Mr Trump's introduction of Ms Barrett, the liberal group Demand Justice sent an email to its supporters urging them to \"chip in immediately to put pressure on Senators to vote NO on confirming Amy Coney Barrett.\"\n\nThe group pledged last week to spend US$10 million to try to block the confirmation of any justice before the presidential inauguration in January, and to target vulnerable Republican senators who support such a nomination.\n\nEven before the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg created the Supreme Court vacancy, Demand Justice had begun a US$2 million digital advertising campaign in July, trying to elevate the court as an issue in competitive states in the presidential race.\n\nThose ads are unlikely to focus on Ms Barrett's religious beliefs, according to Mr Brian Fallon, the group's executive director. He issued a statement last week saying that his group had \"zero interest\" in raising questions about the nominee's Catholic faith.\n\nOn the right, the planned campaigns by Mr Trump-allied groups to defend Ms Barrett will be expensive.\n\nThe Republican National Committee said on Saturday that it was kicking off a US$10 million effort, which will include a digital ad campaign and a get-out-the-vote operation that the party's chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said would \"aggressively promote the qualifications of Judge Barrett, and use the issue to galvanise voters.\"\n\nAmerica First Policies, a nonprofit group started by allies of Mr Trump, on Saturday night announced national television, digital and direct-mail advertising buys of more than US$5 million.\n\nThe first television advertisement in the group's campaign, featuring praise for Barrett from the faculty at Notre Dame Law School, where she is a professor, is set to air on Tuesday during the first debate between Mr Trump and Mr Biden.\n\nMr Brian Walsh, the group's president, said the US$5 million was the group's starting point, and that it was prepared to spend more if necessary. He emphasised the importance of introducing Barrett to the country \"on our terms.\"\n\nPrivately, conservative activists concede that the push to support Ms Barrett stands little chance of affecting the outcome, since there are few senators whose votes are seen as being in play and whom conservatives believe they can effectively sway to vote yes.\n\nFew, if any, Democrats are likely to support the nomination, and a campaign targeting Republicans like Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who has said she opposes filling the vacancy before the election, could backfire by further endangering her chances of winning another term and Republicans' hopes of holding onto the Senate.\n\nDuring the earlier battles over the confirmations of Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, control of the Senate was not hanging in the balance. Conservative activists said that with so much on the line now, they would have to take a more targeted and cautious approach.\n\nFor some groups, the spending on the nomination fight might have an added tax benefit, helping them fulfill requirements that they spend more than half of their annual budgets for purposes other than partisan politics. Ads about the Supreme Court could qualify as nonpartisan, even if they come across as supporting one party or the other.\n\nIn the videoconference, Mr Casey Mattox, Americans for Prosperity's vice-president for legal and judicial strategy, urged activists to act quickly \"because this is going to be a pretty compressed time frame as we go through this process.\"\n\nHe added, \"We don't have a lot of time with a nomination like this.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/af_amy-barrett_280920.jpg?VersionId=bHSaXbzuGLJqrX8ib5jyQQlmwBoZelS7", "alt_text": null}]}

The negotiated sale price of $108 million on the basis of Bedok Point as a redevelopment site was supported by two independent valuations. At the given valuation, the mall's net property income yield stood at 2.5 per cent.\n\nThe manager therefore believes that the sale of Bedok Point for redevelopment would be in the best interests of unitholders as asset value is optimised and capital is redeployed towards higher yielding investments.\n\nSeparately, FCT had on Sept 3\n\nproposed to acquire the remaining 63.1 per cent of ARF it does not own\n\nfor $1.06 billion. FCT intends to raise up to $1.39 billion in equity through a private placement and/or a preferential offering to fund the acquisition. Following the acquisition, the manager said that it will focus on optimising the performance of its enlarged portfolio.\n\nThis will be done through economies of scale in its operations and purchasing and outsourcing of contracted services. FCT will also look to strengthen its retail platform and savings in interest expense through refinancing of existing debts and increasing financial flexibility by unencumbering some of the portfolio properties.\n\nFCT also intends to remain Singapore-centric and suburban retail focused. Opportunities for growth include the retail assets in the sponsor's portfolio, additional stake in Waterway Point which is currently held by three joint venture partners as well as third party opportunities that may present themselves from time to time, said the manager.\n\nCompletion of the proposed ARF acquisition and the proposed Bedok Point divestment are subject to unitholders' approval at the EGM to be held on Sept 28, and the fulfilment or waiver of the conditions under the ARF sale and purchase agreement and the Bedok Point put and call option agreement and purchase agreement.\n\nUnits in FCT closed at $2.52 on Friday, down $0.01 or 0.4 per cent.\n\nSee more on\n\nReits\n\nDivestments\n\nShareholders", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_bedokpoint_280920.jpg?VersionId=UEDh4HFrOvITMyxj2SFZ5mqxTF2d7dxO", "alt_text": null}]}

Be sure to keep practising Covid-19 safety procedures like wearing a mask, sanitising, & socially distancing, especially on campus!\"\n\nIn a Sept 17 post, Caleb Poorman, a freshman, looks straight into the camera, shirtless, wearing a Mizzou-branded mask. \"Hey guys, I hope your school year is going well! In these troubling and uncertain times, it's important to stay focused and still have fun,\" he wrote in the caption.\n\n\"For those who may be struggling with everything going on, the University of Missouri counselling centre offers remote individual therapy,\" he said, adding a phone number students could call to schedule counselling.\n\nAround the country, colleges have enlisted students to help share coronavirus safety messaging on official school channels. The University of Missouri has gone a step further. Over the summer, it hired six of its students, including Marquino and Poorman, to serve as social media influencers, sharing content written by the university about the coronavirus on their personal accounts.\n\nOther schools are ramping up similar programmes as the fall semester begins.\n\n\"We've never tried this before,\" said Christian Basi, director of media relations at the University of Missouri. \"But we felt that this particular situation was so important that we wanted to make sure we were reaching students in a format, on a platform that they would most respond to.\n\n\"Students don't read e-mail details,\" he said. \"They're not going to necessarily listen to a speech by administrator or watch a video by an administrator, but they will listen to their friends, and they will listen to their peers, and they will certainly watch them on social media.\"\n\nSAFETY FIRST\n\nBrands have often hired college students to promote their products on social media, seeking access to the coveted youth demographic.\n\nBut in recent years, some students have been hired by the marketing departments of their own colleges. These programmes have typically targeted high schoolers the college is hoping to enroll. Increasingly, universities are using influencers to reach their own students, spurred by Covid-19 outbreaks and by the aim of preventing outbreaks on their campuses.\n\n\"It's no surprise that colleges know their students are living and breathing social media,\" said Windsor Hanger Western, CEO of the student marketing firm Her Campus Media.\n\nShe pointed to influencer twins Brooklyn and Bailey McKnight as an example of what the future will look like for university marketing.\n\nThe twins, who have millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube, are paid by Baylor University, which they attend, to promote the school as a destination for prospective students. (In August, the twins announced on Instagram that both had contracted Covid-19.\n\n\"It is NOT due to in person classes that this happened,\" they wrote, praising Baylor's safety precautions.)\n\nTemple University has created paid positions for student vloggers, and shared campus influencers' content on its official social channels. \"We keep a good pulse on the influencers in our student body,\" Kristen Manka-White, a marketer at the school, told Inside Higher Ed.\n\nThe University of Maryland plans to start paying students to share coronavirus safety information on social media in the coming weeks as part of a larger student ambassador program, said Sophie Tullier, assistant director of assessment and research for the division of student affairs.\n\n\"We pay really competitive market rates based on how many followers they have and the engagement that they get,\" he said. The New York Times sent messages to several influencers, asking for comment, but they did not respond.\n\nBasi said the school didn't tell Glacier which students to recruit; instead, it gave the firm engagement rate targets. \"They know that they have to pick the appropriate people to make sure we're getting those types of results,\" he said.\n\n\"We really carefully vet all of our influencer selections based on a number of criteria,\" Diteljan said.\n\nThe influencers needed to be current students who posted often on Instagram, received \"really high engagement\" on their posts and displayed \"diversity in their styles of content,\" he said.\n\nSo far, the Glacier campaign has produced 18 Instagram posts, three from each influencer, all of whom have between 1,000 and 2,500 followers on Instagram.\n\n\"As of last week, we had reached about 25,000 students and employees,\" Basi said. \"We had recorded about 63,000 impressions for those two particular audiences.\"\n\nHe added that while it is impossible to confirm exactly how well the campaign was working in terms of safety, students on campus seemed to be following mask and distancing guidelines closely.\n\nHe pointed to the declining number of active cases on campus, noting that on Sept 5, Missouri peaked at around 680 active cases. As of Friday (Sept 25), the school's tracker listed 95 active cases.

Between 2010 and 2018, Mr Trump deducted US$26 million in \"consulting fees\" as a business expense.\n\nOn her financial disclosure forms, Ms Ivanka Trump has reported consulting income that matched the figures on the tax returns.\n\nThat could potentially run afoul of IRS rules prohibiting exorbitantly overpaying consultants or regulations against skirting gift and inheritance taxes.\n\n\"It appears that the president has gamed the tax code to his advantage and used legal fights to delay or avoid paying what he owes,\" House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal said in a statement.\n\nMr Neal's committee is engaged in ongoing litigation to obtain Mr Trump's tax returns.\n\nSince he became president, Mr Trump has seen an increase in demand from some business groups for events and conferences at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, his Washington hotel, and the Doral resort in Miami.\n\nBank of America, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association are among organisations that have hosted events at Mr Trump properties in recent years, the Times documents show.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nIncome tax\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/bttrumo20200927.jpg?VersionId=nrnpBxLMToCHCUqZl2fL9qa5cACKvAkW", "alt_text": null}]}

He declined \"at this time\" to block restrictions set to take effect on Nov 12 on technical and business arrangements which are crucial for the app to function properly.\n\nNichols' detailed written opinion is expected to be released as soon as Monday (Sept 28).\n\nThe Commerce Department said in a statement it \"will comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so\".\n\nThe statement, which defended the TikTok order and Trump's executive order demanding owner ByteDance divest its TikTok US operations, did not specify whether the government would appeal.\n\nThe injunction comes at a time when negotiations are underway to hammer out terms of a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee US operations.\n\nTrump has said he had given the deal his \"blessing\". But key terms of the deal - including who will have majority ownership - are in dispute.\n\nByteDance has also said any deal will need to be approved by China and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.\n\nTikTok said it was pleased with the injunction and added it would maintain its \"ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the president gave his preliminary approval to last week, into an agreement\".\n\nJohn E. Hall, a lawyer for TikTok, argued earlier on Sunday that the ban was \"unprecedented\" and \"irrational\".\n\n\"How does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations under way that might make it unnecessary?\" Hall asked during a 90-minute hearing. \"This is just punitive. This is just a blunt way to whack the company ... There is simply no urgency here.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Chinese state media welcomed the ruling.\n\n\"I think it is in line with morality, justice and common sense,\" Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper said on Twitter on Monday.\n\nChinese state media have said they see no reason for China to approve the deal, describing it as based on \"bullying and extortion\".\n\nTrump's administration contends that TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China's government.\n\nAny deal will also still need to be reviewed by the US government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).\n\nThe Justice Department said a preliminary injunction would be \"interfering with a formal national security judgment of the president; altering the landscape with respect to ongoing CFIUS negotiations; and continuing to allow sensitive and valuable user information to flow to ByteDance with respect to all new users.\"\n\nAnother US judge, in Pennsylvania, on Saturday rejected a bid by three TikTok content creators to block the ban, while a judge in California has blocked a similar order from taking effect that would ban Tencent Holdings' WeChat from US app stores.\n\nSee more on\n\nTikTok\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_tiktok_280920.jpg?VersionId=Of8olBLvJRuI1OV5SI2sPXWmWJHQIWXF", "alt_text": null}]}

Nonetheless, coming nearly a month ahead of November's presidential election, it highlights the potential vulnerability of state computer networks, which include election systems.\n\nMs Tara Lee and Mr Mike Faulk, both of whom are spokespersons for Governor Jay Inslee, didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nSecretary of State Kim Wyman's office tweeted Thursday (Sept 24) that they're \"aware of an active cyber threat facing government entities...though we have no reason at this time to believe this is targeted at elections.\"\n\n'PHISHING CAMPAIGN'\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Inslee said at a press conference that a nationwide \"phishing campaign\" - phony emails that usually include an attachment that detonates malware when opened - was targeting the state.\n\nBut the reality of the attack hitting state computer networks is more serious than a phishing campaign. Attackers have successfully gained access to multiple state agencies, spreading malware and establishing a foothold from which they could deepen their attack.\n\nWashington is being assisted by US Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and Microsoft Corp, in the hopes of fending off the attackers, according to the person familiar.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment. Messages sent to the FBI in Seattle weren't acknowledged.\n\nThe attackers' motives remain unclear. It's not known if any data was stolen or if the hackers had planned to detonate the kind of ransomware attacks that have devastated cities, school districts and businesses across the country in recent years.\n\nSuch attacks seek to lock users out of their computers, demanding a hefty ransom to regain access, and can significantly disrupt operations for days or even weeks.\n\nStill, the timing of the attack has raised security questions ahead of the first presidential election since\n\nRussia meddled in the 2016 race by hacking Democratic Party emails\n\nand targeting election systems in all 50 states, according to federal authorities.\n\nDHS has repeatedly warned about the risk of cyber-attacks and even ransomware before the upcoming vote.\n\nAt least some state employees received calls on Sept 18 directing them to avoid accessing emails. On Sept 21, an updated directive asked employees to stop clicking on new attachments, according to a state employee who asked not to be identified because they're not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nPROFIT TOOL\n\nOne of the people familiar with the investigation said early analysis of the intrusion indicated that the hackers may not have been targeting Washington but rather happened upon - and took advantage of - flaws in the state's cybersecurity system. Responders are continuing to monitor the malware's behaviour across a broad swath of the state's network, said the person.\n\nAt least 13 of the state's departments and commissions were impacted by the attack, including corrections, parks and recreation and fish and wildlife, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.\n\nThat person also said another type of malware, called Emotet, was used in the attack, in addition to Trickbot. Representatives from those state agencies didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe election isn't only a political target for some attackers with nation-state allegiances. They are also a potential tool for cybercriminals seeking profit because victims may be desperate to pay to ensure their systems are operational, said Mr Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the New Zealand-band cybersecurity company Emsisoft.\n\n\"What better time for an attacker to extort payment from government systems than the time it needs access the most?\" said Mr Callow, adding that the hackers could be \"holding fire\" until the days leading up to Nov 3 Election Day.\n\nWashington state is widely viewed as boasting one of the country's most sophisticated cybersecurity systems, especially its election system defences. Because of its dependence on postal ballots, Washington ranks among the highest for pandemic voting preparedness, according to a report by the Rand Corp about voting system confidence in 2020.\n\nDANGEROUS MALWARE\n\nThe Emotet banking Trojan, first identified in 2014, gained notoriety by targeting banks and financial data but has since evolved into a spamming and malware service, according to cyber research firm, Malwarebytes Inc. Its ability to evade detection has drawn the ire of the US government which has branded Emotet among the world's most dangerous malware with an estimated cleanup cost of US$1 million (S$1.38 million) per incident.\n\nHackers are often capable of moving around inside the network, allowing them to compromise additional departments. In the case of Emotet, the attackers are also known for resending phishing emails to victims from the internal email system.\n\nIn addition, it's not uncommon for attackers to take their time after gaining access to a network, before deploying ransomware or some other kind of damaging attack. The hackers can use that time to explore the network looking for sensitive data or figuring out how to exploit a vulnerability. Emotet and Trickbot are frequently used in tandem, especially by the Russia-based cybergang, Ryuk, according to the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.\n\nFirst recognised in 2019, Ryuk became notorious in its first six months of operation for attacking enterprise networks, yielding revenue upwards of US$4 million, according to CrowdStrike.\n\nAs Ryuk's activity faded slightly in the early-spring and summer of 2020, another threat actor emerged with a similar attack profile, called Conti, according to Emsisoft.\n\nIn its short history, Conti, which also appears to be Russia-based, has gained notoriety for attacking state and local governments, including state courts in Louisiana in September, the cyber firm said.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nHacking", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_hacker_280920.jpg?VersionId=x0AehZ9MOZROYzPu9dKUxpXNuaYYR1Cf", "alt_text": null}]}

It is particularly busy on the weekends and during school holidays.\"\n\nMuseums reopened on June 26\n\nafter eight weeks of closure as part of Singapore's circuit breaker measures to curb the spread of Covid-19.\n\nNHB and NGS report good responses for guided tours, which resumed in late August with capacity caps. NGS has had \"a healthy take-up of our daily guided tours\", said Mr Lee. There are daily English tours at both ACM and NMS, but Mandarin tours are available only on the weekends at NMS and will resume at ACM from Oct 3.\n\nMr Ting, 42, added: \"The tours have been well received, and staff have observed that visitors are happy that the tours have resumed.\"\n\nMr Lee said NGS has also received encouraging responses to its free, one-year Gallery Insider membership promotion. The membership for Singaporeans and permanent residents offers unlimited access to the museum's shows as well as access to selected programmes and discounts on museum merchandise and F&B outlets.\n\n\"Since its launch as part of our National Day celebrations in August, there have been over 125,000 sign-ups online, with more than 25,000 visits made to the Gallery to activate the membership,\" he added.\n\nSingapore has been opening up gradually in the past two months. Meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (Mice) events can\n\naccept up to 250 participants\n\n, while up to\n\n100 people are allowed at places of worship.\n\nMuseums and heritage institutions will offer a mix of limited on-site programmes and\n\nonline digital options\n\nfor the time being. Mr Lee said NGS will take its lead from the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth.\n\nBut Mr Ting said: \"Taking guidance from Singapore Tourism Board's safe management measures for guided tours, we are also reviewing the number of participants for our museum guided tours.\"\n\nSTB guidelines currently allow tour groups of 10, divided into two sub-groups of five, which are not allowed to mingle.\n\nIn the meantime, all museums have amped up digital options. The ACM has launched a digital version of its new Material and Design galleries as well as ACM Treasures, which allows people to look at a selection of artefacts in augmented reality.\n\nBoth the ACM and Indian Heritage Centre offer self-guided tours, while NGS has introduced Temi, a robot that can take a visitor on a 20-minute tour of four works of art at the DBS Singapore Gallery 1.\n\nMs Harger notes that the silver lining has been the push to digital which allowed museums to reach audiences beyond Singapore shores while keeping local audiences close.

While he receives comparatively strong marks on the economy, a majority of voters also say he is at least partly to blame for the economic downturn.\n\nPerhaps the most comforting news in the poll for Republicans is that at least some Americans appear to have fluid or contradictory opinions on the confirmation process.\n\nWhile most voters would prefer that the next president appoint Ginsburg's successor, the country was effectively split on whether the Senate should act on Trump's nomination: 47 per cent of voters said it should, 48 per cent said it should not, and 5 per cent were undecided. Still, women and independents were firmly against the Senate seating Trump's appointee.\n\nThe poll had a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percentage points.\n\nGinsburg's death has jolted Washington just weeks before the election,\n\nheralding the possibility of an enduring conservative majority on the Supreme Court and marking the latest extraordinary event in perhaps the most unusual election year in modern history.\n\nYet if the pandemic, economic collapse and increasingly tense racial justice protests have upended life for many Americans, they have done little to reshape a presidential campaign that polls show has been remarkably stable.\n\nBiden is leading Trump, 49 per cent to 41 per cent,\n\nthe Times survey shows, propelled by his wide advantage among women and Black and Latino voters and by his gains among constituencies that strongly favoured the president in 2016, including men and older voters. Biden and Trump are tied among men, with each garnering 45 per cent.\n\nThe former vice-president appears notably stronger among college-educated white voters than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Biden is winning 60 per cent of white women with college degrees, compared with 34 per cent for Trump, and he is beating the president among men with college degrees, 50 per cent to 45 per cent.\n\nFour years ago, according to exit polls,\n\nClinton won college-educated white women by only 7 percentage points\n\nand lost college-educated white men to Trump by 14 points.\n\nWith ballots having already been sent out in a number of states and with the first presidential debate scheduled for Tuesday, Trump has a narrowing window for a comeback.\n\nIn an important difference from the 2016 campaign, he would need to draw much closer to 50 per cent to defeat Biden because there is substantially less interest in third-party candidates this year.\n\nThe Libertarian and Green Party nominees are garnering only 3 per cent combined; that figure is closer to more typical elections than to the one four years ago, when minor-party candidates polled far higher in the period approaching the election and combined to get as much as 6% of the vote in some key states.\n\nWith the country so polarised, public opinion on a variety of issues is increasingly linked to presidential preference. The question of which candidate would do a better job picking a Supreme Court justice, for example, effectively matches the White House race: 50 per cent of voters trust Biden on the high court, 43 per cent trust Trump, and 7 per cent are undecided, equaling the percentage of undecided voters in the presidential race.\n\nVoter sentiments are less partisan, though, on the issue of abortion. Although Trump's vow to quickly fill Ginsburg's seat has enraged the left, it's not just liberal intensity that poses a risk to Republicans if the court clash centers on the future of Roe.\n\nThe poll shows that 71 per cent of independents said abortion should be legal all or most of the time, and even 31 per cent of Republicans said the same. Only 33 per cent of the country said the procedure should be illegal all or most of the time.\n\nCrucial constituencies said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if his nominee would overturn Roe. That included 65 per cent of independents and 61 per cent of college-educated white voters.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJoe Biden", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_amyconeybarret_280920.jpg?VersionId=a0xV4Unk03rI1cCIeUwvHuZuiwOt1BLH", "alt_text": null}]}

Ms Low's father died after 10 weeks in the ICU.\n\nThe experience spurred the mayor of South West District to start Caregiving@South West in 2018, to help caregivers find the resources they need - such as support from social service agencies, respite care and contacts for caregiver training within the district.\n\nThe initiative also includes a caregiver-friendly workplace advisory, which the Community Development Council developed together with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices and Workforce Singapore.\n\nMs Low, an MP for Chua Chu Kang GRC since 2011, said: \"I can empathise with the fears of a caregiver, especially those who have been giving care for a long time.\n\n\"We also are worried about them burning out, the need for respite care and their own retirement adequacy if they stop work.\"\n\nThis is one example of how the district marshalled all its resources to benefit its 770,000 residents, said Ms Low, who is also Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth as well as Trade and Industry.\n\nIn her third term as mayor, her focus will be on jobs, boosting skills and strengthening the social safety net, as well as sustainability.\n\nEfforts include the Adopt programme, which will continue to provide support to low-income families and vulnerable seniors. Many of them live in rental homes, of which there are about 7,500 in the district.\n\nSaid Ms Low: \"In the new term, we will want to weave a social safety net that is tighter, stronger, and also more sustainable.

That's why we need to harness the resources and the support of private-sector organisations or even the people sector to really optimise the impact.\"\n\nThe South West District covers about a third of Singapore, and has a lot of green cover. There is a sense that it is the district's responsibility to promote an eco-conscious district, said Ms Low.\n\nShe added that about 300 new youth eco-ambassadors are appointed yearly through the Junior Environmental Ambassador programme, and the district relies on them to inculcate a sense of environmental ownership.\n\nOn her part, she has not used plastic bottles for the last seven years, carrying with her at least four glass bottles daily. Ms Low said having more conversations with residents will be key to achieving goals.\n\n\"Through conversations, we will know their concerns, their fears, their aspirations, their needs.

There were no immediate reports of injuries, but a Reuters photographer in St Helena saw a number of structures that had been burned.\n\nThe blaze erupted midway through the traditional grape-harvesting period in the Napa Valley, world renowned as one of California's premiere wine-producing regions.\n\nThe area's 475 wineries account for just 4 per cent of the state's total annual grape harvest but half of the retail value of all California wines sold, according to the Napa Valley Vintners trade group.\n\nOf Napa's 16 wine-growing districts, or sub-appellations, the Howell Mountain area may have faced the greatest threat, said Lisa Covey, a spokeswoman for Hall Family Wines, which kept open during the day all its three tasting rooms in the county.\n\nNapa and other wine-growing regions have been hit by wildfires in and around the Bay area for several years.\n\nSusan Krausz, co-owner of Arkenstone Estate Vineyards in Angwin, said it would take days or weeks to assess the impact of the latest blaze on valley vintners.\n\n\"Most people have harvested,\" she said, adding, \"Any time's a bad time for a fire.\"\n\nTom Kaljian, 78, a realtor who owns a house about halfway between Calistoga and St. Helena, defied evacuation orders to spend the day with his wife hosing down their home and dry brush along a fence line separating their property from the Silverado Trail, one of the area's main north-south roadways.\n\n\"We were told to get out of here, but I was trying to protect our little abode, so we stayed,\" he told Reuters by phone, adding that firefighters stopped by later to tell him his house was no longer in danger.\n\n\"I stopped watering at that point, and came in and took a nap,\" he said.\n\nThe latest blaze came as the Pacific Gas and Electric Company announced it was temporarily shutting off power to transmission lines in portions of 16 counties across northern and central California as a precaution against heightened wildfire risks posed by hot, windy, dry conditions.\n\nThe public safety power shutoffs were expected to affect some 65,000 homes and businesses in the region, said PG&E, the state's largest electric utility.\n\nA red flag warning for extreme wildfire risks was to remain posted for Napa Valley through Monday morning, Zander said.\n\nCalFire said a fire weather watch will start on Monday across much of Southern California due to a forecast return of hot, gusty Santa Ana winds and low humidity from San Diego to Los Angeles and Ventura counties.\n\nCalifornia wildfires have scorched more than 1.49 million hectares in the first nine months of 2020, far exceeding any single year in state history, killing 26 people and destroying more than 7,000 structures.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nWildfires", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_glass-fire_280920.jpg?VersionId=QvUAcWlypnCYM2sUlyH5qo4fCc.OHtVt", "alt_text": null}]}

Mr Trump has long refused to release this information, making him the first president in decades to hide basic details about his finances. His refusal has made his tax returns among the most sought-after documents in recent memory.\n\nAmong the key findings of The Times' investigation:\n\n- Mr Trump\n\npaid no federal income taxes in 11 of 18 years\n\nthat The Times examined. In 2017, after he became president, his tax bill was only US$750 (S$1,032).\n\n- He has reduced his tax bill with questionable measures, including a US$72.9 million tax refund that is the subject of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n- Many of his signature businesses, including his golf courses, report losing large amounts of money - losses that have helped him to lower his taxes.\n\n- The financial pressure on him is increasing as hundreds of millions of dollars in loans he personally guaranteed are soon coming due.\n\n- Even while declaring losses, he has managed to enjoy a lavish lifestyle by taking tax deductions on what most people would consider personal expenses, including residences, aircraft and US$70,000 in hairstyling for television.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The records do not reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia.\n\nIt is important to remember that the returns are not an unvarnished look at Mr Trump's business activity. They are instead his own portrayal of his companies, compiled for the IRS. But they do offer the most detailed picture yet available.\n\nBelow is a deeper look at the takeaways.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S TAX AVOIDANCE\n\nMR TRUMP HAS PAID NO FEDERAL INCOME TAXES FOR MUCH OF THE PAST TWO DECADES\n\nIn addition to the 11 years in which he paid no taxes during the 18 years examined by The Times, he paid only US$750 in each of the two most recent years - 2016 and 2017.\n\nHe has managed to avoid taxes while enjoying the lifestyle of a billionaire - which he claims to be - in which his companies cover the costs of many personal expenses.\n\nTHIS TAX AVOIDANCE SETS HIM APART FROM MOST OTHER AFFLUENT AMERICANS\n\nTaxes on wealthy Americans have declined sharply over the past few decades, and many use loopholes to reduce their taxes below the statutory rates. But most affluent people still pay a lot of federal income tax.\n\nIn 2017, the average federal income rate for the highest-earning 0.001 per cent of tax filers - that is, the most affluent 1/100,000th slice of the population - was 24.1 per cent, according to the IRS.\n\nOver the past two decades, Mr Trump has paid about US$400 million less in combined federal income taxes than a very wealthy person who paid the average for that group each year.\n\nHIS TAX AVOIDANCE ALSO SETS HIM APART FROM PAST PRESIDENTS\n\nMr Trump may be the wealthiest US president in history. Yet he has often paid less in taxes than other recent presidents. Barack Obama and George W. Bush each regularly paid more than US$100,000 a year - and sometimes much more - in federal income taxes while in office.\n\nMr Trump, by contrast, is running a federal government to which he has contributed almost no income tax revenue in many years.\n\nA LARGE REFUND HAS BEEN CRUCIAL TO HIS TAX AVOIDANCE\n\nMr Trump did face large tax bills after the initial success of \"The Apprentice\" television show, but he erased most of these tax payments through a refund. Combined, Mr Trump initially paid almost US$95 million in federal income taxes over the 18 years. He later managed to recoup most of that money, with interest, by applying for and receiving a US$72.9 million tax refund, starting in 2010.\n\nThe refund reduced his total federal income tax bill between 2000 and 2017 to an annual average of US$1.4 million. By comparison, the average American in the top 0.001 per cent of earners paid about US$25 million in federal income taxes each year over the same span.\n\nTHE US$72.9 MILLION REFUND HAS SINCE BECOME THE SUBJECT OF A LONG-RUNNING BATTLE WITH THE IRS\n\nWhen applying for the refund, he cited a giant financial loss that may be related to the failure of his Atlantic City casinos. Publicly, he also claimed that he had fully surrendered his stake in the casinos.\n\nBut the real story may be different from the one he told. Federal law holds that investors can claim a total loss on an investment, as Mr Trump did, only if they receive nothing in return. Mr Trump did appear to receive something in return: Five per cent of the new casino company that formed when he renounced his stake.\n\nIn 2011, the IRS began an audit reviewing the legitimacy of the refund. Almost a decade later, the case remains unresolved, for unknown reasons, and could ultimately end up in federal court, where it could become a matter of public record.\n\nBUSINESS EXPENSES AND PERSONAL BENEFITS\n\nMR TRUMP CLASSIFIES MUCH OF THE SPENDING ON HIS PERSONAL LIFESTLE AS THE COST OF BUSINESS\n\nHis residences are part of the family business, as are the golf courses where he spends so much time. He has classified the cost of his aircraft, used to shuttle him among his homes, as a business expense as well. Haircuts - including more than US$70,000 to style his hair during \"The Apprentice\" - have fallen into the same category. So did almost US$100,000 paid to a favourite hair and makeup artist of Ms Ivanka Trump.\n\nAll of this helps to reduce Mr Trump's tax bill further, because companies can write off business expenses.\n\nSEVEN SPRINGS, HIS ESTATE IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY, NEW YORK, TYPIFIES HIS AGGRESSIVE DEFINITION OF BUSINESS EXPENSES\n\nMr Trump bought the estate, which stretches over more than 200 acres (80.9ha) in Bedford, New York, in 1996. His sons Eric and Donald Jr spent summers living there when they were younger.\n\n\"This is really our compound,\" Eric told Forbes in 2014. \"Today,\" the Trump Organisation website continues to report, \"Seven Springs is used as a retreat for the Trump family.\" Nonetheless, the elder Trump has classified the estate as an investment property, distinct from a personal residence. As a result, he has been able to write off US$2.2 million in property taxes since 2014 - even as his 2017 tax law has limited individuals to writing off only US$10,000 in property taxes a year.\n\nTHE 'CONSULTING FEES'\n\nACROSS NEARLY ALL OF HIS PROJECTS, MR TRUMP'S COMPANIES SET ASIDE ABOUT 20 PER CENT OF INCOME FOR UNEXPLAINED 'CONSULTING FEES'\n\nThese fees reduce taxes, because companies are able to write them off as a business expense, lowering the amount of final profit subject to tax.\n\nMr Trump collected US$5 million on a hotel deal in Azerbaijan, for example, and reported US$1.1 million in consulting fees. In Dubai, there was a US$630,000 fee on US$3 million in income. Since 2010, Mr Trump has written off some US$26 million in such fees.\n\nHIS DAUGHTER APPEARS TO HAVE RECEIVED SOME OF THESE CONSULTING FEES, DESPITE HAVING BEEN A TOP TRUMP ORGANISATION EXECUTIVE\n\nThe Times investigation discovered a striking match: Mr Trump's private records show that his company once paid US$747,622 in fees to an unnamed consultant for hotel projects in Hawaii and Vancouver, British Columbia. Ms Ivanka Trump's public disclosure forms - which she filed when joining the White House staff in 2017 - show that she had received an identical amount through a consulting company she co-owned.\n\nMONEY-LOSING BUSINESSES\n\nMANY OF THE HIGHEST-PROFILE TRUMP BUSINESSES LOSE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY\n\nSince 2000, he has reported losing more than US$315 million at the golf courses that he often describes as the heart of his empire. Much of this has been at Trump National Doral, a resort near Miami that he bought in 2012. And his Washington hotel, opened in 2016, has lost more than US$55 million.\n\nAn exception: Trump Tower in New York, which reliably earns him more than US$20 million in profits a year.\n\nTHE MOST SUCCESSFUL PART OF THE TRUMP BUSINESS HAS BEEN HIS PERSONAL BRAND\n\nThe Times calculates that between 2004 and 2018, Mr Trump made a combined US$427.4 million from selling his image - an image of unapologetic wealth through shrewd business management. The marketing of this image has been a huge success, even if the underlying management of many of the operating Mr Trump companies has not been.\n\nOther firms, especially in real estate, have paid for the right to use the Trump name. The brand made possible the \"The Apprentice\" - and the show then took the image to another level.\n\nOf course, Mr Trump's brand also made possible his election as the first US president with no prior government experience.\n\nBUT HIS UNPROFITABLE COMPANIES STILL SERVE A FINANCIAL PURPOSE: REDUCING HIS TAX BILL\n\nThe Trump OrganiSation - a collection of more than 500 entities, virtually all of them wholly owned by MR Trump - has used the losses to offset the rich profits from the licensing of the Trump brand and other profitable pieces of its business.\n\nThe reported losses from the operating businesses were so large that they often fully erased the licensing income, leaving the organiSation to claim that it earns no money and thus owes no taxes. This pattern is an old one for MR Trump. The collapse of major parts of his business in the early 1990s generated huge losses that he used to reduce his taxes for years afterward.\n\nLARGE BILLS LOOMING\n\nWITH THE CASH FROM 'THE APPRENTICE', MR TRUMP WENT ON HIS BIGGEST BUYING SPREE SINCE THE 1980s\n\n\"The Apprentice,\" which debuted on NBC in 2004, was a huge hit. Mr Trump received 50 per cent of its profits, and he went on to buy more than 10 golf courses and multiple other properties. The losses at these properties reduced his tax bill. But the strategy ran into trouble as the money from \"The Apprentice\" began to decline. By 2015, his financial condition was worsening.\n\nHIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE BEEN PARTLY AN ATTEMPT TO RESUSCITATE HIS BRAND\n\nThe financial records do not answer this question definitively. But the timing is consistent: Mr Trump announced a campaign that seemed a long shot to win but was almost certain to bring him newfound attention, at the same time that his businesses were in need of a new approach.\n\nTHE PRESIDENCY HAS HELPED HIS BUSINESS\n\nSince he became a leading presidential candidate, he has received large amounts of money from lobbyists, politicians and foreign officials who pay to stay at his properties or join his clubs. The Times investigation puts precise numbers on this spending for the first time.\n\nA surge of new members at the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida gave him an additional US$5 million a year from the business since 2015. Roofing materials manufacturer GAF spent at least US$1.5 million at Doral in 2018 as its industry was seeking changes in federal regulations. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association paid at least US$397,602 in 2017 to the Washington hotel, where it held at least one event during its World Summit in Defence of Persecuted Christians.\n\nIn his first two years in the White House, Mr Trump received millions of dollars from projects in foreign countries, including US$3 million from the Philippines, US$2.3 million from India and US$1 million from Turkey.\n\nBUT THE PRESIDENCY HAS NOT RESOLVED HIS CORE FINANCIAL PROBLEM: MANY OF HIS BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY\n\nWith \"The Apprentice\" revenue declining, MR Trump has absorbed the losses partly through one-time financial moves that may not be available to him again.\n\nIn 2012, he took out a US$100 million mortgage on the commercial space in Trump Tower. He has also sold hundreds of millions worth of stock and bonds. But his financial records indicate that he may have as little as US$873,000 left to sell.\n\nHE WILL SOON FACE SEVERAL MAJOR BILLS THAT COULD PUT FURTHER PRESSURE ON HIS FINANCES\n\nHe appears to have paid off none of the principal of the Trump Tower mortgage, and the full US$100 million comes due in 2022. And if he loses his dispute with the IRS over the 2010 refund, he could owe the government more than US$100 million (including interest on the original amount).\n\nHE IS PERSONALLY ON THE HOOK FOR SOME OF THESE BILLS\n\nIn the 1990s, Mr Trump nearly ruined himself by personally guaranteeing hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, and he has since said that he regretted doing so. But he has taken the same step again, his tax records show. He appears to be responsible for loans totaling US$421 million, most of which is coming due within four years.\n\nShould he win reelection, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president. Whether he wins or loses, he will probably need to find new ways to use his brand - and his popularity among tens of millions of Americans - to make money.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTaxation\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/09/28/rk_donaldtrump_280920.jpg?VersionId=pyuBShO0iL59Qgn200XkOyur.RoNFcbE", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f71970a1b58152795d521d009a602ad0be4d4a500b1740142bd9c4a2adda9b0d", "alt_text": "mwdesign - DBS Wellness space 1 (CREDIT DBS Bank)\n \nCredit: Photo of DBS Bank office"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ababd7adbab5ef95d4223806a015c648e9803c8d554289cc24869840a46a74ae", "alt_text": "Enforcement action by the Health Sciences Authority netted a suspect and various vapes on July 10."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7f73688fa163929df2c176d392b660d82a63b73e970c811e2339978d254a5fcd", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo, with retirees Chong Hock Loo, 75, and Shirley Tan, 68, during the PCF Family Day event on July 13."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0748316b0c8c0488543313beecbd97ee6f6260fce547cdce53f76f53d9d6a49f", "alt_text": "From left: Pathlight School students Marcus Goh, Nurdaanya Mohamed Hafiz and Brennan Tay with their respective artwork, part of a total of 30 artwork that are selected in the Wing Tai X Pathlight School art competition to be displayed on a construction hoarding along Kim Seng Linear Park, on July 11, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0f74970f823073d68c58dca22ef69d6312f85ec19cd11cccf600d0046eabbb32", "alt_text": "Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - July 13, 2025 Italy's Jannik Sinner celebrates with the trophy after winning the men's final against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz REUTERS/Andrew Couldridge"}]}
