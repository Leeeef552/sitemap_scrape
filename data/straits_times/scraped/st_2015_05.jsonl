PHOTO: EPA\n\nFollow topic:\n\nCycling - Sport\n\nPublished\n\nMay 31, 2015, 11:34 PM\n\nMILAN (AFP) - Spain's Alberto Contador kept his hopes of a rare cycling double alive by securing his seventh Grand Tour title with overall victory in the Giro d'Italia on Sunday.\n\nFormer track rider Iljo Keisse, a Belgian who rides for Etixx-QuickStep, won the final stage from Torino to Milan after outsprinting fellow breakaway rider Luke Durbridge of Australia.\n\n\"It's the biggest win of my career! It's amazing,\" said a visibly shaken Keisse after finishing a tough 98th edition in the best way possible.\n\nBut all eyes were on Tinkoff team leader Contador as he maintained his bid to achieve the rare feat of emulating deceased Italian Marco Pantani, the last cyclist to win the Giro and Tour de France in the same year, in 1998.\n\nAfter three dramatic weeks of racing which saw the retirement of Australian contender Richie Porte (Team Sky), Contador deflected challenges late in the race from Astana pair Fabio Aru and Mikel Landra to finish with a comfortable winning margin.\n\nThe Spaniard may have failed to win a stage throughout, but the former two-time Tour de France winner and three-time Tour of Spain champion finished comfortably ahead of Aru to clinched his second pink jersey after his maiden Giro win in 2008.\n\nAstana team leader Aru, the winner of two key mountain stages, was second overall at 1min 53sec while teammate Landa, also a two-time stage winner, was third at 3:05 Astana's stage successes and podium places will help soothe the pain of the intense doping scrutiny, following a string of positive results last year, that threatened their existence at the top echelons of the sport.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

They can sell up to 150 cups a day, so expect to queue during peak hours.\n\nThe Udders chain of ice cream shops launched its Thai milk tea flavour because of a love for the drink.\n\nMs Hannah Tan, 24, who develops new flavours for Udders, says: \"I wanted to recreate the feeling of sipping on an ice-cold cup of Thai milk tea on a hot day.\n\n\"To make the ice cream, we steep Thai tea leaves in hot milk - fresh, condensed and evaporated - to give the flavour real body.\"\n\nBonheur Patisserie's owner Lin Weixian, 29, says his Thai milk tea macaron is the best of both worlds.\n\nHe says: \"We want to inject some Asian elements into a French macaron, especially when we are a home-grown brand. I love Thai cuisine and Thai iced tea is a must-have when I dine in a Thai restaurant. I decided to combine my favourite sweet beverage with the macaron.\"\n\nThe macaron ($3.50) includes tea leaves in the shells as well as the ganache. The patisserie, which has been at Pasarbella since 2013, sells 150 pieces of it in a week.\n\nAnother retailer who has noticed an increasing demand for Thai iced milk tea is the owner of Nam's Brewing Thai Tea, Mr Hoong Chee Hoe, 35.\n\nHis shop at Far East Square imports the Number One Brand of Thai tea, also known as Cha Tra Mue.\n\nSince its opening in 2013, he has seen queues of up to 20 minutes at lunch time. A cup of Thai milk tea costs $2.80 and he sells at least 200 cups in a day.\n\n\"Over the past two years, the market is constantly growing and we are seeing more Thai tea-related products coming up,\" he says. \"People are also more willing to try other types of Thai drinks.\"\n\nNam's also sells Thai milk green tea, which he says has started gaining ground among tea drinkers here.\n\nThe shop also retails the tea in convenient tea bags ($6.90 for two packets of five tea bags each).\n\nOwl brand, best known for its instant coffee, also sells 3-in-1 instant Thai Iced Tea. It retails at $6.20 for a bag of 15 sachets in major supermarkets.\n\nThailand-born restaurateur Pornsak Prajakwit, 33, uses his grandmother's recipe for the drink. It is the best-selling drink in all five of his restaurants.\n\nTamarind seeds are brewed with the tea and coconut, condensed and evaporated milk add richness and depth.\n\nHe says: \"Tamarind is commonly used in Thai cooking, so instead of discarding the seeds, it is used in making the tea.\"\n\nOn the tea's saccharine sweetness, he says: \"If you rate sweetness out of 10, the ones in Thailand are 11 and those in Singapore are six. Thai iced milk tea is super sweet because it's more like a dessert drink.\"\n\nHe has tried to introduce other Thai drinks to diners, but Thai milk tea remains the favourite.\n\n\"I tried Thai roselle, Thai coffee, everyone still picks Thai iced tea,\" he adds with a laugh.\n\nIndeed, diners are lapping up the sugary drink.\n\nCivil servant Muhammad Khairi, 26, who went to Iceburnz six times during its run in Woodlands, says: \"I like the Thai milk tea because it reminds me of what I drank in Thailand. It is not too sweet or too bland, it is just the way I like it. I'm following them to their next location.\"\n\nHousewife Carol Teo, 54, who goes to Bangkok for holidays once every few years, says: \"I'm glad that the drink is more readily available as my family loves it. While my children like the macarons from Bonheur Patisserie, I still prefer the drink and would like to stock up on the bottled versions.\"\n\neuniceq@sph.com.sg\n\nTHAI TEA FIXES\n\nICEBURNZ\n\nWhat:\n\nThis drinks stall may have ended its month-long run at the night market in Woodlands, but it will be setting up at the upcoming Ramadan Bazaar at Geylang Serai next month.

But the lead lawyer on the defence side said his team had been told by the court that they would only find out whether they can access the evidence on July 8 - the first day of the trial.\n\n\"The defence lawyers urgently need both crucial information gained from the re-examination of forensics evidence in this case and also adequate time to consider this information prior to the trial beginning. I am now deeply concerned at this developing situation,\" Mr Nakhon Chomphuchat said in a statement released on Sunday. \"Forensic evidence is central to this case. Without re-examination of this evidence... the ability of the two defendants to defend themselves against the serious crimes they are charged (with) will be seriously impeded.\"\n\nThe court was unreachable over the weekend.\n\nThe defendants, both aged 22, confessed to the crimes after their arrest in October but later retracted the admission of guilt, alleging it had been extracted under duress.\n\nThe pair's defence team have long voiced concerns over the quality of the Thai police investigation, claiming the crime scene was contaminated and that their clients were tortured into confessing.\n\nRights groups have accused the Thai authorities of using the men as scapegoats.\n\nHowever both police and prosecutors have defended their investigation and insist that the forensic evidence is solid.\n\nThe victims' families have also said they have seen strong evidence against the suspects and expressed confidence in the case after British detectives travelled to Thailand to observe the investigation.\n\nMr Miller and Ms Witheridge's corpses were discovered on a Koh Tao beach on September 15.

He added that a post-mortem suggested that the child might have died in April. The cause of death has yet to be determined.\n\nNo visible signs of injury were found on his severely decomposed body, he also said.\n\nOn Friday, renovation workers found the child's body buried in cement after smelling a foul stench coming from a hole in the kitchen floor in Taman Usaha Jaya, Kepong.\n\nThe parents had allegedly asked their landlord permission to repair a bathroom in March, before vacating the house without notice.\n\nTheir neighbours said sounds of children crying and beating were a regular occurrence in the household.\n\nThe home had its doors and windows locked, and the family never chatted with their neighbours.\n\nAbout a week before they moved out, neighbours heard a boy cry out: \"Please! Don't hit me! Don't hit me!\"\n\nTaman Usaha Jaya residents said they were saddened but not surprised by the morbid find, saying that there was \"something off\" about the family.\n\nBesides shutting themselves in during their eight months there, neighbours often heard cries of children and beatings from the house.\n\nNeighbour Ten Heen, 65, whose relative rented the home to the family, described the 33-year-old patriarch as a \"man who could eat you up\".\n\nHis arms were covered in tattoos and he would be very cold towards Mr Ten even when greeted.\n\n\"Whenever he walked out, it's like he was scared someone would recognise him,\" Mr Ten said, adding that the man lived in the house with his wife, their two daughters and two sons.\n\nThe strange odour of chemical from the house was nothing unusual for the neighbourhood, said Mr Ten.\n\n\"The children are quite young - maybe the eldest has just started secondary school.\n\n\"Last month, I heard a big fight in the house and I heard the son pleading 'don't hit me, don't hit me'.\n\n\"The next day, neighbours noticed that one son was missing. He didn't come out of the house.\n\n\"The day after that, the family brought in a contractor to drill a hole,\" said Mr Ten.\n\nHe said he suspected something amiss when his brother-in-law told him that they only hired a contractor to fix a clogged pipe in the bathroom.\n\nThe family, he said, became more reclusive and the home was dead quiet for about a week. Neighbours then saw the family packing up and driving off around mid-April.\n\nOn Friday, renovation workers found the child's body buried in cement after smelling a foul stench coming from a hole in the kitchen floor.\n\nIt was wrapped in cloth and severely decomposed.\n\nSelangor CID chief Mohd Adnan Abdullah had earlier said that he believed the child was a girl because the remains had long hair.\n\nAnother neighbour, Mr Azizan Shafiee, said even the children avoided speaking to neighbours.\n\n\"When he returned home from work, he would never come out of his car if one of us was standing outside. He would go around the neighbourhood in his car until we went inside.\n\n\"I didn't know them but I am very sad that this happened. That was a child and it's cruel,\" he told The Star.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nCrimes against children/minors\n\nMurder/Manslaughter", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/kepong343534e_2x.jpg?VersionId=BN1G28GMRUl5OTKwhlChqiyXPVFAf_O.", "alt_text": "The body of a child was found buried in cement in the kitchen floor of a house in Taman Usaha Jaya, Kepong, on Friday, May 29, 2015. -- PHOTO: THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK&nbsp;"}]}

In November 2013, it published the Global Teacher Status Index, the first attempt to compare attitudes towards teachers in 21 countries.\n\nThe index found significant differences between the status of teachers worldwide.\n\nThe survey also found that in many countries, a third to a half of parents would \"probably\" or \"definitely not\" encourage their children to enter the teaching profession.\n\nIn the case of Singapore, although teachers were generally well respected, 20 per cent of the respondents said they would not encourage their children to take up teaching as a profession.\n\nSingapore has its own President's Award for Teachers, where the public nominate outstanding teachers. A total of 66 teachers have received the award since its introduction in 1998.\n\nsandra@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nTeachers\n\nEducation and schools", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/29/iwabuchi027.jpg?VersionId=wqqPkBeay83SpwHQp3oODR9f4JxQmvkP", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

The pop-rock quartet CNBlue had previously staged full-length concerts here last year (2014) and in 2013.\n\nAt the One Fine Day concert at The Star Theatre, the 25-year-old Jung was the powerhouse vocalist, the entertaining emcee and his own keyboardist.\n\nThe charismatic showman captivated the over 4,000 strong crowd with songs from the CNBlue repertoire and his first solo album, One Fine Day, which was released in January.\n\nTwo songs into the 17-song setlist, he managed to rouse the enthusiastic audience to their feet, while waving the official concert light stick.\n\nThe crowd was spontaneous throughout the two-hour show and I found myself having to stand to get a view of the stage for a good part of the concert.\n\nThere was a good mix of quiet and high-octane moments.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The versatile singer filled in for his duet partners, which include the likes of Singapore's pop prince JJ Lin, and Korean rapper Verbal Jint.\n\nLin and Jung worked on the Korean- Mandarin-English pop-rock tune Checkmate that was featured on album One Fine Day. They wrote the lyrics together and Jung penned the melody.\n\nHe powered through the dynamic Checkmate, belting out his Korean lyrics and Lin's part in Mandarin.\n\nAnother duet, titled Energy, was interspersed with rap that was originally performed by Verbal Jint. At the concert, Jung took on double duty - switching between soulful crooning and busting out the rap.\n\nIronically, there's a line in the song that goes \"I'm out of energy\". Far from letting his battery go flat, he wiggled and grooved throughout the entire show.\n\nHe obliterated any chance of an awkward pauses, filling almost every moment with random antics. For instance, he playfully cajoled an unsuspecting crew member who fixed his \"trouble\" (he meant microphone) onstage into dancing.\n\nHe declared his appreciation Singapore style, saying \"Thank you lah\", and ad libbed, singing \"Oh Singapore, are you having fun? Oh Baby.\" into lively song Mileage.\n\nSometimes, he would even stop dead in his tracks to elicit deafening cheers from the crowd.\n\nEnding off with the title track to his album One Fine Day, he declared: \"Today is one fine day because of you.\"\n\nI'm sure the audience thought so too.\n\nnggwen@sph.com\n\nSee more on\n\nConcert review\n\nMusic\n\nK-pop", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

Both are also Singaporeans.\n\nThe former sustained injuries during the incident but was conscious when taken to hospital. Substances believed to be controlled drugs and an item, believed to be a drug-taking utensil, were found on the two men who were arrested, police said. They found no weapons on the three subjects.\n\nAt around 4.30am on Sunday at a highly secured checkpoint along Ardmore Park, the three men in a red Subaru Impreza defied orders to allow police to check the boot of the car.\n\nInstead, the 34-year-old driver tried to make a run for it and crashed the car through the barricades. \"Despite police warnings to stop, the driver continued to crash through police barricades, endangering the lives of the officers. Police opened fire at the vehicle to stop further danger,\" a police spokesman said.\n\nThe car, which had a single bullet hole in the front windscreen, came to a stop on a grass patch barely 250m from the entrance of the Shangri-La Hotel. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. It was the first time in seven years that police have had to open fire, with the last incident - involving a knife-wielding man who continued to advance on an officer at Outram Park MRT station - occurring in 2008.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Few do well in both; even fewer among them choose sport over their studies.\n\nBadminton player Grace Chua, 19, is one of those who has decided to take the path less travelled.\n\nScoring an impressive 44 out of 45 in last year's International Baccalaureate, she made the bold move to put aside her studies to focus on badminton.\n\nMaking her debut at the SEA Games this year, she remarked: \"I had a strong passion in badminton and I wanted to take it to the next level and take part in international competitions.\"\n\nChua will be delaying her university education for a couple of years depending on her badminton performance.\n\nEven though Methodist Girls' School (MGS), where she studied, did not have badminton as a co-curricular activity, she never gave up on the sport.\n\nShe said: \"Since MGS did not have a badminton team, I was not able to take part in inter-school competitions. But I train with the (national) youth squad in the evenings, and was still able to gain exposure by taking part in youth competitions.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

This gave me more time to focus on my studies and sport and I am really grateful for that.\"\n\nDespite many people in Singapore placing great emphasis on studies, she has not looked back on her decision to pursue her sporting dream.\n\nShe said: \"I feel that since I have already reached such a high level, it is fine for me to put aside other things for the moment and focus on sport and achieve even better results.\"\n\nFor the SEA Games, she is excited and aims to perform well in front of the home crowd at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. She hopes that her hard work will translate into a good performance on court.\n\nAsked about her plans in badminton, Chua added: \"I will put aside my studies for a while and see how far I can go and how much I can improve.

The Thai monarchy is shielded by one of the world's toughest lese majeste laws and prosecutions using the legislation have increased dramatically since the military took over.\n\nMedia have to routinely self-censor when reporting on the monarchy for fear of falling foul of the broadly-worded royal defamation law.\n\nAnyone convicted of insulting, defaming or threatening the monarchy can be jailed for up to 15 years on each count.\n\nSee more on\n\nThailand\n\nRoyal families\n\nBhumibol Adulyadej", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/nabmTHAIROYALS31515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=8AU1b4JSqQHFwEJptSboUI40UkIvSNHh", "alt_text": "Well-wishers hold portraits of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej and wave national flags as they line up the streets outside the Siriraj hospital in Bangkok on May 10, 2015.&nbsp;Thailand's revered but ailing king has returned to hospital in Bangkok for m"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

Every day, from 9pm to 3am, he plans, assembles and paints his Gundam robot model kits.\n\n\"Sometimes, I run on coffee and Red Bull. But I'm happy to forgo sleep for my passion,\" says the 37-year-old claims executive in an insurance company, who is married with two young children.\n\nLater this week, he will make a pilgrimage to Takashimaya Square, where more than 200 models of the Japanese popular robot franchise will be shown at what is Singapore's biggest Gundam event to date.\n\nTwo 6m-tall robots, each weighing 2 tonnes, will be placed at Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza. Gundam mechanic designer Kunio Okawara, who created the first Gundam design, is coming here to meet fans on Saturday.\n\nThe event, which runs for almost a month starting from Thursday, is to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Gundam model kits.\n\nThe model kits have a passionate otaku following - mostly men under 40 - including here, where some fans have amassed more than 500 model kits, filling their bedrooms and homes with the boxes.\n\nSome of them have each spent more than $50,000 on Gundam, not to mention countless hours assembling the models. And they have no regrets, they say, because they are huge fans of the franchise, which also comprises anime, manga and video games.\n\nMr Lim and Mr Leon Ku, 39, are believed to have among the largest collections of Gundam model kits here. They each own more than 500 kits, which cost from $20 to more than $600 each.\n\nMr Lim first watched the anime series on TV when he was 16 and bought his first model kit - a $30 Wing Gundam - a year later with his pocket money.\n\nHe says: \"It's great imagining myself as a pilot controlling a massive robot and taking down foes. Creating the models somehow lets me indulge in the fantasy.\n\n\"The hobby lets me express myself creatively. I can pose the figures any way I want and modify them to make them look more impressive.\"\n\nIn 2004, he started a Facebook page devoted to his hobby, which now has more than 6,000 \"likes\".\n\nSays his wife, recruitment manager Elaine Lim: \"I think his hobby is fine because it is creative and keeps him at home. At least I know he is not out drinking or partying.\"\n\nThe model kits also inspire creativity in Mr Ku, who is drawn to the challenge of making realistic Gundam models through detailed painting and weathering effects.\n\nThe building manager, who is married with a son, 10, and a daughter, 13, started assembling Gundam models in 1998. By 2004, he had completed 1,000 models and has since lost count.\n\nHe says: \"At my fastest, I made four models a week. Some people think I'm just playing with plastic. But I want to show them that making Gundams can be a form of art.\"\n\nAnother collector, food and beverage manager Lin Zhisheng, owns more than 250 kits, mostly kept in his bedroom.\n\nSays the bachelor, 27, who lives in a four-room flat in Serangoon with his mother and sister: \"I'm drawn to what Gundam models represent - freedom, courage and willpower.\"\n\nHis favourite - and most expensive - model is an 80cm-tall Neo Zeong, which he bought for $300 last year at a hobby shop here.\n\nSays his sister Zhili, 26, a graphic designer: \"When I visited Hong Kong last year, I had to bring back a few Gundam model kits for him.\n\n\"He's quite obsessed. But I can understand because I myself collect sneakers. I guess we all have our own weird obsessions.\"\n\nMr Bernard Cher, 39, who owns M Workshop, a model kit store at Sunshine Plaza, says that Gundam models must be assembled and painted before they can be displayed.\n\nHe adds: \"It's not like Transformers or Sailor Moon where you can just buy the figurines and display them immediately. To get a finished Gundam robot, you need patience and skill to put it together.\"\n\nLimited-edition merchandise will also be sold at the upcoming exhibition and Mr Lin plans to queue overnight to get his hands on them.\n\nHe says: \"They won't be available anywhere else, so I don't mind queuing overnight to get them.\"\n\nbang@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nPeople", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_GUND_1362765e_2x.jpg?VersionId=inBiJjNXkMtB64t8_nAxBPnC4Lh6RTyX", "alt_text": "Gundam mechanic designer Kunio Okawara will be at Takashimaya Square to meet fans this Saturday. -- ST PHOTO: SPH FILE"}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_BAGUN5_1362632e_2x.jpg?VersionId=4u.2iII4qDHdrWj_abRf11skhu1ZBz3S", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_BAGUN4_1362626e_2x.jpg?VersionId=hiji2Pzp7auWURxfuo1NXAmDeGNWXAUl", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_BAGUN1_1362624e_2x.jpg?VersionId=EqKMZ7TLcEqJQkPFLjIlUpdOy9DXJI7i", "alt_text": null}]}

At about 11.30am, Orange Grove Road, Anderson Road and Ardmore Park were reopened.\n\n\"If there was an improvised explosive device detected, the implications would have been very sobering and serious for Singapore,\" added the minister.\n\nThe area around Shangri-La Hotel had been placed under a tight security net, given that it was hosting a major security summit attended by defence ministers and security chiefs.\n\nAt around 4.30am at a highly secured checkpoint along Ardmore Park, three Singaporean men in a red Subaru Impreza defied orders to allow police to check the boot of the car.\n\nInstead, the 34-year-old driver tried to make a run for it and crashed the car through the barricades. \"Despite police warnings to stop, the driver continued to crash through police barricades, endangering the lives of the officers.

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. It was the first time in seven years that police have had to open fire, with the last incident - involving a knife-wielding man who continued to advance on an officer at Outram Park MRT station - occurring in 2008.\n\nThe two passengers, aged 26 and 31, were arrested. The latter was wounded and taken to hospital. Police later searched the vehicle and found a bag containing a white powdery substance - believed to be drugs - and drug paraphernalia.\n\nThe police yesterday said two of the men, including the driver, were wanted by the authorities, but added little more, declining to answer queries on their identities or how many shots were fired.\n\nThe Shangri-La Hotel was locked down briefly in the wake of the incident.

It highlights the value that older employees can bring to the workforce.\n\nThe committee was set up in 2005 to help older workers stay employed longer, and it also aims to change perceptions of them.\n\nHow important is it to retain employees?\n\nFrom the day we employ our workers, more than 90 per cent of them are likely to stay on as employees. Maybe 5 per cent or 10 per cent will become bosses and employ their own workers.\n\nWhen they come to work for us, it is our job to make sure that they really enjoy themselves here, find a career here, and the company must take care of them.\n\nMy employees here are mostly familiar only with wallpaper. If tomorrow, something happens to Goodrich and they have to leave, their specific skillset will be only about the products.\n\nThey will face the same problem of being discriminated by employers.\n\nThe company must take on the responsibilities from day one: to make sure your workers can stay on with you, and be as happy as possible.\n\nYou prefer to retain your employees but are still open to hiring people new to the business. What are some examples?\n\nWe have someone above 45 who came in. He worked in China for more than 15 years, and came back to Singapore, and it was difficult for him to find a new job.\n\nHe joined us about two years ago. We were trying to fit him into various departments. He used to deal with explosives for products like firecrackers. Those skills had no relevance.\n\nBy some coincidence, we'd just completed our building in China, so we sent him over for experience, and we may post him to China because of his past experience there. He's very familiar with the culture.\n\nIf someone has the right skills, or can offer something I cannot find here, I will definitely employ him or her. Age doesn't play an important role, it's the nature of the work.\n\nHow do you help staff stay employable?\n\nI'm always disappointed when people leave, especially when I'm trying to retain and help them. But after a while, I get used to it and think, if they leave, it's their regret and not mine.\n\nWe have various policies to encourage employability. For young people, for instance, I encourage them to leave. When they come in, we give them training, and if they have to leave for another place, by all means do so, as long as their value has increased.\n\nAnd if they don't find the new company good, they have two chances to return to Goodrich, but no more after that. The other policy is that if you leave us to join a competitor, you can't come back.\n\nThe good thing about old employees is that they understand the business.\n\nI used to hire a cleaner. She'd make the coffee, those sorts of duties, and was with us until the age of 68. Whenever a new staff member went into the kitchen, she'd be the first one to say: \"You're very lucky, you've come to the right place.\"\n\nThat kind of positive thinking can change perceptions a lot. If you come in to a company and someone asks, \"Why are you here when everyone's leaving?\", the next thing you'd do is go through the newspapers to look for another job.\n\nWhat older employees tell new hires is more powerful than what I say. I can tell them to trust me, but it takes time for them to see that.\n\nrachaelb@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nPeople\n\nLabour market", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/22/rbchan11.jpg?VersionId=fhsdyutKqVPIons8TereQR2QDtq82fi4", "alt_text": null}]}

Rows of containers with the gel line the ledges on the sides of the block.\n\nThe trial in Bukit Batok began in December 2013 and the one in Choa Chu Kang started in February. Both are still ongoing.\n\nResidents of the Choa Chu Kang block have endured years of disturbance from flocks of mynahs, said Madam Audrey Hoy, 56, a counsellor. \"The droppings were all over, and the birds would fly into my bedroom,\" she said.\n\nThe situation worsens during sunset at about 7pm each day, when the birds fly back to the blocks or neighbouring trees to roost for the night, Madam Hoy said. \"Sometimes, I still have clothes out and they fly all over them and soil them.\"\n\nAnother resident, student Nurul Ain Azhar, 23, said it can get quite disgusting as the droppings are splashed all over the walls of the building's facade.\n\nThe gel has been used in Japan for more than 10 years and was brought in by KSPA Singapore at the end of 2013.\n\nThe product typically takes about a month to become effective, based on current trials, Mr Ignatius Chua, chief operating officer of KSPA Singapore, told The Straits Times.\n\nAbout 20g of the gel is placed in each of the containers, which are about 20cm apart. They have holes at the bottom to prevent stagnant water from collecting and mosquitoes from breeding.\n\n\"The birds will still keep coming back initially because they have the mindset that the place is their roosting space,\" Mr Chua said. \"It is only after a few times that they realise they keep smelling the same odour and decide it is no longer the place to go back to.\"\n\nHe added that the gel does not wash away with water or melt under the sun, and should last for at least three years.\n\nThe gel is non-toxic and does not harm the birds, he added.\n\nBesides the gel, other bird-control methods are being tested and reviewed, said a spokesman for the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA), which oversees bird-control measures here.\n\nCurrently, town councils and the National Parks Board selectively prune trees to temporarily deter birds from roosting. Bird-control companies engaged also use a mix of tools, including spikes, nets and chemical-laced baits.\n\nThe National Environment Agency works with cleaning contractors to ensure the timely disposal of food scraps, which may attract birds at food centres and coffee shops. The AVA also clamps down on the feeding of pigeons, which has been banned since 1973. Those caught flouting the rules are fined up to $500.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Block 755 in Choa Chu Kang said the bird problem has eased somewhat in the last month, but they are unsure if this is because of the gel.\n\n\"It has been over two months since the block was painted and the walls still look clean - hardly any droppings,\" said Ms Nurul.\n\nsamboh@sph.com.sg", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/01/ST_20150601_SBBIRD01A_1366748e_2x.jpg?VersionId=EbG_ayFzFocwAzCyv_rO13OV7b3BjR1b", "alt_text": "As part of the trial, rows of containers with the gel to keep birds at bay have been placed along the ledges of Block 755 in Choa Chu Kang North 5, where residents have endured years of disturbance from flocks of mynahs.

It is an offshoot of the original Bayswater eatery and is set up here with a group of local partners.\n\nThe second, London Fat Duck, which opened in Scotts Square 11/2 weeks ago, is a joint venture between two local food and beverage groups, Akashi and Fei Siong.\n\nOne would assume that Four Seasons, being by the original eatery, would win this battle of the ducks easily. However, there is a twist to the tale: The local outlet uses ducks from the Netherlands and Bangkok, not the British ducks served in London. London Fat Duck uses ducks from an Irish farm.\n\nSo which has the better roast duck? My answer - after tasting the ducks twice at each eatery - is London Fat Duck.\n\nThe bird ($26 for half a duck) does not boast a crisp skin, but the tender and juicy meat has a robust flavour that I don't find in other ducks I have eaten here. And it is not at all gamey.\n\nA layer of fat under the skin adds an aroma to the meat that reminds me of Hong Kong roast goose. If the chef can manage to crisp the skin, this will definitely be the best roast duck in town.\n\nThe version at Four Seasons ($36 for half), however, pales in comparison, on top of being much more expensive. There is hardly any flavour in the meat, while the skin is just as limp.\n\nIts saving grace is the delicious sauce that is poured over it prior to serving. A blend of duck juices, oils and soya sauce, it is tasty and fragrant and tastes best spooned over steaming white rice. It helps to take your attention from the bland-tasting meat.\n\nBut you don't go to either restaurant just to eat duck. So what other dishes should you order?\n\nAt Four Seasons, I would suggest a combination platter of Crispy Pork Belly and Soya Chicken ($28). The roast pork has an interesting contrast of moist, juicy meat and crispy crackling that I like. And the soya chicken is smooth and fragrant from the superior soya sauce used for the poaching.\n\nThe House Special \"Pei-pa\" Beancurd ($28) is good too. The deep-fried, round tofu balls taste of sweet seafood and come stir-fried with assorted vegetables such as carrot slices, peas, shimeji mushrooms and cloud fungus in tasty oyster sauce.\n\nRound off the meal with the Lotus Leaf Fried Rice ($28), which also boasts the delicious flavour of good soya sauce and good wok hei.\n\nOther dishes I have tried, such as Fried Crispy Chicken ($28 for half), Lotus Root Minced Pork ($28) and Toffee Apple ($14), are nothing to shout about.\n\nLONDON FAT DUCK\n\nB1-16/17 Scotts Square, 6 Scotts Road, tel: 6443-7866 (no reservations)\n\nOpen: 11am to 10pm (weekday), 10am to 10pm (weekend)\n\nFood: ***\n\nService: **\u00bd\n\nAmbience: **\u00bd\n\nPrice: $30 to $40 a person\n\nFOUR SEASONS CHINESE RESTAURANT\n\n02-27/28/29 Capitol Piazza, 13 Stamford Road, tel: 6702-1838\n\nOpen: 11am to 10.30pm daily\n\nFood: ***\n\nService: **\n\nAmbience: ***\n\nPrice: Budget from $60 a person\n\nOver at London Fat Duck, the choices are more limited. Besides roast meats, there are just noodle and congee items, as well as a selection of dim sum.\n\nThe duck items are the ones to try. Besides the roast, you should order the Signature Black Pepper London Duck Bun ($4.80 for three). The crispy bun is modelled after famous dim sum eatery Tim Ho Wan's char siew bao, but the filling is made with duck instead of pork. And the pepper in the sauce gives it a nice, fiery kick. The crust of the bun is coloured a mysterious grey, thanks to charcoal powder.\n\nOther items on the menu are run-of-the-mill, though. The meat in the Braised Beef Brisket Noodle ($7.80) is not tender enough and the Seafood Congee \"Ting Zai\" Style ($6.80) is bland.\n\nDim sum items such as Shrimp In Beancurd Skin Fritters ($5.20) and Steamed Shrimp Dumplings ($5.80) are decent, but not outstanding.\n\nSo I would suggest you go to London Fat Duck for the roast duck and duck bun. And to Four Seasons for the roast pork and soya chicken, as well as the beancurd and fried rice.\n\nAs for the rest of the dishes, order them to fill your tummy.

A woodwind quartet, placed on the illuminated gallery, pondered on its significance, only to be posed with further questions. This music-as-theatre piece of symbolism, performed with confidence and no little sensitivity, seemed to ask of this ensemble: Where do we go from here?\n\nMaybe the most obvious answer was Max Bruch's very popular First Violin Concerto, with Christina Zhou as guest soloist. Her entry in the Vorspiel (\"foreplay\" or prelude) was clarity itself, forthright if not totally commanding, and this spelt out the conduct of the performance. She coaxed a sweet but not over-cloying tone and was lyrically disposed, which came through winningly in the slow movement.\n\nHer technique held up well in the faster outer movements, but came close to crisis in the finale when a tuning peg suddenly loosened. The orchestra played on while she re-tuned her violin in a tutti and joined in quite seamlessly to close the work in a blazing triumph.\n\nHer coolness in the face of extreme duress is a testament to true musicianship and fortitude.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Credit goes to conductor Tan's steady, no-nonsense leadership which would withstand the acid test in the concert's main work, Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.\n\nThe slow introduction to the opening movement was taken boldly and steadily, leading to the explosive Allegro which immediately established this young orchestra's ambition and credentials.\n\nIts responsiveness to the conductor's cues was spot on, and this continued in the second movement's variations which was well-paced and tidily laid out.\n\nBrash enthusiasm, so characteristic of novice groups, was not on the cards.\n\nThis ensemble of recent music graduates and students was capable of subtlety and nuance too. The last two movements, which led to Wagner's description of the work as the \"apotheosis of the dance\", were thrillingly dispatched. Fuelled by adrenaline, the players seemed to have boundless reserve as they tackled and overcame its hurdles head on and at blinding full speed.\n\nAfter its breathless conclusion, conductor Tan was gifted with a bottle of bubbly instead of the obligatory bouquet.\n\nBack to the unanswered question: where does ACO go from here?\n\nThe easiest answer: Its next concert, with Mozart and Prokofiev, takes place on 16 August. Another musical treat beckons.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

Lim Bock Song, 43, had fled to the station after stabbing his drinking buddy to death at a nearby hawker centre. He was spotted by Staff Sergeant Azli Othman and another officer at about 3.25pm.\n\nLim drew his knife and advanced towards the staff sergeant, ignoring the officer even after he drew his revolver and warned him to stop. He charged at Staff Sgt Azli, who shot him in the chest.\n\nThe single shot drew screams from several commuters, some of whom tried to get away by running up the escalators and stairs.\n\nIn 2010, a coroner's inquiry found that the shooting was justified. Closed-circuit television footage in the station showed that Staff Sgt Azli had little time to react to Lim's aggressive behaviour and could have been fatally stabbed, said the state coroner.\n\n2. 2002\n\nA 42-year-old motorcycle thief was shot after lunging at four policemen with a knife in a carpark at Mount Alvernia Hospital.

When police checked on him, he tried to attack them with the rod, and kept charging despite being shot the first time.

To that end, there should be an immediate and lasting halt to land reclamation by all claimants,\" Mr Carter said on Saturday at the same forum with Adm Sun and his delegation in the audience.\n\n\"We also oppose any further militarisation of disputed features,\" he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that other claimants have developed outposts of differing scope and degree, including Vietnam with 48, the Philippines with eight, Malaysia with five and Taiwan with one.\n\n\"Yet, one country has gone much farther and much faster than any other.\n\n\"China has reclaimed over 2,000 acres, more than all other claimants combined and more than in the entire history of the region.

Reporting of shootings by police agencies is voluntary.\n\nBut the Post's analysis indicates the daily death toll for 2015 is close to 2.6 as of Friday. At that pace, police will have shot and killed nearly 1,000 people by the end of the year, the paper said.\n\nThe Post's analysis showed that about half the victims were white, half minority. Among unarmed victims, two-thirds were black or Hispanic.\n\nBased on census numbers for the areas where the killings took place, blacks were killed at three times the rate of whites or other minorities.\n\nThe victims ranged in age from 16 to 83. More than 80 per cent were armed with potentially lethal objects, mostly guns. Ninety-two victims were identified as mentally ill.\n\nPolice are authorised to use deadly force when they fear for their lives or the lives of others. Three of the 385 fatal shootings have resulted in an officer being charged with a crime.\n\nCurrent and former police chiefs and other criminal justice officials told the Post police must begin to accept responsibility for the killings. They said that many deaths could be blamed on poor policing.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nPolice\n\nLaw enforcement", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/POLICE456e_2x.jpg?VersionId=vA4LuIjHq2xxn38EbZWS9VR6o7wW3ssV", "alt_text": "Police place evidence markers at spots where shell casings have been found at the scene of a shooting at the intersection of West North Avenue and Druid Hill Avenue in West Baltimore, Maryland on May 30, 2015. -- PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

The second is far bigger, yet cannot be seen. It is the medal target of his team.\n\nFor Singapore's shooting contingent, the target is six golds at the upcoming SEA Games, which would signal a return to the sport's past successes.\n\nAnd just like their demeanour on the shooting range, the Republic shooters are poised, calm and confident of hitting the target.\n\nDespite the fact that nearly a third of the 29-strong squad are making their Games debut, all are tipped to contribute.\n\n\"They are expected to deliver. Nobody goes to the major Games just for experience,\" said the Singapore Shooting Association's high performance chief, Thomas Soo.\n\nIn 2007, the Republic's shooters hauled in a record 20 SEA Games medals - including eight golds - from 33 events in Korat, doubling their 10-medal tally from the 2005 Manila Games.\n\nIn 2009, with no trap or skeet competitions, the shooters still clinched an impressive six golds. However in the last two Games, with even fewer contested events, they could garner only a solitary gold each time.\n\nThis time around, it is back up to 26 events, half of which are team categories where Singapore usually nab their medals - 24 of their 58 medals in the past decade came from team events.\n\nAlso returning are the trap and skeet competitions, which offer a total of four golds. The Republic has entered a six-man contingent - including 2005 and 2007 gold medallists Choo Choon Seng and Mohd Zain Amat - for these.\n\nDespite their long absence from the Games, skeet shooter David Chan said that participation in various regional invitationals and the annual South-east Asia Shooting Championships has allowed them to keep an eye on competitors in the small, close-knit community.\n\nThe 42-year-old is also confident of his team-mates doing well for the team events. He describes how even those shooters doing well individually tend to shoot with their team-mates in mind.\n\nAs he puts it: \"Who knows, my hitting an extra target could be making up for my team-mate missing his.\"\n\nAs for the rifle and pistol disciplines, they are a mainstay at the Games, and Singapore's representatives are eager for an improved showing this month.\n\nSeasoned sharpshooter Jasmine Ser feels better prepared this year after having more time to train, recover and improve her mental game after receiving the Sports Excellence scholarship in late 2013.\n\nThe award enabled her to train full-time.\n\nPreviously, she had been balancing training with her undergraduate studies. Nowadays, she trains twice daily.\n\n\"I didn't waste time; I used every bit that I could,\" she said. \"Not just for training, but to recover and relax... to sit down and think carefully and catch a breath.\"\n\nIn her attempt to qualify for a second Olympics, Ser has been fine-tuning her skills at a series of international meets.\n\nShe will return home only tomorrow, after spending nearly a month overseas - first as part of the 13-strong Singapore squad for the World Cup in Fort Benning in the United States, then continuing solo for the subsequent Germany leg.\n\nGiven that medal expectations weigh heavily on her shoulders, the extra time has been precious.\n\nEven so, she refuses to entertain thoughts of winning gold yet.\n\n\"The nature of shooting and the competition itself is so intense that your focus has to be on your own muscles,\" the 25-year-old said. \"Just a slight twitch and you will get a bad shot.\"\n\nchingyl@sph.com.sg", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/01/ST_20150601_SPT10SERA_1358102e_2x.jpg?VersionId=45S22Ir8D6vLmY7LDXe85UalLz4SrgtS", "alt_text": null}]}

But critics deride the proposal as \"fake democracy\" because it sticks to a ruling by China that candidates must first be approved by a loyalist committee.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said on Sunday they had made no progress after meeting top Beijing officials in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. The meeting was widely seen as the last chance for compromise before Hong Kong lawmakers vote on the political reform package in June. It needs a two-thirds majority to pass and pro-democracy lawmakers make up more than a third of the legislature.\n\n\"We came here... trying to find a way out of the impasse,\" Civic Party leader Alan Leong told reporters after the four-hour meeting, which was attended by 14 out of 27 pro-democracy lawmakers as well as 40 pro-Beijing legislators and the city's current leader Leung Chun Ying.\n\n\"We are left with an unequivocal conclusion that the Central People's Government is not going to yield,\" Mr Leong said. \"We are therefore left with no choice but to definitely veto the government proposal.\"\n\nMr Wang Guangya, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the Chinese State Council or Cabinet, said it was \"unfortunate\" that the democrats were uniting to stop the plan.\n\n\"The other side behaved like a bloc, holding on to their strict position... I don't think it's constructive or healthy,\" he said after the meeting.\n\nMr Wang said lawmakers have a \"historic responsibility\" to cast their vote \"with conscience\".\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr Wang had said that any election plan would have to stick to Beijing's ruling.\n\nAnother Beijing official, Mr Li Fei, said the vote would test whether democrats are loyal to the principle of \"one country, two systems\" under which Hong Kong is ruled, local media reported.\n\nMr Li also warned during the meeting that lawmakers could be \"punished\" by voters for vetoing the plan, the South China Morning Post reported on its website.\n\nBeijing's restrictions, announced last August, sparked more than two months of mass rallies that brought main roads in parts of the city to a standstill late last year.\n\nHong Kong was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 but is largely self-governing and enjoys freedoms not seen on the mainland.\n\nSee more on\n\nHong Kong\n\nChina\n\nReforms", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/HongKongBanner310515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=qlrkaZvmVbJenI4rbZvDciEQDKH4rFBH", "alt_text": "Pro-democracy protesters take turns to speak as they stand behind a huge banner in Hong Kong on May 31, 2015, before a rally to commemorate the 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, prior to the incident's 26th anniversary on June 4.

Therefore, landlords are more easily convinced to let telcos install more equipment, the companies said.\n\nAs early as January, M1, StarHub and Singtel started rolling out 4G small cells to boost network capacity, effectively doubling the speed of surfing in some buildings.\n\nFor instance, at the Basement One level of Paragon mall in Orchard Road, where M1 last month installed three small cells, 4G speeds for its customers have doubled to around 100Mbps.\n\n\"We need to bring up surfing speeds indoor to the same level as outdoor as people tend to congregate in foodcourts and cafes, resulting in high demand for mobile data there,\" said M1 chief operating officer Patrick Scodeller.\n\nOver the next two years, busy buildings such as nex and Clementi Mall, as well as train platforms in Orchard Road, Raffles Place and Jurong East, among others, will also get a 4G speed boost, Mr Scodeller said.\n\nThe investment is part of M1's yearly $120 million allocated for network upgrades.\n\nSpecifically, 4G small cells are less than one-tenth the size of a traditional base station, which looks like a refrigerator, and can be mounted on the ceiling to save space. They can be installed in two to three days, compared with the three to four weeks required for a traditional base station.\n\nStarHub in January fitted Marina Bay Sands with small cells, doubling typical 4G surfing speeds to 230Mbps.\n\nSome 40 high-traffic commercial buildings and malls, including VivoCity, nex, Ion Orchard and Tampines 1, will also be getting a 4G speed boost by the end of next year.\n\n\"The range of radio transmission is often limited indoors, thus data speeds are lower than outdoors,\" said StarHub chief technology officer Mock Pak Lum.\n\nLast month, Singtel installed additional 4G capacity at The Seletar Mall, VivoCity and Marina Bay Sands' foodcourt area. It said it will continue to roll out 4G small cells in high-traffic locations, including in nex, but would not reveal typical surfing speeds.\n\nSenior analyst Clement Teo of US-based market research firm Forrester said telcos are investing to boost 4G surfing speeds indoors for better video streaming, for instance, as there are commercial incentives to do so.\n\n\"The more mobile data users download, the more they pay,\" he said, adding that 4G small-cell technologies have also matured significantly to convince telcos to make the investment.\n\nEvents project consultant Roy Nahar, 35, said he looks forward to the upgrade. \"I hope surfing slowdowns due to network congestion will no longer happen,\" he said.\n\nitham@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\n4G mobile", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/01/IMG7599e_2x.jpg?VersionId=YJnLNj8xLtaT5Fo.NlV6h5dhg52gWQdz", "alt_text": "A traditional 4G base station which is much bigger compared to the new 4G base stations. -- ST PHOTO: IRENE THAM"}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/01/IMG7596e_2x.jpg?VersionId=99en_6WY4Bjj6KdQlJghJ0EaXf9Or_.G", "alt_text": null}]}

What I have been asked by at least 30 friends, is: \"Did you cry?\".\n\nYou see, I have a reputation for tearing up and turning into a blubber bag at any time, when least expected - or appropriate. At a cremation service for a good friend's father, I cried more than any of the family members.\n\nAs for my 24-year-old daughter's wedding, the \"Did you cry\" question was just the start. When I replied, \"No\", disbelieving friends followed up with \"Don't bluff\", \"I am sure you did\" or \"No need to be shy about it\".\n\nIn fact, at the ceremony and reception, I was on the verge of tears many times. I choked with emotion. I felt my lips quiver. As I made my father-of-the-bride speech, my notes turned blurry. But I did not cry.\n\nMy stoic Dad performance is getting me no Oscars, though. Worse, women friends end their conversation with: \"My husband will surely cry when our daughter gets married,\" which I interpret as: \"My husband is not like you, he cares a lot for our daughter, is very close to her and will surely cry when she gets married.\"\n\nSuddenly, after being embarrassed all my life about being a chronic crier, I find myself fighting to retain my title.\n\nFailing to display my paternal devotion by being a wedding weeper is only part of the bridal blues.\n\nThe main reason: I feel guilty because of how relieved I am that Natasha has finally gotten hitched.\n\nIt wasn't that I was happy to get her off my hands. In fact, it was just the opposite. Ever since Natasha was 13, she has said: \"Dad, I want to get married and have kids.\" And so, for many years, I had felt helpless. When your children ask for things, you want to help make it happen. Yet, the marriage rates for women have been falling, and the numbers of singles, rising.\n\nAlso, in encouraging my daughter to pursue a degree, I was upping her chances of singlehood. Singapore statistics show that the chances of marriage for higher-educated women are slimmer.\n\nI was at a wedding last weekend and bumped into an old friend, who said: \"Congrats, Matt. I heard your daughter got married.\" He added: \"I am waiting my turn.\"\n\nHis daughter, in her mid-20s, was beside him. She gave me a wave. So I asked: \"And when is she getting married?\"\n\n\"She was going out with someone for many years and they broke off and now she is not seeing anybody,\" he said matter-of-factly, and sighed.\n\nI felt for him. I knew exactly what that sigh meant.\n\nBut now, for me there is no cause to sigh - just cry. Oh, what lengths I went to, to avoid that.\n\nI even went to the wikiHow website to look for tips on how not to cry. (Tip: Don't look at your daughter during the wedding service - once she starts crying, you will, too.)\n\nIt was particularly hard at the church rehearsal on the eve of the ceremony, when tender images of my daughter as a baby, nestled like a koala in my arms, flashed through my mind.\n\nI wondered: \"Does she know that nothing can beat a father's love for his daughter, does she really want to step out of dad's protective hands?\"\n\nBut the next day, as I watched Natasha and her groom exchange vows, I knew she had found my replacement. She had found the right guy.\n\nIt was bittersweet, but it was a relief. Inside, I shed a tear.\n\nmatt@sph.com.sg\n\nWhat were your feelings when your child got married?

I then played a great 3-wood in the playoff but then I have to say my heart was in my mouth when I saw my putt starting to horse-shoe.\n\n\"But then to see it drop was one the best moments in my career.\" There was the added bonus for Kjeldsen of securing a place in July's Open Championship at St. Andrews.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Mississippi is considering road barricades and planning biosecurity measures. Iowa is trying to figure out how to deal with a mountain of dead - and reeking - chickens.\n\nFederal health experts are hopeful that the virulent bird flu that has devastated Midwestern poultry farms in recent months has reached its peak and will taper off as the weather warms. But worried state officials aren't taking chances.\n\nFears that the virus, which has led to the deaths of nearly 45 million birds in 16 American states and Canada, could come roaring back in the fall, when temperatures cool, have agriculture officials across the US preparing for the worst.\n\nEven states that haven't been hit yet are taking no chances.\n\n\"We're better safe than sorry,\" said Dr Robert Cobb, state veterinarian for Georgia, the nation's leading producer of chickens raised for meat, which has not had any cases so far.\n\n\"All the research I've been able to find is showing that this virus could likely stick around for years.\"\n\nAfter a backyard flock in northeastern Indiana tested positive in early May - the state's first case of the virus - Indiana's State Board of Animal Health banned all bird shows at county fairs this summer, following similar moves in Iowa, Minnesota and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe board and other state agencies also began planning what they would need in the event of a wider outbreak, including portable toilets and protective gear for personnel.\n\nAnd they asked the Department of Corrections to begin training non-violent offenders to help with any culls needed.\n\nIn late May, the first group of 50 inmates were fit-tested for respirators, and began training on how to safely remove chickens from cages and transfer them to an enclosed cart used to asphyxiate the birds.\n\nDenise Derrer, spokesman for the state board of animal health, said crews of low-level offenders have also helped with state recovery efforts after floods and tornadoes and will be used in the event of a wider outbreak.\n\n\"We can't count on warm weather killing off this virus,\"Ms Derrer said.\n\nTo the south, Mississippi State Veterinarian Jim Watson, whose state has so far escaped the outbreak, is prepping for the virus to arrive later this year or in early 2016. He and his team have discussed road barricades, biosecurity and the possibility of declaring a state of emergency.\n\nThe team has purchased a second foam-based system, used to spray inside infected barns and suffocate birds.\n\n\"We're on the Mississippi River, so there's going to have to be geese and ducks that are contaminated coming down that flyway,\" Mr Watson said. \"Even though we have very few chicken farms on the water, those birds are going to stray all over the state during hunting season.\"\n\nWhile the outbreak does appear to be slowing in the Midwest, where most of the 44.6 million affected birds have been located, outbreak spikes can be difficult to spot quickly in the federal data.\n\nThe USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reports cases that its labs confirm, but these numbers often come days or weeks after state agencies have identified and reported probable cases.\n\nJust a day after USDA Chief Veterinary Officer John Clifford told Reuters last week that the agency believed the worst was over, Nebraska announced that a new egg farm with 3 million hens had tested positive. Iowa also reported another outbreak, resulting in the need to cull 1 million more birds.\n\nThe uncertainty led Alabama veterinary officials to meet with Governor Robert J Bentley's staff to outline bird flu response options. The groups were in agreement, said State Veterinarian Tony Frazier, that Alabama, the third largest producer of broiler chickens, couldn't afford take a wait-and-see approach.\n\nEven if the outbreak is waning for now, cleanup is far from over.\n\nOn Friday, the USDA said it wanted to hire more federal contractors \"due to the size and scope\" of the outbreak. The USDA and Iowa have contracts with three landfills in the state, including one with a large incinerator, to help speed up culling, bird disposal and barn clean-up.\n\nFor locals, help can't come soon enough. In Sioux Center, Iowa, neighbors of an infected Center Fresh Group egg-laying facility told Reuters the stench of dead birds was making them sick.\n\n\"We can't live here,\" said John Fuoss, who said he vomited from the smell of dead chickens and manure used as compost on a nearby field. \"My head's ready to explode.\" And it will take time for residents of afflicted areas to believe the crisis is past.\n\nKatie Olthoff's family has stopped riding bikes around a lake close to their home near Stanhope, Iowa, out of fear their tires could come into contact with water-fowl feces contaminated with the virus. The family, which raises more than 100,000 turkeys a year, is also staying away from the zoo and from friends who have backyard poultry flocks.\n\nThe family, Ms Olthoff said, now assumes \"that wherever we go, the entire environment is contaminated.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCanada\n\nUS news", "images": []}

Another is the rise of households with married couples who are childless or not living with their children. Whither the nuclear family with two or more generations under one roof?\n\nThe traditional family structure is still dominant but its proportion has declined - from 56 per cent in 2000 to 49 per cent last year. That matters as the longstanding basis of care and support of individuals - the young, aged and infirm - is the strength of the immediate family and, to an extent, the soundness of extended family ties.\n\nShould kinship platforms wither and other options are sought increasingly, society will come up against the practical limits of state welfare financed by taxes (a growing burden upon a shrinking base of workers), and of safety nets offered by voluntary welfare organisations (whose resources will be stretched by competing needs).\n\nFamily changes are inevitable, given the confluence of various trends, some long in the making and others recent. Biological and tribal links were key when survival and child-rearing needs ranked supreme.\n\nAs broad structures for collective security, education and healthcare emerged, family transition was marked. And as women became breadwinners too, man-woman and parent-child relations were affected. Low fertility (fuelled by socio-economic and cultural changes), low mortality (aided by modern science), and wealth accumulation (a result of sustained economic growth) also reshaped the family, impinging on gender equity, forms of partnership, and intergenerational relations.\n\nThus, ideological pluralism for some nations is less a matter of choice than one of necessity - with recent marriages at greater risk of failing, more marriages involving foreign spouses, same-sex relationships, and role reversals - for example, instances of seniors still supporting their grown children in some way.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it would be too much to expect the formation of a family policy framework here that is explicit, neat and comprehensive.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It did not elaborate.\n\nKwon said part of the success had been in diversifying crops, with wheat, barley and potatoes planted after the fall rice harvest.\n\nMr Isaczai said farmers had no choice but to diversify, because it was too dry to plant rice.\n\nMr Daniel Pinkston of the International Crisis Group told Reuters in Singapore that the North was \"living on the edge\".\n\n\"They might have had four, five decent years of decent output but you need only one disaster, one flood or one El Nino pattern that could have a negative impact,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nNorth Korea\n\nDroughts\n\nAgriculture/farming", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/nabmNKOREA31515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=GSPFEwsv5377J6NgRngawzIuMiiePvMS", "alt_text": "This undated photo released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on May 30, 2015 shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (centre) visiting the general tree nursery under construction by the Korean People's Army.&nbsp;&nbsp;North"}]}

But little was done to ensure its protection from the next raid. Such was the barrenness of Indian strategic thinking and the nation's abiding faith in the gods.\n\nThat sense of fatalism and complacency continued into the late 1950s, when the newly independent nation's ties with China began to fray, leading to a crushing military defeat in the 1962 war over their Himalayan border. The shock led to a rapid re-arming of India, complete with a nuclear programme, that has pushed it into the ranks of Asia's big powers, giving it an increasing capacity to project power beyond its immediate neighbourhood.\n\nEven so, India was content to remain a reactive power, keener to be loved than feared.\n\nAs recently as a decade ago, when a devastating tsunami wrecked many installations in its Andaman & Nicobar Island chain, the government, ignoring suggestions from its military, avoided using the rebuilding opportunity to beef up defence installations along the strategic island chain. It figured that doing so would cause concern in South-east Asia and spark a response from China, always nervous about the Malacca Straits being a choke point.\n\nThings are changing though and two recent events highlight how rapidly India is turning into a proactive power. The Look East policy of old has turned into an Act East policy and Mr Modi is making good on his word.\n\nThe devastating April earthquake in landlocked Nepal, and the promptness with which India responded with its army and air force, showcased the trigger reflexes of the Modi government and the capabilities it could bring to bear in an emergency.\n\nAnd, from a strategic point of view, last week's inking of a \"vision document\" by the Indian and Vietnamese defence ministers - a paper that both have chosen to keep secret - underscores how far afield India now sees its sphere of influence, never mind whose backyard it may enter in the process. New Delhi is also swiftly building strategic ties with the Philippines, which is locked in a maritime dispute with China.\n\nOn May 18 an Indian defence ministry release noted that four ships of its Eastern Fleet - including a guided missile stealth frigate and its latest anti-submarine warfare corvette - were on \"operational deployment to South Indian Ocean and South China Sea\".\n\nMeanwhile, a confluence of circumstances, led by worries over China's increasingly assertive external posture, has placed India in a strategic sweet spot, at ease with and courted by a host of powers, including the US, Japan and Russia. This year, India will send its two aircraft carriers and other modern ships to join frontline ships from the US Pacific Command in their biggest joint exercise. Japan also will join the annual wargames, called Exercise Malabar. Increasingly, the term being used by military men and strategists is \"an Indo-Asia-Pacific region\".\n\nMeanwhile, the India-Japan strategic partnership is growing apace. India is likely to be the first nation to receive the ShinMaywa US-2 specialised seaplane as Japan takes its first tentative steps in the arms export trade.\n\nThe US-2 will be a force multiplier for India because it would be able to quickly inject troops into areas where there are no landing strips on shore.\n\n\"An Indo-Pacific definition of Asia lends further legitimacy to India's growing role as a strategic actor in East Asia,\" the International Institute for Strategic Studies said in its latest Asia-Pacific Regional Security Assessment. \"It also offers an intellectual rationale for a stronger US-India relationship.\"\n\nIn January, US President Barack Obama paid an unprecedented second visit to New Delhi, this time as chief guest at the nation's Republic Day celebrations. The summit's notable outcome was a US-India joint strategic vision statement that spoke of partnering on issues stretching from Africa to East Asia.\n\nMost significantly, it affirmed \"the importance of safeguarding maritime security and ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight throughout the region, especially in the South China Sea\".\n\nSuch a bold tilt to America would have been unthinkable a decade ago in India.\n\n\"Modi's foreign policy is geared to move India from its long-held non-alignment to a contemporary, globalised practicality,\" says strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney. \"A multi-aligned India also will not shy away from building strategic partnerships with countries around China's periphery to counter its India-containment strategy.\"\n\nStill, some of India's moves are aimed not so much at checkmating China as pressuring it to drop its assertiveness on the troubled border and lie low in India's backyard.\n\nIndia and Bhutan are the only two nations with which China has outstanding land boundary disputes, Beijing having settled with a dozen other nations on fairly generous terms. Eighteen rounds of border talks between Special Representatives of China and India yielded only limited results.\n\nEarlier this month, paying a return visit to China, Mr Modi, unusually for an Indian leader, publicly confronted the Chinese leadership on the issues that divide them, even as he stroked them on a variety of other fronts.\n\n\"We covered all issues, including those that trouble smooth development of our relations,\" Mr Modi said in his statement.\n\n\"I stressed the need for China to reconsider its approach on some of the issues that hold us back from realising the full potential of our partnership. I suggested that China should take a strategic and long-term view of our relations.\"\n\nAt the same time, India has halved the size of a new mountain strike corps specially raised for the China border - a friendly gesture. Likewise, not wanting to show his hand, Mr Modi declined an invitation to address this year's Shangri-La Dialogue, instead sending the junior defence minister.\n\nIt is too early to say how China and the wider region will react to India's mixed messaging. But clearly, after a long period of inertia, there are active minds at work in New Delhi and the fruit of their toils is only just coming into view.\n\nvelloor@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nIndia\n\nNarendra Modi\n\nForeign policy\n\nIndia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/26/leaders260615.jpg?VersionId=S12h36zwkSH6LL.miKCY8uBDY22QxseI", "alt_text": null}]}

The festival falls on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, which is June 20 this year.\n\nIt commemorates the death of a famous Chinese poet called Qu Yuan, who is said to have drowned himself in a river to protest government corruption. Villagers threw rice dumplings into the river as food to prevent fish from eating his body.\n\nBusinesses that SundayLife! spoke to say that demand for traditional rice dumplings is still strong, with sales increasing up to five-fold in the lead-up to the Dragon Boat Festival. Most of the customers are middle-aged.\n\nMr Lim Cheng Hwee, 50, managing director of the Eastern Rice Dumpling chain, says: \"These people have registered the taste and look of traditional dumplings that they grew up with, and may not accept new forms.\"\n\nHe adds that while the company has diversified its flavours, coming up with versions such as black pepper chicken and brown jasmine rice to cater to the health-conscious crowd in the past three years, these newer varieties only make up 5 per cent of its daily production of up to 4,000 dumplings. His brother-in-law, Mr Low Hong Peng, 61, who co-owns the Daun Pandan Rice Dumpling chain, which sells up to 3,000 dumplings daily, says the Dragon Boat Festival is primarily celebrated by the older generation.\n\nHe says: \"Most youngsters are not aware of this festival as it is not an official public holiday.\"\n\nMr Richard Lim, 58, a second-generation owner of Hiong Kee Dumplings in Hong Lim Food Centre, thinks that the newfangled rice dumpling flavours are a gimmick to attract diners.\n\n\"Pork, chestnuts and mushrooms make the best flavour combination and it has lasted for hundreds of years. There is no point in changing something that has been proven to work.\"\n\nThe former hotel cook took over his mother's street stall in Hokkien Street in 1982, and says that some people \"buy those seasonal fanciful dumplings from hotels\" to impress friends and business clients.\n\nMadam Yeoh Min Lin, 76, of Hainan Cuisine & Snacks in Toa Payoh Lorong 7, wants to preserve and showcase the rare dialect cuisine by selling up to 400 Hainanese-style rice dumplings made only in the three weeks leading up to the Dragon Boat Festival.\n\nShe says: \"Hainanese delicacies are usually kept within families. By selling them, people who used to grew up with Hainanese friends and neighbours can relive their memories of this festive food.\"\n\nWhile traditional dumplings are receiving healthy sales, some business owners point out that a lack of manpower prevents them from boosting production and introducing more flavours. Some businesses use industrial-size machines to marinate and fry the fillings in bulk, but the nifty skill of wrapping the parcels with bamboo or pandan leaves can only be done by hand.\n\nHiong Kee's Mr Lim says that the number of dumplings produced is dependent on his staff strength.\n\nHe says: \"My main worry is the continuity of the business, as my workers are getting old with no one to pass their skills to.\" He adds that young people are turned off by the hard work. He starts frying the ingredients at 6am daily and takes up to seven hours to make a batch of dumplings.\n\nAt Kim Choo Kueh Chang in Joo Chiat Place, Mr Edmond Wong, 32, a third-generation assistant director, says a lean team of 12, including his family members, churns out up to 4,000 dumplings a day during the festive period. He says that it is difficult to get extra help.\n\n\"It can be labour-intensive so we incentivise workers with good pay,\" he says. \"A seasoned dumpling wrapper can earn up to $5,000 a month during the festive period.\" The 70-year-old shop has also been reaching out to a wider range of customers through conducting talks and workshops on Peranakan culture over the past five years, mainly in primary schools.\n\nHe says: \"These talks indirectly contribute to sales of our rice dumplings, as curious school children visit our shop with their families.\"\n\nSingapore permanent residents from China, who live and work here, have become customers too.\n\nDaun Pandan's Mr Low says they make up half of his customers on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival.\n\n\"They celebrate Dragon Boat Festival more elaborately back in their home country, and want to continue the tradition here,\" he says.\n\nBusinesswoman Alice Cheah, 50, who has been buying dumplings from Hoo Kee Bak Chang for the past 18 years, likes that the meat is not too fatty, and the smaller dumplings are not too filling.\n\nShe says: \"I have tried new versions of dumplings, like those with fruit fillings, but I still prefer the traditional ones as they are what they should be.\"\n\nRetired fund manager Tan Swee Leong, 64, who visits Hiong Kee Dumplings three times a week, says: \"The fillings are generous and flavourful. Though they can be pricey, they are worth it as these hawkers have taken a lifetime to perfect their craft.\"\n\nIt is this skill of making rice dumplings that Hoo Kee's Mr Chew hopes to pass on to his 21/2-year-old son in the future.\n\nHe says: \"If I can grow this business further, I would want him to continue it, or else that will be the end of a family tradition.\"\n\nkengohsz@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nDragon boating\n\nChinese food\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service\u200b\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nWin 2x tickets to New Zealand.

She graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a diploma in business studies.\n\nShe says: \"All my siblings were married and they wanted me to get married too. But when I studied the Buddhist teachings closely, I felt that life is more than raising a family and building a career. All these things are impermanent and I will not be able to take them with me when I die.\"\n\nThe path that Ms Choo, who now goes by her ordained name Venerable Shi Fa Xun, took 23 years ago remains uncommon among young Buddhists here today.\n\nThere are no official figures but the BuddhistYouth Network, which provides career coaching and leadership workshops for the 20 or so Buddhist youth groups here, estimates there are only about 15 Singaporean monastics under 40 years old. Most are in their mid- to late-30s. About half are based overseas.\n\nVen Fa Xun, who wrote an honours thesis on why women become nuns for her Bachelor of Arts degree in education at the University of Western Australia, says: \"There are too many distractions for young Singaporeans. In their 20s, they are busy finishing up their studies or building a career. In their 30s, they are busy working and raising a family.\n\n\"It's usually when people find that all these things still don't bring them happiness that they start to consider taking up the monastic path.\"\n\nFrom her own experience, she says \"the good thing about doing it young is that you are more flexible and it is easier to change yourself to cope with monastic life\".\n\nRegardless of their age, however, she feels that Buddhists here are generally not drawn to life in a monastery as they have been conditioned by a capitalist society to climb the social ladder and indulge in sensual pleasures to achieve happiness.\n\nAlso, Chinese Singaporeans are still largely Confucianist in outlook and value having a family, she says.\n\nBuddhist monastics, on the other hand, have to take a vow of celibacy. They are encouraged to live a simple and disciplined lifestyle and have to be contented with basic clothing and shelter.\n\nVen Fa Xun feels that monastics are still misunderstood by society today.\n\nShe says: \"Monastics have often been portrayed as failures or uneducated in literature and popular media. The spiritual motivation behind their decision is often neglected.\n\n\"As a result, Buddhists who wish to pick up the robes often do not get enough support from family and friends.\"\n\nVenerable Jue Fang, 37, is an exception.\n\nWhen she became a nun 14 years ago, soon after she graduated with a degree in economics and maths from the National University of Singapore, she had the full support of her taxi driver father and housewife mother, both staunch Buddhists.\n\n\"I was very lucky,\" says the nun, who has a brother four years younger. She is now the director of international relations at Nan Tien institute in Australia, a tertiary institution which draws on Buddhist teachings.\n\nFor another 41-year-old Singaporean Buddhist monk who declined to be named, it took longer to win the approval of his parents, who practised ancestor worship and were not familiar with Buddhist teachings.\n\nThe youngest of three children was inspired to be a monk after reading Buddhist teachings and seeing his buddy in national service don the robes and the \"serene\" effect that had on him.\n\nHe decided to do the same after he completed his degree in English literature from NUS and worked for a year as a finance officer. He was 25.\n\nGiven the dearth of young monastics, are Buddhist elders worried about who will succeed them? Ven Fa Xun says: \"We can only try our best and let people understand and value monastic life through Buddhist classes and dispel misconceptions that monastics are losers or victims. Ultimately, we cannot force people to take up the robe.

All 41 of those charged have a collective responsibility for the tragedy.\"\n\nPolice announced last year they were set to charge Mr Rana, who was arrested on the western border with India as he tried to flee the country days after the April 24, 2013 factory collapse. But the process was held up after the police needed government approval to frame charges against a dozen government officials included in the 41, a standard requirement in Bangladesh.\n\nPolice will later Sunday submit chargesheets to Dhaka's chief judicial magistrates court, which is expected to officially accept the charges and set a date for a trial.\n\nMr Rana became Bangladesh's public enemy No. 1 after survivors recounted how thousands of them were forced to enter the compound at the start of the working day despite complaints about cracks appearing in the walls.\n\n\"They (Rana and the factory owners) discussed and decided to keep the factory open. They sent the workers to their deaths with cool heads,\" Mr Kar said.\n\nMr Rana and others will also be charged with violating the building code, for illegally extending the six-storey building, which was initially approved as a shopping centre, into a nine-storey factory complex.\n\n\"That illegal extension violating all construction (regulations) was the seed of this massive disaster,\" Mr Kar said.\n\nAmong the others expected to be charged are seven owners of the garment factories and three government engineers who approved the extensions to the building.\n\nThe mayor of Savar industrial town, where the factory was located, along with a local councillor, also face murder charges for ignoring breaches of building and factory laws.\n\nThe disaster highlighted appalling safety problems in Bangladesh's US$25 billion garment industry, the world's second largest after China's.\n\nA host of Western retailers had clothing made at Rana Plaza, including Italy's Benetton, Spain's Mango and the British low-cost chain Primark.\n\nThe disaster prompted sweeping reforms including new safety inspections and higher wages in the industry which employs around four million workers.\n\nSee more on\n\nBangladesh\n\nAccidents\n\nBangladesh", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/RanaPlaza310515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=S_RBlafTFyB8jcotScrQGy7MNETPWAoE", "alt_text": "Memebers of Bangladeshi garments worker union shout slogans as they mark the second anniversary of the Rana Plaza building collapse at the site where the building once stood in Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka on April 24, 2015.

The allegations against his organisation and his colleagues, he thundered, brought \"shame and humiliation\" to the world governing body, while he insisted: \"There can be no place for corruption of any kind.\"\n\nIt is important to remember that Blatter has not been charged with anything, nor has he even been legally implicated in the proceedings against the 14 people who have now been indicted by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). But the severity of the charges against his fellow office-bearers are unprecedented in the annals of any international sporting administration.\n\nAnd what these suspects subsequently reveal in their sworn testimonies will give investigators a clearer image of whether Fifa was run like a squeaky-clean Disney kingdom or if it was a murky fiefdom that tolerated and perpetuated financial wrongdoing. If the latter picture emerges, it will dramatically contradict Blatter's view of himself as a Bambi-like paragon of virtue and propriety.\n\nAccording to US Attorney-General Loretta Lynch, the scope of the operation carried out this week \"spans at least two generations of soccer officials who\u2026 abused their positions of trust to acquire millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks.\"\n\nSo deeply entrenched was the slush-fund culture, said Lynch, that a single Fifa executive is suspected of \"taking more than US$10 million (S$13.5 million) in bribes over a 19-year period\".\n\nSo where exactly does Blatter stand? The answer to that is that there are three possible scenarios.\n\nOne, that he was entirely unaware of what are, at this stage, still only alleged enrichment schemes and twisted financial deals.\n\nTwo, that he was aware but chose not to take any action against his Fifa colleagues.\n\nOr three, that he was not only aware but that he too achieved some measure of financial gain.\n\nIf scenarios two or three are revealed to have been the case, then Blatter will surely face legal proceedings as well. If, however, the first scenario applied instead, then it is still a damning indictment on his ability to run a clean organisation, while also making a mockery of his assertions that he will now clean up Fifa from top to bottom.\n\nBlatter's stewardship of a global organisation accused of serious and deep-rooted financial impropriety is - from a legal point of view - very distinct from having endorsed that impropriety or being actively involved in it.\n\nRemember, too, that while there have been numerous gripes about the way Fifa has functioned during his 17 years at its helm, the game has grown, the revenue it generates has burgeoned, the number of nations that have been granted a share of those profits has increased, and the World Cup has been held on two continents that had never staged it before - Africa and Asia.\n\nBut the current legal proceedings against the world governing body will compromise its standing , its reputation and its influence, while certainly bringing sweeping change - under Blatter or his successor if he steps aside or is forced out of office - in the way it conducts its business.\n\nAnd the fallout from the current controversy might come back to haunt Blatter in one or more ways. It was during his presidency that serious allegations of financial gain and compromised decision-making processes surfaced after Russia and Qatar were awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, respectively.\n\nRemember how Fifa, appalled at the fact that anyone would question their methods, carried out their own investigation of the process by which host countries were chosen? And remember how Fifa's own investigation cleared itself of any wrongdoing in November last year?\n\nWhat transpires in the course of the separate Swiss and US trials will define Blatter's future, but for the moment, the man who is basking in his fifth term as Fifa president wants us to believe that he is the man to clean up his organisation.\n\nPerhaps he sees himself, Avengers-style, as a selfless, courageous superhero called Sepptimus Prime.\n\nSee more on\n\nFifa", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/SOCCERFIFA150531e_2x.jpg?VersionId=uCZvF56BNPgXCsmQ4ChM3zp9zZEZ9ryc", "alt_text": "FIFA President Sepp Blatter reacts after he was re-elected at the 65th FIFA Congress in Zurich, Switzerland, on May 29, 2015. -- PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

Mr Carter was appearing in front of a mainly Asian audience who, as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong pointed out on Friday night, have no wish to take sides in the US-China competition for influence.\n\nAt the same time, the Chinese too have to be mindful of Mr Lee's warning that Beijing risked souring ties with Asean as a result of its moves in the South China Sea.\n\nThere is also another factor for China to consider and some indications of this will be available today when Admiral Sun Jianguo, head of the Chinese delegation, speaks in plenary.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is visiting the US in September for a summit with President Barack Obama. Both sides have a stake in making a success of the summit but it is a fair guess that if Mr Xi sticks to his demand for a \"new type of great power relationship\", it could only be achieved if China shows a willingness to play by the rules.\n\nAs Mr Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at Australian National University, points out, stark confrontational language from Adm Sun would confirm Mr Carter's point about China being out of step with the region's rules and norms.\n\nSo the scene is set for some soft language from China as well.\n\nMeanwhile, the US has already made some key signals to Asia.\n\nFirst, it is making it clear it is not going away in a hurry. Indeed, it is gaining friends in the region.\n\nHis next stop, Mr Carter said early in his speech, is Vietnam, with which the US is going to sign an agreement that, for the first time, commits both nations to greater \"operational cooperation\".\n\nHe then heads to India, where an updated defence framework \"will open up the relationship on everything from maritime security to aircraft carrier and jet engine technology cooperation\".\n\nSecond, the regional power balance may be shifting as China rises but, as he reminded everyone, \"the US is doing well too\". Not only is the economy doing well, but also the military has \"improved its readiness while maintaining its unmatched operational edge and unrivalled capabilities\".\n\nNew technologies, \"including a few surprising ones\", are on the bake and the Pentagon will bring \"the best platforms and people to the Asia-Pacific\".\n\nMr Carter wasn't being jingoistic. His tone was measured. Yet, listening to him yesterday, it was impossible not to be reminded of the chorus of a Victorian-era war song:\n\n\"We don't want to fight but by jingo if we do;\n\n\"We've got the ships, we've got the men, we've got the money too.\"\n\nvelloor@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nLee Hsien Loong\n\nSouth China Sea", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/pixshangrila01150531e_2x.jpg?VersionId=x6ngRYRVe7FYyHOtemliX.WLkqj7zSX6", "alt_text": "Chinese Deputy Chief, General Staff Department, People's Liberation Army, Admiral Sun Jianguo (left) speaks to United States Secretary of Defense Dr Ashton Carter during the Ministerial Luncheon during the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue on May 31, 2015. --"}]}

But from that competition on, we finally saw the fruits of our labour,\" said Quek, grinning at her recollection of that pivotal moment, in spite of her usual serious self during the interview.\n\nYet that turning point was buried under the weight of bad history, and lives on only as a memory held close to the volleyball players' hearts - a beacon of hope after a long struggle in the shadow of more successful sports like swimming and table tennis.\n\nThis SEA Games, however, the players hope to notch their first win in a high-profile regional competition and prove that the sport has a future.\n\nSaid the 28-year-old Quek: \"We believe it's time for us to shine. Our few minutes in the spotlight is the showcase of our three years of hard work.\"\n\nThere are no records of the men's national team's last appearance in the Games, but it has been 10 years since the women's team participated in the biennial meet.\n\n\"We are sending the team to the SEA Games to show the volleyball community that there is talent in Singapore,\" said team manager Vincent Lim.\n\nNevertheless, few expect any medals from the sport. In fact, Team Singapore chef de mission Tan Eng Liang said just three weeks ago: \"All we expect of them is not to be last.\"\n\nNevertheless, the players are heartened as ordinary people have shelled out $10 and snapped up all the tickets to their games - a sign, perhaps, of the community rallying behind the team.\n\n\"I was taken aback by the speed at which the tickets sold out, but all the kids whom I coach wanted to go - that's the excitement in the community that I want to see,\" said player Joelle Lim, 22.\n\nSmall, but encouraging steps - that's what the national volleyballers are grateful for.\n\nFrom those rock-bottom times when only two players show up for training, now all 12 members train each day, wearing sponsored jerseys and shoes as they brush up their skills at St Hilda's Secondary School and Temasek Polytechnic.\n\nQuek recalled: \"There was a time when requests for basic apparel were turned down because of funding issues, and some of us struggled with commitment because we didn't feel recognised.\"\n\nFor these Games, the women need to beat Myanmar to enter the semi-finals and secure Singapore a bronze, which would be their first medal since 1981.\n\nBut the men face a tougher task against Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nNational coach Akihiko Narita believes that there is a 50-50 chance that the women will do well, as their exposure to international teams remains limited.\n\n\"The players are motivated by the support from the association and upping their game. If they keep going, we may have strong medal chances in two to three years,\" he said.\n\nFor the women's team, after all those bleak years, all they need to keep going is a little faith from their coach, their association and their fans.\n\ngohruiqi@sph.com.sg", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/01/ST_20150601_SPTVOLLEY01U7ZW_1365689e_2x.jpg?VersionId=Rj8E8oe_B7aiwaI40p.388XswKH3iLXm", "alt_text": null}]}

The remains of the ancient spiders, from the group of arachnids called Mesothelae, were found in France.\n\nBut their living descendants, which came about between 39 million and 58 million years ago, live only in South-east and East Asia.\n\nNUS spider expert Li Daiqin, who has studied spiders for over 20 years, believes the globetrotting arachnids could shed light on continental drift, the widely accepted belief that the earth started out with one supercontinent which broke and drifted apart.\n\n\"This group of spiders cannot be dispersed over water,\" said Associate Professor Li, who is with the university's biological sciences department. \"So, based on where the original fossils were found, and where the living descendants now occur, they must have travelled with the land.\"\n\nThree routes could have taken the spiders from Europe to Asia, travelling on one of the land masses, he suggested.\n\nThey could have journeyed across the Middle East, through China, or come through Myanmar and western Thailand, he said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The duo became fast friends through the CDC's Neighbours For Active Living programme, which matches volunteers with elderly residents to build a close-knit community.\n\nToday's event, organised by all five CDCs, aimed to highlight the strength of such community bonds as Singapore celebrates its Golden Jubilee. It was attended by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, mayors of all five districts and MPs, who also joined in a 2.5km walk around the bay.\n\nSouth East District mayor Maliki Osman said a cohesive community has been important to Singapore, adding: \"It is even more critical today, given recent developments of terrorist threats.\"\n\nSuch cohesion includes a level of trust and understanding in a multiracial society, added Dr Maliki, who is also Minister of State for Defence and National Development.\n\n\"We may be different in some respects, but we are the same, we are all Singaporeans,\" he told reporters. \"CDCs have a more critical role to bring people together, deepen that understanding and enhance appreciation (of one another) so that we can move forward and weather any possible storm that may come.\"\n\nHis comments come as government leaders have stressed the importance of safeguarding racial harmony in the face of the global terror threat, and as the Home Affairs Ministry said last week that a 19-year-old self-radicalised Singaporean had been detained for planning to join the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria terror group in Syria and to carry out attacks here.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

After 50 years, Singapore has maintained, like Asean, that it does not want to have to choose between America and China in the region.\n\nBut what of China? What does China want?\n\nAs Singapore celebrates its Jubilee Year and looks towards the future, it has to do so with a hard-headed look at its biggest neighbour China. Singapore needs to have a realistic assessment of China's intentions, America's resolve, and the place of Asean and Singapore in the region, in order to chart its course in the geopolitical future world.\n\nMany Chinese leaders feel that their country has been out of kilter for too long and it is time to put it right. It took more than 100 years to regain unity and security, another 50 to attain a measure of prosperity.\n\nWhen The Straits Times was first published, in 1845, China had just been defeated by British naval power and forced to open up five ports. The Americans were about to take California, just four years before the Gold Rush turned the Pacific into an Anglo-American lake. China suffered rapid decline and played virtually no role in world affairs. Until 1945, its story was largely one of distress and absence.\n\nSince 1949, China has tried to find a safe position, first between two superpowers, Soviet Russia and the United States, and now in relation to just one, the US in the Asia-Pacific. Does China want to become a superpower? If that is the only way to be prosperous and safe, the answer is yes. That, however, is the wrong question.\n\nIf China is prosperous and strong, it will be a superpower in Asia. It is not in the region's interest to try to prevent China from being that. But there is no reason to believe that the Chinese will copy the British and the Americans and try to build a superpower based on naval might to maximise their global dominance. This kind of concept is absent from the Chinese heritage.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

The voyages showed capacity but no ambitions to dominate the seas or build maritime empires. The voyages were stopped when they proved that there were no enemies that threatened China from the seas. The imperial court's decision to destroy the navy was an action consistent with China's heritage, not the voyages before that.\n\nChina's history thus suggests that it seeks to be a power founded on economic wealth and technological brilliance - the factors which made its civilisation admired for millennia.\n\nIn recent times, global power shifted to the US in the 1990s as the unchallenged master of the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans. The economic emergence of Asia has moved the world's focus closer to this region.\n\nChina recognises these realities and knows that it needs a better balance between its continental commitments and its maritime opportunities. At the same time, it has to re-calculate the costs and benefits of greater participation in a wider range of global affairs. Not least, it needs balanced relationships in its immediate neighbourhood. China's key problem is how to convince its neighbours that it has no intention to move from being assertive to being aggressive. It does not seek to replace American with Chinese dominance. Its national interest lies in creating an environment in which China will not be feared as a superpower but respected for its wealth and creativity, necessary conditions for a modern civilisation.\n\nSmaller neighbours\n\nBALANCING relations with smaller neighbours requires a change of mindset among all concerned.\n\nEarly South-east Asian states dealt with imperial China for some 2,000 years. As new nations now, they are witness to a weak China restoring its position as a regional power. They are also learning to act regionally as Asean and to identify common concerns.\n\nThe needs and hopes of China and Asean should be dealt with in a package to achieve outcomes that are balanced and sustainable. This requires close attention to details of contested issues in order to guard against any single issue like that of the South China Sea disrupting the whole relationship.\n\nMatters concerning territorial disputes are difficult to resolve. China and Asean have to exercise great skill in avoiding conflict and enabling negotiations to take place without rancour.\n\nChina is aware that Asean leaders have continually to devise original and ingenious ways to build consensus and extend influence beyond its shores.\n\nChina, in turn, has offered several plans to help the region. Ever since then Premier Zhu Rongji signed the Framework Agreement on China-Asean Economic Cooperation in 2002, there has been special attention given to Asean.\n\nThe setting up of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and President Xi Jinping's two Silk Roads strategy are the most recent manifestation of long-term commitments. They are meant to offset political anxieties by offering clear economic opportunities. The world is watching how China implements the promise behind those policies.\n\nAs China's power and influence increase, questions will be asked about a historical phenomenon peculiar to South-east Asia. The region is home to large numbers of Chinese and people of Chinese descent. These Chinese are well known to have a strong sense of ethnic identity. Singapore - where three-quarters of the population are ethnic Chinese - is a case in point. China will have a keen interest in how the city-state develops and the way it conducts itself in the region.\n\nChina-Singapore ties\n\nKEY events in the relationship between China and Singapore are striking. On the day Singapore became a new nation in 1965, China was on the eve of a deadly power struggle between Mao Zedong and his colleagues in its ruling party.\n\nA few weeks later, its sister party, the Parti Kommunis Indonesia (PKI), was destroyed after an abortive coup. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese were killed or shipped to China. That saw the end of diplomatic relations between Indonesia and China for 25 years.\n\nThe Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution followed shortly in China, and the turmoil it brought to the Chinese people undermined any illusions anybody still had about learning from China.\n\nThere were other changes that could not have been predicted.\n\nWithin a decade, the People's Action Party in Singapore became all-powerful, China welcomed US President Richard Nixon, and Mr Lee Kuan Yew went to see Mao Zedong. Events moved quickly after that. Deng Xiaoping came to Singapore and China went further than anyone expected to open itself to the capitalist economies. Singapore's trade with China grew apace. The global Cold War swiftly ended with communism seen by all to have failed.\n\nThis was a spur to something South-east Asia had not seen for several decades: A turning towards China. Many entrepreneurs of Chinese origin in the region became interested in China again.\n\nAlert to its neighbours' sensitivities concerning the country's demography, Singapore monitored its business with China with great care. Its leaders established special projects in China to benefit both countries.\n\nAt the same time, Singapore remained true to the historic norms that connected it to the economic and security chains of the Western world. Even as it sought to be more active in China, it paid close attention to how the US and European Union responded to China's needs. Nevertheless, China appeared to understand Singapore's constraints and appreciated its many initiatives. After 2000, the pace quickened dramatically as the Chinese economy advanced.\n\nWith its Chinese majority, the global city of Singapore is a focus of attention, not least among its Asean fellow members. They are keen to know how its Chinese population will react to the growing confidence of China. What happens in Singapore could shape the response of others of Chinese descent in the region.\n\nOne thing, though, is certain: The Chinese in Singapore will not blindly follow China. Indeed, it is remarkable how the Chinese in Singapore have changed since the country's independence.\n\nThe divisions between those who look to China and those who do not are sharper. Each generation sees more Singaporeans embracing a Singapore identity that binds more of the local-born together. This Singapore identity is avowedly multi-cultural.\n\nBut what is yet uncertain is how much of this Singapore identity will remain recognisably \"Chinese\" and how China will see it.\n\nBut the question of how \"Chinese\" a society and its values are, is also moot.\n\nWhen Chinese societies modernise, they are pulled in directions different from what was once thought quintessentially Chinese. Yet, modern Chinese communities may also paradoxically become more alike in lifestyles, career goals and even thought processes, no matter where they live.\n\nSingapore's dilemma\n\nTHIS leads to three questions that could put Singapore at the centre of future discussions on this issue. The first is what happens to the majority Chinese population of Singapore in a region with some 30 million South-east Asian citizens of Chinese descent.\n\nIf they cohere with other communities as Singaporeans, the region would be relieved while China might be disappointed.\n\nBut these Chinese could also be divided in their attitudes towards China as a superpower.\n\nSingapore's neighbours may expect its leaders to force its Chinese population to conform to the pluralism the country stands for, and not tolerate the political and cultural strains that affinity to China might produce.\n\nThe second is what happens when local nationalists in another South-east Asian state turn against China because of a bilateral dispute. As long as this does not directly affect Singapore, it may be able to calm both sides through Asean channels.\n\nBut should the nationalists in the state attack their own citizens of Chinese descent, Singapore may need to be active in keeping regional relations stable so China will not be pressured, as it was in 1998, by Chinese communities overseas to intercede with Indonesia. Singapore would also have to prepare its own Chinese community to understand what it does.\n\nThe third concerns any conflict involving China and a non-Asean power. None would alarm Singapore more than one with the US on whose commitment in the Asia-Pacific region the state has pinned great hopes.\n\nSome segments of Singapore's Chinese population may sympathise with China. If that happens, Singapore would have to make extra efforts to demonstrate its national coherence. At worst, it may have to join with others to determine the rights and the wrongs of the conflict and openly take sides.\n\nIn all three, Singapore's capacities will be sorely tested. The consolation is that after 50 years of nation building, it should be more ready to deal with an active China. Asean has done remarkably well in building institutional networks to minimise discord - but there is no alternative to the region seeking a sustainable balance in future superpower relationships.\n\nAs for China, it can be a beneficial influence, most of all among those of Chinese descent, when it succeeds in building the modern civilisation it can be proud of.\n\nstopinion@sph.com.sg\n\nThe writer is a renowned historian of Chinese nationalism and the overseas Chinese.

But they were so popular, they flew off oven trays before even reaching the shelves of one-time supermarket giant Yaohan.\n\nQuarrels and snaking queues were commonplace in many of Yaohan's branches, where customers competed for the many bargains the Japanese chain offered, recalled former staff who yesterday got together - many of them for the first time after almost 20 years - to reminisce.\n\nOpened in 1974 in Plaza Singapura, Yaohan was the first to introduce the one-stop shopping concept to Singapore. The first week alone saw nearly a million Singaporeans flock to its three floors in the newly opened mall. By 1983, it had five branches, including in Jurong and Bukit Timah. In 1997, its parent company in Japan went bust, and its last branch in Thomson closed.\n\nBut between the start and the end, it became a household name, with its green and white logo, Japanese management culture and retail innovations - from childcare to allow parents to shop, to open-view bakeries and shoe-repair services - which were as iconic as its an pan (red bean paste bun).\n\n\"We used to have morning assemblies daily,\" said retiree Jeffrey Law, 73, who was a human resource manager with Yaohan before retiring as an editorial consultant. To encourage camaraderie, employees sang the National Anthem, took the Singapore and Yaohan pledge - in which they vowed to better serve all people - and did morning exercises. Staff were also regularly sent for Japanese etiquette and service training at Yaohan's international education centre in Hong Kong.\n\n\"We were taught not to walk with our hands behind our backs because customers might perceive it to be rude,\" said Mr Law, who joined Yaohan in 1976 and left in 1997.\n\nBut if the staff were taught to be on their best behaviour, the crowds could at times get unruly. Former store manager Henry Quek, 63, remembers how the Katong store's glass doors broke on the morning of a sale, which included bargains such as a 5kg pack of rice for $1. \"The crowds were pushing as they waited for the store to open,\" he said.\n\nMs Alice Leo, who organised Saturday's get-together of 120 former staff at Chengsan Community Club, also recalled how customers brought their babies along when buying Anchor beer. Each carton was specially priced but each customer was limited to one. \"I asked if their baby also drank beer and they replied: 'My baby is also a person',\" the 61-year-old former sales assistant laughed.\n\nMany of those who met up on Saturday worked for Yaohan for more than two decades. Ms Leo began reaching out to her long-lost colleagues at the suggestion of a friend as a way to mark SG50. \"Word that we were holding the event spread very quickly and we soon had to turn some away after we hit 120 responses.\"\n\nSuch a reception was not unexpected, though. Said Mr Law: \"We spent so much of our working lives in Yaohan.\"\n\nandreang@sph.com.sg", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/yaohanthomsonrelaunch1986May31e_2x.jpg?VersionId=_dfoIFMB3l0nwAkmsgO9VfFtnl.WYw1p", "alt_text": "Crowds gathered at the&nbsp;relaunch of Yaohan Thomson&nbsp;after its revamp in 1986. -- PHOTO: ST FILE"}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ShoppingforChineseNewYeargoodiesatYaohanPlazaSingapura1977May31e_2x.jpg?VersionId=Axh22jNWu9mkHx146eIKwW4v0P7.Bt8U", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/Yaohanthomson1977May31e_2x.jpg?VersionId=87KLX_S_.YLR.WsnvWVGKCIxQ9At8MDh", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/nabmYAOHAN331515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=bRXSqNRlwP_WHLDdUUaUIDRrmX6Y4oxL", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/nabmYAOHAN231515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=d8PCiA7WnxwmSZqMKiBJW3wTOHxawvIW", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/nabmYAOHAN131515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=aj_zzT0kSeZ2D6Avgvadb8IeyF3Uw5AT", "alt_text": null}]}

Sahaj's mother Mina Shrestha said their son has been too terrified to leave their side, even to go to the toilet, since the quake destroyed their home and forced them to live in a tent.\n\n\"Aftershocks are still continuing. It is difficult not to be nervous about sending the children to school again,\" Ms Shrestha told AFP. \"But the teachers have assured us that it is safe here, and at least his mind will be fresh if he meets his friends and studies.\"\n\nClassrooms made of bamboo have been built on the school's football field, while some lessons were held in buildings marked \"safe\" since the quake by engineers.\n\nTeachers sat with the younger children as they drew or played, some relieved to return to some semblance of normality.\n\n\"We've been staying home for so long, it is nice to play here and meet my friends again,\" said nine-year-old Muskan Bajracharya.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Many had been preparing to open the following week for the new semester.\n\n\"I don't even want to imagine what would have happened if it was a school day,\" said Ms Sakuntala Bhlon, 37, whose two children study in classes five and eight.\n\nThe reopening had been declared for May 17, but was delayed after a second major 7.4-magnitude quake rattled the country on May 12.\n\nFor some schools, however, reopening so soon after the quake has proved impossible, with temporary classrooms still being built, and continuing concerns about safety and space.\n\n\"It is impossible for me to reopen right now. The school ground is filled with debris and we don't have an open space,\" said Ms Lila Nanda Upadhyay, principal of Rupak Memorial International School in the Kathmandu valley.\n\nMr Dilli Ram Rimal, director-general of the education department, said he hoped more would reopen in coming weeks.\n\n\"We understand that not all schools have the resources to reopen,\" he said.\n\n\"But education is an important part of the recovery and we need to begin the process.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nChildren and youth\n\nEducation and schools\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nWin 2x tickets to New Zealand.

Not because Lim Tong Hai wants to.\n\nIn fact, if he could, the former national defender would leave that memory deep in the back of his mind. But that has been almost impossible.\n\n\"Even after all this time, people still bring it up. I get people whispering behind my back, saying, 'That's the fella who kelong (threw) the 1993 SEA Games semi-final',\" said Lim, 46.\n\nHe made SEA Games and Singapore football history when he scored two own goals in that 1993 semi-final against Myanmar. What was even more painful was that the goals came after Singapore had raced to a 2-0 lead after just 23 minutes in front of a partisan home crowd at the National Stadium.\n\nThe match went into extra-time and although Steven Tan equalised to make it 3-3 after Myanmar striker Win Aung had given the visitors the lead, the Lions eventually lost 4-5 in the ensuing penalty shoot-out.\n\nThe loss was especially hard for fans to accept, as the 1993 team were arguably the best Singapore had assembled in a while and the public were hopeful of the Lions winning what is still an elusive SEA Games football gold.\n\nWith the Games back in Singapore for the first time since 1993, Lim said he felt it was time to break his two-decade long silence on the incident.\n\n\"Sooner or later, it would come out again, especially with the SEA Games back in town,\" said Lim, a sports and wellness senior lecturer with the Institute of Technical Education College East.\n\n\"I felt it's time I came out to talk about this.\"\n\nThe former centre-back said his conscience remains clear as he looked back on the two ill-timed swipes on his right boot.\n\nBoth times, he executed the kicks with the intent to clear the ball, but both times he succeeded only in putting the ball in the back of the Singapore net.\n\n\"The ball came into a potentially dangerous area,\" said Lim, who is also a physical education and sports science consultant at the National Institute of Education.\n\n\"With hindsight, of course I could have reacted differently. But in a match, my only instinct was to clear the danger.\"\n\nHe said the incident opened his eyes to how cruel the game can be, and also made him realise who his true friends were. Some even told his then-girlfriend, whom he would later marry, that Lim should just quit football for his own good.\n\n\"The worst was someone commenting that if (Andres) Escobar was shot six times, I should be shot 12 times, because I scored two own goals,\" said Lim, referring to the Colombian defender who scored an own goal in the 1994 World Cup match against the United States.\n\nThe US won the match 2-1 and Colombia were subsequently eliminated in the group stage. Shortly after the exit, Escobar was shot six times in Colombia. The murder was widely believed to be punishment for the own goal.\n\nLim said his team-mates, his family and his girlfriend helped his through those tough days. He also took solace from the words of then Defence Minister and president of the Singapore National Olympic Council, Yeo Ning Hong.\n\nBack then, Dr Yeo told the Lions: \"I want to tell all of you, and also all Singaporeans, that in life, mistakes are inevitable.\n\n\"I told Tong Hai he doesn't have to bear the burden of his mistakes.\"\n\nDr Yeo also used a Chinese saying: \"No do, no wrong. Little do, little wrong. More do, more wrong.\"\n\nAdded Lim, now a father of two: \"My back was against the wall. I could either fade away or come out fighting if I wanted to make football my career.\n\n\"I chose to come out fighting.\"\n\nThe following year, Lim went on to win the Malaysia League and Cup Double with the Lions. He played with the national team until 1999, and even went on to captain the Lions.\n\nLim, who had also coached at S-League club Geylang United and was their general manager, still contributes to the national game as chairman of the Football Association of Singapore's Referees' Committee.\n\nWith Singapore's SEA Games football campaign set to begin today, Lim, like many fans, will be rooting for the Young Lions.\n\nAnd ahead of the opener against the Philippines, he had this piece of advice for the team: \"Just forget about the pressure and go out, play your best and enjoy the game.\n\n\"The fans will be behind you.\"\n\nmarclim@sph.com.sg", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/01/ST_20150601_SPTTONG09YP_1365698e_2x.jpg?VersionId=4YnZimtkLPSimNG0bcuCq5HZYQMiXwjx", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/01/ST_20150601_SPTTONG_1365690e_2x.jpg?VersionId=HoZaH8WU6_X7E2zoRCmmMaADFBj5sIX.", "alt_text": null}]}

If we hadn't found them, they may have died,\" the officer said.\n\nThe government initially labeled the migrants \"Bengalis\" - a term used to refer to both stateless Rohingya Muslims and Bangladeshis - but officials later said they believed most of those on board were from Bangladesh.\n\nMyanmar has come under harsh criticism for its treatment of Rohingya, more than 100,000 have fled persecution and poverty in Rakhine State in 2012.\n\nMore than 4,000 Rohingya and Bangladeshis have landed in rickety boats throughout Southeast Asia in the last month following a crackdown on human trafficking in Thailand.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Instead it refers to them as \"Bengalis\" and alleges they are illegal immigrants from across the border.\n\nThey face daily discrimination including controls on their movements, family size and access to jobs, forcing tens of thousands to flee overseas - usually to Malaysia. That exodus increased dramatically after 2012 when scores were killed in communal bloodletting in Rakhine.\n\nMyanmar has been keen to portray those leaving its shores as Bangladeshi economic migrants and rejects widespread criticism that its treatment of the Rohingya is one of the root causes of the current exodus.\n\nOn Saturday, a local official from Haigyi Island said the migrants were all Bangladeshis and would be taken to an area near the Bangladesh border in Rakhine state in the coming days.\n\nBut Bangladesh has insisted it will not take back any migrants who trace their origin to Myanmar.\n\nAnd because the Myanmar authorities refuse to use the term Rohingya, it is difficult to ascertain where exactly the migrants come from.\n\nNo media or aid group has yet been able to meet the migrants held on Thamee Hla Island to verify where they say they originate from.\n\nA lucrative people-smuggling trade has long thrived in the region, largely ignored or colluded at by the authorities.

Are you ready for White Walkers?\"\n\nOn a Game Of Thrones tour in northern Iceland, in search of locations where the hit HBO fantasy series is filmed, such jokes are inevitable.\n\nIn author George R.R. Martin's Westeros, dragon glass is the material that kills yeti-zombies stalking the north. The \"glass\" in question is obsidian - a naturally occurring volcanic glass you can find in Iceland.\n\nWe crunch down a snowy path, bare silver birch trees on either side. Eventually, we come to the edge of a vast lake.\n\nLake Myvatn (say \"mee-vat\"), the country's fourth largest natural lake, has a surface area of 37 sq km and is surrounded by a conservation area spanning 440,000ha.\n\nIt is here that a scene was shot of the wildlings, or free folk of the show's legion of characters, setting up their camp.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

In winter, however, only ducks such as black scoters and Barrow's goldeneyes disturb its clear surface.\n\nThe silence is slightly unnerving. Lava rock formations or islands dot the water. Legend has it that these used to be trolls, who had gone fishing on the lake at night, then turned to stone when the sun came up.\n\nSandra points across the lake at a row of stacked rocks, with an opening in the middle. \"That's the entrance of the love cave that Ygritte and Jon Snow go into,\" she says, referring to a romantic scene in Season 3 between a wildling archer and the illegitimate son of the noble House Stark. \"But the cave is somewhere else.\"\n\nSatisfied, we trek back to the car. A rustling comes from the direction of some bare birches and Sandra mock-hisses: \"White Walkers!\"\n\nBut it turns out to be just a couple of other tourists. We grin sheepishly at them.\n\nThe Game Of Thrones-themed tour by The Traveling Viking (\n\nwww.ttv.is\n\n) is just one of a number offered around Iceland. Sandra says theirs started in 2012, after the tour company's boss Jon Thor Benediktsson wrote to HBO with the idea.\n\n\"We thought we wouldn't get a response because we're a small company,\" says Sandra. \"But, to our surprise, they replied really quickly.\"\n\nWhen the show's producers returned to Iceland to film again, they went on the tour too.\n\nThe seven-hour tour, which costs 22,000 Icelandic kroners (S$221), starts from the northern Icelandic town of Akureyri, spans the Myvatn area and includes entry fee to the geothermal Myvatn Nature Baths - a splendid freshwater lagoon similar to Iceland's famed Blue Lagoon, but sans white silica-rich mud and crowds.\n\nSandra picks me up at 9am from my hotel in town in a jeep with giant wheels. I have to take a running leap to vault into the passenger seat. We are joined by her colleague Solveig Bennyjar-Haraldsdottir, who will soon take over as guide for the tour, as well as Emily Moore, a backpacker from New Jersey.\n\nAs we drive out of town, towards dazzling white mountains and along the long Eyjafjorour fjord and frozen lakes, Sandra - who is from Stuttgart, Germany, but has lived in Iceland since the 1990s - asks who our favourite characters are. She then offers interesting theories about plot mysteries and regales us with trivia.\n\n\"Most of the shooting locations are just by the side of the road,\" she says, pointing out a rock-strewn area and then calling up the scene it featured in on her iPad.\n\n\"Why? In winter, you don't want to lug tonnes of camera equipment on foot. Besides, it doesn't look very much different if you hike deeper in.\"\n\nEven so, landscape \"inaccuracies\" irk her when she watches the show: \"They're supposed to be travelling great distances, but you keep seeing them pass the same rocks.\"\n\nOur route takes us past Ljosavatn, or Lake of the Light, home region of Icelandic lawspeaker and pagan priest Thorgeir Thorkelsson, who decided in the year 999 that Iceland would convert to Christianity, thereby easing pressure from the Norwegian king and averting civil conflict.\n\nHistory comes alive\n\nThe religious transition was achieved peacefully, with his three caveats: that Icelanders be allowed to still worship the old Norse gods, eat horse meat and abandon their babies in the wild.\n\nGame Of Thrones fans would see parallels with Icelandic history: the uneasy truce between the Old Gods-worshipping northerners and the New Gods-following power brokers in King's Landing in the south; and the discrimination against the baby-sacrificing wildlings beyond The Wall - a fortification of solid ice on the border of the Seven Kingdoms in the book.\n\nWe stop at Godafoss, Waterfall of the Gods, into which Thorgeir cast his pagan idols to symbolise the change. Icicles fringed the falls, its thundering considerable even from a distance.\n\nFrom there, we drive along the River Laxa, dodging grey geese on the road, to the pseudo-craters on the shores of Lake Myvatn. Formed by steam explosions when water is heated in lava, these pseudo-craters or rootless cones look like the real deal, except that they have no access to magma underground.\n\nBesides our hike at Lake Myvatn, we also take a walk through Dimmuborgir (Icelandic for \"dog city\"), where scenes of wildling leader Mance Rayder's base were filmed.\n\nThe nature reserve is filled with stacks of lava rock, dating back 2,500 years, said to be petrified trolls (again).\n\nSolveig leads us down one of the narrow paths to show us the profile of the squirrel in one of these rock towers. Sandra points out a bunch of stone \"ladies\" waiting in line, as though for the bathroom. Dimmuborgir is also said to be the home of the 13 Yule Lads, Icelandic versions of Santa Claus.\n\nLunch is at Vogafjos Cafe, literally a cowshed with a restaurant attached, which Sandra says was a favourite of the HBO crew when they were there for three weeks in November 2012.\n\nAfter an excellent dish of pan-fried arctic char (about 4,000 kroners), I visit the patiently dozing cows next door.\n\nA pit stop followed at the \"love cave\", where Jon Snow and Ygritte frolicked after entering through the rocks we had previously seen on Lake Myvatn.\n\nUnfortunately, it is too icy and slippery to venture in. In any case, the waters, at 40 deg C, are too hot to bathe in (the actual love scene was shot in a studio).\n\nThen, it is on to the \"stinky mudpots\" at Hverir at the base of the volcanic Namafjall (Mining Mountain), which, mercifully, does not reek so much of sulphur on this particular day. The mud is acidic and not to be touched.\n\nOur final stop, the Myvatn Nature Baths, is where I sit up to my neck in geo-thermal waters while watching snow flurries - before screaming as I run through the cold back into the changing room.\n\nOn our drive back to Akureyri, Sandra asks: \"Were you expecting the Wall?\"\n\nThe Wall in the TV series is a CGI- enhanced version of a real glacier in south Iceland.\n\n\"This tour requires a lot of imagination,\" she adds, before offering to put on the Game Of Thrones soundtrack in the car.\n\nI respectfully decline. The perilous beauty of the Icelandic north is drama enough.\n\nstlife@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nIceland\n\nTelevision\n\nTravel and leisure", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_CCTHRONESXNCC_1360212e_2x.jpg?VersionId=ECJkEnRrUg8tNipyDlitZBNaFsXguNAx", "alt_text": "(Clockwise from left) Mudpots at Hverir at the base of the volcanic Namafjall; rock formations in Dimmuborgir; and Godafoss, Waterfall of the Gods."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_CCTHRONESW7R9_1360213e_2x.jpg?VersionId=57cB69EyAw9cciTt90e.A7tc9u5fdmTZ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_CCTHRONES_1360198e_2x.jpg?VersionId=i.VkrTY5fwTLASc.nePCuVQTzHgr36o2", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_CCTHRONESZ2XE_1360206e_2x.jpg?VersionId=Qd5HhvIkRUL7tT7LPOibFjPUmiNU_cZ6", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_CCTHRONESUS66_1360214e_2x.jpg?VersionId=7baunWGKKNTyU6webHXWS6ZB9Stp2EgU", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_CCTHRONES1KD9_1360205e_2x.jpg?VersionId=M3S4xSZo5xk9fRlhT5HO3uBsDjxIuVqA", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

But the timing of sanctions relief, access and verification of compliance and a mechanism for restoring sanctions if Iran broke its commitments were among the most difficult topics left for further negotiations.\n\nUS and European negotiators want any easing of UN sanctions to be automatically reversible if Tehran violates a deal. Russia and China traditionally reject such automatic measures as undermining their veto power as permanent members of the UN Security Council.\n\nAs part of the new agreement on sanctions snapback, suspected breaches by Iran would be taken up by a dispute-resolution panel, likely including the six powers and Iran, which would assess the allegations and come up with a non-binding opinion, the officials said.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would also continue regularly reporting on Iran's nuclear program, which would provide the six powers and the Security Council with information on Tehran's activities to enable them to assess compliance.\n\nIf Iran was found to be in non-compliance with the terms of the deal, then UN sanctions would be restored.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It was also unclear how the proposal would protect the United States and other permanent Council members from a possible Chinese or Russian veto on sanctions restoration.\n\nUS Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power has made it clear that Washington does not want Russia's and China's recent slew of vetoes on resolutions related to Syria to be repeated with an Iran nuclear agreement.\n\nFrance's Ambassador to the United States Gerard Araud said in Washington last week that, under a French idea, sanctions would be reinstated automatically in the event of non-compliance, avoiding the threat of a veto.\n\nUnder that idea, which Mr Araud said had not to date been approved by the six powers, the onus would be on Russia or China to propose a Security Council vote not to re-impose sanctions.\n\nRussian and Chinese officials did not respond immediately to requests for confirmation that they signed off on the snapback mechanism.\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry met Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Geneva on Saturday. They discussed progress and obstacles to an agreement in the Iran nuclear talks a month before the deadline for a deal aimed at reducing the risk of another war in the Middle East.\n\nRestoring US and EU sanctions is less difficult than UN sanctions because there is no need for UN Security Council involvement.\n\nFor their part, Moscow, Beijing and Teheran have wanted assurances that Washington cannot unilaterally force a sanctions snapback - a risk they see rising if a Republican wins the US presidency in 2016.\n\nA senior Iranian diplomat confirmed that discussions of specific snapback options were underway.\n\nHe told Reuters Teheran was preparing its own \"snapback\" in the event the Western powers fail to live up to their commitments under the agreement.\n\n\"At least three or four different suggestions have been put on the table, which are being reviewed,\" he said.\n\n\"Iran also can immediately resume its activities if the other parties involved do not fulfill their obligations under the deal.\"\n\nHe added that it was \"a very sensitive issue\".\n\nIf Iran accepts the proposed snapback mechanism, there are other hurdles that must be overcome, including IAEA access to Iranian military sites and nuclear scientists and the pace of sanctions relief.\n\nIran says its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and rejects allegations from Western countries and their allies that it wants the capability to produce atomic weapons.

However, he added: \"If need be, he will be questioned in the future.\"\n\nRussia and Qatar deny wrongdoing in their bids.\n\nThe Sunday Times reported Blatter would be the last of 10 FIFA officials to be questioned. Michel Platini, the president of the European governing body UEFA, and Vitaly Mutko, the Russian sports minister, would also be interviewed, it said.\n\nIn the Swiss newspaper interview, Blatter described a meeting he had on Thursday with Platini, when the former French international star encouraged him to quit with a fanfare.\n\n\"He said in all seriousness: 'Sepp, hold the congress and at the end say you're stepping down. You'll have a gigantic party thrown for you, and you can keep your office here at FIFA',\" Blatter said, adding that he had refused Platini's invitation to have the conversation over a glass of whiskey.\n\nBlatter comfortably won the FIFA vote with strong support from developing nations, which have received generous funding from FIFA to develop the sport under Blatter's leadership.\n\nBritain - which has been one of Blatter's fiercest critics, especially since England lost a bid to host the 2018 World Cup - stepped up the pressure on Sunday.\n\n\"Michel Platini has talked of European nations boycotting future World Cups if Blatter refuses to stand down. No options should be ruled out,\" Whittingdale, who is Britain's Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport, wrote in the Sunday Times.\n\nMember associations of UEFA will meet before the European Champions League final in Berlin on Saturday to discuss its next step. Before Blatter's re-election, Platini said they would be \"open to all options\".\n\nBut asked about a boycott, he said on Thursday: \"I honestly don't wish that.\"\n\nIn any case, achieving consensus at UEFA may be hard; French media reported that the president of the country's federation, Noel Le Grat, voted for Blatter.\n\nSeven senior football officials were arrested in a dawn raid before the FIFA congress in Zurich, and US authorities have said altogether nine officials and five sports media and promotions executives have been charged in cases involving more than US$150 million in bribes over a period of 24 years.\n\nThe indictment mentioned two payments cleared by Standard Chartered. \"We are looking into those payments and will not be commenting further at this time,\" a spokesman for the London-based bank said.\n\nOther banks named on the indictment, including Britain's Barclays, are making internal checks on their involvement and cooperating with the authorities, banking sources said. Barclays declined comment.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron and Greg Dyke, the chairman of England's Football Association, have urged Blatter to quit. Prince William, who lobbied for Britain to host the 2018 tournament along with star player David Beckham, has also spoken of the need for FIFA to reform.\n\nThe government of Germany, the reigning world champions, also called for change. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that football brought people around the world together.\n\n\"That should be the real legacy of FIFA. I have serious doubts, whether FIFA is up to this great task without a clear new start,\" he said.\n\nMany football experts regard a European-led boycott as unrealistic proposition believing that if it went ahead it would be a disaster for a sport that has avoided the kind of splits which have weakened others. Boxing for instance is now governed by four world bodies.\n\nDyke said it would be \"ridiculous\" for England to boycott the next World Cup in 2018 in protest because it would not have an impact.\n\n\"It's got to be done by enough nations to have an impact, if it's done,\" Dyke told BBC TV's Andrew Marr show, saying any kind of action needed to be with others.\n\nLater he told BBC Radio that any boycott needed the support of \"10 large countries\" to have an impact, adding that the Dutch and Germans were also demanding change.\n\nSee more on\n\nFifa", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/06/01/pzjohn01e_2x.jpg?VersionId=IDuXZWHHlDizUhWcmtn3p.TEJO1YvAmK", "alt_text": "John Whittingdale, the British government minister with overall responsibility for football, renewed calls on Sunday (May 31) &nbsp;for Fifa chief Sepp Blatter to step aside. -- PHOTO: REUTERS"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

Such change is sorely needed as the domestic recycling rate, at 19 per cent last year, is far from what one would expect from citizens who take great pride in the nation's \"Garden City\" image.\n\nRecycling is not a fad but a necessity as Singapore's landfill will run out of space between 2035 and 2045 if the mountain of refuse being collected yearly is not checked. Behavioural change on a large scale simply will not happen till Singaporeans make it a personal responsibility to reduce waste and recycle. After all, it doesn't take much to learn what can be recycled, and how to conveniently reuse things and do simple repairs around the house. Habits bred at home are more likely to be manifested at workplaces too.\n\nThose operating commercial premises have little excuse to not make an effort to offer recycling facilities, especially when most recyclables are already coming from industries. Such steps should come as naturally to them as the provision of electricity, water and sanitation infrastructure, as activists have noted. Big hotels and malls are already obliged to submit waste-reduction plans. Food centre operators should also do their bit - for example, by using recycling machines to convert food waste and leftovers into compost or water. Only 13 per cent of food waste (which piled up to 788,600 tonnes last year) is recycled.\n\nSome might suggest incentives to improve recycling rates, like the South West District's \"Trash-for-Cash\" programme that enabled residents to exchange recyclables for necessities. But these cannot be sustained indefinitely. Ultimately, it's about going green for its own sake. Instead of seeing all things material as \"disposable\", one ought to embrace a disposition to practise conservation in all ways possible for the larger good.\n\nSee more on\n\nNational Environment Agency\n\nRecycling", "images": []}

But failure could mean a parachute descent into the ocean hundreds of kilometres from rescue.\n\nNo ship will trail the plane as it is far too fast for a maritime vessel to keep up with, even though its maximum speed of 140km an hour is much slower than conventional jet aircraft.\n\nEven so, with an engineer's detachment, Borschberg has declined to contemplate his own mortality.\n\n\"I don't see it (as) risky, in the sense that we worked a long time on all these different questions,\" he previously told AFP.\n\n\"In the worst case, we have a parachute, we have a life raft and we know how to use it. Of course, hoping that we will not need to do that.\"\n\nPlanners had identified airports in Japan should the plane need to make a stop because of technical problems, but the open ocean offered no such possibility, he said.\n\n\"As soon as we leave this part of the world, then afterwards we are in the open sea. There is no way to come back,\" Borschberg said.\n\nSolar Impulse 2 is powered by more than 17,000 solar cells built into wings that, at 72 metres, are longer than those of a Boeing 747 and approaching those of an Airbus A380 superjumbo.\n\nIn advance of the Pacific flight, the crew stripped off two side wheels and internal brakes from the propellers to make the fragile-looking craft - already just 2.3 tons, the weight of a large SUV - as light as possible.\n\nAt one point Borschberg returned to his native Switzerland for medical checks related to migraine problems.\n\nThe plane is the successor of Solar Impulse, which notched up a 26-hour flight in 2010, proving its ability to store enough power in lithium batteries during the day to keep flying at night.\n\nRidiculed by the aviation industry when it was first unveiled, the Solar Impulse venture has since been hailed around the world, including by UN chief Ban Ki-moon.\n\n\"Now is the moment just to demonstrate what this airplane can do - fly day and night with no fuel,\" Bertrand Piccard, who has flown the Solar Impulse on other stages of the voyage, told reporters by video link.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nOceans\n\nAviation/Aerospace sector\n\nSolar energy\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service\u200b\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nWin 2x tickets to New Zealand.

It is unclear how much farther China will go.\"\n\nWhile he called for the peaceful settlement of rival territorial claims in the South China Sea, Dr Carter also pledged that America would maintain a substantial presence in the region and \"will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows\".\n\nChina and Taiwan, along with four Asean nations - Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei - have competing claims over parts of the South China Sea.\n\nThe US and its allies will not be deterred from exercising their rights, he said, adding that \"turning an underwater rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty or permit restrictions on international air or maritime transit\".\n\nChina reacted promptly at the end of Dr Carter's speech, with Senior Colonel Zhao Xiaozhuo from China's Academy of Military Science saying Beijing's actions are \"legitimate, reasonable and justified\".\n\nObservers said the exchange was far less confrontational than had been widely expected.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The US, he said, would be available to provide security in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come.\n\nIt will deepen longstanding alliances, diversify its force posture and invest in new military capabilities and war platforms.\n\nOne key measure is a US$425 million (S$572 million) plan to help South-east Asian countries strengthen their maritime capabilities through military exercises and equipment purchases.\n\nThis week, Dr Carter will also ink deals with Vietnam and India to deepen military cooperation. This comes at a time when Washington is already doing more with other regional partners to build a security framework that must \"reward cooperation, not coercion\", he said.\n\nDr Carter, who was speaking as Pentagon chief at the Shangri-La Dialogue for the first time yesterday, portrayed a picture of enduring US military dominance and said it is adding technologies to its arsenal like new unmanned systems in the air and sea, a long-range bomber, electromagnetic railgun and lasers.\n\nSome of the best and the latest equipment, like the navy's P-8 Poseidon aircraft and Virginia Class submarines, will also be brought to the Asia-Pacific.\n\nLater in the day, Dr Carter sat down with his counterparts from Japan and Australia on the sidelines of the summit for trilateral defence ministers' talks.\n\nA joint statement after the meeting said they expressed strong opposition to the use of coercion or force to alter the status quo in the East China Sea and South China Sea unilaterally.\n\n\"They urged all South China Sea claimants to exercise self-restraint, halt reclamation activities, take steps to ease tensions and refrain from provocative actions that could escalate tensions,\" the statement said.\n\n\"They called on governments to clarify and pursue territorial claims and accompanying maritime rights in accordance with international law.\"\n\nWeighing in on the hot-button issue, Chinese defence officials say that freedom of navigation in the South China Sea \"has never been affected\".\n\nRear-Admiral Guan Youfei, director of the Chinese defence ministry's Foreign Affairs Office, told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting: \"On the other hand, freedom of navigation should be about benefiting economic development, not about allowing a country to deploy its military vessels everywhere.\"\n\nThe three-day gathering of 26 defence chiefs and some 300 top military brass ends today.\n\njermync@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_JCCARTER31PBCX_1365303e_2x.jpg?VersionId=Cswg0ab8c2Pb_yNfFve3LhAbAu_qvUJb", "alt_text": "Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen (right) with US Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter during the ministerial luncheon yesterday.

The two men arrested,who are also Singaporeans, are 26 and 31 years old respectively.\n\nThe three men in a Singapore-registered red Subaru Impreza were stopped at a police vehicular checkpoint set up along Ardmore Park.\n\nWhen police officers asked to inspect the car boot, the 34-year-old driver suddenly accelerated the vehicle and headed towards Anderson Road. Despite warnings to stop, the driver continued to crash through police barricades, endangering the lives of the officers, the police said.\n\n\"Police opened fire at the vehicle to stop further danger. The vehicle subsequently stopped at the junction of Orange Grove Road and Anderson Road,\" said the police statement.\n\nA bag containing white powdery substances, believed to be controlled drugs, was recovered in the car.\n\nSubstances which appeared to be controlled drugs and an item believed to be a drug-taking utensil were also found on the men arrested.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The 31-year-old passenger was injured during the incident and was taken to the hospital conscious.\n\nPolice and officers from SAF's Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Explosives Defence Group have searched the car. No explosives, arms or weapons were found in the vehicle.\n\nNo weapons were found on the men. The incident appeared to be an isolated one, according to preliminary investigations by the police.\n\nThe red Subaru Impreza was towed away close to noon time.\n\nSecurity measures, including vehicle and person check points, have been put in place in the vicinity of the Shangri-La Hotel because of the Shangri-La Dialogue. The three-day security summit, which closes later on Sunday, was attended by defence chiefs from 26 nations, security analysts, academics and media from around the world.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who was attending the dialogue on Sunday, told reporters: \"Police have kept me informed of the situation which they have got swiftly under control. The investigations so far indicate that it's a situation related to drugs.\"\n\nMr Teo, who is also Minister for Home Affairs, added: \"The police will act firmly according to the law with anyone who breaks the law to make sure that we maintain public safety and security.\"\n\nMs Rachel Maher, 42, a resident of the nearby Ardmore II condo, said she and her husband heard two gunshots after 4am.\n\n\"It was quick, we heard the gunshots, jumped out of bed and looked out the window.\"\n\nShe added: \"It was scary, at that point we didn't know the justification for the shots.\"\n\nMs Daisy Umarani, a security guard at Ardmore Residence condominium, was on duty when she heard several gunshots. \"I was shocked, but I couldn't go out to look, I needed to stay at the condo,\" said the 40-year-old.\n\nAt about 9am on Sunday, the entrance to Anderson Road from Stevens Road was cordoned off.

Hence they will not be covered under the proposed law,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"The specific intent of the proposed law is to prevent Mr Lee's image or name from being used in commercial merchandise. Examples are things like chocolate boxes, souvenir coins or medallions and office stationery,\" she added.\n\nThe ministry's clarification comes amid concerns from several quarters and criticism online that the new law could have a chilling effect on artistic expression that features Mr Lee, who died on March 23, aged 91.\n\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong had said last weekend that the law would be changed in response to concerns from the public - shared by the Government - that companies and individuals are trying to profit from Mr Lee's legacy.\n\nHe highlighted two principles the Government will be working with: One, the protection would be against the use of Mr Lee's name and image for commercial gain, not works of tribute or for charity. Two, it would not be a blanket ban but a case-by-case approach in which the authorities' approval is required before use.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

It did not give a timeline.\n\nAsked whether the law would cover merchandise or transactions outside Singapore, the ministry said this was something it needed to study further.\n\nNews that the law was not aimed at restricting creative work came as a relief to artists like freelance designer Christopher \"Treewizard\" Pereira, 57, who has been making caricature figurines of Mr Lee that range in size from 12cm to 30cm since 2009.\n\nHe told The Sunday Times he was initially worried he might not be able to produce and sell his work under the impending law in spite of his good intentions.

Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for National Defence Tea Banh said the code, which Asean members are negotiating with Beijing, can guarantee the peaceful settlement of disputes in the South China Sea.\n\n\"Some would criticise these mechanisms as useless but I would rather argue that without these mechanisms, the tensions in the South China Sea would have escalated into full-scale conflict a long time ago,\" he said in his speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Phnom Penh had argued that territorial conflicts in these waters should be tackled between claimants and not involve Asean.\n\nMeanwhile, Asean's largest member, Indonesia, called for more dialogue, and suggested that countries embroiled in disputes in the South China Sea conduct joint patrols.\n\nIn his speech, Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said he is confident that these \"peace patrols\" can help solve the problem. Later, he told reporters these patrols could involve China as well - an idea Malaysia's Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said was \"not an impossibility\".\n\nMalaysia has consistently advocated a diplomatic approach to the dispute, he said in his speech, and remains convinced that a Code of Conduct will be the best way to govern competing claims to the waters.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Let's recognise that it will be difficult.\n\n\"These dispute claims have gone on for a long time... But we ought to be patient because the alternative is much worse.\"\n\nCountries acknowledging their different points of view is a good starting point, he added.\n\n\"It is much better than saying, 'I'm not going to talk about it.

Arsenal retained the FA Cup in majestic style as their 4-0 demolition of Aston Villa in Saturday's final made history for the Gunners and their manager Arsene Wenger.\n\nWenger's side swept Villa aside with a swashbuckling display sparked by Theo Walcott's first half opener and illuminated by a sublime strike from Alexis Sanchez to double their lead after the interval.\n\nPer Mertesacker and substitute Olivier Giroud also got on the scoresheet for the rampant north Londoners to seal Arsenal's second trophy in 12 months with the biggest margin of victory in an FA Cup final since 1994.\n\nIt was a suitably memorable performance on a historic day which saw Wenger become the first manager in the post-War period to win the competition six times, a tally matched by only George Ramsey, who won the last of his with Villa in 1920.\n\nThere was another significant slice of history for Arsenal as they lifted the famous old trophy for the 12th time, moving them ahead of Manchester United as the most successful club in the competition.\n\nWenger insisted this week that he doesn't know where he keeps his medals, but he now has a ninth major honour of his 19-year reign at Arsenal to add to the collection.\n\nArsenal had conceded twice in a disastrous opening eight minutes against Hull in last year's final.\n\nBut there was no sign of such a fraught start this time as Arsenal quickly established their smooth passing rhythm to pen Villa deep inside their own half.\n\nSanchez was at the heart of all their best moments and he worked space to clip a cross towards Laurent Koscielny, whose header forced a fine one-handed save from Shay Given.\n\nAaron Ramsey should have scored when a fortunate deflection presented him with a clear sight of goal just inside the penalty area, yet the Arsenal midfielder couldn't hit the target with a rushed effort.\n\nVilla, appearing in their first FA Cup final since 2000, seemed completely bewildered by the speed and movement of Arsenal's attacks.\n\nThey were prised open when Mesut Ozil's ball in the six-yard box was met by Walcott with a lunging volley that looked goalbound until Kieran Richardson threw himself into a last-ditch block.\n\n- Inspired switch -\n\nWalcott had been preferred to Giroud in the central striker's role that he has spent years telling Wenger he could thrive in, but the Arsenal boss responded to that miss by shifting the winger to the left flank and moving Sanchez into the middle.\n\nIt proved an inspired switch as the pair combined to break the deadlock in the 40th minute.\n\nOnce again, a blur of Arsenal passes went unchecked by the bedraggled Villa rearguard before Nacho Monreal lofted a cross that was bravely headed back across goal by Sanchez.\n\nWith Villa's defenders too slow to react to the danger, Walcott pounced, arriving unmarked from the left to lash a ferocious left-foot shot past Given.\n\nWalcott's seventh goal of an injury-ruined season was no more than Arsenal deserved and, with their confidence now sky-high, they took just five minutes after half-time to press home their advantage.\n\nWhile Walcott has been a bit-part player for most of the campaign, Sanchez has established himself as Arsenal's creative fulcrum in the nine months since he arrived from Barcelona and he capped his debut season with a stunning effort in the 50th minute.\n\nSeizing possession in a wide position 25 yards from goal, a typically deft drop of the shoulder send two Villa defenders the wrong way, buying time and space for Sanchez to unleash a superb, swerving shot that flashed over the flat-footed Given into the roof of the net.\n\nVilla, so vibrant since Tim Sherwood took over late in the season, looked traumatised by Arsenal's scintillating display.\n\nMertesacker compounded their misery in the 62nd minute when the Gunners defender guided a corner into the net via his shoulder before Giroud's clever flicked finish in stoppage-time underlines the class divide between the teams.\n\nSee more on\n\nArsenal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ARSENAL3543e_2x.jpg?VersionId=u1cK0.83SZrAt890sPNZfCfMsxqjr2SH", "alt_text": "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (right) watches as his team celebrate with the trophy after winning the FA Cup final football match between Aston Villa and Arsenal at Wembley stadium in London on May 30, 2015. -- PHOTO: AFP"}]}

In her teens, she fell in love with the theatre and dreamt of being a playwright.\n\nShe won a Public Service Commission teaching scholarship to study English literature at Princeton University in the United States, where she bagged prizes for a play and a collection of short stories she wrote. She even got to perform a monologue she wrote at a show produced by the famous Royal Shakespeare Company in England.\n\nShe thought she had done everything that was artistically fulfilling, but when she graduated in 2006, she felt no joy.\n\nShe says: \"Instead, I felt burnt out, like I had run a very long race for no reason.\"\n\nMs Pan, 31, who now goes by her ordained name, Thubten Damcho, was speaking over the telephone from Sravasti Abbey, a Tibetan Buddhist monastry in a forested area in Washington in the United States, where she now lives.\n\nIn 2007, after returning to Singapore, she started teaching English language and literature at a secondary school here and was in charge of its drama club.\n\nShe dated, partied and ran arts workshops for volunteer welfare organisations. And yet, she still felt dissatisfied with life in general.\n\nAt a friend's suggestion, she signed up for Buddhism classes at Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery.\n\nThe teacher, Venerable Chuan Guan, 42, \"exploded\" her notion of what a monastic should be.\n\nShe recalls: \"He was well-educated, humorous and explained Buddhist concepts in a logical and practical manner.\"\n\nOne day in class, she learnt what \"true happiness\" was.\n\nThe venerable drew a picture of the six realms of existence in Buddhist cosmology, and showed how the Buddha had gotten out of the cycle of rebirth.\n\nShe says: \"By transforming his mind through moral conduct and meditation, he was no longer subject to an uncontrolled cycle of mental and physical suffering, and was able to benefit others.\n\n\"And I thought, 'That's what I want to do with my life! I wanted to follow in the Buddha's footsteps.'\"\n\nFor the next three years, she started to seriously consider being ordained as a nun. She attended a novice retreat, where she shaved her head and wore robes. She simplified her lifestyle and gave away things she did not need, including her books.\n\nWhen she told her parents, both freethinkers, and sister, a Christian, about her intention, they were sad.\n\nShe says: \"My mother cried and asked if she had done anything wrong. I told her, it's because she has raised me well that I wanted to live a virtuous life.\"\n\nHowever, a two-week visit to Sravasti Abbey in 2010 to check out monastic life put her plans on hold.\n\nShe was shocked to find that in between meditation sessions, the monastics' life was grounded in the menial work of unplugging toilets, moving logs and doing dishes as part of serving the community.\n\nShe explains: \"I realised that monastic life was not about having time for your own spiritual practice. Instead, you learn to put the community first, and do things you may not enjoy because they benefit others.\n\n\"This was a real challenge to my self-centered mind that's used to doing whatever I want, whenever I want to.\"\n\nConfused about her aspiration, she returned to Singapore and buried herself in work.\n\nShe had been transferred to a policy- making division, which was more competitive and she found her drive to achieve resurfacing.\n\nThen in 2012, while serving as an assistant to Venerable Chodron, the abbess of Sravasti Abbey, at a retreat in Indonesia, she saw again how her mind was overwhelmed with negativity.\n\nFor instance, she was jealous of her then boyfriend's ex-girlfriend, whom she did not even know.\n\nConversely, she saw how the abbess was always joyous and equanimous regardless of the situation, the \"fruit of decades of spiritual practice as a monastic\".\n\nShe quit her job two years ago and moved to the abbey in Washington, where, with her family's blessings, she got ordained.\n\nHer parents visited her once and she chats with them over Skype once every two weeks. Dad, 62, is a lecturer in mechanical engineering while mum, also 62, is a retired administrative executive.

Arifil Azim Putra Norja'i had been detained under the Internal Security Act in April. He had planned to join ISIS, but if he failed to leave Singapore for Syria, he intended to kill President Tony Tan Keng Yam and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\n\nA 17-year-old student has also been arrested and is being investigated over his radicalisation.\n\nAsked what could have attracted them to ISIS' ideology, Dr Yaacob highlighted how such youths are typically isolated from their families and communities.\n\n\"They are looking for a cause, a challenge, answers. Maybe ISIS offers something to them. This is where an alternative narrative is important, for us to tell them that this is wrong and there is another thing better for you,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed the need to reach out to such youths and guide them towards constructive activities, such as charitable work and youth groups: \"Rather than leave them alone, we should engage them.\"\n\nHe cited yesterday's launch of the Wakaf Heritage Trail, which saw 180 students aged 11 to 18 join a race around Kampong Glam, as an instance of such engagement.\n\nDr Yaacob also later attended a networking session with participants in Mendaki's youth mentoring programme, and shared his experiences as a former mentor.\n\nSeparately, Foreign Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said the true strength of a society is not just in whether it can prevent terrorist activity, but how it recovers when something does happen.\n\n\"This can't be done by the Government alone. It has got to be the community,\" he said at the launch of the two-day BeritaHarian.sg National Futsal Championship, which kicked off with an exhibition match between teams with players of different races and faiths.\n\n\"Every event like this which brings together people and community leaders... builds strength within society. That is fundamental.\"\n\nAnd Second Minister for Home Affairs and Trade and Industry S. Iswaran told Tamil Murasu the terror threat is a problem faced by society as a whole and not just one particular community's challenge.\n\n\"The consequences of those wrongful actions will have adverse impact on all of us, regardless of the communities or religious backgrounds we belong to.

Some 200 Malaysians have also joined ISIS in Syria, with over 100 more arrested at home for ISIS links.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had on Friday raised the spectre of ISIS establishing a base somewhere in the region, \"in a geographical area under its physical control like in Syria and Iraq... somewhere far from the centre of power of state governments, where government writs do not run\".\n\n\"There are quite a few such places in South-east Asia,\" he said. \"If ISIS did that, it would pose a very serious threat to the whole of South-east Asia.\"\n\nMr Hishammuddin said Malaysia was studying the effectiveness of ongoing actions against ISIS in the Middle East, so as to learn from mistakes there and better deal with ISIS as it rears its head in the region.\n\nHe also raised concerns over maritime security in the Straits of Malacca - an area extremists have said they want to target - and said Malaysia has been working with Asean countries to beef up security in the waterway.\n\n\"The threat is a different threat,\" he said of ISIS, which has gained significant territory and allies and drawn close to 1,000 fighters from the region.\n\n\"It is still unfolding before us. We're still grappling and trying to find solutions to face off with them,\" he said. \"The present solutions we've been seeing, the present actions that have been taken, have not been successful if you watch..

At one point amputation was considered, the Hall said in its portrait of her. \"For her to do what she did was special because she couldn't run as well as other people. And yet she had the smarts,\" longtime doubles partner Shirley Fry told the Taipei Times in 2004.\n\nHart's game was based more on finesse than power, with matchless racquet control and an arsenal of shots.\n\nHart, a native of St Louis, won seven major titles in 1951, playing three finals at Wimbledon in one day because of rain delays. She lost only one set during the two-week tournament and defeated Fry for the singles title, 6-1, 6-0.\n\n\"I wasn't tired, I was on cloud nine,\" she told the Taipei Times.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But if it is well-argued, does not stoke primal feelings unduly, and is from someone with deep insights into an issue - and written accessibly - we are prepared to run it.\n\nTake the ongoing tension in the South China Sea. Tensions are rising between China and the United States, after the US sent a surveillance plane flying over the South China Sea on May 20, above disputed land masses on which China has reclaimed land and built installations. The Chinese reportedly warned off the plane at least eight times, once with the rather plaintive appeal:\n\n\"Please go away \u2026 to avoid misunderstanding.\"\n\nThe US pilot is reported to have responded: \"I am a United States military aircraft conducting lawful military activities acting outside national airspace. I am with due regard in accordance with international law.\"\n\nA few days after that incident, the Chinese released a white paper on military strategy.\n\nDepending on what media you follow, you would think the paper is all about asserting Chinese military might and a resurgent Chinese navy. Or you might think the paper is a wonderful statement of Chinese desire for transparency to avoid misunderstanding.\n\nIf you are smart enough to subscribe to The Straits Times, though, you would get\n\nboth points of view, here\n\n.\n\nAnd while much commentary on the paper centred on China's projection of its naval power, and its shift from \"offshore waters defence\" to \"open seas protection\", one analyst who wrote for The Straits Times\n\nhad a very different take\n\n.\n\nThe most striking thing about the paper, he said, was the way it asserted that the military would follow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its leadership. And the picture that emerges is of a China trying to balance between becoming militarily strong and keeping the peace. Noted Greg Austin, a visiting professor at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, in a piece written for The Straits Times: \"One Chinese commentator says the new strategy paper has signalled support for the dual- track strategy of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who China wants to partner with Asean to manage regional security, while working to resolve disputes between the two sides.\n\n\"But the strategy has the stamp of President Xi Jinping all over it - the China dream, an appeal to revolutionary values, and mixed signals about the balance between making China militarily strong and keeping the peace.\"\n\nThose following the news on US-China relations would have asked at some point this week, whether the US and China will go to war. If the US sends planes flying over islands claimed by China (and other rival claimants); will the Chinese lose patience one day and take action? Will the US deploy forces to block or prevent, Chinese actions?\n\nOn this, Australian academic Hugh White is very clear:\n\ndo not underestimate China's resolve to go to war\n\n. No, he is not a war-mongering alarmist.

There are 24 such areas across Singapore, including the nature reserves.\n\nThe Gardens' existing 6ha nature area is one of Singapore's few remaining patches of primary rainforest and has been preserved since 1859. The expansion includes a 10ha fragment of secondary forest next to the Gardens known as the Learning Forest, and surrounding forest areas.\n\nNParks said the ecology in these areas complements the primary rainforest. More trees, including exceptionally tall and rare ones, will be planted in them, and an existing freshwater swamp will be restored and enhanced as part of the nature area expansion.\n\n\"The additional 14ha will enhance the forest habitat in the Gardens as it forms a contiguous swathe of forest through the heart of the Gardens,\" NParks said.\n\nIt added that this will create more opportunities for pollination and seed dispersal of native forest trees, help the rainforest regenerate, aid in the conservation of plants native to the region and create additional habitats for native wildlife such as the Red-legged Crake bird.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

This SDI, he said, was not the same as the acronym for the United States Strategic Defence Initiative, a Cold War-era missile defence system meant to protect the US from nu-clear attacks.\n\n\"The SDI I propose today is\u2026 an SDI in which we work together to tackle security issues of the 21st century,\" he stressed.\n\nMr Nakatani's proposal was received positively by countries in the region, with Vietnamese Deputy Defence Minister Nguyen Chi Vinh saying that while he does not have a clear understanding of it yet, \"any initiative or idea based on international law that will help build peace and stability in the region is welcome\".\n\nSingapore's Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen concurred. \"In principle, everyone would agree (to it). How it's done, at what pace, we will leave it to the various fora.\"\n\nHe added that \"all countries agreed\" with Mr Nakatani's point that momentum was needed not only to establish a rules-based consensus and system which everyone wants, but also to infuse it with a spirit of cooperation and collaboration.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Theoretically it is very good but the problem is, on specific issues, do you have consensus?\"\n\nHe added that the problem with the Asia-Pacific's security architecture is that it is largely supported by two-party alliances. This works to exclude countries like Russia and China.\n\nIt would be ideal to build a security architecture that does not exclude others and is multilateral in nature.\n\nHowever, he said, there is a need first to reach consensus on security issues through negotiation and dialogue before there is any possibility of building an SDI.\n\nMr Nakatani's proposal furthers the increasing engagement of Japan in the region since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe returned to power in 2012.\n\nIn Mr Abe's keynote address at last year's Shangri-La Dialogue, he said Japan would play \"a more proactive role than it has until now in making peace in Asia and the world something more certain\".\n\nYesterday, Mr Nakatani also accused China - without naming it - of trying to change the status quo in the South China Sea as well as the East China Sea where Tokyo and Beijing are tussling over sovereignty of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands.\n\nMr Nakatani also deflected a question on whether he would personally apologise for Japan's wartime past, saying only that his country had felt remorse and that Japanese must not avert their eyes from the suffering that was caused.\n\nAnalysts have said Japan's unwillingness to apologise for its wartime actions prevents it from playing a greater role in the region.\n\nsuinoi@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nSouth China Sea\n\nSecurity issues", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_SNJAPAN31_1365279e_2x.jpg?VersionId=nziS4lXG_XZbu8JAYOlQvlGGWcbrdStR", "alt_text": "Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani (left) speaking with Admiral Sun Jianguo, Chinese deputy chief, General Staff Department, People's Liberation Army, during the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue yesterday."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

And it doesn't worry him.\n\nThe 56-year chase for Singapore's maiden SEA Games football gold has come home. More than any other sport, this is arguably the medal every Singaporean is yearning for.\n\nBut even after training trips to Turkey, Austria and Japan and a string of friendly matches, the Under-23 team Aide helms have not exactly been a paragon of excellence and confidence.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

They were also stunned 3-1 by the Cambodia U-22s in March.\n\nWithin the squad, uncertainties linger. Left-back Shakir Hamzah was stripped of his captaincy, while 17-year-old 1.87m Irfan Fandi - Lions great Fandi Ahmad's eldest son - has been shuffled between defence and attack to find the best use of his physique.\n\nDespite avoiding defending champions Thailand as well as contenders Malaysia and Vietnam in the SEA Games group stage, doubts remain over Singapore's ability to even finish in the top two of Group A and book a semi-final spot.\n\nBut, if Aide is to be believed, this is just how he likes it.\n\n\"It's always good to be underestimated,\" the former centre-back tells The Sunday Times, with a wry smile.\n\n\"People are talking about Thailand cruising to the gold and not putting the limelight on us.\"\n\nIt is a feeling echoed across the dressing room. Goalkeeper Syazwan Buhari said: \"The criticism is good for us because we can use it as extra motivation to try and make a name for ourselves.\n\n\"We are using these Games to show people we are good.\"\n\nExperience was gained from the last edition in Myanmar two years ago, when Aide's troops held their own in the semi-final against Thailand, only to lose 0-1 after a mix-up between centre-back Safuwan Baharudin and goalkeeper Izwan Mahbud. They eventually settled for their third football bronze in four editions.\n\n\"That's why I keep talking about balance in my tactics,\" said Aide, who is assisted by former national defenders S. Subramani and Kadir Yahaya.\n\n\"Of course, I want the team to attack and score goals - but we must defend properly first. If we don't stay compact... we will be out.\"\n\nWhen the 40-year-old noticed training standards and discipline were slipping during their week-long stint in Japan this month, he was said to have given his players the hair-dryer treatment.\n\nThey have since responded with a 3-0 victory over Japan's Shizuoka Sangyo University and a 5-1 thumping of Laos' U-23s at home last week.\n\nStill fans doubt them, especially since previous Singapore teams have failed. The 2013 batch, for instance, boasted established national players like Hariss Harun, Safuwan and Izwan, all of whom were coming off the highs of winning the Malaysia Super League with the LionsXII.\n\nBut even they failed to become the first Singapore outfit to reach the final since 1989, when the team were powered by a frightening front line that included Fandi Ahmad and V. Sundramoorthy.\n\nSo what makes the latest crop, featuring promising but unproven talents like Irfan and Adam Swandi, different from two years ago?\n\n\"This team are more of a unit and have a lot of character,\" midfielder Anumanthan Kumar said ahead of his second Games outing.\n\n\"We have been together for two to three years, so we all know one another very well. If we focus and follow coach's instructions, we will do well.\"\n\nWords will have to translate into action when Singapore open their campaign against the Philippines at the Jalan Besar Stadium tomorrow.\n\nThe hosts are looking to extend the feel-good factor from the LionsXII's stirring 3-1 Malaysian FA Cup triumph over Kelantan last week.\n\nAide, a bronze medallist himself in 1995, has a simple message to rally his boys: \"I've experienced that winning feeling with the national team, being adored and praised by fans.\n\n\"I told the boys it's something money can't buy. This is their chance to write history and leave a legacy behind.\"\n\nnsanjay@sph.com.sg\n\nAdditional reporting by Deepanraj Ganesan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_SPTSOC_1365436e_2x.jpg?VersionId=ALmGDEctpWaD9SQ5z75t3JsuWcsetWDG", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

A new book turns the spotlight back on the island's early historical gems.\n\nOur Modern Past: A Visual Survey Of Singapore Architecture 1920s-1970s is written by Mr Ho Weng Hin, Mr Dinesh Naidu and Ms Tan Kar Lin - conservation advocates who say they penned this tome to help Singaporeans visualise the architectural value behind old buildings.\n\nThe concept for the book was partially influenced by Pastel Portraits (1984), a volume about Singapore's pre-World War II architecture, in particular the row house. It was authored by Gretchen Liu, a writer and early champion of the conservation cause here.\n\nMr Naidu, 40, a civil servant, says: \"The book was a real impetus for the conservation movement. For example, it opened a lot of people's eyes to the conservation value of shophouses, which were considered slums in the 1980s before they were restored.\"\n\nOur Modern Past features a wide range of building types: from schools to churches to even civil service quarters and flats, which might be seen as \"ugly and grey\", says Mr Naidu.\n\nSo he hopes the book will stir hearts and spur thinking about conservation, and deter demolition. He says: \"In a way, we want to sensitise people and change their mindset and perspective.\"\n\nHe graduated from the National University of Singapore's architecture faculty with Mr Ho, 40, and Ms Tan, 38, who are married. The couple run architectural conservation specialist consultancy Studio Lapis.\n\nOur Modern Past is largely a pictorial tome, published as three books. They cover various decades, starting from the colonial design period of the 1920s to the post- independence years, when public housing became one of the most pressing needs in independent Singapore. They end with 1978, with the Pandan Valley Condominium, an iconic suburban housing project near Holland Road which became known for its stepped-block look.\n\nCollectively, the project features 649 photographs and each of the three books is written up in two sections: elements and feature buildings.\n\nThe elements section is like an architectural lesson for readers, exploring design elements such as form, type and materials that were popular in that period.\n\nFor example, tower-on-podium buildings such as the Malaysia-Singapore Airlines Building (1968) in Robinson Road gained traction in the late 1960s. Aside from having retail and public amenities, the podiums also provide shelter for pedestrians while the tower blocks are usually used for offices.\n\nThere are 34 design elements such as textured plaster, which was popularised in the inter-war years as an alternative to ornamental masonry; and fair-faced brickwork, which was used extensively after the war because it was cheaper than other options. Each element is illustrated with pictures of various buildings around town.\n\nThe next section features buildings that have used a combination of these elements. A total of 44 buildings are highlighted, including the old National Stadium and National Library, both of which have since been demolished.\n\nIt is a volume of epic proportions - and not simply in size. The project, which was funded by various sources including the Urban Redevelopment Authority Aude Grant, the National Heritage Board Heritage Project Grant, private donations from architects and in kind, took 10 years to complete.\n\nBefore this, the original idea for the book, which was taken on by another architect, intended to feature only 30 iconic buildings here. But that architect left the project and the trio \"inherited\" it. As the research gathered momentum, they collated a list of 400 buildings and decided to go in a different direction.\n\nMs Tan says: \"We did extensive fieldwork and found that many buildings were still in existence - everyday buildings that people are familiar with. These would not have made it to the list of 30, so we decided to change the approach.\"\n\nThey divided up the research and worked on the project in their free time and from overseas, such as when Mr Ho went to Italy to pursue his master's degree for three years at the University of Genoa in 2005. They wrote thousands of letters to building owners to gain access for photo shoots. And they found material in the unlikeliest places.\n\nOn a trip to London for another work project, Mr Ho chanced upon old copies of Singaporean architectural journals, which had been sent there for record keeping. During the colonial years, Singapore's budding architecture fraternity was affiliated with the Royal Institute of British Architects, says Mr Ho, explaining the existence of these journals. Published inside were much-needed original building plans as well as photographs.\n\nThe team also conducted interviews with veteran architects such as Mr William Lim, whose work included the People's Park Complex in Chinatown; and Datuk Seri Lim Chong Keat, who worked on the Singapore Conference Hall in Shenton Way.\n\nThey even hunted down descendants of architects who had died such as Ms Sandy Lincoln, daughter of Mr Lincoln Page, a British senior architect with the Singapore Improvement Trust - the predecessor to the Housing and Development Board - who designed flats in Tiong Bahru, among other works. She shared a photograph collection of her father's work and was able to recall life in colonial Singapore.\n\nMr Ho says: \"It was by luck we got to know that they were around and where to find them. We were hoping they might have kept their father's records or could tell us from their memories. There aren't many things written about them.\"\n\nWhile the authors fulfilled their architectural passion project, launching the book was bittersweet as the photographer died before he saw it in print: Award-winning architectural photographer Jeremy San, who worked on the project alone, died from an illness two years ago, aged 36.\n\nThe authors fondly recall how Mr San, who was a runner-up at the 2012 Icon de Martell Cordon Bleu photography award, would go to each location multiple times, at various times of the day, to see how different the space would look.\n\nFor example, he captured a mesmerising image of the main staircase of the Market Street Carpark, which has been demolished. At about 4pm, the sunlight cast beautiful shadows through the latticed concrete walls onto the mosaic tiles, creating a stunning picture that played with shapes and light.\n\nThere is also a sense of nostalgia as the reader flips through the books, conjured up in part by his use of slide photography rather than a digital camera. Mr Ho says: \"Jeremy was like a collector of these spaces and the way he photographed them is different. Looking at the pictures, you don't feel his presence in it, but rather, it is as if you are standing in the space yourself.\"\n\nEven as this visual dictionary of Singapore's architectural history was launched last month, the authors are not taking a break, but are preparing for the debut of Volume Two next year - an encyclopaedia-like book on the modern architectural history of Singapore. It will also contain rare archival photographs and building plans.\n\nBut they have ruled out working on a similar book to their first volume, which would continue where they left off into the 1980s and onwards.\n\nGiven that they were born in the 1970s, Ms Tan says: \"When you're contemporaneous to a building, you tend to go in with a more critical viewpoint because you know how it came to be. You'll question why it couldn't be better.\n\n\"But for these buildings, you'll see them with a historical perspective. We see it in its context - that it was a product of its time.\"\n\nnatashaz@sph.com\n\nOur Modern Past ($120) is available at Books Kinokuniya Singapore Main Store; Times Bookstores outlets such as at Paragon, Cold Storage Jelita and Plaza Singapura; Tango Mango Books & Gifts; Select Books; and Basheer Graphic Books.\n\nIconic buildings in Singapore\n\n1. National Library\n\nNever has a building stirred up debate like the National Library.\n\nThe iconic red-brick building in Stamford Road was torn down in 2004 to make way for a tunnel.\n\nThe authorities also had to realign Stamford Road so that the Singapore Management University would have sizeable land to build on and traffic volume in the area could be managed.\n\nThose in favour of keeping the building were outraged when the Preservation of Monuments Board said in 1999 that the library did not have \"enough merit\" to be gazetted as a national monument.\n\nAlternative suggestions that would have preserved the building were rejected.\n\nAs students from the architecture faculty, Mr Ho Weng Hin and Ms Tan Kar Lin were vocal about their disappointment with the decision and that included writing letters to the press.\n\nAnyone who has been to the library will probably cite the front porch as the most recognisable spot, as many once hung out there. Also iconic were the unpainted bricks, made in local kilns, which formed the facade. The library was officially declared open by former Singapore president Yusof Ishak on Nov 12, 1960.\n\nThere were plans to reconstruct the structure as a pavilion, but they were ditched because of technical and cost constraints.\n\n2. Chee Guan Chiang House\n\nAmid the shiny new malls and condominiums, this 77-year-old derelict structure is the house that Orchard Road forgot.\n\nCompleted in 1938, it was designed and built by Mr Ho Kwong Yew, one of the leading architects of the Modern Movement who also designed the original Haw Par Villa. Its style was a departure from traditional forms such as pitched roofs and ornate decorations.\n\nThe building in Grange Road, which is designed as a main house with a smaller house within it, was commissioned by Mr Chee Guan Chiang, the eldest son of the first chairman of OCBC group.\n\nAs the house of a rich man, it boasted an expansive garden, curved verandahs and spacious rooms. The occupants also enjoyed modern sanitation - a luxury at that time.\n\nLooking at the interiors, it is likely that its owner threw extravagant parties. Enter the reception hall and a grand staircase flanked by stylish metal rails greets visitors.\n\nThe dramatic staircase is lit by natural sunlight streaming in through the rows of stained-glass panes, which were proof of the owner's opulent tastes.\n\nThe main house was given conservation status by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 2008.\n\nIt is a popular haunt for photography buffs, despite it being closed off.\n\n3. Post War Tiong Bahru \"Red Flats\"\n\nThose who love to hear the birds sing will remember fondly these two blocks of public flats in Tiong Bahru Road.\n\nAside from housing two- and three-room apartments, there was also a coffee shop called Wah Heng on the ground floor of Block 53. Here, bird owners would hang their cages on a metal structure before catching up with friends over coffee.\n\nResidents would refer to the twin blocks, completed in 1951, as \"hong wu\" or red house, as the original facade had a \"burnt-brick red colour wash\".\n\nEach unit had a spacious verandah, while the roof terraces were a hive of communal activity as residents would head upstairs to catch the breeze, rest at pavilions there or dry their laundry.\n\nIt is the first public housing flats to be converted into a hotel. The Link Hotel was completed about eight years ago and has 150 rooms.\n\nOur Modern Past's authors write that the renovations - these included closing verandahs and a pedestrian bridge linking the two flats - \"appear to be unsympathetic to the original design intent of the Red Flats\".\n\nJeremy San photographed the flats before renovation works started on the building.\n\n4. People's Park Complex\n\nWith its loud green-yellow facade, the 42-year-old building in Eu Tong Sen Street is a landmark and the heart of Chinatown. The six-storey podium of shops and offices was completed and opened in October 1970 and the 25-storey residential block in 1973.\n\nWhile mixed-use developments are common in Singapore today, the People's Park Complex was considered a pioneer in the genre when it was completed at the cost of $12 million.\n\nThe site was once an open public park before it was turned into Pearl's Market, with outdoor stalls. It was destroyed in a fire in 1966.\n\nDesign Partnership - now known as DP Architects, a successful home-grown firm - created the 102.7m-tall building in Brutalist style. The bulky, towering building was an in-your-face creation with its heavy usage of concrete. One celebrated zone is its \"interlocking atria\" where people gathered among kiosks on the ground floor, much like wandering among market stalls.\n\n5. Change Alley Aerial Plaza\n\nShopping in a \"mid-air shopping complex\" (read: bridge with air-conditioning and stores) was a radical concept when the Change Alley Aerial Plaza was opened in 1973. It was designed by local architect KK Tan & Associates.\n\nFeaturing a rolled steel-glass paned bridge, which links Clifford Pier to Clifford Centre, the centrepiece of this plaza was the revolving Red Lantern restaurant at the top of the 12-storey tower.\n\nThere was also a lookout deck below the restaurant for members of the public to take in the view of the bay as they sipped drinks at the coffeehouse.\n\nIt was named after the Change Alley of London, where stockbrokers congregated, but it also housed money-changers who did business with visiting seamen and tourists.\n\nThose who frequented Change Alley's shops - it was a mix of tailors, jewellers and those selling international souvenirs, among others - will remember its \"futuristic space pods\", which had curved shop windows. It also had a cafe along its tiled corridors.\n\nThe tower has since been conserved, while the bridge has been given a modern update.\n\nHowever, the name Change Alley no longer exists. They are both now part of the OUE Bayfront, a commercial property which includes an 18-storey office tower at 50 Collyer Quay.\n\n6. Victoria School\n\nThis storied school moved several times from Kampong Glam to Syed Alwi, which is near Victoria Bridge, before it settled at this Tyrwhitt Road location in 1933.\n\nThe school was designed by Public Works Department (PWD) architect Frank Dorrington Ward, who also designed the former Supreme Court.\n\nDuring World War II, Victoria School was used by the Japanese and teachers had to follow a Japanese-only school syllabus. After the war ended in 1945, the school was used as a hospital for a short while before it welcomed students again.\n\nThe PWD experimented with school designs by building a multi-purpose hall above a naturally ventilated canteen in 1967.\n\nAfter that, the all-boys school moved out in 1984 to its new home in Geylang Bahru. In 2003, it moved to Siglap Link.\n\nChrist Church Secondary School used the Tyrwhitt Road site between 1985 and 2001. In 2007, the main classroom, administrative block, hall and canteen block were gazetted for conservation and turned into the People's Association (PA) headquarters in 2009.\n\nSources: Our Modern Past, National Library Board, URA\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore\n\nArchitecture", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_NZPASTCAYP_1357529e_2x.jpg?VersionId=rH0M5kGd7pd5mN_RHmghZinDs11v7CNn", "alt_text": "Chee Guan Chiang House. -- PHOTO: JEREMY SAN"}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_NZPAST1W3M_1357518e_2x.jpg?VersionId=E6ZqylUFCEBpVXuCmQnL71Emi.kFw_c7", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_NZPASTLL5M_1357530e_2x.jpg?VersionId=V2oAk6ZFX_j4EUxKGTAc6l37gLojzSTk", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_NZPAST_1357493e_2x.jpg?VersionId=7DTmFoOqpn2PW92HJLhouGPvTlSdX3a4", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_NZPAST0GIJ_1357519e_2x.jpg?VersionId=r1XphksRKGf8plD_walv270IJQbVoPvZ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_NZPASTDQJR_1357528e_2x.jpg?VersionId=gn__5RqbKoESLgzmlTlYqiOHmQZAHSDQ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_NZPASTNF35_1357531e_2x.jpg?VersionId=ikD.ySV8E6DzqilcndIWF17sYYdpmERE", "alt_text": null}]}

The game has changed so much now.\"\n\nYes, it has.\n\nBut one cannot help but wonder how the current crop would cope with legendary Singapore coach Choo Seng Quee's training regimen, which harnessed 1960s talents like Majid Ariff and Lee Kok Seng.\n\nPerhaps 1.87m-tall Irfan would boost his aerial prowess heading leather footballs soaked in water.\n\nOr would Young Lions captain Al-Qaasimy Rahman be even more vocal if he had to lead his squad in singing the National Anthem at the top of their lungs at sunrise?\n\nToday, a mini-army of sports scientists, nutritionists and physiotherapists surround Irfan and his team-mates.\n\nInstead of stop-watches and weathered boots that require the studs to be screwed on, they don lightweight shoes and special vests that track heart rates, distance covered and average speeds during training.\n\nThe times are a-changing. As Seak put it succinctly, football in the 1970s was about \"discipline, long balls, and running... plenty of running.\"\n\nAnd, of course, the Kallang Roar.\n\nThe cauldron of noise at the old National Stadium was fuelled by an iconic Lions line-up.\n\nIn between bites of curry puff and crackers, the fans' appetite was sated by \"gelek\" dribbler Dollah Kassim, acrobatic forward Quah Kim Song and \"banana kick\" specialist S. Rajagopal - all heroes of the 1977 Malaysia Cup-winning outfit.\n\nThey adopted an attacking 4-2-4 formation, pressing high up the field to win the ball back and pounce on retreating backlines.\n\nSometimes, they left gaps in their own half.\n\n\"The crowd didn't mind us losing some matches as long as we stuck to attacking football,\" said Seak, the Lions' youngest captain at 20.\n\n\"I remember fans being happier with a 4-3 defeat than a 0-0 draw.\"\n\nAs the game got faster, tactics evolved to place greater emphasis on midfield superiority.\n\nWith a nascent attack of Fandi and V. Sundramoorthy spearheading a 4-4-2 set-up, Singapore reached the SEA Games final in 1983, 1985 and 1989.\n\nTwice, they fell to Thailand, led by wondrous striker Piyapong Pue-on, and once to Malaysia, boasting hit-men Mokhtar Dahari and Dollah Salleh.\n\n\"Those were some of the most intense games I've ever played,\" said Sundram, 49, whose full-bodied mullet has been replaced by a short haircut with greying sideburns.\n\n\"Even as forwards, we had to drop back to pack the midfield because the more players you had there, you generally controlled the game better.\"\n\nTry as they might, the Lions could never get their paws on the SEA Games gold, making their last appearance in the final in 1989.\n\nStill, whether it was two in midfield during Seak's days or a pack of four when Sundram dazzled, there was one constant.\n\nThe Singapore team those days never backed down from a fight.\n\nFollowing in the bootsteps of Syed Mutalib and Robert Sim in the 1970s, the next decade witnessed more unforgiving tacklers like Borhan Abu Samah, Sudiat Dali and Malek Awab.\n\n\"Something that I think that's missing among our footballers today is the pride and passion,\" said midfielder Malek, 54, who featured at seven different SEA Games.\n\n\"When I put on the national jersey, I was willing to bleed and break bones for my country.\"\n\nHe was first to tackles, but the ever-affable Malek was nearly an hour late for this interview at the Singapore Sports School, earning a gentle rebuke from former team-mate Sundram.\n\nIn their prime in the 1990s, the duo featured in matches worthy of repeat YouTube viewings.\n\nFew will forget Fandi's diving header that sank Kedah, sparked by two ferocious tackles from Malek. Or Sundram's overhead kick against Brunei, where the ball was played out from the back.\n\n\"We played as a team - everyone pressed to win back the ball, and everyone was involved in our build-up play,\" Sundram noted.\n\nNodding in approval, Seak added: \"Unless you have Messi or Ronaldo, you can't just depend on one or two players to win matches.\"\n\nToday, intricate 4-2-3-1 and 3-3-3-1 formations are in vogue.\n\nFull-backs are expected to cross like wingers, goalkeepers must have two good feet, and centre-forwards should be both mobile and powerful.\n\nWith Thailand's re-emergence as regional kingpins, Singapore - once again - find themselves playing catch-up, not helped by a stagnating youth pipeline.\n\nOnly three of the eight local S-League clubs run youth programmes, while the National Football Academy has been criticised for its limited outreach and inconsistent curriculum.\n\nSeak, formerly the director of coaching at the Football Association of Singapore, wants to see more kids playing the game regularly, and at a younger age.\n\nHe said: \"This is, by far, the country's most popular sport.\n\n\"We religiously follow European leagues, yet can't get our very own game right.\n\n\"Right now, for the most part, we don't have the right people or the right programmes to run football.\"\n\nFinding more uncompromising coaches in the vein of Walker would be a good place to start.\n\nnsanjay@sph.com.sg\n\nSEAK POH LEONG\n\nTOP HONOUR\n\nSeap Games\n\nBronze: 1975\n\nHe was the tireless dynamo in midfield who allowed his more skilful team-mates to flourish.\n\nAs Dollah Kassim and Arshad Khamis skipped past one opponent after another, and Quah Kim Song threw his body at odd angles to connect with diving headers at the end of crosses, Seak Poh Leong stationed himself near the centre circle.\n\nHe was the protector of the backline, using his keen football sense to intercept through-balls and close down dangerous adversaries.\n\nAs former Singapore coach Trevor Hartley aptly put it, Seak \"held things together\".\n\nThe midfielder, who was the Lions' youngest captain at age 20, may have never tasted success at the international level. But he has fond memories of being part of the team that inspired the Kallang Roar.\n\n\"I wouldn't swop my experiences with guys like Dollah, Kim Song and Mat Noh for any medal or trophy,\" said the 62-year-old businessman, who also served the game in various youth coaching roles at the Football Association of Singapore and Geylang International.\n\n\"It was a joy to win back the ball and pass it to those talents.\n\n\"I had a front-row seat to their magic show.\"\n\nMALEK AWAB\n\nTOP HONOURS\n\nSEA Games\n\nSilver: 1983, 1985, 1989\n\nBronze: 1991, 1993, 1995\n\nMalaysia Cup\n\nChampion (with Kuala Lumpur): 1987, 1988, 1989\n\nChampion (with Singapore): 1994\n\nMalaysian League\n\nChampion (with KL): 1988\n\nChampion (with Singapore): 1994\n\nBefore he became a firm crowd favourite as a tireless midfielder, Malek Awab was heckled by fans at the National Stadium - for blocking their view.\n\nAs a 15-year-old with big dreams but a small wallet, he sold kuachi (melon seeds) at the storied Kallang venue during football matches to earn a living.\n\nAlthough he was scolded as he went about his job in the terraces, a dream to become a professional player was born.\n\nIn school though, he was forced to play badminton as teachers told him that he was too small to play football. But a trial for Farrer Park United's youth team would change his life.\n\nHe may stand at a mere 1.66m, but Malek's energetic displays made him stand tall on the pitch.\n\n\"There were some people who didn't believe in me, even later in my career, so I played to prove them wrong,\" the 54-year-old says with his trademark toothy grin.\n\n\"There's always a smile on my face. But I like to think that I was a beast on the field.\"\n\nV. SUNDRAMOORTHY\n\nTOP HONOURS\n\nSEA Games\n\nSilver: 1983, 1985\n\nBronze: 1993\n\nMalaysia Cup\n\nChampion (with Kedah): 1990\n\nMalaysian Super League\n\nChampion (LionsXII coach): 2013\n\nMention V. Sundramoorthy's name to Singapore football fans and the memory of his overhead kick against Brunei in 1993 inevitably crops up.\n\nBut for \"The Dazzler\" himself, the goal that stands out in his 17-year career was scored against Malaysia's \"Spider-Man\" at the 1983 SEA Games.\n\nIn front of 55,000 raucous fans at the old National Stadium, Sundram fondly recalls his 47th-minute strike against goalkeeper R. Arumugam, who earned the nickname for his exceptionally long arms and reflex saves. The custodian was tragically killed in a car crash in 1988.\n\nSundram's strike proved to be the decider in a 2-1 group-stage win over their arch-rivals, who boasted top Malaysian stars like Santokh Singh, Zainal Abidin and Lim Teong Kim.\n\nSundram, whose team went on to claim the silver, said: \"Fandi (Ahmad) challenged for the ball in the box. I anticipated the second ball, beat my marker to it and volleyed it into the top corner. It was the one time I saw Arumugam helpless.\"\n\nIRFAN FANDI\n\nPicture this: You are the youngest player of a team charged with ending Singapore's long chase for a first SEA Games football gold.\n\nYou are playing in front of an expectant home crowd, wearing the same jersey number of your father, arguably the country's most famous player.\n\nOh, and it doesn't matter that your dad never won the gold - you are expected to.\n\nWelcome to the pressure-cooker world of 17-year-old Irfan Fandi.\n\nThe public first caught a glimpse of his talent at the 2013 Lion City Cup at the Jalan Besar Stadium.\n\nFaced with the pressure of living up to Fandi Ahmad's legacy, the teenager struck against the Under-15s of Arsenal and German club Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nApart from his finishing, the 1.87m striker has impressed with his physical strength, aerial power and sound technique.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm quite used to the pressure and expectations people have of me,\" says Irfan, who has been attached to Chilean top-tier outfit Universidad Catolica since 2013.\n\n\"I just don't want to let my team down. Coach Aide (Iskandar) has picked me in spite of my age, so my aim is to prove him right.\"\n\nFandi picked 17 as his lucky number because one and seven adds up to eight, which means prosperity in Chinese. With Irfan taking on the same digits, Singapore fans hope this will translate into goals and gold.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_SPTHARISS_8_1364585e_2x.jpg?VersionId=773xlLliYbVqDHvsU.wjGK1BD_JQDzXK", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_SPTSOCMO3N_1364017e_2x.jpg?VersionId=Au_s_FxNLxun14EML.v7.nQeXAjnXixy", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

Hence, I know I can do it too.\"\n\nWhile the upcoming Games could be the last one for veteran Wee, they could prove to be a springboard to greater achievements for the younger athletes in the Singapore team.\n\nHo Lin Ying, 16, gold medallist in taijiquan (compulsory) at the 2013 World Wushu Championships, will be making her Games debut along with fellow 16-year-old Lim Si Wei.\n\nZoe Mui, 18, and Jesse Colin Adalia, 17, both silver medallists at the Nanjing Sports Lab - which was held alongside the 2014 Youth Olympic Games - will also step onto the mat for their second taste of the SEA Games at the Singapore Expo next weekend.\n\nZoe, who will be competing in three events, is looking forward to the experience.\n\n\"My family and friends will be coming over, and this motivates me, because I want to do better and make them proud,\" said the Singapore Polytechnic student.\n\nWhile she was part of the duilian (bare hands) team who won silver at the last SEA Games, she is not setting any medal targets. She added: \"I just want to do my best, and the medals will be a bonus.\"\n\nThis view was echoed by Yong, who noted that the team's success is not based solely on results.\n\nHe concluded: \"My personal goal is to put up a good show for whoever is watching.

But her desire to right wrongs and fight for the weak and exploited has not dulled.\n\nIt explains why she has given up a cushy corporate life to devote her time to social causes.\n\nFor more than a decade, she sat on the board of the National Committee for Unifem Singapore where she held positions of president and vice-president.\n\nAs co-chair of its anti-trafficking committee from 2003 to 2012, she engaged the Government as well as the public and private sectors to raise awareness about human trafficking.\n\nAfter that, she worked on gender issues and gender rights in Cambodia and Myanmar for the United Nations Development Programme. Three years ago, the articulate woman returned to Singapore where she became vice-chair of Suara Musyawarah, a committee to engage the Malay Muslim community on important issues.\n\nThe co-founder of Aidha, a business school for migrants and low-income communities, she is spearheading New Life Stories, an initiative to help former women inmates bond with their children through reading.\n\nChatty and gregarious, Ms Saleemah is comfortably ensconced in a settee in the spartanly furnished three-room Circuit Road flat she shares with her mother, a former washerwoman.\n\nThe youngest of six children, Ms Saleemah has lived in the same flat all her life. The minimalist look, she says, is deliberate.\n\nThe floor space is perfect for chit chat and communal dining when loved ones and friends come calling, which is often.\n\nIn fact, her late father, a kindly store-keeper with a big heart, practised an open door policy, often welcoming needy strangers into their midst.\n\n\"My father used to say, 'As long as there is floor space, as long as they are happy to eat what we eat, anybody can stay here',\" she recalls.\n\nAlthough it is now safe and pleasant, the neighbourhood, she says, was not a salubrious place in the 1970s when she was growing up.\n\n\"It was the wild, wild West, with a lot of drugs, sex and violence,\" says Ms Saleemah, who recalls witnessing suicide, domestic violence, gang fights and drug abuse from her kitchen window.\n\nA physically abused neighbour two floors down hanged herself, two of her friends were gang-raped after running away from home, and several junkies in the neighbourhood ended up in jail for drug trafficking. One even got executed for killing a policeman during a struggle.\n\nThere were many attempts to pull her into the sleaze.\n\n\"When I was 10 or 11, I was offered glue to sniff. I rejected not because I thought it would kill my brain cells but because it looked like phlegm in a bag. That was enough to make me want to throw up,\" she recalls with a laugh.\n\nMen offered her money for sex, but not once did she think of succumbing because the security of growing up in a loving family, she says, made her grounded.\n\n\"I grew up in a very protected space, and I grew up with much love. I don't need to do things for gratification or validation,\" she says.\n\n\"My dad set the tone, he was a very polite man and never raised his voice. He named me Saleemah, which means the protected one,\" she adds. Her father died when she was nine.\n\nA self-starter, the former Cedar Girls' student breezed through school.\n\n\"I wasn't hardworking but I paid attention and had a good memory. I would have liked it if someone had sat down with me and asked me, 'What are your life goals?' My life could have turned out differently,\" she says.\n\nAt 17, she became a bit of a searcher.\n\n\"I started reading Nietzsche and other philosophers and asking myself what the meaning of life was,\" she says, grinning at the recollection.\n\nAfter completing her A levels at Nanyang Junior College in 1987, she decided to skip university.\n\n\"I read a lot and decided that intellectual pursuit was far better than the pursuit of wealth. I studied all the religions, went to various places of workship and met pastors, monks and nuns.\"\n\nShe found a job working as a customer service officer in a bank. But every opportunity she got, she travelled.\n\n\"I backpacked from Bombay to Goa, travelled across Western Europe, and went from Jakarta to Bali and the little islands in between.\"\n\nProfessionally, she did not do too shabbily either. She made good money doing business development and marketing for companies including courier company TNT and The Asian Banker, a company providing information for the financial services industry.\n\nBut in 2000, her life turned an unexpected corner when a close friend told her she had been raped in her teens.\n\nThe revelation stunned her and brought back memories of all the lives she had seen destroyed by rape and violence when she was growing up.\n\n\"I told myself I wanted to do what I could to support and help women,\" she says.\n\nSo she wrote to a few NGOs, offering her services as a volunteer. None of them replied except for Unifem, now renamed UN Women. Her first assignment was to translate for a group of nurses and doctors sent by Unifem to Batam, Indonesia, to teach sex workers there about safe sex.\n\nIt was a disaster, she says. Seeing sex workers aged as young as 11 and listening to their stories, she started crying.\n\n\"I was not wired to be a translator. I was supposed to be neutral but I was crying. I was also not supposed to have opinions but I could not just sit there talking about safe sex when I strongly felt that more needed to be done,\" she says.\n\nAfter one more such trip, she went back to Unifem and told the then president - social activist Melissa Kwee - that they needed to do more than talk about safe sex; they needed to stop trafficking.\n\nNot long after, she became Unifem's vice-president, and started beavering away on an action plan to raise awareness about the issue.\n\n\"It was a very personal and wonderful journey. Every time I talked to a person who had been sexually exploited, I saw myself. What made me different was the family I had. I felt that I had been given blessings and abundance that they didn't have,\" says Ms Saleemah, who joined Unifem full-time in 2005 and sat on its anti-trafficking committee for nearly a decade.\n\n\"I felt that I was doing it for my sisters. I looked into their eyes and saw how broken they were. That was what drove me,\" she adds, brushing away tears.\n\nIgnoring naysayers, she and several compadres at Unifem engaged not just the private sector but the Government as well.\n\nIn 2005, they even organised a conference on trafficking. They approached embassy officials, regional NGOs working on trafficking, and other interested parties.\n\n\"We wrote to them and said, 'We would like to invite you to Singapore to share how you dealt with the problem. But we don't have any money and you would have to pay your own way,\" she says, adding that more than 140 people attended the conference, held at Hilton Hotel.\n\nLast November, the Singapore Government passed the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act.\n\n\"It was a long journey and many helped to push the cause. Credit must be given to people like Kanwaljit Soin and Braema Mathi who raised the issue in Parliament,\" she says, referring to the two former Nominated Members of Parliament.\n\nIn 2008, she took up an appointment with the United Nations Development Programme to work in Cambodia and Myanmar.\n\n\"In Cambodia, it was working with women to see how they could get involved in politics both as politicians and voters. In Myanmar, it was working with local NGOs to help them plug into the bigger non-profit world out there.\"\n\nThe stints, she says, were invaluable.\n\n\"In Cambodia, I learnt a lot about love and forgiveness. Many of the activists suffered so much but they are still filled with so much love for their land. It made me realise that no matter how small and how crowded Singapore is, it will always be home.\"\n\nThat realisation awakened in her an urge to return home and contribute to the little red dot.\n\n\"The universe works in strange ways. Two days after I made the decision to come home, I received a call asking if I would be keen on a project,\" she says.\n\nThat project was Suara Musyawarah - which means the voice of lively discussion in Malay - which was set up to collect feedback on the needs, concerns and aspirations of Malays.\n\nOver six months, Ms Saleemah and a committee talked to 500 community members at 35 focus group sessions. Their feedback on issues ranging from education to aspirations was compiled into a 70-page candid, unvarnished report in 2013.\n\nFor the past year, she has been helming New Life Stories, a social enterprise which works with formerly incarcerated women and their children.\n\nMs Saleemah's biggest wish is to break cycles of negativity, from poverty to violence.\n\nHer interviews with women inmates reveal that many nurse a lot of pain.\n\n\"There's a lot of forgiveness which they need to go through - forgiveness for their parents, their children, themselves. Almost all of them say they cannot forgive themselves for the pain they cause their children.\"\n\nNew Life Stories is her way of helping mothers and their children reconnect. The aim, she says, is not pedagogical.\n\n\"It's reading for the sheer joy of it. It doesn't matter if your English is broken or your pronunciation is wrong.

She practises ancestor worship and goes to Chinese temples to pray for health and peace. Ven Goh recalls: \"She got all the relatives to come the next day to try to dissuade me.\"\n\nFrom then on, he kept his aspiration a secret. Although his family's finances went through some rough times - his father's trading business went bust in the 1998 economic crisis - Ven Goh says his growing-up years were generally happy.\n\nHe continued to read books about Buddhism through his secondary school days at Assumption English School. He still thought about becoming a monk, but his aspiration dimmed somewhat with \"materialistic happiness\".\n\nHe says: \"I was the top student in class. I also had a group of friends and we would often go to play arcade games after school to enjoy ourselves. Life was good.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Worried about what would happen to him and his brother, who was eight years younger, he could not concentrate on his studies and instead of the expected As, got Bs and Cs for his O Levels.\n\nHe says: \"I became disenchanted with secular life. I saw that not everything would go according to our will or expectations.\"\n\nTogether with his father, who won custody of the children, he became a Buddhist. He also resolved anew to take up the monastic path, believing that he could make faster progress spiritually than if he were to remain a lay Buddhist.\n\nWhen he told his parents about his intention, they were more receptive this time. Having gone through a divorce, they saw no point in forcing their child to get married.\n\nHe signed up for a meditation course and went for his first meditation retreat.\n\nAfter he completed his studies in chemical process technology from Singapore Polytechnic, he entered national service. All this time, his resolve to become a monk never wavered.\n\nHe says: \"I was just waiting to complete NS because one needs to be free of government debt to get ordained.\"\n\nMeanwhile, to condition himself to the life of a monk, he went for Buddhist meditation retreats at least once a year.\n\nA few months after his national service, he was ordained in the Theravada tradition at Santi Forest Monastery in Johor in a ceremony attended by his parents and brother. He was 23 years old.\n\nHe spent the next four years away from city life, first staying at the forest monastery in Johor and then at various forest monasteries in Thailand. There was flooding during the rainy seasons and during winter, he had to put on more robes.\n\nHe says: \"My teacher wanted me to realise that inner peace comes from within and is not dependent on external factors.\"\n\nAt the end of 2012, he returned to Singapore and is now a resident monk at Palelai Buddhist Temple in Bedok Walk. Among other things, he is in charge of the accommodation for visiting monks.\n\nLife after ordination has its \"ups and downs\". He says: \"You still have to deal with people's politics. There are quarrels and disputes. But this is a human problem which existed even in Buddha's time.\n\n\"Our practice is to just be mindful of anything that comes, tell ourselves that it's impermanent, and let it go.\"\n\nAs a monk, he has to adhere to 227 precepts including remaining celibate. It has not been too difficult, he says, as he has been practising most of them even before he got ordained.\n\nHe says of his training as a monk: \"We were asked to meditate and contemplate on the foulness of the human body to help us reduce our attachment to it.\"\n\nHis parents visit him regularly. His father, Mr Anthony Goh, 57, works as a taxi driver while his mother, Madam Lee Geok Mui, 53, today runs a small spa business.\n\nSays Madam Lee of her son: \"I wanted him to go to university and get a job after that. But when I saw how much he wanted to do this, I had to let him go. And now that I see he's happy, I am happy for him too and wish him well.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nTemples", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_VESAK_GOHCHUNKI_1363200e_2x.jpg?VersionId=eWd8UpIrEUvwXUdpaZMrHfDWyjOoDEUG", "alt_text": "Venerable Goh Chun Kiang collecting cooked food from people at a food centre.

He is undertaking studies in the European community, Norway, Britain and Australia.\n\nHis research influenced the 1989 Children Act, the 2005 Children Act, the 2006 Childcare Bill and policies on childcare, early education and parental support in Britain and other countries.\n\nHe has served as an expert witness to several House of Commons select committees and been a scientific adviser to research councils and several governments. He is also a consultant to the European Commission, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and World Health Organisation\n\nThe aim was to see if pre-school has a long-term impact on the children's academic and social behavioural development.\n\nTherefore, information on the children, their parents, the home environments and their pre-school settings was collected.\n\nTheir developmental progress was monitored until they entered school and later at key time points (ages six, seven, 10, 11 and 14). The latest study released last year investigated the students' academic and social behavioural outcomes at age 16 and their educational, training and employment choices.\n\nThe study compared the children's pre-school experience and their General Certificate of Secondary Education results. The GCSE is equivalent to the GCE O Level Examination that students here take at the end of secondary school.\n\nSays Prof Melhuish of the results released in September last year: \"The evidence is clear - pre-school education is beneficial. Children who attend pre-school end up with better GCSE results, which means they will go on to earn more money in later life.\"\n\nThe study showed that the benefit of going to any type of pre-school, rather than staying at home, was equivalent to getting seven B grades at GCSE rather than seven C grades.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which did further analysis, the higher grades would translate to an additional \u00a327,000 over their lifetime.\n\nThe study also found a link between the amount of time spent in pre-school, and GCSE results.\n\nChildren who attended for two or three years, whether full-time or part-time, did better in GCSE English and maths at age 16, according to the research.\n\nPre-school had a bigger impact on maths than English.\n\nProf Melhuish explains: \"This is probably because, at home, parents do more to build literacy skills in their children, like reading to them. They don't focus so much on building numeracy skills. So the institutional experiences, like in the pre-school or in the school, can affect numeracy outcomes more compared to the home, because the home does so little for the numeracy outcomes.\"\n\nHe goes on to point out another significant finding of the study.\n\nThe children who had pre-school education showed a more positive attitude towards education and more pro-social behaviour and self-regulation than the children without any pre-school experience.\n\n\"Self-regulation is as important as learning your ABCs and 123s. Kids with good self-regulation can pay attention to classroom activities and ignore distractions.\"\n\nProfessor Melhuish says Singapore is on the right track in giving priority to children from disadvantaged homes in Ministry of Education-run kindergartens.\n\nOne-third of the places in the kindergartens are reserved for children from lower- income homes.\n\nKey study shows benefits of pre-school education\n\nThe Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary (EPPSE) project started in 1997 and was the first major longitudinal study in Europe to investigate the impact of pre-school provision on a national sample of children.\n\nThe final reports on the study, released last year, looked at the influences on students' academic and social outcomes at age 16.\n\nThe research also estimates some of the economic returns from society's investment in early education.\n\nResearch was conducted through a nationally representative sample of children in 141 pre-school settings, and was drawn in 1997 from five English regions.\n\nA sample of children, who had no or minimal pre-school experience, were recruited to the study at entry to school, for comparison with the pre-school group.\n\nEPPSE researchers assessed the children at recruitment to the study to create a profile of each child's intellectual and social-behavioural development.\n\nThey used standardised assessments and reports from the pre-school worker who knew the child best.\n\nChildren were assessed again at entry to school, and the children have been followed up on at ages six, seven, 10 and 11 in primary school, and at ages 14 and 16 in secondary school.\n\nThe children involved are now aged between 19 and 22.\n\nAt GCSE, the benefits of going to pre-school translate into an extra 41 points - the difference between getting, for example, seven grade Bs compared with seven Cs.\n\nAdditional analysis of the EPPSE findings by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) shows that there are also economic returns.\n\nThe IFS estimated that children who have attended pre-school will be \u00a327,000 (S$56,000) better off over a lifetime.\n\nHe refers to the findings on children from disadvantaged homes.\n\n\"Pre-school benefited children from disadvantaged homes even more, especially if they attended pre-schools which were of high quality and where there were children from different social backgrounds,\" he says, before going on to explain why pre-school has a bigger impact on this group.\n\n\"It comes down to having little learning opportunity at home. So going to a high-quality pre-school will not only give them a good foundation for numeracy and literacy skills, but it will also teach them the other skills that studies show are increasingly important - the ability to self-regulate and cooperate with other people better.\"\n\nHe adds: \"But perhaps just as important, attending a good pre-school teaches children that learning can be enjoyable and that they can be good at it. Their more developed cognitive and social skills, along with this positive attitude towards learning and school, point them in the direction of academic success.\"\n\nBut what makes a high-quality pre-school?\n\nHe says although \"quality\" can refer to a number of factors, research indicates that the most important factor in determining quality of pre-school programmes may be what teachers do, and how they do it, when interacting with children.\n\nProf Melhuish goes on to make a strong case for governments to provide pre-school education, especially for disadvantaged children, from an earlier age - no later than two.\n\n\"There is mounting evidence that early childhood is a crucial period when the brain is most malleable, when interventions are most cost-effective for at-risk kids.\n\n\"For example, there is an American study which has pointed out the importance of parent talk from age 0 to 4 and how it is the basis for learning for a child. So it is important to start earlier, not wait till age five,\" he says.\n\nHe says the EPPSE study is unique because it provides valuable evidence on the long-term value of pre-school.\n\nHe refers to two other studies, both in the US - the Perry Pre-school Project in Michigan in the 1960s and the Abecedarian experiment conducted in North Carolina in the early 1970s which also tracked children into adulthood.\n\nThe Perry Pre-school Project involved providing high-quality pre-school education to a group of three- and four-year-olds living in poverty and assessed to be at high risk of school failure.\n\nThe pupils were taught by certified public school teachers with at least a bachelor's degree. The average child-teacher ratio was 6:1 and the curriculum emphasised active learning. These children were tracked for decades after leaving pre-school. Not only did more of them go on to complete high school and enter college, they also had better jobs and earned higher salaries.\n\nAccording to Prof Melhuish, the two US studies and the British study all put together make a clear case for governments to invest in early childhood education.\n\nHe points out that a cost-benefit analysis of the Perry Pre-school Programme found a rate of return of 7 to 10 per cent.\n\n\"This is well above the return on any private equity fund,\" he says, adding: \"Investments in early childhood care and education yield high returns all the way to adulthood. The research shows children who have good interactions with their parents, are read to, attend pre-school and in general are stimulated from birth to age five are more likely to stay in school, perform better and lead healthier and more productive lives as adults.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Life is unfair. There will always be kids born into households that have much less. Nevertheless, we have a duty to ensure that every child has a chance to reach his fullest potential.\n\n\"And this is why we need governments to turn their attention to early years education and care of children.\n\n\"Early education, especially one that is of high quality, pays off.

After his NS, he worked as a project executive at the temple where he helped organise one such retreat.\n\nHe says: \"The desire to become a monk became stronger. I was just trying to find the right teacher to guide me.\"\n\nHe has never dated and says he has always been more drawn to people's inner character than their outward appearance.\n\nAfter six months, he quit his job to study computer science at Nanyang Technological University. But in his first semester, a fellow Buddhist from his polytechnic days told him he had come across a good teacher and was planning to be ordained under his guidance.\n\nVen You Guang recalls: \"He asked me if I would like to join him and I agreed, just like that.\n\n\"Even though I was in the midst of preparing for my semester exams, ordination had been at the back of my mind. I trusted my friend, so I trusted the teacher he had chosen and I didn't want to waste any time.\"\n\nWhen he told his parents, they were caught off guard, as he expected.\n\nSays Ven You Guang: \"My dad asked if there's anything I lacked, but I told him, no, there's nothing material I lacked. I just wanted to transcend myself spiritually.\n\nHe adds: \"They were influenced by popular media and thought I would disappear forever but I reassured them I would not.\"\n\nIt took him a few weeks to persuade his parents to come around. They attended his ordination in the Mahayana tradition at Fa Hua Monastery in Upper Paya Lebar Road in 2005.\n\nHe spent the next three years there receiving monastic training in meditation, chanting and Buddhist studies. He was then involved in the setting up of an affiliated temple in Pengarang in Johor, a two-hour bumboat ride away.\n\nNow a spiritual adviser at Puat Jit Buddhist Temple in Sengkang, he conducts Buddhist classes, gives talks and meets people from different walks of life. He recently started a youth group to do volunteer work.\n\nA major challenge, he says, is his asthma, which could be worsened by dust or the smell of incense. For the last 10 years, he has been hospitalised at least once every year for the condition and last year, underwent a procedure to bring it under control.\n\nBut he has never thought of quitting.\n\nHe says: \"Whenever I feel tired, or don't wish to do something, I won't focus on myself. Instead, I will remind myself that there are a lot of people suffering out there and what I can do to help them. When you have this stronger drive behind you, you can go a long way.\"", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/31/ST_20150531_VESAK_SHIYOUGUAER37_1363717e_2x.jpg?VersionId=P5ajT.kaYFxIHtigUCuicXjbFAGI2Mjy", "alt_text": "Venerable Shi You Guang is now a spiritual adviser at Puat Jit Buddhist Temple in Sengkang, where he conducts Buddhist classes and gives talks. -- ST PHOTO: CHEW SENG KIM"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

Turner, a consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden and a team leader at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

anastrazole - to tamoxifen, researchers found anastrazole was slightly better.\n\nAfter 10 years, 93.5 per cent of women in the anastrazole group were living breast cancer-free, compared to 89.2 per cent in the tamoxifen group.\n\nThe 10-year overall survival rates were about the same in the two groups (92.5 per cent for anastrazole and 92.1 per cent for tamoxifen).\n\n\"The good news is tamoxifen and anastrazole are both very effective, but it seems that women have better chances of staying well with anastrazole,\" said lead study author Richard Margolese, a professor of surgical oncology at The Jewish General Hospital, McGill University in Montreal, Canada.\n\nA third study released at ASCO and published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that women who have a bit of extra tissue removed around the tumour during breast-conserving surgery, or partial mastectomy, face a reduced risk that cancer will be left behind.\n\nThe study involved 235 women with breast cancer diagnoses ranging from stage 0 to 3, some of whom were randomly assigned to have extra tissue around the tumor removed - known as cavity shave margins (CSM) - and some who were not.\n\n\"Despite their best efforts, surgeons could not predict where the cancer was close to the edge,\" said lead author Anees Chagpar, associate professor of surgery at the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nBut those who had cavity shave margins were half as likely to need surgery again, the study found.\n\nPatients will be followed for five years to see if survival or recurrence are influenced by the procedure.\n\n\"This randomised controlled trial has the potential to have a huge impact for breast cancer patients,\" Chagpar said.\n\n\"No one likes going back to the operating room, especially not the patients who face the emotional burden of another surgery.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCancer", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

He attended the Catholic University of America in Washington and received his law degree from the University of Maryland.

It was first applied to the Lamborghini Muira SV in 1971.\n\nAnd it was not until 1995 that Lamborghini repeated it with the Diablo SV and, most recently, the Murcielago SV in 2009.\n\nThese models, especially the Muira SV, remain the most desirable and collectable Lamborghinis to date.\n\nSo, what then is a Superveloce? Well, it is a Lamborghini that has undergone a comprehensive weight-loss programme, detailed chassis enhancements and tweaking of its V12 engine.\n\nAnd in the case of the latest Aventador SV, aerodynamic aids are part of the package.\n\nHaving been originally endowed with a full carbon-fibre monocoque chassis and body means there are slim pickings when it comes to lightening the Aventador. But Lamborghini has more tricks up its sleeves.\n\nIt has fabricated new doors, rocker and fender panels from what it calls SMC Superlight - a Boeing-developed aerospace composite using short strands of carbon-fibre in the sheet-moulding process to attain a sturdier, much lighter component.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Along with a redesigned rear end, it contributes to engine cooling and weight saving.\n\nOne of the biggest weight savings comes from a new quad-pipe rear muffler, which enhances performance and gives the exhaust a distinctive straight- through sound.\n\nAll in all, Lamborghini managed to lighten the car by 50kg, reducing its weight to 1,525kg, despite having added beefier components such as MagnaRide suspension and a variable-ratio steering system.\n\nBeing an SV also means getting a perfunctory hike in horsepower. The Aventador's engine output goes from 700bhp to 750bhp and peaks at 8,400rpm instead of 8,250rpm.\n\nThis was done by optimising the engine's variable intake system and variable valve timing. Its new and lighter muffler system, which allows freer flowing exhaust, probably contributed as well.\n\nPut that package together and the Aventador Superveloce becomes something really amazing, lapping the Nurburgring Nordschliefe circuit in just under seven minutes. Only one other series production car could match that feat: the uber-hybrid Porsche 918.\n\nThe Porsche 918 was limited to just 918 units, but the Aventador SV will be even rarer, being limited to 600 worldwide.\n\nAs we arrived to drive the car at the Catalunya F1 circuit, we were told that 500 had already been sold.\n\nBeing strapped into a beast with 750bhp, I can say I am glad it has the latest Haldex all-wheel-drive system, which is part active stability and part traction control. It can apportion as much as 60 per cent of torque to the front wheels and up to 90 per cent to the rear.\n\nThis works brilliantly with the car's MagnaRide suspension to deliver exceptional handling stability and handling flexibility.\n\nAs the test-drive was restricted to just track driving, we spent the entire session pushing the Aventador SV to the limit. There are very few cars with more than 700bhp that will allow a driver to use almost his entire performance envelope in just one morning. The car's chassis is so communicative that you can feel a slide beginning and initiate corrective action before it goes too far.\n\nThe engine is normally aspirated, allowing the throttle to be a very precise tool with which to control not only performance but also the car's handling.\n\nBack off a few millimetres and the SV's nose tightens the line. Take off even more and the tail starts to slide. Apply more power and the nose runs wide. What is really amazing is this can be done confidently because the chassis is so balanced.\n\nIn Strada (street or normal) mode, the car's electronic stability system reins in the exuberance quite early into a slide. This can be annoying for spirited drivers.\n\nSport is a much better setting for track work. You can set the transmission to full auto or manual. The Sport Auto automatically downshifts into the appropriate gear as you slow down for each corner.\n\nCorsa is the most unforgiving mode as it minimises electronic intervention and allows only manual shifting. But it is also the most satisfying mode when you get it right.\n\nThe Aventador SV is a rare find in an era of over-the-top hyper cars. It is a pure driving tool that relies on the good old combination of analogue chassis balance and naturally aspirated power, without resorting much to electronic trickery.\n\nIf you have about $1.9 million to spare, you might want to check it out when it arrives in September.\n\nstlife@sph.com.sg\n\nThe writer is a regular contributor to Torque, a motoring monthly published by SPH Magazines.\n\nSee more on\n\nCars", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_ALSV_1358973e_2x.jpg?VersionId=hvxOoYQm52XyQo8vuWFQMbrtxJsmnWsu", "alt_text": "The chassis of the Lamborghini Aventador SV boasts Boeing-developed aerospace composite that is sturdy and light. -- PHOTO: LAMBORGHINI SPA"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

One is even suspended in mid-air.\n\nThese creative new incarnations are on show at the Republic of Fritz Hansen showroom till June 30, after which they will move to the National Design Centre to be exhibited on July 9 and 10.\n\nSeries 7 is an iconic chair created by Danish designer Arne Jacobsen in 1955. So far, it has sold more than seven million pieces worldwide.\n\nTo commemorate its 60th anniversary, luxury furniture studio W. Atelier and Danish furniture design company Republic of Fritz Hansen collaborated to create 7 Architects x Series 7 - a project that gives Singaporean creatives free rein to re-interpret and transform the chair, so long as the chair's form is preserved.\n\nThe seven groups include celebrity interior designer Peter Tay, two-time recipient of Singapore President's Design Award Colin Seah and International Design Awards Gold recipients Sam Ang and Sal Chua.\n\nThe newly designed and re-imagined chairs came in a multitude of forms.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Aptly named Anywhere, it reflects its surroundings, allowing for the piece to meld effortlessly into its environment.\n\nOn the original Series 7's appeal, he says: \"To me, part of the chair's sublime beauty comes from the way form and function converge into such a timeless piece.\"\n\nCoincidentally, Seah, 43, founder and design director of Ministry of Design, had come up with a similar idea. His chair, Kamaeleon (Danish for chameleon), features an eighth mirrored chrome film layer over the original seven timber veneers.\n\nThe result is a futuristic-looking, fully reflective chair.\n\nAnother team comprising Ang, 42, and Chua, 42, from Grey Canopy stood out from the crowd, with their chair being suspended in mid-air so people can admire the Series 7 in its pure form, since visitors cannot sit on it.\n\nTheir piece, Series 8, 9, 10, 11... (Experiment On Curves Vs Light), features a meticulous, hand-pasted arrangement of timber dowels on the surface of the chair.\n\nDowels are solid cylindrical rods often used as pegs.\n\nThey hoped to create a textured, dynamic chair that looks different under different lighting.\n\n\"The shadows dance and change with the curves,\" Chua says.\n\nSeah, Ang and Chua plan to keep their one-of-a-kind chairs in their studios after the exhibitions, while Tay hopes to sell his to raise funds for Abilities Beyond Limitations and Expectations, an organisation which helps the physically challenged

There is also the question of the legitimacy of the United States' activities under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos).\n\nChina and the US, as well as all international and regional stakeholders, should work together to secure the freedom of navigation governed by Unclos, and secure the safe operation of navigation at sea based on international regulations.\n\nIt is time to initiate a regional mechanism in line with the safety and security of navigation, to reduce the risk of incidents at sea.\n\nSome worry that China's groundbreaking ceremony for the building of two lighthouses in the South China Sea will escalate tensions in the region.\n\nBut the possible escalation of the disputes in the South China Sea is not driven by either China's ceremony for the building of two lighthouses, or its recent land reclamation.\n\nThe international community acknowledges that China is not the first state which initiated resource-exploration activities in disputed areas, introduced military vessels to enforce jurisdictional claims, or conducted land-reclamation work in the adjoining waters.\n\nInstead, the escalating tension is driven by the misperception of China by the neighbouring countries. The misperception is that China's economic and military growth as a \"big and strong\" neighbour makes it a threat. Some international media reports on claimant states in this region are one-sided.\n\nDespite potential challenges, there is great hope for China and Asean to resolve their differences in the South China Sea in their preferred ways.\n\nChina's international image has been jeopardised, and it is viewed as not having done well enough in comparison with other claimant states (states which could easily win the moral high ground as smaller and weaker nations) in the longstanding territorial and maritime disputes in the South China Sea.\n\nTremendous legal and diplomatic efforts are needed to achieve China's strategic goal. China could unlock the impasse in the South China Sea by using soft power and diplomacy.\n\nIn 2011, China announced a China-Asean Maritime Cooperation Fund, with a first paid-up capital of three billion yuan (S$654 million), primarily to support marine scientific research, connectivity and navigational safety in the South China Sea.\n\nIn 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Asean that China would be willing to work together with Asean to build a \"Maritime Silk Road in the 21st century\".\n\nLast year, China called for cooperation proposals from Asean states for the second round of competition for projects for the cooperation fund.\n\nChina and Asean have also declared 2015 the \"Asean-China Year of Maritime Cooperation\".\n\nThere are two Chinese strategic considerations behind these concepts: to shape a new pattern of diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries, and to create favourable conditions for better maritime cooperation, which in turn will create a benign environment so that China can build itself into a substantive maritime power.\n\nBut for China and the US, it is a different story. In order to resolve this paradox, China and the US have no choice but to engage each other and maintain regular consultations on how they can coexist with their respective core interests. After all, the Asia-Pacific is big enough for both countries to share and exert their respective influence without constantly being at each other's throats.\n\nWhile China's rise stands a good chance of triggering a regional power shift, the US needs to acknowledge China's rise and its core interests.\n\nSimilarly, China must respect the legitimate interests of the US in the South China Sea, especially freedom of navigation in line with Unclos, which in any case is also in China's common interest.\n\nWhat would work in the favour of both countries is to explore the fields of developing maritime cooperation between China and the US. Joint efforts in anti-piracy in the Gulf of Aden have provided one successful example. Providing search and rescue at sea and humanitarian assistance would be the areas for both countries to take a lead in this region with their naval capacity.\n\nIt will be in China and the US' interests to initiate a regional mechanism in line with the safety and security of navigation, for example, an Incidents at Sea Agreement or a Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea, in this region.\n\nThe writer heads the Institute for China-America Studies, an independent, non-profit academic institution launched by the Hainan Nanhai Research Foundation.

He and his foster parents have remained close over the years and they hope to attend the ceremony here.\n\nThe award has been given to 12 Singaporeans since 1967, including former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, ambassador-at-large Tommy Koh and former Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar.\n\n\"I feel very proud that I'm getting the same award as well-known personalities such as Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Being brought up to the same stature, I feel very awkward, because I'm just an ordinary potter,\" says Iskandar, who last year received the Japanese Foreign Minister's Commendation Award for his \"distinguished contribution to introducing Japanese culture, and promoting the friendship between Japan and Singapore\".\n\nDiagnosed with prostate cancer last January, the 1988 Cultural Medallion recipient visits the hospital every two to three months for blood tests and to check if the cancer cells are spreading. He is recovering from an operation to remove cataracts in March.\n\nA retrospective exhibition of his works to be held next November will probably be his last, he says. His hope is that the exhibition, which compiles his pottery works and writings, will tell people that \"it takes time to develop a culture, especially in pottery, which is not part of our culture\".\n\nmzlim@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nAwards and prizes\n\nArtists", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_BLALOHA_123412e_2x.jpg?VersionId=5NyAlbH3W5Pj8gHABDijjsy0pPspEv8y", "alt_text": "Potter Iskandar Jalil has been taking students to Japan almost every year since 1992 to learn from potters there. -- PHOTO: BERITA HARIAN FILE"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

You could travel and tour for years and still not have half the number of contacts a label can have,\" he says.\n\nMr Lim Teck Kheng, marketing director of Universal Music Singapore, says there are \"definitely discussions with international producers for the new Gentle Bones release\".\n\nOn top of planning tours and releases in different countries, he adds that the record label's roster of regional and international artists means there is a good pool of talent to tap from for possible collaborations.\n\nLocal singer-songwriter Reuby, whose single Sunshine reached No. 1 on iTunes Singapore's Top Singles Chart last year, has already gone regional with the help of his label Warner Music Singapore.\n\nIn the wake of his album launch last year, the company planned for him a tour which included stops in South Korea, the Philippines and Hong Kong.\n\nMr James Kang, artists and repertoire director of Warner Music Singapore, says: \"His unique vocal tone, acute songwriting abilities and the advantage of his young age excited various territories.\"\n\nIn South Korea, a Warner affiliate managed to get one of Reuby's songs, The Key To Her Heart, featured on the popular drama Spy, giving the Singapore singer \"instant regional attention\".\n\nEven with what The Sam Willows have achieved thus far independently - their self-titled debut EP made it to the top 30 most downloaded albums of 2013 and 2014 on iTunes Singapore and they have more than 52,000 subscribers on their YouTube Singapore channel - they have room to grow.\n\nThe band's singer-guitarist Benjamin Kheng, 25, says of their decision to sign with Sony: \"We're just hoping to be able to attack bigger projects with a little more muscle. A major record label helps set a music act down a commercially viable path, especially if that aligns with the act's sound and vision.\"\n\nSony Music has already started the ball rolling, confirming The Sam Willows' releases in Australia, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, with Hong Kong and the Middle East to follow.\n\nMr Julius Ng, 52, managing director of Sony Music Singapore and Malaysia, says: \"The challenge was really getting them out of Singapore. We needed to build a sound that is so international that we can sell them in any part of the world.\"\n\nSo the label has hooked the band up with veteran Sweden-based music producer Harry Sommerdahl, who has worked with popular acts such as The Wanted, Celine Dion and Ace Of Base. Most of the band's new songs for their upcoming album were recorded with him.\n\nThe good news for other aspiring singer-songwriters and bands: Universal and Sony are still on the look-out for more talent.\n\nSony Music's Mr Ng says: \"We've covered three of the genres already - pop and hip-hop with Trick, adult contemporary with Sezairi, pop-folk with The Sam Willows - so we want to listen to something really different... maybe even a boyband or girlband.\"\n\nmelk@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nMusic\n\nPerforming artists", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_MKLABEL_1361302e_2x.jpg?VersionId=CgccLGgl.mxoJ2z7Y4dkErphGoIa_KsQ", "alt_text": "The Sam Willows were signed by Sony Music Entertainment last week. -- PHOTO: TNP FILE"}]}

In the past, everyone spoke Malay in the kampungs.\n\n\"What we're going for is realism, instead of trying to force things. In the case of Aileen Tan, I don't want her to speak Mandarin because her character wouldn't have known how to speak it.\"\n\nHe was speaking at a press conference yesterday.\n\nTan, 48, plays the lead character Zhao Di, the unwanted second wife of an older man who is forced to return to her own family.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It will be shot in Ipoh and Singapore for more than two months, starting in July, and is slated to be released during the Chinese New Year period next year.\n\nNeo wants to capture the large-scale shift of Singaporean families from kampungs to housing estates. He says: \"It was a major moment in our history, with an impact on the economy, people's emotions, families and the society at large.\n\n\"I experienced that era and it feels meaningful to record all these things that happened in the past. If we don't, who would?\"\n\nBecause of the Hokkien dialogue in the film, Neo picked actors who are fluent in the vernacular tongue. Wang called the dialect his \"homeground\", while Lee was clearly at ease as well, as he made jokes in Hokkien.\n\nThe big surprise was Tan, who proceeded to show her command of it at the press event. She says in Hokkien: \"A lot of people think I'm Cantonese because of my husband. My parents are Hokkien, so it's thanks to them that I got this role.\"\n\nHer husband is director Gerald Lee from Hong Kong.\n\nThe challenge for her is that she will have to speak another language she is not familiar with - Malay.\n\nWang's grouse is that he has to age for his role. After dyeing his hair white recently to sort out the look of his character, a parking station attendant addressed him as \"Ah Pek\" (Hokkien for old man). He adds: \"And when I went home, my dog wouldn't stop barking at me.\"\n\nFor Long Long Time Ago, Neo wants to recreate a major flood from 1969 and is hoping to build a 30m-by-30m pool that is 1.5m deep.

It is one of the oldest mystical concepts known to man, first observed in Egypt 1,600 years before Christ. A powerful symbol of the cyclical nature of time. About coming full circle, and then starting again.\n\nSuch are the strange and interesting life and times of Singapore's museum of natural history.\n\nFrom roots that trace back to 1823, when Stamford Raffles himself mooted the idea of a Singapore Institution for natural history; then 1849, when two coins donated by the Temenggong of Johor were acquired by the colonial government and the idea of a museum was seeded; to the establishment of a legal body, the Raffles Museum, in 1878.\n\nThis entity is South-east Asia's first natural history museum. But the world is an unpredictable place - many dramatic events occurred. Between 1942 and 1945, Singapore experienced a war of unprecedented cruelty and violence when the Japanese occupied the territory. Through fortune, the museum survived.\n\nThen in 1965, Singapore was suddenly no longer part of the Federation of Malaysia but an independent country. And in these traumatic times, as a young nation grappled for survival, the Raffles Museum became the National Museum of Singapore.\n\nAnd the powers to be were confronted with a decision. Two \"needs\" collided - the need for economic survival and the need for heritage. Both causes were important - just that one was more immediate.\n\nDecisions have consequences. In the ensuing tragedy, there was no place in the \"new\" museum for the century-old collection of animals. Specimens which once awed a mesmerised public and were the legacies of hundreds of research scientists from around the world were deemed expendable.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Not by design but through fortitude. Failure was never an option. And failure would have been terrible.\n\nA 'pariah' collection\n\nAT THAT juncture in time, giving the country's heritage and treasure away to another land was an option. Even throwing it away in the rubbish heap was an option. The collection did not survive unscathed. In those times of tribulation, we gave Malaysia the whale skeleton that had adorned the original Raffles Museum building since 1907. And in the process, we gave away the memories of three generations of Singaporeans. This is one hair shirt we will have to wear for generations to come.\n\nNothing ever stays the same. As the world changed, and a young Singapore grew stronger, wealthier and confident, it also became more sentient. Desperation was replaced by a new appreciation of our past.\n\nThe \"pariah\" Raffles collection became the Zoological Reference Collection of the Department of Zoology in the university in 1972. It had no permanent home and only a skeleton crew. It was a nomad, homeless, even when the University of Singapore fused with Nanyang University to form the National University of Singapore.\n\nOnly in 1988, after 16 years of wandering, was a purpose-built abode created in the new university campus of Kent Ridge. Opened by the nation's Education Minister at that time, Dr Tony Tan, this landmark event was witnessed by arguably the most famous director the museum ever had, the late Michael Tweedie. He was with the museum for 24 years between 1932 and 1956, and discovered hundreds of new species of reptiles, amphibians, fish, crustaceans and molluscs.\n\nPast and present met to witness what was then widely believed to be the ultimate salvation of the Raffles collection. Not exactly the old museum in its heyday, but at least it had a permanent home - or so we thought then!\n\nIn 1998, the powers at the university decided that the collection should become a research facility. It morphed into the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research in the Faculty of Science. And a new Education Minister, Mr Teo Chee Hean, heralded its revival in 2001.\n\nActs of madness\n\nIN THOSE halcyon times, some \"nationalists\" questioned why the university should retain the name of \"Raffles\" for the facility. Was this name but a vestige of a colonial memory that was best excised in the name of national pride? The heart says yes but the head says no. The Raffles name is not merely to honour an Englishman who founded modern Singapore. The name is a link to the museum's history. It is its bloodline. Good or bad, right or wrong - it is part of the museum's bloodline.\n\nThe bloodline echoes its own wants. It surpasses human intent. It brings out visionaries and heroes. It compels \"acts of madness\" - it encourages \"impossible dreams\". But \"madness\" and \"impossible\" are relative terms.\n\nI like the definitions of these two powerful words by acclaimed US journalist Ambrose Bierce, author of the classic lexicon, The Devil's Dictionary: madness - one who is affected with a high degree of intellectual independence; and impossible - something \"lacking in patience and money\". Like Singapore - \"mad\" to be a separate island-state and \"impossible\" for it to survive. Really?\n\nThe bloodline ensured that the Raffles Museum was revived as the new Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. Resurrected with the unwavering support of former president S R Nathan, and the financial might and philanthropic largesse of the Lee Foundation. As well as an army of donors and fellow believers.\n\nA \"ground-up\" exercise that fulfilled the \"impossible dream\", to the tune of $56 million - enough to build a new museum of substantial substance, and add three dinosaurs to boot. In the words of our second prime minister Goh Chok Tong, NUS has, to all intents and purposes, built a \"People's Museum\". Or as the museum's own staff quip - it is a \"museum of the impossible\".\n\nIt has taken NUS a long time to achieve the \"impossible dream\" - 45 years since it left Stamford Road in the then National Museum, and over 10 years since it was tasked by Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh to try nevertheless.\n\nNUS apologises to Singapore for this tardiness in delivery. The difficult, NUS will normally do immediately. The impossible, that takes a little longer. But it has now been done.\n\nAs much as money is the lifeblood of a project - however noble - the building of a true natural history museum is not just about concrete and hardware. It needs one element money cannot buy. Heart. People with heart. And the staff of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research, some who have been with the institution under one name or another for over 40 years, stepped up to the plate when it mattered.\n\nThe money enabled. The people ensured. The passion, energy and work ethos of the old museum staff - over and far above what is expected of normal employees - helped make the \"impossible dream\" a reality. Dreamers and doers. Heroes and heroines. They believed in the cause - even when it caused them no end of grief. As the French artist Renoir once remarked, \"The pain passes, but the beauty remains\". And that beauty is a state-of-the-art natural history museum for Singapore that opened in time for its 50th birthday.\n\nNatural history lives on\n\nTHE new museum is more than just a guardian of our memories. The nostalgia I see in the older generation of Singaporeans when they glimpse \"old friends\" in the gallery is palpable. It is an emotional roller coaster for them. The museum is a time capsule for the old. It is a wellspring of memories for the young.\n\nIt is also a symbol - a symbol of our need to appreciate fellow life forms we share the earth with. To catalogue, to document our fellow denizens. To know so we can understand, so we can protect. It is a tool of science, an engine for education, and a means to empower the next generation, so they do not repeat the environmental sins of their forefathers.\n\nThe museum is a symbol of our humanity and our responsibility as good planetary guardians. To give young people \"impossible dreams\" so our very real nightmares do not recur.\n\nThe year 2015 is Singapore's 50th year of independence, the nation's golden jubilee. It is also NUS' 110th year of founding. Today, the Education Minister of 1988 is the seventh President of Singapore. Today, our Education Minister of 2001 is the nation's Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nToday, we mourn our whale, even as we cheer our three dinosaurs. Today, the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research is the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. Today, the original vision of Stamford Raffles for a \"Singapore Institution\" is revived - as a museum for Singapore and South-east Asia's biodiversity.\n\nOuroboros is about the cyclical nature of time and endurance.\n\nThere is a belief that the origins of the famous mathematical symbol for infinity - the famous \"lazy eight\" or lemniscate - was derived from an Ouroboros overlapping in the middle. It makes sense. After all, the Ouroboros also represents an entity that persists from the beginning with such force and quality, it cannot be extinguished. That entity is Singapore's original and first natural history museum.\n\nstopinion@sph.com.sg\n\nThe writer, a systematic biologist who is an expert on crabs, is head of the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum at the National University of Singapore.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_MUSEUM30_13638731e_2x.jpg?VersionId=.8rH4uiRSTpAR6Ijoh8V9DupBvPqh.ax", "alt_text": "-ST ILLUSTRATION:MIEL"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

In 2012, Dr Sen took charge as the university's first chancellor.\n\nBut issues over funding and levels of autonomy had been areas of discord between Dr Sen and the previous government. In February last year, the previous Congress government approved 27 billion rupees (S$572 million) in expenditure until the financial year 2021/2022 and, as a result of the significant financial backing, wanted greater oversight of the running of the university.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The remaining amounts will come in batches and by early next year 1MDB will be wound down,\" said a source.\n\nThe reduction of its debts will allow 1MDB to \"downsize\" its operations significantly and transfer the remaining liabilities to its three subsidiary companies, which are into property development and generation of electricity.\n\n\"The subsidiaries have assets and can hold some amount of debt. The holding company does not have adequate assets and that is why it faces cash-flow problems to service its debt obligations,\" said sources.\n\nThe power generation company, which is Edra Global Energy, has three major power plants worth some RM13 billion.\n\nThe property subsidiaries are broken into two - one holding the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) Development and the other the 200.3ha Sungai Besi airport land that is to be developed into Bandar Malaysia.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It was supposed to spearhead Malaysia into projects that bring high impact to the economy.\n\nHowever, it has come under scrutiny for its opaque financial transactions with companies based in the Middle East.\n\nAmong them is Petro Saudi International (PSI), which was the first joint venture partner that 1MDB locked up with in 2009.\n\nThe joint venture with PSI started with an initial sum of US$1 billion. But the investment later ballooned to US$2.32 billion that was parked with funds based in the Cayman Islands.\n\nA portion of the funds came back last year, according to 1MDB. But an amount of US$1.1 billion that was supposed to find its way back to help 1MDB redeem its debts was placed with BSI Bank in Singapore. The Finance Ministry has said the sum was in the form of \"units\".\n\nApart from the investment with PSI, the fund has also come under fire for the high cost incurred in raising US dollar debt papers.\n\nIt raised US$3.5 billion in 2012 and another US$3 billion on March 19, 2013 - just a few weeks before the general election.\n\nThe funds were raised with a high degree of collateral and cost, something that is not usual for an entity such as 1MDB that is fully backed by the Government.\n\nAccording to sources, the Cabinet was briefed that 1MDB has become a political hot potato to the extent that it is hurting Umno party.\n\n\"The party comes above everything else for Najib. That is why he is deciding to wind down 1MDB,\" said the source.\n\nSee more on\n\n1MDB\n\nMalaysia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

Beijing has made strides this year in introducing the infrastructure needed to float it freely on global capital markets.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said he welcomed China's intention to reform its yuan currency and that progress on liberalising China's capital market should pave the way for the yuan to satisfy the IMF's criteria as global currency.\n\nIncluding the yuan in the IMF basket would increase China's influence at the Fund - an institution Washington was instrumental in designing and through which it has projected 'soft power' for the last 70 years.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But they haven't mentioned China as a potential participant.\n\nThe proposed patrols would send a message that no single country should \"build up strength or threaten anyone\" in the waters, Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said in an interview on Saturday on the sidelines of a regional meeting of defence ministers and military chiefs in Singapore.\n\nParts of the waters are also claimed by Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei, the Philippines and Malaysia. Over the last 18 months, China has accelerated reclamation work on reefs, raising alarms regionally and in the US, which in turn has stepped up its aerial and sea patrols of the area.\n\nIndonesia has long said it is a neutral party in the disputes, even as waters off its Natuna archipelago - an area rich in natural gas - appear to overlap slightly with China's claims.\n\nAsked whether he thought China had designs on the Natuna islands, Ryacudu said \"not yet\" and added China had no right over them. \"We have history there,\" he said.\n\nJoint patrols in the waters would be hard to implement, even assuming countries agree to the idea. The 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China have been working toward a \"code of conduct\" for the waters for more than a decade without major progress.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Patrols by more than one country have been very effective in other areas, like curbing piracy in the Malacca Strait, he said.\n\nIn his speech earlier to the Shangri-La dialogue, Hishammuddin urged South-east Asian nations to reach a code of conduct for the disputed waters soon.\n\n\"If we're not careful it could certainly escalate into one of the deadliest conflicts of our time,\" he said.\n\nRyacudu, a former army chief of staff, also said Indonesia's military should play a greater role in tackling Islamist extremists, particularly the threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nBetween 200 and 500 Indonesians are believed to have joined the group in the Middle East, giving them new skills they could use if they return. Supporters at home might heed ISIS calls for violence in its name.\n\nRyacudu said the military's extensive network of command posts right down to the village level should be the \"eyes and ears\" of the state in tracking down suspects.\n\n\"If events are disturbing the people, then it's a police issue,\" he said. \"But if they disturb the state, then the military should be involved.\"\n\nThe remarks appear to indicate a growing assertiveness by the military under President Joko Widodo, who is known as Jokowi. The military had a large political and internal security role under former dictator Suharto, but withdrew after his regime collapsed amid pro-democracy protests in 1998.\n\nThe police force has led the campaign against extremism for the past 15 years, winning praise internationally for its efforts.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nIndonesia\n\nChina\n\nSouth China Sea", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/jopyRYACUDU30e_2x.jpg?VersionId=kQx6xTHUjh33HBjOaFyiKe2r6kGg6kHN", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

Intrusive government powers, created and wielded in the name of preventing another mass-casualty terrorist attack, would be at least partly scaled back, proponents and critics of the surveillance say.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, will no longer be able to employ \"roving wiretaps\" aimed at terrorism suspects who use multiple disposable cell phones, and will have more difficulty seizing such suspects' and their associates' personal and business records.\n\n\"We're past the immediate aftermath of the 9-11 attack. And we can look at these issues more calmly,\" said Peter Swire, who served on a review panel appointed by President Barack Obama after former contractor Edward Snowden's 2013 revelations of vast NSA surveillance.\n\nWith the clock ticking, a coalition of Senate Republican libertarians and security hawks has blocked action on new legislation known as the USA Freedom Act that would reform the bulk telephone data program but not kill it.\n\nLibertarians want the program ended altogether, while the hawks argue it should be maintained as it is now.\n\nCurrently, telecom providers are legally required to send phone records to the government. The USA Freedom Act would require private firms to hold the data, which the NSA could search with court authorisation.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

The USA Freedom Act already has passed the House of Representatives and has Obama's strong support.\n\nIt is unclear if supporters of the Freedom Act can get the 60 votes needed in the Senate to move forward. A previous attempt on May 23 fell short, 57-42, but the bill's backers have been pushing hard to win over three more senators.\n\nHow badly US counter-terrorism efforts would be disrupted by even a temporary suspension of the telephone data collection and other legal authorities is disputed.\n\nThe Obama administration is issuing increasingly dire warnings, sometimes citing Islamic State's calls on its supporters to conduct attacks wherever they live.\n\n\"The intelligence community will lose important capabilities,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement. \"At this late date, prompt passage of the USA Freedom Act by the Senate is the best way to minimise any possible disruption of our ability to protect the American people.\"\n\nBut many experts and civil liberties advocates say that US intelligence and law enforcement authorities have other powerful - and less objectionable - tools to investigate and prosecute militant plots. Those include court orders, subpoenas and other forms of electronic surveillance.\n\n\"The government still has expansive ... law enforcement tools that will remain in place,\" said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nGroups as diverse as the left-leaning ACLU and the conservative Tea Party Patriots argue the telephone data program in particular is unconstitutionally broad, targeting the communications of millions of innocent Americans.\n\nEarlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled the program was illegal, going beyond what the Patriot Act authorized. The court declined to halt the program, saying it would give Congress a chance to act.\n\n- \"Collecting the dots\" -\n\nThe bulk telephone records program, first exposed to journalists by Snowden, collects metadata - data that provides information about other data - about US citizens' phone calls. This includes the number dialed and time and length of the call but not the content of the conversation.\n\nSenior US officials have said the surveillance fills a critical gap, determining whether a militant overseas is communicating with someone inside the United States.\n\nSwire, a privacy and cyber security expert and a professor of law and ethics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said the 2013 presidential panel he served on \"looked at the classified file and concluded that telephone metadata had not been essential to preventing any attack.\"\n\nCurrent and former US intelligence officials say that is the wrong yardstick to use. \"Very seldom do we have one (single) piece of information\" that prevents a terrorist attack, said Richard Schaeffer, a former top NSA official. \"It is literally collecting the dots\"and piecing them together, he said.\n\nCurrent US officials seem even more chagrined about losing other powers that could expire at midnight Sunday. Those, they argue, were never controversial but have been caught up in the backlash against government intrusion.\n\nOne, known as the \"lone wolf\" provision, allows the FBI to seek a wiretap on an individual if that person is suspected of terrorist activity, even if the individual cannot be linked to a specific group. Law enforcement officials have never used that power.\n\nBut a senior US official said \"this is not a tool that we want to see go away.\"\n\nThe provision giving the FBI expanded powers to seek a terrorism suspect's records such as hotel stays and car rentals is used about 200 times per year, officials said.\n\nThe roving wiretap provision, in which a court authorises tapping an individual's communications regardless of the device used, rather than a specific phone number, has been used most commonly in law enforcement rather than terrorism cases, said Stewart Baker, a former top Homeland Security official.\n\n\"But it's not an authority we would want to lose,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSpying\n\nHacking\n\nSeptember 11\n\nUS news\n\nPrivacy issues", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

By contrast, the report also showed incomes climbed, fuelling the debate on whether GDP is being underestimated.\n\nA swelling trade gap subtracted the most from growth in 30 years as the appreciating dollar caused exports to slump while imports rose following the resolution of labour disputes at West Coast ports. Federal Reserve officials are among those who believe the setback in growth will be temporary, helping explain why they are considering raising interest rates this year.\n\n\"The numbers show the economy literally collapsed last quarter, but we know there were a lot of special factors,\" Jim O'Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York, said before the report.\n\nO'Sullivan was the top forecaster of GDP in the past two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \"There's a good chance we'll see a second-quarter bounce back.\"\n\nEconomists' forecasts ranged from a decline of 1.2 per cent to an increase of 0.2 per cent. The GDP estimate is the second of three for the quarter, with the third release scheduled for June, when more information becomes available. The economy grew at a 2.2 per cent pace from October through December.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

That was partly offset by a gain in home building.\n\nWhile poor weather and merchandise delays due to a labour dispute at West Coast ports were temporary restraints, the damage caused by the plunge in fuel prices and stronger dollar may be longer-lasting.\n\nThe income side of the economy was more upbeat last quarter, with the GDP report offering a first snapshot of the quarter's gross domestic income. The measure, which shows the money earned by the people, businesses and government agencies whose purchases go into calculating growth, is seen by researchers including some at the Fed as a better gauge of the strength of the economy.\n\nGDI adjusted for inflation climbed at a 1.4 per cent annualised rate in the January through March period after rising 3.7 per cent in the fourth quarter. While the income and GDP should theoretically match, the different methods used in calculating the numbers cause them to sometimes diverge.\n\nIncome Side \"Recently, the income side of the economy has been growing faster than the product side (GDP),\" Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, wrote in a note. \"This suggests that GDP growth is understated.\" The contraction last quarter may not have been as bad as it appears, in part due to the so-called residual seasonality that probably distorted the data. The tendency of the first quarter to be persistently weak in recent years has sparked a debate about the extent of the bias, with the Fed Board and regional Fed banks including the San Francisco Fed jumping into the fray.\n\nThe results of the various research indicates first-quarter growth has underperformed the rest of the year by about 1.6 per cent to 1.7 per cent on average. The Bureau of Economic Analysis this month said it'll make changes to further minimize the bias, and take this into account when issuing annual benchmark revisions in July.\n\nConsumer Spending Among the details of the first-quarter GDP report, household consumption grew at a 1.8 percent annualised rate, revised down from an initial estimate of 1.9 percent. The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey called for a 2 percent gain, following a 4.4 per cent jump in the fourth quarter.\n\nConsumers' purchasing power grew, with disposable income adjusted for inflation increasing 5.3 per cent. The saving rate rose to 5.5 per cent from 4.7 per cent.\n\nThe report also included revisions to fourth-quarter personal income. Wages and salaries grew by US$117.2 billion, up from the US$94.5 billion gain previously reported.\n\nThe report also offered a first look at corporate profits. Before-tax earnings dropped 5.9 per cent from the prior quarter and was up 3.7 per cent from the same time last year.\n\nThe trade deficit subtracted 1.9 percentage points from growth, the most since 1985, compared with the previously estimated drag of 1.25 points.\n\nProjected Rebound The economy is poised to pick up this quarter. A Bloomberg survey of economists in May predicted growth will accelerate to a 2.7 per cent pace in the April through June period, with household consumption expanding 3.2 percent.\n\nAn improving labour market is among reasons consumers may be more willing to spend. Payrolls rebounded in April, as employers added 223,000 jobs after an 85,000 gain in March. The unemployment rate fell to 5.4 per cent, the lowest since May 2008. Weekly applications for jobless benefits are hovering just above 15-year lows reached at the end of April.\n\n\"The US economy seems well-positioned for continued growth,\" Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a May 22 speech in Providence, Rhode Island. \"Households are seeing the benefits of the improving jobs situation.\" If the economy continues to improve as she expects, \"it will be appropriate at some point this year\" to start raising rates, Yellen said.\n\nAuto Sales Automobiles sales also bode well for consumer spending and factory production. Cars and light trucks sold at a 16.5 million annualised rate in April after 17 million the prior month, data from Ward's Automotive Group showed.\n\nCorporate investment data also indicate a pickup is under way. Bookings for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft - a proxy for future corporate spending - advanced 1 percent in April after rising 1.5 per cent the prior month.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. is among automakers with plans to invest. The company said it will spend US$439 million to build a new paint shop at its Corvette sports car plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky.\n\nMore hiring, easier credit availability and borrowing costs still close to historically low levels are helping to revive the housing market. The pace of new-home sales jumped 6.8 per cent last month, more than projected. The index of pending home resales, considered a leading indicator because it tracks contract signings, climbed in April to the highest level in nine years, the National Association of Realtors reported this week.\n\nSee more on\n\nGDP\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/29/nabmUSECO29515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=P1bV8B68xoO.RLSloROg4KfRSXync3Kz", "alt_text": "This June 19, 2013 file photo shows the seal of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, DC.

Migrants often travelled to Thailand by boat, then overland to northern Malaysia.\n\nOn Friday, a second vessel filled with more than 700 would-be migrants was discovered by Myanmar's navy in the Irrawaddy delta region.\n\n- Persecuted minority -\n\nMyanmar has insisted all those found on the first boat are Bangladeshi nationals and has vowed to return them there, although it is not clear if they have been allowed to cross or if Rohingya from Myanmar were among the group.\n\nBuddhist-majority Myanmar does not recognise the Rohingya as an indigenous ethnic group and officials routinely refer to them as \"Bengalis\" from across the border.\n\nBut Bangladesh has said it will not take back any migrants who trace their origin to Myanmar.\n\nThe source nationality of those on board the second vessel is also currently unclear, with Myanmar saying those on board are \"Bengalis\" but not yet clarifying whether they mean migrants from Bangladesh or Myanmar.\n\nSince Bangkok's crackdown, more than 3,500 migrants have arrived on Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian soil in recent weeks, and hundreds or thousands more are feared still trapped on boats.\n\nMyanmar's Rohingya are one of the world's most persecuted minorities, and a surge of violence in 2012 between the community and the Buddhist majority in western Rakhine State brought their plight to the fore. They face restrictions on movement, jobs and family size.\n\nBut Myanmar has been keen to portray those leaving as Bangladeshi economic migrants and has rejected widespread criticism that the Rohingya's dire conditions are one of the primary root causes of the current exodus.\n\nAt a regional meeting to address the migrant crisis in Bangkok on Friday, Myanmar's delegation said it was being \"singled out\" for criticism after a UN representative called on the former junta-led nation to improve the Rohingya's lot.\n\nSee more on\n\nMyanmar\n\nThailand\n\nHuman trafficking\n\nRefugees and asylum seekers\n\nIllegal immigration", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/THAILANDSEASIAMIGRANTS300515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=NsoEE5_Nlfj9XtxwSv625i9xHoYAg62O", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

And while China has couched its activity in the area in economic terms, the US accuses it of militarising the territorial disputes.\n\nProf Shen said \"how to balance our interests with our friends' interests, our perception of threat and American perception of threats and interests\" should be the subject of the current Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\nsuinoi@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nSouth China Sea\n\nTerritorial disputes\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

The other bases are listening posts and staging areas for the US to monitor and limit China's movements.\n\nPlans are being drawn up in Washington to directly contest - with warships and aircraft - Beijing's territorial claims to nearly all of the South China Sea, and deter China's military from crossing to the Pacific, analysts say.\n\nChina has created over 800ha of land since last year on seven reefs in the Spratlys in the South China Sea, parts of which are also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia.\n\n\"The Americans know they are the ultimate goal here. Once the Chinese consolidate in the Spratlys and they punch through, then they'll go to the second island chain: Guam,\" Mr Jose Custodio, a consultant of the Philippine military and a former adviser to a US defence company working for the US Pacific Command, told The Straits Times.\n\nGuam is the home port of a US submarine squadron and a strategic base of the US Seventh Fleet operating in the Pacific.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

An American P8-A Poseidon plane - which the Chinese military recently warned off at least eight times as it swooped over a China-held reef in the Spratlys - reportedly took off from Clark.\n\nDefence Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said evicting the US bases had been a mistake. \"If the Americans had not left, we wouldn't be in this predicament,\" he said China would never have been able to go near Scarborough shoal off the coast of the Philippine province of Zambales had the Americans remained in Subic, he said. The Americans were using Scarborough as an \"impact range\" at the time, he pointed out.\n\nSince 2012, after a tense naval standoff with the Philippines, China has set up a blockade around Scarborough, keeping away Filipino fishermen who depended on the shoal's lagoon for a living.\n\nMr Custodio said once the Chinese islands in the Spratlys are operational and as the US settles in, something similar to the Bar Lev Line will emerge in the South China Sea. Israel had built that chain of fortifications along the eastern coast of the Suez Canal after it captured the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\n\"It will be like a tripwire: Once one side crosses, all hell will break loose,\" said Mr Custodio.\n\nrdancel@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nAsia's territorial disputes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_RDBASES30_1362558e_2x.jpg?VersionId=263U8BCfEaqGnpfxKmfANhDtYrOegMw5", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

They will be able to take steps to recover monies lost from financial mismanagement and questionable payments,\" the MND added, referring to the accountants' additional task.\n\nThe MND's decision comes despite the finding by Justice Quentin Loh that the law already allows the National Development Minister to impose conditions on grants disbursed to town councils - including the appointment of independent accountants.\n\nHe also urged both sides to reach a consensus on conditions, so grants can be disbursed soon.\n\nBut yesterday, in setting out why it was appealing, the MND noted that the High Court made serious findings against AHPETC:\n\n\"The Judge found that AHPETC had breached and continues to be in breach of its duties and obligations in law, and that there are critical questions about the state of its finances.\n\n\"The Government cannot disburse public funds to AHPETC in the current circumstances, given the very serious findings by the AGO and the High Court.\"\n\nIn further response on Friday night to The Straits Times on why it was taking the appeals route when the minister could impose conditions on the disbursement of grants, an MND spokesman said:\n\n\"Although the Judge found MND's conditions for the disbursement of the Service & Conservancy Charge (S&CC) grants to be reasonable, the Judge also agreed it was probably the case that any conditions imposed by the minister would be unacceptable to APHETC and this will result in further court proceedings.\n\n\"This will delay disbursement of the S&CC grants, which ultimately put at risk residents' interest.\n\n\"MND's appeal, if granted, will ensure that a court-appointed independent accountant takes appropriate steps to recover any monies that may have been lost through its financial mismanagement and questionable payments. It will also allow MND to immediately disburse the S&CC grants to AHPETC in the interests of residents while ensuring that these public funds are adequately safeguarded.\n\n\"The court appointed independent accountants will be officers of the Court acting in the interest of all parties, taking directions from the Court.\"\n\nThe MND applied to the High Court in March to appoint the independent accountants.\n\nWhile Justice Loh agreed with AHPETC's lawyers that there was no legal basis for the court to appoint the accountants, his judgment released on Wednesday had harsh words for AHPETC, describing it as a \"travesty\" that it ignored its duties and obligations.\n\nHe was critical of the state of its accounts and the validity and propriety of payments previously made to related parties - a reference to its managing agent firms that were also owned by some key officials in the town council.\n\nAHPETC's failure to make quarterly transfers to the sinking fund was also the \"height of financial irresponsibility\".\n\nAHPETC's lawyer Peter Low confirmed on Friday that a notice of appeal has been served. He said MND is applying to have the appeal hearing expedited.\n\nwaltsim@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nWorkers' Party\n\nMinistry of National Development\n\nAHTC", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/29/jopyAHPETC29e_2x.jpg?VersionId=.RxnWhWWq6Ah_JrQXQgpTVJkCu7M2nR4", "alt_text": "The Ministry of National Development filed an appeal on Friday against a High Court judgment which had dismissed its application to appoint independent accountants to the Workers' Party-run Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council. -- PHOTO: ST FIL"}]}

As the event got under way on Friday, demonstrators on both sides screamed obscenities at each other as police in riot gear swiftly separated the two groups, each with about 250 people, using police tape and barricades.\n\n\"This is in response to the recent attack in Texas,\" organiser Jon Ritzheimer wrote on his Facebook page, announcing the event at a mosque targeted in part because the two Texas gunmen had worshipped there.\n\nMore than 900 people responded on the event's Facebook page that they would take part in the demonstration, and by 6 pm local time (0100 GMT on Saturday), police were expanding their presence in anticipation of growing crowds. Officers with riot helmets and gas masks formed a cordon for several blocks.\n\nAmong the anti-Islam protesters, some of whom called Islam a \"religion of murderers,\" more than a dozen men in military clothing carried semi-automatic weapons.

The curriculum is also constantly revamped to meet changing industry demands. For instance, computing studies was added as a subject in 2011.\n\nThe school's principal, Dr Hang Kim Hoo, said: \"To stay relevant to society, the school aims to prepare our students with skills and knowledge beyond the math and science frontiers.\n\n\"They may need to deal with future complex problems or issues, which require effective solutions.

The civil service, Singapore's largest employer, has also accepted the recommendations.\n\nThe guidelines take effect from July 1.\n\nSee more on\n\nLow-wage workers\n\nSalaries", "images": []}

Fully recovered from a hamstring injury, 400m runner Zubin Muncherji is focused only on moving forward.\n\nAnd when the 1.88m youth gets into his stride, he is a fearsome prospect on the track.\n\nLast year, the 17-year-old broke one of Singapore's oldest athletics records.\n\nHis time of 47.29sec in the 400m race at the Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Taipei was 11-hundredths of a second faster than the previous national mark of 47.40 set by Godfrey Jalleh in 1974.\n\nCrucially, it is also just shy of the 2013 SEA Games-winning time of 47.22 set by Filipino Archand Christian Bagsit, and has put Zubin in the frame for a potential gold-medal tilt at the National Stadium next month.\n\nWhile shot put star Zhang Guirong is chasing her sixth consecutive victory in the event and expected to deliver a gold for Singapore, do not rule out something special from Zubin.\n\nJONATHAN WONG\n\nISABELLE LI, TABLE TENNIS\n\nSHE was the women's singles silver medallist at the last two SEA Games, losing to her more experienced and higher-ranked team- mates on both occasions.\n\nBut this has been a year where paddler Isabelle Li has shown an appetite for the big stage.\n\nIn January, the 20-year-old, then ranked 130th in the world, scored the biggest victory of her career with an improbable 3-2 win over 20th-ranked Lee Ho Ching of Hong Kong in the fifth and deciding match of the ITTF World Team Cup quarter-final.\n\nIt guaranteed Singapore a bronze medal at the prestigious tournament and Li's performance was praised by national women's coach Jing Junhong, who declared that Li had finally come of age.\n\nNow hovering just outside the top 100 and on an upward trajectory, Li will again be entered for the women's singles and team events at these SEA Games.\n\nUnlike the past editions, she will be an integral part of the national squad who are gunning for a clean sweep of all seven golds on offer at next month's Games.\n\nJONATHAN WONG\n\nSHAYNA NG, BOWLING\n\nWHILE the lanes on which she bowls are universally smooth and even, Shayna Ng has experienced some rough edges in her career.\n\nIn 2006, she made the national team at 17. But after finishing 52nd out of 57 bowlers in the all events category at the 19th Asian Tenpin Bowling Championships in Jakarta that year, she was demoted to the youth team.\n\nIt was 2009 before she returned to the national squad and she has not looked back since.\n\nAt the 2011 SEA Games, she was part of the five-woman team who won the gold. The next year, she was crowned world champion at the QubicaAMF World Cup in Poland.\n\nShe went on to win her second major individual title at the PBA-World Bowling Tour International Bowling Championships in 2013 in Nagoya, Japan.\n\nNg, 26, was the 2014 Sportswoman of the Year. Now, the SEA Games present a chance to extend her pedigree on home soil as she competes in all five women's events - singles, doubles, trios, team of five and masters.\n\nCHUAN LIMIN\n\nNEIGHBOURING STARS\n\nCHANATHIP SONGKRASIN, FOOTBALL\n\nTHEY call him \"Messi-J\" because of his similarity to the Barcelona superstar in terms of his compact build and impressive dribbling skills.\n\nAnd last December, Thailand's attacking midfielder Chanathip Songkrasin proved to be as valuable to his country as the Argentinian star, as he was named the best player of the 2014 Asean Football Federation Suzuki Cup.\n\nThat triumph was Thailand's fourth regional title as they defeated Singapore en route to winning the crown.\n\nOnly 21 years old, he was also the youngest to receive the Most Valuable Player gong since the inaugural tournament in 1996.\n\nChanathip currently plays for BEC Tero Sasana in the Thai Premier League but his talents have sparked the interest of top Japanese teams Shimizu S-Pulse and Gamba Osaka.\n\nAt the Games, defending football champions Thailand will be looking to Chanathip again, as they bid to leave Singapore with another gold medal to add to their collection of 14.\n\nDEEPANRAJ GANESAN\n\nCHANATIP SONKHAM, TAEKWONDO\n\nLOOK out for this taekwondo flyweight exponent at the upcoming SEA Games competition.\n\nChanatip Sonkham came to prominence in the 49kg category when the Thai won a bronze at the 2010 Asian Taekwondo Championships.\n\nThe 24-year-old then shone at the 2012 London Olympics as she eliminated Russian and Chinese Taipei opponents to reach the semi-finals, where she lost by just one point to Spain's Brigitte Yague.\n\nShe eventually settled for bronze after easily beating Guatemala's Elizabeth Zamora Gordillo 8-0.\n\nA year later, she thrashed Jordan's Dana Touran 13-0 to take the World Taekwondo Championships flyweight gold in Puebla, Mexico.\n\nThis will be Chanatip's maiden SEA Games. With continental, world and Olympic titles and medals under her belt, she will be looking forward to add a SEA Games gold to her growing medal collection and enhance her reputation as Asean's taekwondo queen.\n\nLOW JAY SEN\n\nPANDELELA RINONG, DIVING\n\nWHEN a Sarawak coach picked Pandelela Rinong and several other elementary school students as having some aquatic potential, she was eight. She learnt to swim first, before she was steered towards diving the next year.\n\nThe first time Singaporeans saw her compete, at the 2010 Youth Olympics, she was 17. She won two silvers in the 10m platform and 3m springboard.\n\nShe will return here next month as the first Olympic medal winner for Malaysia in a sport besides badminton, the first Malaysian woman to win an Olympic medal, and the first Malaysian female flag bearer at the Olympics.\n\nNow 22, having competed in three SEA Games, winning five gold medals, she is bidding to retain her 10m platform gold. But she is not taking victory for granted. She told the Malay Mail Online: \"I'll definitely give my best and won't take things easy.\n\n\"The aim is of course to retain my medal but diving is a subjective sport and anything can happen during competition.\"\n\nHO SI RUI\n\nNGUYEN THI ANH VIEN, SWIMMING\n\nSINGAPORE may have its young swim star in Joseph Schooling, but Vietnam can also boast a bright young talent in 19-year- old Nguyen Thi Anh Vien.\n\nLike Schooling, she is already a multiple SEA Games medallist, having won three golds, four silvers and a bronze at the 2011 and 2013 editions.\n\nSimilarly, she is setting unprecedented feats for her country - becoming the first Vietnamese swimmer to clinch Asian Games medals when she earned two bronzes (200m backstroke and 400m individual medley) in Incheon last year.\n\nAnd, just like Schooling, she is based in the United States, as she prepares to represent her country at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.\n\nAt this SEA Games, Anh Vien is tipped to challenge for six golds, even as she faces stiff competition from the Singapore contingent.\n\nNo doubt, Vietnam's most valuable athlete of 2014 will hope to make a name at the OCBC Aquatic Centre even amid the likely dominance from the Singapore swimmers.\n\nCLARA CHONG\n\nWUTTICHAI MASUK, BOXING\n\nFOR one who professes to model himself on legendary Thai boxer Manus Boonjumnong, Wuttichai Masuk has certainly gone some way to emulating his compatriot's achievements.\n\nLike the 2004 Olympic light-welterweight champion, Wuttichai, 25, has built up his own formidable record in the weight class.\n\nWuttichai first made waves in the featherweight category. At just 19, he beat Hurshid Tajibayev of Uzbekistan in the 2009 Asian Amateur Boxing Championships in Zhuhai, China.\n\nHe bulked up for the light-welterweight class at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, taking home a bronze. Four years later, at the Incheon Asian Games, he took out the hometown favourite Lim Hyun Chul to win gold.\n\nLast year, he was awarded the title of Best Amateur Athlete in Thailand by the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT).\n\nAs the current holder of both the SEA Games and Asian Games light-welterweight titles, Wuttichai looks ready to set the canvas ablaze in Singapore.\n\nLOW JAY SEN", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_SPT10WUTTI_1358842e_2x.jpg?VersionId=NU1t0swVt6a78aL4RH0b_xQOIx05kq9Z", "alt_text": "Wuttichai Masuk. -- PHOTO: REUTERS"}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_SPT10NGYUEN_1358136e_2x.jpg?VersionId=Gj5bfFkX35oppizeHZAb8nv_f.IDWIMd", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_SPT10PANDT5QV_1358782e_2x.jpg?VersionId=FVbEgtuPt7BbvYPI4BqKKyHzF9oyARJW", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_SPT10CHANAT_1362703e_2x.jpg?VersionId=N.sHG2gz6TY7tBHJOI8XfsT98iMce8hk", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_SPT10CHANA_1358147e_2x.jpg?VersionId=5vGeEKx15p2B2gZWlF0juGq3pUpIZ7gx", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_SPT10SHAYHZDK_1360690e_2x.jpg?VersionId=jlcHGT2u7YSdxantUtTFYw22EpI2XYP8", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_SPT10ISAB_1360689e_2x.jpg?VersionId=0ffIcAMI7XEc9dGwALPVW_1P8M4Z2v19", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_SPT10ZUB_1361751e_2x.jpg?VersionId=y_4mb0VGKGPzzzbNn9RKawBVsG_uG0pQ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_SPT10SER_1358101e_2x.jpg?VersionId=2al.zIBU7KtiQBMc_uoOIqxdcVGgXrtx", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_SPT10IRFANN_1359125e_2x.jpg?VersionId=wcnit8qg3HzS5yuPiUL_CPNMfYdb9VyD", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

It's not the only leg, but if it is not included then the stool will fall over.\"\n\nYukiya Amano, the head of the UN's atomic watchdog, told AFP this week that Iran had agreed to implementing the Additional Protocol of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that allows for snap inspections.\n\n\"When we find inconsistency or when we have doubts, we can request access to the undeclared location for example, and this could include military sites,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nIran\n\nUS news\n\nIran nuclear deal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/CONFER300515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=AqmCTjAkFVbxEhYqv9xWlAIrq5khdyYW", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

One who made plans to join the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and carry out attacks here has been detained under the Internal Security Act since last month. The other was arrested this month for further investigation.\n\n\"If the religious behaviour and attitude of our family members and children are of grave concern, and may potentially cause a law and order issue, it is incumbent, religiously, to report this to the authorities,\" he said.\n\nParents should not see this as sacrificing their children but as a way of coming to their rescue. They could also turn to mosques and qualified religious scholars, or refer them to the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis).\n\n\"It is our duty to ensure the right teachings of Islam prevail in our community. Misunderstood and twisted interpretations must not be given space and we must act as a community to ensure the right understanding of Islam at all times,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, a Muis spokesman said it has reviewed the content of its Islamic education programmes for children, youth and adults to now include topics such as jihad. This is to provide the right understanding of the term and to correct misconceptions. Facilitators can also discuss current issues during lessons, she said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

It is the latest revelation of the lure of terrorist groups even amid the peace and tolerance that mark life in Singapore. The self-radicalised youth had planned to attack key facilities and even assassinate government leaders here if he were unable to travel to Syria. Also troubling is the arrest of another teen Singaporean for investigations into the extent of his radicalisation.\n\nThe 19-year-old's case, like innumerable others worldwide, shows the insidious allure of online terrorist propaganda tailored to the vulnerability of youthful discontents. They are seduced into accepting the use of a degree of violence, which they would not have contemplated in their everyday lives. The aim is to destroy what they have been convinced to believe are the wicked ways of the secular world. The wish to slay leaders - a pathological desire not usually associated with the criminal imagination in Singapore - is a commentary on the apocalyptic heights to which propaganda can raise a person once he has been deluded into believing that a non-confessional system is evil.\n\nEvidently, it would require several social forces to come together to throw a protective cordon sanitaire around the young. If self-radicalisation through the Internet is not to grow in Singaporeans, parents and other family elders must communicate with their children, using the visceral credibility of biological and emotional ties to resist the anonymous grip of extremists masquerading as the global Muslim community. Religious and community leaders must engage dissenters frankly, addressing any unease or disquiet that they might have over their place in an inclusively secular society. Non-Muslim Singaporeans would help their Muslim brethren by continuing to believe that protecting the nation from terror is a collective task in which people of all faiths oppose a minority of religious zealots.\n\nIn the same vein, friends and colleagues should be alert to signs of altered behaviour that could signify an inner turn to radicalism. Fortuitously, what led the authorities to the 19-year-old was a person who had noticed the changes in him. Unfortunately, others whom he had failed to sway to his \"cause\" did not alert the authorities. This is misplaced confidentiality. To bring a misguided relative or friend to the attention of official agencies is not to fail the trust that he has placed in relationships. Instead, it is to save him, along with others, from the consequences of a possibly monstrous misadventure generated by the delusional relationships of the virtual world.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore\n\nISIS\n\nTerrorism", "images": []}

In the past, everyone spoke Malay in the kampungs.\n\n\"What we're going for is realism instead of trying to force things. In the case of Aileen Tan, I don't want her to speak Mandarin because her character wouldn't have known how to speak it.\"\n\nTan, 48, plays the lead character Zhao Di, the unwanted second wife of an older man who is forced to return to her own family.\n\nThe other leads in the cast were also unveiled at the press event.\n\nMark Lee, 46, plays Zhao Di's self-centred younger brother, while veteran getai entertainer Wang Lei, 54, plays their conservative father who favours boys over girls.\n\nLong Long Time Ago is budgeted at between $4 million and $5 million. It will be shot in Ipoh and Singapore for more than two months, starting in July, and is slated to be released during the Chinese New Year period next year.\n\nNeo wants to capture the large-scale shift of Singaporean families from kampungs to housing estates. He says: \"It was a major moment in our history, with an impact on the economy, on people's emotions and families and society at large.\n\n\"I experienced that era and it feels very meaningful to record all these things that happened in the past. If we don't, who else would?\"\n\nBecause of the Hokkien dialogue in the film, Neo picked actors who are fluent in the vernacular tongue. Wang called dialect his \"homeground\" while Lee was clearly at ease as well as he joked about in Hokkien.\n\nThe big surprise was Tan, who proceeded to show her command of it at the press event. She says in Hokkien: \"A lot of people think I'm Cantonese because of my husband. My parents are Hokkien so it's thanks to them that I got this role.\" Her husband is director Gerald Lee from Hong Kong.\n\nThe challenge for her is that she will have to speak another language she is not familiar with - Malay.\n\nWang's grouse is that he has to age for his role. After dyeing his hair white recently to sort out the look of his character, a parking station attendant addressed him as \"Ah Pek\" (Hokkien term for old man). He adds: \"And when I went home, my dog wouldn't stop barking at me.\"\n\nFor Long Long Time Ago, Neo wants to recreate a major flood from 1969 and is hoping to build a 30m by 30m pool that is 1.5m deep. Tan thinks she and her cast mates would have to spend two to three days soaked in it. But Lee thinks it would be closer to a week given that it is a night scene.\n\n\"That's why it's fun making his films, it's like taking a roller-coaster ride,\" says Lee, who adds in jest: \"To the audience, watching a Jack Neo film is a light-hearted, meaningful experience. But to us, it's like making a horror thriller.\"\n\nIn the Neo-directed comedy Ah Long Pte Ltd (2008), Lee had to jump into a pit filled with faeces and also got smeared all over with chocolate sauce, attracting the unwanted attention of ants.\n\nbchan@sph.com.sg", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/29/jopyJACKNEO29e_2x.jpg?VersionId=cxVOyAmdpmO_ZSMGvXiPIKPI5bS289Wc", "alt_text": "Jack Neo's (second from right) new movie Long Long Time Ago will star (from left) Wang Lei, Aileen Tan and Mark Lee. -- PHOTO: LIANHE WANBAO"}]}

The group, which only recently acquired the famous DoDo fishballs business, is now planning to open a new central kitchen facility at Quality Road.\n\nHere's a look at its existing central kitchen at Enterprise Road which has played a role in the company's present stellar performance.\n\nCAPACITY\n\nMonths after its Enterprise Road facility became fully operational in November 2014, it reached to 75 per cent of its capacity during the Chinese New Year period this year. It began catering to 30,000 people per day, twice the number from its previous capacity. The new central kitchen plans to expand this further to 50,000 a day. COO Rachel Teo says they catered to a record 1,189 orders on the first day of CNY this year. On normal weekdays they operate to 40 per cent of their capacity and can churn out 680 buffets in a 12-hour period. During non-CNY peak seasons - like the Hungry Ghost season, Christmas, Lunar Festival and Weddings season, they get about 500 to 600 orders each day.\n\nMADE IN SINGAPORE\n\nA decade ago they started getting kitchen equipment from Q'son, a Singapore company, which provides them with customised woks - made to fit the length and space of their kitchen - as well as other appliances like cookers and stoves. The company choose not to import such kitchen equipment because the cost savings derived from importing were relatively negligible. However, their rotary fryers come from Taiwan and Japan. The fryer can cater to 100 people under 25 minutes.\n\n'CAKE DEPOSITOR'\n\nOne attraction among the machines in their semi-automated division, is their 'cake depositor' - a machine that can make cookies, eclairs, cream puffs and macarons at the switch of a button. A separate machine mixes the batter, which is then poured into the cake depositor that moulds pastry. All that is left to do after this is chose a sweet dish of one's desire. The machine is efficient enough to supply their entire catering arm.\n\nSIGNATURE DISHES\n\nNearly 80 per cent of the sauces and pastes which go with their food are produced in-house. These include their signature chicken curry, pepper sauce, sweet and sour sauce, lemon sauce, rendang sauce and kung pao sauce. The reason being, the quality of products from suppliers were not up to the standard of Founder-Chairman Neo Kah Kiat. Now that the group has acquired Thong Siek Holdings, which produces surimi -based (minced fish paste) seafood products, TSH can also produce their sotong balls for them to ensure consistent quality.\n\nhphyllis@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nFood and beverage sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/29/jopyBAKES0129.jpg?VersionId=8sBIC.q8sqxmv0n76jt0h0pfqIoT6COZ", "alt_text": "Chefs working in a central kitchen of Neo Group, a food and catering company.&nbsp;--&nbsp;PHOTO: NEO GROUP LIMITED"}]}

There were no grand speeches by founding fathers at constitutional conventions. We came into nationhood suddenly, and needed a working Constitution in short order. This was supplied by the Republic of Singapore Independence Act, which was passed shortly after Independence and backdated to Aug 9, 1965.\n\nThe Act provided for the 1963 State Constitution and certain provisions of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia to continue in force, and made some additional provisions. Amendments were made as we found our feet as a nation, one of the more significant being the creation of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights as a result of the recommendations of the Wee Chong Jin Commission. The result was a patchwork Constitution.\n\nIn 1970, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew felt that this \"mess\" had to be \"polished up\" and asked the British FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) for a complete redraft. Mr Lee thought the draft provided by the British was a first-rate job, but rejected it after further reflection. He preferred to retain the constitutional arrangements that had worked for Singapore, than to pursue some unworkable perfection. In the end, the different pieces of our Constitution were consolidated and published as a single document, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.\n\nThe origins of our Constitution have led some to assert that Singapore operates under a system of parliamentary supremacy. Whatever the theoretical niceties, we have today a Constitution that is indisputably supreme in law and in fact. It shares many features with other Constitutions: parliamentary democracy and Cabinet government in the Westminster mould, the rule of law, the separation of powers, an independent judiciary, and a Bill of Rights. Its interpretation is the province of the judiciary. The body of constitutional case law is still small but surely increasing.\n\nApart from litigated cases, legal advisers and legislative drafters in my chambers handle on a daily basis many matters that engage the Constitution and its attendant principles. Their advice on constitutional matters is taken seriously by government officials and proposals have been significantly changed as a result. To my officers, interpreting the Constitution is not a rarefied exercise.\n\nFidelity to the text\n\nHOW should the Constitution be interpreted? Much has been said. Much more will no doubt be said during this conference, and I am sure we will hear the word \"autochthonous\" used quite liberally.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

In a way, this is a truism: How can one claim to interpret a text without being faithful to it? But there are also higher principles involved. Underlying the notion of written law is a belief in the power of the written word: That words have meaning, that words are important, and that words can bind. This is all the more so for a written Constitution that is the supreme law of the land - its words are meant to bind the State and secure the rights of the people. Fidelity to the idea of a written Constitution must mean fidelity to its text.\n\nWhat does fidelity to the constitutional text require? In the first place, it requires that, where constitutional provisions are clear, they must be given effect to. And many of our constitutional provisions are clear enough that little is required by way of interpretation. Article 9(4) is a good example. It provides that a person cannot be detained beyond 48 hours without being produced before a magistrate, and cannot be detained further without the authority of the magistrate. This is the essence of the writ of habeas corpus. There is little that is doubtful in this provision; it does not make for long judgments or academic musings. But it is this absolute clarity that makes the provision a bulwark of personal liberty. It is the same clarity that secures regular general elections, the independence of the judiciary, and the very sanctity of the Constitution, among other things.\n\nBut fidelity to the constitutional text does not stop at giving effect to the literal meaning of the text. Sometimes, value judgments have to be made in interpreting and applying the Constitution.\n\nThis is because the Constitution is not drawn like tax or criminal statutes, which are intended to have meanings that cleave to the text. Some constitutional provisions, most significantly the fundamental liberties, are broadly framed, and intentionally so. Concepts like equal protection and free speech may have a clear general meaning, but their application to specific facts requires exposition and value judgments.\n\nThere are also implied concepts and principles in the Constitution. Some degree of implication is unavoidable in any written document, and especially so in a document with a scope as wide as the Constitution. In fact, many important concepts in the Constitution are implied. For instance, the principle of separation of powers is nowhere stated in the Constitution, but is everywhere implied in the system of government that it prescribes. Value judgments are needed to identify this and other propositions that are reflected in or assumed by the express provisions of the Constitution, and without which the express provisions would be meaningless or unworkable.\n\nI would make a short detour here and briefly mention constitutional conventions. These are not rules of law and are not enforceable by the courts. But they are essential to a complete understanding of how the Constitution works in practice, which may be very different from how the legal rules are framed. One would, for instance, have a very mistaken view of the British Constitution if one did not appreciate the convention that the sovereign acts on the advice of the government of the day. Singapore has imported some conventions from the United Kingdom, such as the practice of the House of Commons, which is relevant where the Standing Orders of our Parliament are silent. We have also evolved our own conventions - for instance, it is the Government's practice to consult the President before introducing constitutional amendments that affect the President's discretionary powers, and to state the President's views when the amendments are debated in Parliament. The written Principles agreed between the President and the Government in the area of protection of reserves is another example of a constitutional convention. One constitutional scholar refers to it as \"the clearest example of soft constitutional law as it relates to institutionalised interaction\". As we mature as a polity, the development of constitutional conventions is likely to become a rich area for study.\n\nAs is evident from my earlier observations, a literal approach is not always sufficient in interpreting the Constitution and understanding how it works in practice. In the context of constitutional interpretation, there will be cases where judges are called upon to look beyond the plain words and exercise a degree of value judgment. I think we can be frank and acknowledge that the process involves a degree of judicial lawmaking, occurring in the interstices of the written law, in the fashion of Dworkin's Judge Hercules. The power of the court in such cases is significant: Short of a constitutional amendment, the interpretations they lay down are final, and what they hold to be within the domain of the Constitution is thereby removed from the ordinary processes of democracy.\n\nConspicuous fidelity to the constitutional text is therefore even more important in such cases, where the judge is by necessity required to go beyond the plain words. A failure to justify each decision by reference to the constitutional text taints the courts with the suspicion of preferring their personal views under the guise of interpreting the Constitution, asserting judicial supremacy under the guise of upholding constitutional supremacy.\n\nIn practical terms, fidelity to the text in such cases means that judges must reach their decisions guided only by considerations that flow from the text and the structure of the Constitution, and the principles that undergird the text and the Constitution. These principles must be rooted in the law, untainted by extra-legal considerations that are more appropriate for the political arena, in order that judges can fulfil their role as neutral and independent arbiters. Some of the more general considerations are well known. The Privy Council has said that the fundamental liberties must be given a generous interpretation that avoids the austerity of tabulated legalism. There is also the consideration that the Constitution is founded on the separation of powers and its provisions are to be interpreted accordingly.\n\nSometimes, the constitutional text leads inexorably to one interpretation, even though it is not explicit. For example, if you read Article 4 and Article 93 together, there can be no doubt that the courts have the power to strike down unconstitutional laws. Another example is the right to vote. The Constitution does not in terms create such a right. But if there were no such right, the system of parliamentary democracy established under Part VI, and the requirement for general elections in Articles 65 and 66, would be no better than a mockery. My predecessors as attorney-general have therefore advised, and the Government has accepted in Parliament, that there is in principle an implied constitutional right to vote.\n\nIn other cases, the process of interpretation may be more involved, and judges may have to decide between reasonable alternatives. But this is an exercise that a judge is well-equipped to handle, using the usual tools of judicial reasoning. There will of course be debates - not least by those in this audience - on whether the judge in a given case reached the best possible interpretation of the text, and that is fine and healthy. But so long as the judge is guided by proper textual considerations, properly articulated, the interpretation that he reaches will be a legitimate one, even though another judge might legitimately reach a different conclusion.\n\nIn reaching their conclusions, it is critical that judges articulate their reasoning. The legitimacy and strength of unelected judges lie in a consistent and visible adherence to the law and to legal method. Every decision must be capable of justification with reference to legal rules, principles and precedents. A failure to give proper reasons undermines the legitimacy of the judicial process.\n\nThe guarantee of equal protection in Article 12(1) illustrates some of the points I just made. The broad language of the clause has lent itself to much litigation. In Taw Cheng Kong's case, the Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court on the strength of the nexus between the purpose of a law and the classification adopted by the law that is required under the reasonable classification test. In Lim Meng Suang's case, the Court of Appeal was presented with wide-ranging arguments for interpreting Article 12(1). After extensive analysis, the court confirmed that the established reasonable classification test was applicable, albeit with some interesting glosses the practical implications of which remain to be seen.\n\nThe judges in each of these decisions took somewhat different views on what Article 12(1) required. Constitutional scholars may prefer one of these decisions over the other, or argue for yet other interpretations. But each of these decisions can be said to be legitimate interpretations, because they were guided by considerations that flowed from the text Article 12 and the Constitution. As discussed in Lim Meng Suang, some of these considerations include: The principle that the fundamental liberties ought to be generously construed, the countervailing principle that judges should avoid open-ended tests that in effect placed them in the position of policymakers (which is a principle founded on the separation of powers in our Constitution), and the specific consideration that Article 12(2) had specifically laid down a closed list of grounds on which discrimination was prohibited.\n\nThis very brief summary of Article 12 case law also illustrates how there is room for judicial interpretations of the Constitution to change and evolve in response to changing social and national circumstances, and yet remain legitimate and faithful to the text. But such evolution is ultimately constrained by the constitutional text. If the constitutional text does not change, there is necessarily an outer limit to its scope. A fixed constitutional text cannot have an ever-expanding meaning.\n\nI should also say that, while the Constitution must be ultimately interpreted within its four walls, the process does not require us to bury our heads in the sand. The Constitution shares many basic ideas with other written Constitutions, even though its architecture and the precise wording of specific provisions may differ. It is therefore helpful to look at how the courts in other countries have interpreted their Constitutions. For instance, the Kable principle in Australia holds that you cannot confer a function on the courts that is incompatible with their constitutional character as independent repositories of judicial power. The principle obviously has resonance in the context of our Article 93. Our Court of Appeal has recognised in Lim Meng Suang that foreign cases are however decided in the context of their unique social, political and legal circumstances. The Court has therefore cautioned that an expansive constitutional right to life and liberty should be approached with circumspection.\n\nEven where we ultimately decide to differ from other jurisdictions, consideration of comparative jurisprudence imposes a salutary discipline on the quality of our judicial reasoning. On this point I am of course preaching to the choir - the judgments of our courts on constitutional law regularly discuss foreign case law, and woe betide the counsel who is not prepared to address the court on relevant foreign case law. State counsel, for their part, regularly consider relevant comparative law in giving advice on constitutional issues. I have also asked for regular digests of international developments to be shared within my chambers, not least because these are sometimes bellwethers for constitutional issues that may arise in Singapore.\n\nNon-textual approaches\n\nI NOW wish to deprecate what may politely be called non-textual approaches to interpreting the Constitution. Their premise is this: There are some laws or policies that are so deplorable that there must be some constitutional remedy, even if the most anxious consideration of the constitutional text, in the light of all that I have said earlier, points to none.\n\nIt is clear to me that such approaches are neither lawful nor legitimate. I have mentioned earlier that fidelity to the text does not preclude arguments about the best interpretation of the text, and sometimes these arguments can be very difficult. But there is an important distinction to be made between an interpretive exercise where there is a bona fide commitment to be guided only by textual considerations, and one that is overtly or covertly motivated by outcomes that a judge wants to achieve. If judges go beyond textual considerations in interpreting the Constitution, they are really repudiating the Constitution and constitutional supremacy and substituting their personal views. In doing so they would be undermining the legitimacy of the courts as impartial tribunals guided only by the law. They would also be usurping the province of the democratically elected branches, and ultimately diluting every citizen's democratic choice.\n\nSome argue that it is comforting that judges stand ready to provide a remedy in extreme cases. To me, there is nothing comforting about judges who are willing to bend or ignore the law. And in matters outside the law, why should judges purport to know better than the rest of us?\n\nHere it is helpful to compare the Due Process Clause of the US Constitution, Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, and Article 9(1) of our own Constitution. At first blush these are similarly worded provisions but there are significant differences in drafting and in how each provision has been interpreted, and these illustrate some of the points I just made.\n\nIn the United States, the Due Process Clause prohibits the deprivation of \"liberty... without due process of law\". The US courts have created various substantive rights under the doctrine of \"substantive due process\". This included the economic liberties created in the Lochner era, which have since been repudiated. Today, the liberties recognised under the Due Process Clause include \"personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education\". There is no clear basis in the US Constitution for these rights, and the US courts have not articulated any clear framework for how these un-enumerated rights are identified and defined. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that these rights are entirely a judicial creation.\n\nThe difficulties with the Due Process Clause and its jurisprudence were known even in the late 1940s when the Indian Constitution was drafted. The drafters of the Indian Constitution deliberately drafted Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to avoid importing substantive due process jurisprudence. The ambit of Article 21 was confined to \"personal liberty\", as opposed to liberty generally. And personal liberty could be deprived by \"procedure established by law\". Yet the Indian courts have gone ahead and created numerous substantive rights under Article 21. To me, this is a clear instance of judicial creativity.\n\nOur Article 9(1) is derived from the Indian Article 21. In the context of Article 9 as a whole it is obvious that the clause is concerned only with unlawful executions and unlawful detentions. Our courts have firmly and quite rightly refused repeated invitations to read the clause to include the freedom of contract and notions of sexual autonomy. In Yong Vui Kong's case, the Court of Appeal specifically declined to follow the activist approach of the Indian courts and tests which \"hinge on the court's view of the reasonableness of the law in question, and requires the court to intrude into the legislative sphere of Parliament as well as engage in policymaking\".\n\nTo be sure, there are matters that some of us hope can be placed under constitutional protection, with all its attendant implications. But this is an argument for constitutional change and is not relevant to constitutional interpretation. In interpreting the Constitution, we must be guided by what the text is, not what we hope for it to be. To venture beyond the text of the Constitution and enunciate a meaning that reflects what the law should be is to disrespect the principle of separation of powers: This is an exercise that violates rather than upholds the Constitution.\n\nBy way of illustration I want to briefly touch on a fairly recent discussion on whether there is a basic structure to the Constitution that cannot be amended. To me the issue is fairly straightforward. The Constitution has made it very plain and specific provisions stipulate how its various provisions may be amended. Even fundamental provisions can be amended by the prescribed processes although entrenched provisions require a national referendum. There is therefore no question of any provision of the Constitution, however fundamental, being immune from amendment. There may be valid arguments for amending the Constitution to make this the case, but those arguments have no bearing on what the law is today.\n\nThe Constitution: A continuous process of refinement\n\nHealth and vitality\n\nIN CONCLUDING, I want to place constitutional interpretation in context, using an example from the United States. Constitutional lawyers rightly celebrate Brown versus Board of Education, where the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1954 emphatically struck down segregation in schools. But it is sobering to also remember that racial integration was viscerally opposed in many parts of America and was not fully achieved until many years later. In 1957, President Eisenhower had to send in the army to escort black children to school in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThe US experience with desegregation is salutary. The role of judges in faithfully interpreting and applying the Constitution is important and indispensable. But judges alone cannot secure the health and vitality of the Constitution. The judiciary must be supported in its role by the other branches of government, who must see it as their duty to abide by the Constitution and to give effect to judicial interpretations of the Constitution. The Constitution itself recognises this in a small but significant way: In addition to the Judges of the Supreme Court, the President and the Members of Parliament all swear an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\n\nBeyond the organs of State, the strength of the Constitution ultimately depends on its acceptance by the people: by you and me and our fellow citizens. Here I want to quote from a parliamentary speech made by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1984:\n\n\"From my experience, Constitutions have to be custom-made, tailored to suit the peculiarities of the person wearing the suit. Perhaps, like shoes, the older they are, the better they fit. Stretch them, soften them, resole them, repair them. They are always better than a brand new pair of shoes.\n\n\"Our people have got used to and understand the present system. It takes a long time... Any fundamental change takes a long time. But most important of all, the Constitution works. Many countries have tried and gone through several Constitutions since independence... They have not brought stability or legitimacy. I believe it is better to stretch and ease an old shoe when we know that the different shape and fit of a younger generation requires a change.\"\n\nThere is wisdom in those words. Despite its humble and patchwork beginnings, the Constitution devised by then Prime Minister Lee and his colleagues have served us well for the past 50 years. As we look ahead, each succeeding generation must decide for itself if the Constitution continues to reflect its aspirations and our national conditions, and have the strength of conviction and the boldness of spirit to make any necessary change.

and corruption charges but had given federal investigators a clear view of Fifa corruption, including Trinidad and Tobago's Jack Warner, whom prosecutors say helped steer the 2010 World Cup to South

US Attorney-General Loretta Lynch had asked them to detain seven officials from Fifa, the international football organisation, and extradite them to the US to face charges. Yet again, the US has displayed the longest arm in international law.\n\nThank goodness, is my reaction. Somebody has to show the determination and will to clean up Fifa, despite the efforts of its entrenched president Sepp Blatter to plough on through deepening scandal.\n\nIn Brooklyn, where the charges were laid, soccer is mostly played in parks and schools but Ms Lynch, correctly, did not see this as grounds to restrain herself.\n\nThe tradition of US law enforcers and courts reaching overseas to get their men and women often irritates. Yet, in Fifa's case, and in its broader crackdowns on corruption, the US is correct.\n\nWhen global organisations become havens for bribery and kickbacks - unlike Major League Baseball - they cannot be left to fester simply because enforcing justice is too hard.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Concacaf, Fifa's member confederation covering the US and Central America, concluded two years ago that both its former general secretary Chuck Blazer (since turned FBI informer), and former president Jack Warner had received millions of dollars in illicit payments from its coffers.\n\nYet, Mr Blatter, 79, keeps going, denying all knowledge and lining up his backers to be re-elected for a fifth four-year term today.\n\n\"The stress factor is a little bit higher today than yesterday but he is quite relaxed because he knows he was not involved,\" Fifa's chief spokesman, Mr Walter De Gregorio, said at a briefing after the arrests.\n\nMr Blatter should not escape responsibility. He runs an organisation that has encouraged patronage by channelling millions of dollars of its revenues each year into its 209 member federations and six confederations.\n\nIt has failed to ensure that they are run properly, and to prevent national representatives from being offered money to cast votes for countries to host World Cups.\n\nUntil recently, Mr Blatter has been in a good spot to ignore this shambles. As Basel University professor Mark Pieth, who was asked by Fifa to propose reforms in 2012, told the FT at the time, Switzerland \"has this legacy of being a kind of pirates' harbour... It's attractive (to the 60 international sports organisations based there) because there is little regulation\".\n\nSwitzerland has since tightened the law to deter corruption in international bodies, and is conducting a second investigation - separate from that of the US - into how Russia and Qatar were awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The Zurich raids included the seizure of documents by the office of the Swiss Attorney-General as part of this investigation.\n\nThe US has a longer tradition of, and displays much greater vigour in, pursuing international criminality, including piracy. The US Constitution gives Congress the power to \"define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offences against the law of nations\".\n\nThe most powerful law is the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it an offence for a US company - or crucially, a company with US operations - to pay bribes to officials. BHP Billiton, for example, paid a US$25 million (S$34 million) penalty last week for financing the attendance of 176 government officials at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nFor a long time, companies and other countries griped about the US asserting its rights as a global enforcer but it has gradually dawned on them that not only is an aggressive stance justified but also that they should do more to block corruption themselves. Global standards have been raised by others falling into line, both in law and in enforcement.\n\nIn the Fifa case, US law stretched as far as it needed. Mr Blazer was based in New York, and defendants from Fifa and sports marketing bodies passed through the city. After he became an FBI informer, according to the New York Daily News, Mr Blazer carried a key chain with a microphone to London to record conversations with officials visiting the 2012 Olympics.\n\nSwitzerland is showing more initiative than in the past but the Swiss Attorney-General's Office has gone along with the narrative that Fifa is \"the damaged party\" in the affair, rather than being to blame. This might be formally true under Swiss law but it does little to dispel the impression that Mr Blatter has the country where he wants it.\n\nHappily, the US offers no such comfort. \"Let me be clear: This is not the final chapter in our investigation,\" Ms Lynch declared after unveiling charges of racketeering and money laundering.\n\nFootball may not be a US sport but please, carry on.\n\nFINANCIAL TIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nFifa\n\nUS news\n\nAttorney-General\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/fifa300515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=QTiUBvC4gkTeSZedVFh_BbAO5YLnU8so", "alt_text": "A logo of the Fifa is seen at the top of its headquarters on May 27, 2015 in Zurich. -- PHOTO: AFP"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c5f5f20e8df8465bbfc4b59e453487bc16461d823df8dfa250ba454e9a80f97", "alt_text": "When officers moved in to surround the car, the driver revved his engine and tried to speed away."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1970969d20d3d1acd94e919706bebf972feba42dac9e49a79f9b62ffbc291ba8", "alt_text": "Chong Jun Keong allegedly distributed 103 bags of vapes which weighed about 1,966kg in total."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/bb352301f54fe2388a8c634f33a15fdc3b261db71d52c462c73c652d08a4be8f", "alt_text": "Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother\u2019s car when he ploughed into several vehicles that had stopped at a red light."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}]}

This reality reminds us of the important role played by family members in guiding their family. We need to ensure that our children are not only practising the religion and understand it, but we are also responsible in ensuring that the religious education that is received by us and our family are the correct teachings.\n\nThis becomes more imperative in view of the current ISIS terrorist group who misuses the name of Islam to commit killing and terrorism (including) through the active use of social media.\n\nAs parents, individual, family and community, we must ensure that our children and family members are equipped with deep religious knowledge. This is to develop self-resilience for them to differentiate and to reject any form of deviant or radical ideas, especially those that support terrorism and are not in line with Islamic teachings.\n\nWe must also be conscious of the changes in behaviour and attitude of our children or family members. This is especially if we have witnessed changes in their attitudes and religious outlook which seem to be tilted towards radicalism. For example, when they start to be rigid in giving views on issues related to religion-associated political thought, such as the discussion on establishment of an Islamic State, or the caliphate and so on. These issues require critical research and reading, to ensure that one is able to acquire the correct understanding of these issues.\n\nIf we are unable to advise or guide them, we must refer them to those who are capable in tackling this. Ensure that we get the assistance of counsellors or religious teachers that are certified by the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS) or through consulting religious officers at mosques or from the Office of The Mufti.

They are joined on rickety boats by economic migrants from Bangladesh, who similarly fall into the hands of traffickers demanding ransoms for their freedom.\n\nThe meeting on Friday brought together 17 mostly Asian countries, along with the United States, Switzerland and international organisations such as the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nMr Htein Lin's rebuke was largely directed at UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner Volker Turk, who said that addressing the root causes of the exodus \"will require full assumption of responsibility by Myanmar to all its people\".\n\n\"Granting of citizenship is the ultimate goal,\" he said.\n\nThailand's Foreign Minister Tanasak Patimapragorn warned in his opening address that \"the influx of irregular migrants... has reached alarming levels,\" creating an urgent regional problem needing a united response. \"We need a concerted effort by all countries concerned.\"\n\nIn remarks to reporters later, he refused to single out any particular country for blame, but stressed that the meeting sought to derive concrete solutions under a \"friendly atmosphere\".\n\nBangladeshi Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque, meanwhile, revealed that 30 per cent of recently rescued victims were Bangladeshi nationals. The rest are presumed to be Rohingya Muslims.\n\nMr Haque said Bangladesh would take full responsibility of repatriating its nationals that were recently rescued in South-east Asian waters.\n\nThe IOM on Friday committed another US$1 million (S$1.35 million) to resolving the crisis, on top of another million it has already committed.\n\nThe United States is also due to announce additional funding later on Friday, said its Assistant Secretary of State Anne Richard.\n\nEarlier this month, Thai authorities launched a long-overdue crackdown on the human smuggling trade in the country's deep south, after dozens of bodies were pulled from mass graves in a remote border area studded by migrant camps. The crackdown threw the multi-million-dollar industry into disarray as traffickers abandoned their victims on land and at sea.\n\nOn the Malaysian side of the border, authorities found 139 suspected migrants' graves this week in Wang Kelian, Perlis.\n\nMore than 3,500 migrants have arrived on Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian soil in recent weeks following the Thai crackdown. Thousands more could still be trapped in the sea as the monsoon season approaches.\n\ntanhy@sph.com.sg\n\nSee more on\n\nThailand\n\nRohingya\n\nRefugees and asylum seekers\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nRefugees and asylum seekers", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/29/INDONESIASEASIAMIGRANTS01290515e_2x.jpg?VersionId=_edpPctBI6552MFKBy71MN0zQAMZ.7ka", "alt_text": "Rohingya children and women from Myanmar sleep in a confinement area in Bayeun, located in Indonesia's Aceh province after a boatload of Rohingya migrants from Myanmar and Bangladesh were rescued by Indonesian fishermen on May 20 off the Aceh coast."}]}

Below is an extract on US-China competition and disputes in the East and South China seas.\n\nFind out what\u2019s new on\n\nST website and app.\n\nActions provoke reactions. The US is responding to Chinese activities with increased over-flights and sailings near the disputed territories. Every Asian country stands to lose if regional security and stability are threatened.\n\nPHOTO: REUTERS\n\nFollow topic:\n\nLee Hsien Loong\n\nPublished\n\nMay 30, 2015, 06:07 AM\n\nWHEN both the US and China say that the broad Pacific Ocean is \"vast enough\" to embrace both China and the United States, we read that as a good sign. Provided \"vast enough\" means that there is space all over the Asia-Pacific region for both powers to participate and compete peacefully, and to work out problems constructively, without raising tensions, and does not mean \"vast enough\" to divide up the Pacific Ocean between the two, each with its own sphere of influence, circumscribing options for other countries, and increasing the risk of rivalry and conflict between two power blocs.\n\nRealistically speaking, however, competition between major powers is unavoidable, but the question is what form this competition will take. One model of competition is where major powers strengthen their influence within a set of international rules and norms. We see that in how China is actively deepening cooperation and making friends all over Asia, through the 2+7 cooperation framework with Asean, the One Road One Belt, and the Maritime Silk Road initiatives.\n\nThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is one of China's major projects. It clearly will enhance China's influence in the world, but it also meets a real and urgent need for infrastructure development and capital in the region. And it is a way China can participate constructively in the international order together with other countries, similar to how the Americans and Europeans influence the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and how Japan plays a major role in the Asian Development Bank.\n\nThat is why Singapore gave its support very early to the AIIB idea, and why many more countries have since welcomed it and joined as prospective founding members, not only Asian countries, but also Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Australia and others.\n\nLikewise, the US is giving substance to its rebalancing towards Asia by increasing its engagement. One major initiative is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\n\nPresident Barack Obama has personally pushed this hard with the negotiating partners. The administration needs to obtain Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) from Congress for, without that, no country will close their TPP negotiations with the US. A TPA Bill has passed the Senate, and is now before the House. All the TPP partners are watching closely, and hoping that Congress passes TPA legislation, in a satisfactory form and in good time. I hope the American legislators and public realise how big the stakes are in the TPP, not just for Asia but for themselves. Because whatever the merits or demerits of individual items in the TPP agreement from the trade point of view, the TPP has a wider strategic significance. Getting the TPP done will deepen links between both sides of the Pacific. Failing to get the TPP done will hurt the credibility and standing of the US not just in Asia, but worldwide.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

It is an open secret that the US had reservations about the AIIB and discouraged its friends from participating. And on the TPP, some observers believe that the rules are being crafted to raise the hurdle for China to join. I am sure that is not the thinking of all TPP members, although China is not yet ready to join the TPP.\n\nSpeaking as an Asian country and a participant in both, Singapore hopes that in the long term, China will join the TPP, and the US and Japan will join the AIIB.\n\nBut there is another model for competition, where win-win arrangements are harder to reach, and unhappy outcomes harder to avoid. The territorial and maritime disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea are an example.\n\nThese disputes have heated up significantly in the last few years. There is daily buzzing of ships and aircraft around the Senkaku/ Diaoyudao islands, and the testing of boundaries by both China and Japan. In the South China Sea, claimant states are taking unilateral actions in the disputed areas, drilling for oil and gas, reclaiming land, setting up outposts, and reinforcing their military presence.\n\nActions provoke reactions. The US is responding to Chinese activities with increased over-flights and sailings near the disputed territories, to signal that it will not accept unilateral assertions of sovereignty in the South China Sea. Each country feels compelled to react to what others have done, in order to protect its own interests.\n\nNon-claimant countries cannot take sides on the merits of the rival claims. But they do have a stake in the maritime disputes, and in particular how they are handled. Every Asian country stands to lose if regional security and stability are threatened. Major sea and air lines of communications pass through the South China Sea. Every state whose trade passes through the South China Sea, or whose ships and aircraft use the South China Sea, has an interest in ensuring freedom of navigation and over-flight, including Singapore, for whom the South China Sea is a vital lifeline.\n\nNo country can renounce its claims, or sometimes even concede that a dispute exists, without paying a high political cost. But the consequence is that all sides harden their positions, and disputes become harder to disentangle. These maritime disputes are thus most unlikely to be solved in the foreseeable future. But they can and should be managed and contained. If the present dynamic continues, it must lead to more tensions and bad outcomes.\n\nChina and Asean should conclude a Code of Conduct on the South China Sea as soon as possible, so as to break the vicious circle and not let the disputes sour the broader relationship. If all parties adhere to international law, including Unclos (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea), that is the best outcome. On the other hand, if a physical clash occurs, which escalates into wider tension or conflict, either by design or more likely by accident, that would be very bad.\n\nBut even if we avoid a physical clash, if the outcome is determined on the basis of might is right, it will set a bad precedent. It may not lead immediately to a hot conflict, but it will be an unhappier and less sustainable position. In the long run, a stable regional order cannot be maintained by force alone, but also requires consent and legitimacy in the international community, together with the balance of power.\n\nSee more on\n\nLee Hsien Loong\n\nSouth China Sea\n\nUS-China ties\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nBoost Your Job Hunt With AI In SG's Competitive Job Market\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nTransform your home affordably with IKEA Home design service\u200b\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2015/05/30/ST_20150530_XSHANG30_1363824e_2x.jpg?VersionId=DlzYRAnp_jAbCrwItiUxinc89Jyg5Rix", "alt_text": "Actions provoke reactions.
