whether it can work with other platforms across the SAF, and whether it is easy to maintain.\n\nAnother factor is the risk of concentration failures, where the discovery of a serious problem could lead to an entire fleet of fighter jets being grounded till a solution is found.\n\nBesides acquiring new aircraft and missile systems, the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is also setting up a new facility called the Air Warfare Centre at the Paya Lebar Air Base in July.\n\nIt will centralise various entities that will test and operationalise different air warfare concepts and capabilities in a controlled environment without the physical need for that space.\n\nTaken together, these efforts will help the RSAF to maintain air superiority, which is crucial for a small state like Singapore as it creates the time and space for early warning against any aggressors, said Dr Ng.\n\nDuring the interview, he also outlined other timeframes for equipment upgrades and purchases in the army and navy, as well as steps to leverage technology more to build a next-generation SAF that is smarter, leaner, and more lethal.\n\nThese efforts will help the SAF to continue to do more with less as the security challenges are set to become more complex while it also will have to grapple with a one-third reduction in manpower resources amid the country's declining birth rates, said Dr Ng, adding that the SAF is confident of coping with the manpower crunch.\n\nFor instance, the Next-Gen Howitzer high-mobility weapon system, which can shoot and scoot faster compared to the Singapore Self-Propelled Howitzer Primus, is envisaged to be introduced from 2020 and help build a next-generation army that is \"faster, heavier, more deadly, and has greater firepower\".\n\nThe Multi-Role Combat Vessel, which can function as the \"mothership\" for unmanned systems and be configured for different types of missions, will replace the Victory-class Missile Corvettes that are reaching the end of their operational lifespan in 2025.\n\nDr Ng said these asset upgrades and purchases have been factored into defence spending for the next decade, which will keep pace with inflation each year and is unlikely to see a spike, barring unexpected scenarios.\n\nHe said these moves are being made to build an SAF capable of protecting another generation, just like how the previous generation had done for the current one.\n\nHe cited how long-term planning over the years to build an SAF capable of meeting a myriad of potential future challenges allowed it\n\nto deploy various assets\n\nfor the\n\nJune 12 summit on Sentosa\n\nbetween United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"We succeeded because each last generation took great pains and steadily built up the SAF, and this is what this generation must do,\" said Dr Ng.\n\nSee more on\n\nSAF\n\nNg Eng Hen", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/06/30/colin-fj2-30_1.jpg?VersionId=Rut9.yROAqk8zTvtEA0NxYhtNsAKpzVt", "alt_text": null}]}

Group projects also feature heavily in every SMU module, and are mostly simulated to reflect actual corporate environments. The students are allocated different teams to tackle case studies every semester.\n\nAdds Ms Tay: \"That mirrors real world scenarios where we can't really choose the people we work with. The dynamics may not always tickle our fancy, but we just have to find ways to make things work.\n\n\"SMU creates experiences and provides avenues to make learning relevant in the real world.\"\n\nGrowing through change\n\nMs Tay describes her postgraduate studies as being akin to a caterpillar's metamorphosis, where it evolves to a pupa and eventually emerges as a butterfly.\n\n\"It's been less than a year since I started my MBA course and already, I've seen the promise of a quality education being met with opportunities to find my own approach to problem-solving. In SMU, we are constantly challenged to discover new ideas and new ways to navigate the world around us - timeless abilities that can be transformative if done well.\"\n\nMORE POSTGRADUATE STUDIES II SUPPLEMENT HERE.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/07/02/postgrad-smu-francescatay03.jpg?VersionId=T0tbYIta8FCmiZ5BZOOelcuZFDiNviz_", "alt_text": null}]}

These wheelchairs are not available for public use for now.\n\nThe beach wheelchairs, in blue, white and yellow, are fitted with large yellow rubber wheels which allow them to roll on sandy beaches. Two large flotation devices, which double as armrests, let the wheelchairs bob about in the water, and each wheelchair will require a caregiver to push it into the water.\n\nAbout 30 persons with disabilities had a chance to try the wheelchairs on Saturday.\n\nIt took the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), together with the People's Association, a year to obtain the wheelchairs.

Hub takes less time to maintain, repair tracked vehicles\n\nA new hub for tracked vehicles in Sungei Gedong to perform depot-level maintenance tasks in an army camp has reduced manpower costs by 20 per cent .\n\nTime needed for repairs has also been cut by 50 per cent, reducing turn-around time for vehicles such as the Bionix Infantry Fighting Vehicles and Bronco All-Terrain Tracked Carriers.\n\nThis means that such vehicles will be more readily available for training and operations, by allowing staff from a contractor to work in camp, rather than having to send the vehicles to their depot - taking a longer time and costing more.\n\nThe SAF's first Integrated Forward Maintenance Hub at Sungei Gedong Camp launched in March this year (2018).\n\nThe next integrated hub at Kranji Camp, meant for the army's motorised infantry fleet of vehicles, will open next year.\n\nHaving ST Engineering Land Systems technicians at an army camp means certain work processes can be simplified.\n\nFor example, a minor welding job could have taken six days in the past - three days to prepare the paperwork and logistics to get the vehicle transported to ST Engineering Land Systems at Jalan Boon Lay Depot and back.\n\nNow, this task can be done in Sungei Gedong in one day.\n\nOn average, depot-level work used to take 24 days, but now take 12 days with the co-location of facilities in Sungei Gedong.\n\nOther than a workshop, the hub at Sungei Gedong also has a warehouse that stores commonly-used spare parts, which were previously stored at the Army Logistics Base at Old Choa Chu Kang Road.\n\nA new Independent Spares Retrieval and Exchange System (iSpares) at the warehouse, similar to SingPost's POPstation, also means that technicians can now collect required spare parts from self-locking storage boxes at their convenience.\n\nThis takes away the need to meet the person in charge of the store.\n\nThere is also an office at the hub that helps to reduce administrative processing time for handling quotations and warranty claims.\n\nChief maintenance and engineering officer, Military Expert 7 Tan Mu Yen, said: \"What we've attempted to do with the hub is to organise all the relevant maintenance support functions, redesign our work flow, to basically cut down unnecessary admin downtime, and handing and taking over between individuals.\"\n\nAnother initiative by the army's Maintenance and Engineering Support formation is a system that gathers data to allow a more optimal maintenance regime to be designed.\n\nUsing a data analytics engine, information collected about a tracked vehicle, such as its movement, fuel use, and engine speed, can be analysed to predict when maintenance needs to be carried out.\n\nThis is as compared to servicing the vehicles according to certain rules, such as after having travelled a certain distance, which may not be optimal.\n\nThe Telemetry and Analytics System (TAS) has already been implemented for the army's fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), cutting technical investigation time from 48 hours to eight hours per UAV.\n\nMilitary Expert 4 Wilgene Tan, who worked on the algorithm behind the TAS, said: \"Once we're able to decipher this data, our main aim is to predict failure of the vehicles, to stretch the maintenance dollar and hopefully, save the army money.\"\n\n2. Parachute flight simulator boosts landing accuracy\n\nBefore a commando makes his first live parachute jump, he can now practise controlling his parachute to land accurately without having to go on a plane.\n\nThe Parachute Flight Simulator in Pasir Ris Camp has reduced the number of trainees who land out of the designated landing zones from a few cases each year to zero.\n\nThe facility opened in 2014 to help trainees with static line parachuting. Since mid-2017, it has also provided training to those doing freefall courses.\n\nThere are six such simulators at Pasir Ris Camp, which are able to replicate a range of environments and weather conditions, such as rain and wind.\n\nThe trainee is strapped up across his body and wears a display mounted on his head.\n\nPulling on the attached straps will simulate a reaction mirroring that of a live descent.\n\nA video of how the trainee performed and his flight path can be recorded and replayed to point out areas for improvement.\n\nOne of the key benefits of using the simulator is in improving canopy control, said Major Arnold Low, commanding officer of the the Special Operations Tactical Support Centre (SOTSC), which operates the facility.\n\nHe said: \"The flight simulator enhances our training, putting our trainees in an environment where they can see the actual conditions they can expect to see during the live task.\"\n\nOther benefits include being able to test a trainee's reaction to emergency scenarios, such as when the parachute is torn or fails to deploy properly.\n\nThe simulators are also used by the Red Lions parachute display team to rehearse their descents onto the floating platform at Marina Bay.\n\nStatic Line Detachment Commander and airborne instructor, First Warrant Officer Ng Chin Hun, said that after the implementation of the simulator training, he no longer has trainees landing out of the drop zone during their live jumps.\n\n\"This is because after going through the simulator, their canopy control is now much better... From the simulator itself, we can see what exactly the airbase looks like for trainees to familiarise themselves, be it at Sembawang or Paya Lebar Airbase,\" he said.\n\n3. Augmented reality glasses helps air force trainees reduce errors\n\nThe Republic of Singapore Air Force has begun experimenting with the use of augmented reality training aids, such as a lens that uses holograms to simulate environments, to improve training realism and effectiveness.\n\nThe mixed reality lens allows for scenarios that are difficult to replicate in real life, enhancing experiential learning.\n\nThese scenarios include aircraft emergency response, or when a ground power generator catches fire.\n\nA trainee would have to react on the spot and perform remedial actions, by interacting with the holograms using hand gestures.\n\nThis has been on trial since earlier this year (2018). The air force plans to implement it for training at the Air Engineering Training Institute from July.\n\nAnother gadget, a head-mounted micro tablet that is operated using voice commands, allows users to retrieve information easily, without having to use their hands or refer to hardcopy manuals.\n\nThe device also supports remote mentoring, where an instructor can look at what the trainee sees when he is working and offer advice.\n\nWhile the mixed reality lens and micro tablets have been on trial this year, smart glasses have already been in use since last year.\n\nIt offers similar functions to the micro tablet in allowing an instructor to see what a trainee sees via live video streaming, but is less obtrusive.\n\nThis is useful when doing work in confined spaces, such as under a fighter jet.\n\nME6 Ken Chua, commander of the Air Engineering Training Institute, said: \"(One) benefit of using such technology is that you can inject scenarios that you can't replicate in real life. In this manner, we're actually expanding the training envelope.\"\n\n\"Such scenarios simulated allow trainees to gain confidence before they do the live training.\"\n\nAir force engineer Geraldine Tan, 20, who used the mixed reality lens for her training, said: \"Traditionally, the instructor will be standing beside you and asking you to read through the steps and procedures first. Afterwards, you bring the paper to the real asset and do the checks one by one.\"\n\n\"But this can be quite scary because we're learning it for the first time. Moreover, not many people can try it because the assets are limited.\"\n\nIn the past, only a minority out of a group of trainees could practise on a real system.\n\n\"But with the lens, everyone can try it and familiarise themselves with the system,\" added ME1 Tan.\n\nSee more on\n\nTechnology and research\n\nSAF", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/06/30/colinit-30.jpg?VersionId=.134w3hRkc9wNbgwF.3PLJrHqJC0fNY0", "alt_text": null}]}

We wish him all the best in executing his duties,\" the official Twitter for the party polls posted after the former party vice-president obtained an unassailable lead on Saturday night.\n\nMr Khairy conceded defeat on Saturday, tweeting: \"I accept the decision with an open heart. Insya Allah (God wiling) Umno's new line-up will be able to restore the people's confidence towards our party. Make total changes. Prove that Umno can change for the better.\"\n\nAbout 150,000 delegates voted nationwide in an electoral college system, where each of the 191 divisions - based on Malaysia's parliamentary constituencies - pick one candidate for presidency.\n\nThe former deputy premier is the party's most senior leader after being promoted in 2015 by then Prime Minister Najib Razak.

There's no better place than a World Cup.\"\n\nFrom the ensuing penalty, Antoine Griezmann sent Franco Armani the wrong way two minutes later following VAR confirmation to open the scoring.\n\nAngel di Maria and Gabriel Mercado struck for Argentina on either side of half-time to give them a shock lead. But that was as good as it got for La Albiceleste.\n\nBenjamin Pavard drew the French level in the 57th minute with a lovely strike off the outside of his right boot.\n\nThe \u00a3166 million (S$299 million) Mbappe was a constant thorn in the flesh of the Argentina defence, and when they could neither catch nor foul him, the 19-year-old Paris Saint-Germain forward punished them with two clinical strikes in the 64th and 68th minute, as Lionel Messi will go home with no goals in the knockout rounds from four World Cups.\n\nSergio Aguero scored a third for Argentina in the 93rd minute but could not change the result.\n\nThere was drama aplenty before that, as the awful Argentinians somehow managed to make it 1-1 through di Maria's 41st-minute 25m stunner, and even take the lead when Mercado diverted Messi's shot past Hugo Lloris in the 48th minute.\n\nBut long-range shots and luck could take Argentina only so far, and France never panicked as they were in control even if they had just 39 per cent possession.\n\nSweat and tears streamed down the faces of Argentina fans after the final whistle, reducing the flags painted on their cheeks into a messy blur, much like how incoherent their team were on the pitch. They never looked likely to keep their lead, much less extend it.\n\nAs the lone forward in the starting line-up, Messi continued to look isolated and distant as Jorge Sampaoli once again failed to find the right strategy to make the most of his talisman's talents.\n\nAs a result, the 30-year-old had to drop deep so often he resembled a midfielder, while defenders like Nicolas Otamendi surged forward to bypass their hollow engine room.\n\nCristian Pavon, preferred to Gonzalo Higuain, had not even registered a shot on target in the group stage, and a cross that went behind the net summed up his match.\n\nFrance, and particularly Mbappe, gleefully exploited their unbalanced opponents with a lethal mix of pace and precision as they upped a gear from the previous round with the wealth of talents they have in every department.\n\nRight-back Pavard had legendary World Cup scorers Diego Maradona and Ronaldo, seated in the VIP area below the media tribune, amazed and muttering \"Golazo\" with a vicious, swerving drive to make it 2-2 after 57 minutes.\n\nMbappe then took over as Armani delivered his best Willy Cabellero impersonation and the Argentina defence was being their usual bungling self.\n\nSubstitute Aguero grabbed a late consolation, but unlike against Nigeria, there was to be no silver lining, no place to hide, and no more second chance.\n\nPrior to the game, some Argentina fans approached this reporter for tickets to this game as they had wrongly banked on their team to top Group D and had balloted for the round-of-16 match in Nizhny Novgorod instead.\n\nBut others had been wise enough to hedge their bets to also get tickets for this game and they formed more than 80 per cent of the 42,873-strong crowd in the stadium.\n\nMany were also optimistic they could return to Nizhny for the quarter-finals, but were left speechless after the painful defeat. Some recovered to loyally serenade their team but as the players filed past without acknowledging them, a few indicated their displeasure by jabbing their own temples and thumping their chests before throwing their jerseys in the direction of Javier Mascherano and Messi.\n\nIt will not matter now, they are all going home and with the morale-boosting way they came back to win, France will believe they can go all the way.\n\nSee more on\n\nFootball matches\n\nFrance\n\nArgentina\n\nLionel Messi", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/07/01/btargentina20180630.jpg?VersionId=eLYW5QNVePbhoiOoUGk.ciAY7pbPBn.1", "alt_text": null}]}

The interview centred on SAF modernisation efforts and the global terrorism threat.\n\nDr Ng was also asked about bilateral ties with Malaysia, which have come under strain after Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia would review the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High-Speed Rail project. He also said Malaysia would consider re-negotiating a long-standing water supply deal.\n\nMemories of a long-running territorial dispute between both countries have also been rekindled by Tun Mahathir's recent remarks that the structure on Middle Rocks could be enlarged to form a small island.\n\nThis was after Malaysia, on May 28, withdrew its application to revise a 2008 International Court of Justice judgment that said Pedra Branca belongs to Singapore, giving up for good its right to challenge Singapore's sovereignty over the island. The 2008 judgment also ruled that Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia.\n\nOn ties with Malaysia, Dr Ng said there is a need to deal with new governments with maturity, respect and understanding.\n\nMaturity is needed to know that new governments would do things differently and are sometimes dealing with their domestic audience, he added. Respect must be given to the new governments, while it is also important to understand their predicament and challenges.\n\nDr Mahathir came to power after winning the May 9 general election.\n\n\"So I would approach the first few months of the new Malaysian government with maturity, respect and understanding...

I suppose it appealed to my self-actualisation needs. I had been deferring my studies for many years, as there was no good time at work to take time off. It has taken me many years to go back to school,\" she says.\n\nOnce her mind was made up, Ms Leong spared no efforts to thoroughly research her options. In the end, she decided on her alma mater, the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n\n\"I chose to do my MBA at NUS full-time because I wanted the best MBA experience while staying in Singapore.\n\n\"I felt that my future lies here, and I wanted the support of my family when I went back to school. Also, NUS awarded me a scholarship to pursue this master's degree,\" says Ms Leong, who has a Bachelor of Science in Applied Chemistry (Honours) from NUS.\n\nExploring possibilities\n\nMs Leong is mid-way through her 17-month programme. \"My MBA thus far has opened my eyes to a lot of opportunities, especially in terms of entrepreneurship and starting my own firm,\" she says.\n\nShe and her classmates have secured an office, and a source of funding for their start-up venture to market Huxley cosmetics in Singapore and South-east Asia.\n\nHuxley is a skincare brand from Korea that is known for its unique key ingredient, the prickly pear cactus seed oil used by Moroccan women in the Saharan desert to keep their skin hydrated and supple.\n\nBut it is not just business that she is thinking about these days. Her course work has introduced her to other things, like how she might be able to give back to society.\n\n\"The teachers at NUS have told us that our purpose in business is not profit. Profit is only the means to keep the business running. Our purpose has to be about contributing to society; to stakeholders beyond the shareholders,\" says Ms Leong.\n\nIt is the unspoken theme throughout all the classes, she adds.\n\n\"In accounting, we not only talk about profit and loss, but also discuss how social costs are not included in balance sheets. In corporate strategy, we talk about green strategies as a competitive advantage. And for my management practicum project, we were tasked to figure out how to use loyalty principles to incentivise green behaviour in corporations and individuals.\"\n\nPeerless connections\n\nFor Ms Leong, one of the best things to come out of the MBA programme was the connections she made.\n\n\"I have developed deep trusting relationships with people whom I have only known for about eight months. Some of them hail from places so far away I might never have met them if not for the MBA,\" she says.\n\nMORE POSTGRADUATE STUDIES II SUPPLEMENT HERE.", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/07/02/postgrad-nus-biancaleong02.jpg?VersionId=H3YGF2W2b1bnsHF89oP0gsOVP7bW_uSz", "alt_text": null}]}

I am happy for that.\" And happy that, after being crowned French Open champion for the 11th time at Roland Garros, he still feels he has a genuine shout at lifting the title again for the first time in eight years.\n\n\"I'm feeling good...Expectations are always high. I am not here to play the tournament; I am here to try to have a good result,\" the 32-year-old said, adamant that he can put behind him a string of more recent disappointments in London SW19.\n\nSince his last appearance in the final in 2011, Nadal has made a series of unexpected early exits at the hands of unheralded players like Lukas Rosol, Steve Darcis and Dustin Brown and he also missed the 2016 Championships with injury.\n\nNO QUARTERS\n\nLast year, he lost to Gilles Muller, succumbing 15-13 in the fifth set and again failing to make the quarter-finals. History has shown, though, that he if does get to the last-eight here - as he's done five times - he always goes on to the final.\n\nNo final, of course, could top the 2008 classic which was celebrated at Wimbledon on Friday with a special screening of a new documentary 'Strokes of Genius' that focuses on that particular duel and the evolution of the rivalry between this year's top two seeds.\n\n\"I am not thinking every day about that final. I am just focused on what I am doing today - but of course in that moment, that final was a very important step forward for me in my career,\" reflected Nadal.\n\n\"I always have been very clear that it probably was one of the most emotional matches that I played in my career. To win here was one of my dreams. After losing two finals (both to Federer), that final created a big impact in my career.\"\n\nAfter winning his 17th Grand Slam title on the Paris clay, Nadal, as last year, spurned the chance of a grasscourt tournament warm-up, pulling out of Queen's for the second straight year and opting to fine-tune his game in exhibition matches.\n\nHe sounded content enough with his build-up, though.\n\n\"It was not positive for me to not play Queen's,\" he said. \"I was sad not to have the chance to be there. On the other hand, I didn't go there because I'd played a lot on clay. So I was very happy.\n\n\"But that's how it works. I am not 20 any more. After a long claycourt season, the body needed a rest, a slow adaptation to the grass. That's what I did,\" added the No. 2 seed, who faces Israel's Dudi Sela in the first round on Tuesday.\n\nSee more on\n\nWimbledon\n\nRafael Nadal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2018/07/01/btnadal20180630.jpg?VersionId=sVb3H9jVholJg6qXRIkAESje.UtRZABq", "alt_text": null}]}

We have a young and ambitious squad,\" he said.\n\nRemarkably, neither Ronaldo nor Messi have managed to score a single goal in a knockout tie in four World Cups going back to 2006.\n\nRonaldo reached the semi-finals with Portugal in his first World Cup in Germany, but has never made it past the last 16 since then.\n\nThis has been his best World Cup in terms of goals scored, as he leaves with four in total, including a hat-trick in a 3-3 draw with Spain in the group stage.\n\nHis tally is one behind the tournament's current leading scorer Harry Kane, with Ronaldo also missing a penalty in the 1-1 draw with Iran.\n\n\"He is an exceptional player,\" said Uruguay's veteran coach Oscar Tabarez. \"He is their leader, their captain.
