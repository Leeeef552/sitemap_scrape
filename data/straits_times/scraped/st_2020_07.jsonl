And accurate, low-cost diagnosis is really exciting, so it's a breakthrough.\"\n\nBlood tests for Alzheimer's, which are being developed by several research teams, would provide some hope in a field that has experienced failure after failure in its search for ways to treat and prevent a devastating disease that robs people of their memories and ability to function independently.\n\nThe test, which measures a form of the tau protein found in tangles that spread throughout the brain in Alzheimer's, proved remarkably accurate in a study of 1,402 people from three different groups in Sweden, Colombia and the United States.\n\nIt performed better than MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scans, was as good as PET (positron emission tomography) scans or spinal taps, and was nearly as accurate as the most definitive diagnostic method: autopsies that found strong evidence of Alzheimer's in people's brains after they died.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nAlzheimer's disease\n\nScience\n\nScientific research", "images": []}

A new report shows that such lockdowns led to a drop of up to 50 per cent in the global din tied to humans.\n\nPHOTO: AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nFollow topic:\n\nNoise pollution\n\nPublished\n\nAug 01, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nThe shock waves of civilisation travel through rocky ground and, at times, ricochet around the globe, as geologists know from decades of listening for earthquakes with sensitive seismometers. The human pulses come from heavy traffic, football games, rock concerts, fireworks, subways, mine explosions, rock drilling, factories, jackhammers, industrial blasts and other activities. In 2001, vibrations from the collapse of the World Trade Centre in New York registered in five US states. Seismometers even picked up the impacts of the two airplanes.\n\nNow, a team of 76 scientists from more than two dozen countries reports that lockdowns from the Covid-19 pandemic led to a drop of up to 50 per cent in the global din tied to humans. The main quieting, from March to May, was compared with levels in previous months and years.\n\n\"The length and quiescence of this period represents the longest and most coherent global seismic noise reduction in recorded history,\" the scientists reported in the journal Science. The quieting, they added, resulted from social distancing, industrial shutdowns and drops in travel and tourism. The overall decline far exceeded the kind typically observed on weekends and holidays.\n\nDevices for measuring earthquakes go back at least to the early part of the 18th century, when pendulums were used to display ground motions. In 1895, Irish engineer John Milne established on the Isle of Wight a modern seismometer centre that quickly grew into the world's first global network, with 30 overseas branches. By 1957, a global group of seismologists had listed 600 stations. The devices can pick up vibrations not only from earthquakes and human activities but also from hurricanes and the crashing of ocean waves on shorelines, as well as the impacts of rocky intruders from outer space.\n\nThe new research was led by the Royal Observatory of Belgium and other institutions, including Imperial College London and the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Participants from the United States included the seismological laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico, of the US Geological Survey, as well as Princeton and Stanford universities and the universities of Alaska, Maine and California.\n\nThe team assembled data from 337 seismometers run by citizen scientists and 268 stations run by government, university and corporate geologists. It reported that the global quieting began in China in late January and spread to Europe and the rest of the world in March and April. The team said that by the end of the monitoring period, in May, the vibration levels in Beijing remained below those of previous years, suggesting that the pandemic was still restricting activity in the Chinese capital.\n\nIn New York City's Central Park, the vibrations on Sunday nights during the peak lockdown period registered as 10 per cent lower than previously measured.\n\nOverall, the greatest reductions were in big cities and other densely populated areas. The team said the quietude let scientists pick up previously hidden earthquake signals and that continued analysis of the data may help geologists learn how to better differentiate between human and natural vibrations.\n\nThe findings of the team were so surprising and clear that they generated news accounts in early April, almost two months before closure of the monitoring window.\n\nIn its Science paper, the team reported that the quieting was also quite evident at tourist spots. At the lush tropical isle of Barbados in the Caribbean, the lockdown began on March 28 and, compared with previous years, produced a decline in ground vibrations of up to 50 per cent. The team found similar reductions at ski resorts in Europe and the US.\n\nGlobally, median levels of shaking fell up to 50 per cent between March and May, \"highlighting how human activities impact the solid earth\", the authors wrote.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nNoise pollution\n\nCovid-19\n\nScience\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19 Special", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/ST_20200801_AIQUIETK5TE_5854679.jpg?VersionId=S4x0y34UIzX51aXKC05PjTXzS73z4i4E", "alt_text": null}]}

One worker will record their contact details, then direct them to a colleague who will insert a swab into their nasal passage to gather a sample for testing.\n\nTravellers are then allowed to continue their journey. Test results will come through between 24 and 48 hours later, when travellers will be contacted by public health workers.\n\n\"The test (results) are not available immediately. We don't know if someone is positive or negative,\" Paumier told Reuters at the airport.\n\n\"But the objective is to follow these people, especially those who are positive, to follow them up, and find out who they've been in contact with.\"\n\nQUARANTINE QUERIED\n\nWith fears around Europe of\n\na second wave of the coronavirus epidemic,\n\nsome governments have advised against travel to high-risk destinations, or told travellers they must quarantine themselves on their return.\n\nThat has prompted anger from some holidaymakers, and the travel and tourism industry, who say it is a blunt instrument.\n\nTravel executives have proposed testing on arrival as a way to curb the epidemic without disrupting travel plans.\n\nCharles de Gaulle airport has been trialling the testing - on a voluntary basis - near a bureau de change in the arrivals area.

The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction.\n\nThe PMI echoed upbeat readings from other major Asian export nations, with factory production in South Korea jumping at the fastest rate in more than 11 years, and Japan's output snapping four months of decline.\n\nHowever, analysts caution that the recovery could stall amid rising global infections and as China's factories deal with flood disruptions.\n\n\"The current rapid pace of recovery is likely to slow in the coming months as the initial boost from reopening businesses fades,\" said Capital Economics analyst Julian Evans-Pritchard. \"The prop to exports from shipments of goods linked to the pandemic (like masks and work-from-home equipment) is also likely to diminish.\"\n\nReinforcing the downbeat outlook for global demand, industry research released yesterday showed worldwide smartphone sales down 14 per cent year on year in the second quarter.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

But the pace of declines slowed from the previous month, suggesting a bottoming out in these trends, while production and total new orders both hit four-month highs.\n\nSmall companies continue to feel both supply and demand pressure, with a sub-index for them falling further into contraction.\n\nJapan also showed signs of modest recovery in broader business and consumer activity as industrial output snapped four months of decline in June. Official data released yesterday showed factory output in the world's third-largest economy rose 2.7 per cent in June from the previous month when it hit its lowest level since March 2009 during the global financial crisis.\n\nThe rise was largely thanks to a bounce in motor vehicle production, and beat the median forecast for a 1.2 per cent increase in a Reuters poll of economists. Japan's economic activity has gradually resumed in recent months after the government lifted a state of emergency at the end of May.\n\nSeparate data showed its June jobless rate edged down from a three-year high reached in the previous month, although the number of available jobs per applicant fell to a more than five-year low.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nManufacturing\n\nChina\n\nJapan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/st_20200801_pmi01_58566022.jpg?VersionId=2KSJkfnCVpH0SzJgFcJtTl752N5iSAEe", "alt_text": "Employees at a plant of the Daimler-BAIC joint venture's Beijing Benz Automotive in Beijing in May.

But if it did, here is how it would work: The Constitution gives states the power to choose the \"times, places and manner\" of elections, but Congress can set national standards.\n\nSince 1845, Congress has set election day as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. That date is a vestige of an agricultural economy when autumn harvests were completed and Tuesdays did not interfere with trips to the market.\n\nEvery once in a while, someone proposes a change. The Weekend Voting Act - sponsored by Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Representative Louise Slaughter of New York, both Democrats - would have moved the election to the weekend after the first Friday in November. The Bill died in the last Congress without a vote.\n\nIt would be difficult to push the elections back much further without hitting legal and constitutional deadlines. States need time to complete their official counts and certify the results before appointing members of the Electoral College, called electors.\n\nBy law, the Electoral College meets on \"the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December\". This year, that day is Dec 14. If no election has been held, it would be up to state legislatures to decide how to cast their electoral votes and they could choose anyone.\n\nThe final step is for Congress to receive the Electoral College votes. That usually happens on Jan 6, but Congress has changed the date in the past.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

The Senate chooses the vice-president.\n\nFinally, there is one deadline that cannot be moved without a constitutional amendment. Inauguration day is Jan 20, 2021. Mr Trump's term ends at noon that day, whether there has been an election or not.\n\nIf no president or vice-president is chosen by then, the Speaker of the House becomes president. That is now Democrat Nancy Pelosi, but there will be an election for a new Speaker in January.\n\nBut if a catastrophe were to somehow prevent the election of new members of Congress, the president pro tem of the Senate would move to the White House.\n\nThat is Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. He was re-elected to a six-year term in 2016 and would be the one person in the line of succession whose eligibility does not rely on an election held in 2020.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nElections\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nWhy Mighty Jaxx needs tech-first financial operations to power its global growth\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\nSpacious homes, near nature and transport links: New condo lets families can find room to grow in Singapore\u2019s north\n\nAd\n\nThis season\u2019s must-have jeans, from curve to straight styles\n\nShop Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/ST_20200801_XTRUMPXCV7_5856694.jpg?VersionId=oka5HUzFkhm9SXpcFIz9lbIe.vakI60p", "alt_text": "The House Speaker - now Ms Nancy Pelosi (far left) - and Senate president pro tem - now Mr Chuck Grassley (left) - are next in the presidential line of succession if no president or vice-president is chosen by the end of Mr Donald Trump's term.

It paid an interim dividend of 0.38 cent a share for the corresponding period last year.\n\nRevenue for the half year fell 25.1 per cent to $234.2 million, owing to lower contributions from the real estate and jewellery segments. This was partly offset by the financial services segment.\n\nReal estate turnover fell by 38.6 per cent to $98.7 million, with sales for the period coming mainly from its Australia 108 project in Melbourne, which will achieve full completion this year.\n\nLikewise, the jewellery unit's revenue fell by 46.4 per cent to $34 million as shops were closed during the circuit breaker period, Aspial noted on Thursday.\n\nHowever, turnover from the financial services division rose by 11.7 per cent to $102.8 million, owing to higher contributions from pawnbroking and jewellery trading. This was partially offset by lower revenue from sales of jewellery and branded merchandise in Singapore, as well as the secured lending business.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

That allows international tournaments postponed because of the pandemic to catch up, but potentially at the expense of club fixtures. The French National Rugby League (LNR), which runs French club rugby, said it has taken a first step towards legal proceedings by issuing a formal notice to World Rugby, accusing it of modifying the international calendar \"without any real consultation with the professional leagues and in particular the LNR\".\n\nUnder the World Rugby plan, the Six Nations, put on hold in March with one round of games plus the Ireland-Italy match still to play, will be completed on Oct 24 and 31.\n\nA rest weekend after that will be followed by four consecutive rounds of international matches.\n\nThe Rugby Championship will take place over a reduced six-week period starting Nov 7.

It would represent a major blow for the Beijing-based company, which became one of only a handful of truly global Chinese conglomerates thanks to TikTok's commercial success.\n\nIt is was not immediately clear how the separation would happen and what ByteDance would do with the rest of TikTok's global operations.\n\nAn announcement on ByteDance's plans for TikTok could come soon, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the companies that have been in exploratory talks to buy TikTok, one of the sources said.\n\nWhile the Redmond, Washington-based company already owns professional social media network LinkedIn, it would face fewer regulatory hurdles in acquiring TikTok than its more direct competitors, such as Facebook, the source said.\n\nByteDance, Microsoft and the US Treasury Department, which chairs the government panel that has been reviewing ByteDance's ownership of TikTok, declined to comment.\n\n\"While we do not comment on rumors or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok,\" TikTok said in a statement.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Wednesday that TikTok was under a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and that he would be making a recommendation to President Donald Trump this week.\n\n\"We are looking at TikTok, we may be banning TikTok, we maybe doing some other things or a couple of options, but a lot of things are happening,\" Trump told reporters on Friday.\n\nAs relations between the United States and China deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong's autonomy, cyber security and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint in the dispute between the world's two largest economies.\n\nLast week, the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs unanimously passed a Bill that would bar US federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued devices. It will be taken up by the full Senate for a vote. The House of Representatives has already voted for a similar measure.\n\nByteDance has proactively been considering a range of options for TikTok amid pressure from the United States to relinquish control of the app, which allows users to create short videos with special effects and has become wildly popular with US teenagers.\n\nByteDance has received a proposal from some of its investors, including Sequoia and General Atlantic, to transfer majority ownership of TikTok to them, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe proposal values TikTok at about US$50 billion, but some ByteDance executives believe the app is worth more than that.\n\nByteDance has also fielded acquisition interest in TikTok from other companies and investment firms, Reuters has reported.\n\nByteDance acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly in a US$1 billion deal in 2017 and relaunched it as TikTok the following year. ByteDance did not seek approval for the acquisition from CFIUS, which reviews deals for potential national security risks. Reuters reported last year that CFIUS had opened an investigation into TikTok.\n\nThe United States has been increasingly scrutinising app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves US military or intelligence personnel.\n\nOrdering the divestment of TikTok would not be the first time the White House has taken action over such concerns.\n\nEarlier this year, Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech sold Grindr, a popular gay dating app it bought in 2016, for US$620 million after being ordered by CFIUS to divest.\n\nIn 2018, CFIUS forced China's Ant Financial to scrap plans to buy MoneyGram International Inc over concerns about the safety of data that could identify US citizens.\n\nVALUABLE STARTUP\n\nByteDance was valued at as much as US$140 billion earlier this year when one of its shareholders, Cheetah Mobile, sold a small stake in a private deal, Reuters has reported. The startup's investors include SoftBank Group Corp.\n\nThe bulk of its revenue comes from advertising on apps under its Chinese operations including Douyin - a Chinese version of TikTok - and news aggregator app Jinri Toutiao, as well as video-streaming app Xigua and Pipixia, an app for jokes and humorous videos.\n\nSome of the company's other overseas apps include work collaboration tool Lark and music streaming app Resso.\n\nTikTok CEO Kevin Mayer, a former Walt Disney Co executive, said in a blog post on Wednesday that the company was committed to following U.S. laws, and was allowing experts to observe its moderation policies and examine the code that drives its algorithms.\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nChina\n\nTikTok\n\nUS-China ties", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/file7boi88xx4ds1eul71gc9.jpg?VersionId=g.Qi9ozNU4CG5a4z0.pPbP3nX.fyBnP9", "alt_text": null}]}

officials warn could be worsened by drought and dry heat.\n\n\"The heatwave requires the state to be vigilant, and everyone to be cautious,\" French Prime Minister Jean Castex said while visiting firefighters in Bourg-en-Bresse, southeastern France.\n\nOfficials also urged families and neighbours to check in on the elderly, and retirement homes were on high alert since air-conditioners are being discouraged over fears they could foster coronavirus contagion.\n\nAn increase in Covid-19 cases prompted French officials to tighten face mask requirements in several cities this week, with many making them mandatory outdoors as well as in enclosed public spaces.\n\nHOTTEST DAY THIS YEAR\n\nIn the Netherlands, beachgoers were told to avoid the coastal resort of Zandvoort near Amsterdam, with public safety authorities saying it was too crowded to maintain social distancing.\n\n\"There are much quieter beaches on our coast and on other waters, I advise you to look for them,\" the regional safety authority chairperson Marianne Schuurmans was quoted as saying by Dutch media.\n\nLong queues of cyclists formed to take the ferry to Schiermonnikoog, one of the West Frisian islands near the German border, as temperatures in the southern Netherlands jumped to 35 Celsius.\n\nBritain's national weather service said it was \"the hottest day of the year by some way\", with the mercury climbing to 37.8 degrees at London's Heathrow Airport.\n\nMany in the capital packed onto trains heading for Brighton on the southern coast.\n\nAustria and Bulgaria also reported their hottest day yet this year, with Vienna topping 37 degrees before a summer storm brought some relief.\n\nThe Spanish weather service said most of the country was scorching under an air mass moving north from Africa, with Madrid reporting 38 degrees while several cities in the interior saw 40 degrees or more.\n\nAs the traditional August holidays approach, swimming pools were in high demand despite face mask requirements.\n\nIn Germany, which also recorded its hottest day for 2020 with temperatures exceeding 35 degrees in parts of the south, public pools imposed limits on swimmer numbers in a bid to reduce the infection risk, with online-only ticket sales, no access to the showers or changing rooms and a 1.5-metre distance to be observed in the pools and out.\n\nAuthorities also urged people to observe a safe distance between one another at rivers and lakes.\n\nWestern Europe can expect relief from the high temperatures from Saturday, forecasts show.\n\nSee more

It not only puts a strain on our National Health Service and care system, but it also piles pressure on our bodies, making us more vulnerable to many diseases, including, of course, coronavirus,\" says British Health Secretary Matthew Hancock, who unveiled this week a slew of measures intended to \"help people make healthier choices\" in the food they consume.\n\nBut the measures are already under attack from opposition politicians who dismiss the initiative as merely intended to deflect attention from the government's own record in managing health crises, and from leaders in the food industry who complain that the new regulations are too costly.\n\nAn analysis by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development released at the end of last year, just before the coronavirus pandemic, found that Britain is the second-fattest nation in Europe, with almost a third of the population classified as overweight.\n\nThe report also claims that, as a result, Britons now live, on average, 2.7 years less compared with their European peers.\n\nMore alarmingly still, obesity among schoolchildren is on the rise, notwithstanding the fact that menus in all schools have long been subject to careful nutritional assessment.\n\nBut it was the coronavirus crisis that dramatically illustrated the dangers of being overweight, for the latest statistics indicate that the risks of dying from the virus increase by at least 25 per cent if the affected person is overweight.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

his life was in danger and he had to be treated in intensive care, largely because he was overweight.\n\nAs a result, Mr Johnson is now an enthusiastic convert. \"Losing weight is hard, but with some small changes we can all feel fitter and healthier,\" he told the nation.\n\nAnd for good measure, he posted a video of himself, taking an energetic walk with his dog, to prove the virtues of healthy living.\n\nSee more on\n\nBritain\n\nObesity\n\nFood and beverage sector\n\nAdvertising and marketing", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

And for that, I am sorry,\" she added.\n\nDeGeneres, one of the most prominent gay women celebrities in the United States, also referred to criticism that has been levelled at her personally in recent media reports.\n\n\"I'm also learning that people who work with me and for me are speaking on my behalf and misrepresenting who I am and that has to stop,\" she said.\n\n\"As someone who was judged and nearly lost everything for just being who I am, I truly understand and have deep compassion for those being looked at differently, or treated unfairly, not equal, or - worse - disregarded. To think that any one of you felt that way is awful to me.\"\n\nDeGeneres, whose show has won dozens of awards in its 17 years on the air, said she was glad that her production team was \"finally having conversations about fairness and justice\".\n\n\"We all have to be more mindful about the way our words and actions affect others,\" she added.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nCelebrities\n\nTelevision", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/ST_20200801_TREND01_5856273.jpg?VersionId=QVnE0M7CTMe1ukQI.G6cwqOblTCRcJua", "alt_text": null}]}

When approached, they identified themselves as Malaysians working for SMRT. Other guests said they were factory workers from Malaysia. Both groups said they are at the hotel temporarily, due to the Malaysian movement control order that took effect on March 18.\n\nWhen contacted, SMRT referred ST to the Ministry of Health (MOH) for more information.\n\nThe hotel's general manager Tony Cousens told ST it was informed by MOH on July 24 that a city guest who visited the hotel was identified as a positive case, and that the hotel gave the ministry the necessary information for contact tracing.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Workers must therefore be housed separately according to their construction site, to reduce mixing, and jobs must be scheduled to keep groups segregated.\n\n\"However smaller contractors may not have enough workers to have the flexibility for such arrangements,\" said the Scal spokesman.\n\nMr Roger Heng's firm, LSK Engineering, is an electrical engineering sub-contractor with about 60 workers, of which 15 per cent have been cleared to work.\n\nApart from critical mass, Mr Heng said that construction sites also need workers with different skills. But work remains stalled at some sites because those who have been cleared may not have specific skills, he explained.\n\nMr Loo said housing his workers in a range of accommodation, including construction temporary quarters (CTQs) at the worksite itself, has helped him to meet cohorting requirements.\n\n\"But it is still a challenge. If your worksite has no space, or if it is in a built-up environment, then you can't build CTQs,\" he noted.\n\nA BCA spokesman told ST yesterday that it is looking at ways to further review the requirements, \"factoring in the feedback from industry\".\n\nBCA said it has been engaging associations such as Scal, the Specialist Trade Alliance of Singapore and the Dormitory Association of Singapore to help employers \"cohort\" workers staying in purpose-built dormitories.\n\nMr Hooi also had concerns that time spent on mandatory swab testing for construction workers at 14-day intervals - a critical measure to mitigate outbreaks - will create bottlenecks. A new online system has been created to hopefully ease the process.\n\nFrom today, BCA said, employers can make appointments for these periodic swab tests online with the Health Promotion Board.\n\nMOM said that measures such as cohorting and regular testing help to ensure a safe and controlled restart of work.\n\n\"This will minimise the risk of a resurgence of infections, and safeguard the health of workers and our community at large. We seek the understanding of employers in this regard,\" it added.\n\nACCESSCODE ISSUES\n\nContractors have also raised issues with MOM's AccessCode, which gives \"green\" status to workers allowed back to work.\n\nMr Loo, who has more than 300 migrant workers, was one of several in the industry who had problems with the system, with workers' statuses switching erratically.\n\nOn Thursday, MOM said it was notified by some employers that their workers' status had unexpectedly turned \"red\", which means they cannot work.\n\nThe issue was resolved in an hour. Yesterday, an MOM spokesman said the ministry recognises that \"the multiple conditions which determine the AccessCode status pose a challenge for employers and workers\".\n\n\"We understand the challenges faced by all parties, and are working towards simplifying the conditions, making information more accessible and enhancing user experience,\" said the spokesman.\n\nFrom July 12, for example, MOM introduced new features for employers to check AccessCode details through an online service, Safe\u200a@\u200aWork, while workers can use the SGWorkPass app. MOM also removed a previous \"grey\" status to make the codes simpler.\n\nBut the ministry also said employers, operators and workers need to do their part by providing accurate data for AccessCode, which is critical for it to run smoothly even as enhancements are made.\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nConstruction sector\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nForeign workers\n\nCovid-19 Special", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/nz_construction_010822.jpg?VersionId=ad2QzImHfM7XTmCBGHZSKLlbH6c_eWIu", "alt_text": null}]}

They will have to wait at least another two weeks, he said.\n\nHe also extended regulations to make face coverings compulsory in more indoor settings, such as museums and cinemas, and said police will enforce compliance from Aug 8.\n\nWhile the Prime Minister insisted he does not want to reimpose a \"full national lockdown\", he said it is vital for the public to obey the rules to avoid more drastic action.\n\n\"Our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control,\" he said in a televised press conference yesterday.\n\n\"We cannot be complacent.

However, I kept the soil in which the plants were grown. Is it safe to reuse this soil?\n\nWoon Siew Hung\n\nIt can be difficult to advise if the pest that attacked your basil plants earlier is not known.\n\nTo be safe, you may want to sterilise the soil before reusing it to grow new plants. The easiest way is perhaps to put the soil in a large bucket and pour in hot water. The soil suspension is then allowed to cool gradually. Then pour out the water and allow the soil to dry.\n\nYou will need to break the dried soil into smaller bits by using a hand hoe. Incorporate soil amendments such as good quality compost to improve the soil. Some gardeners also enrich potting soil with organic fertiliser before growing new plants with it.\n\nPlant from the melon family but is a weed\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

I have looked in the book, 1001 Garden Plants In Singapore, but still cannot identify it. What is this plant?\n\nFrankie Meehan\n\nThe plant often grows as a weed in wastelands. It is botanically known as Gymnopetalum scabrum and a member of the melon family (Cucurbitaceae). It is not known to have food uses.\n\nSnake plants lack water and light\n\nI have some potted snake plants I keep indoors. Lately, the leaves of two of the plants became curved and lumpy. I always use a small water spray and sun the plants twice weekly. What is wrong with the plants?\n\nRicky Choo\n\nGARDENING WITH EDIBLES - FACEBOOK LIVE\n\nNParks' gardening experts Wilson Wong and Jacqueline Chua will be sharing tips and tricks for growing your own edible plants in its first Gardening with Edibles Facebook Live session.\n\nThey will also be answering your questions on growing edibles.\n\nWHEN: Today, 10 to 10.45am\n\nWHERE: Live on NParksBuzz Facebook,\n\nwww.facebook.com/\n\nnparksbuzz, or go to bit.ly/2D7ZP38\n\nThe leaves of your snake plants (Sansevieria cultivar) seem to have some wrinkle lines. Together with the curling of the leaf margins, these signs suggest your plants may be lacking water.\n\nAlthough the snake plant is often regarded as a drought-tolerant plant, it will be detrimental to its health if it has been allowed to dry out for a prolonged period of time.\n\nAfter each watering, excess water should come out from the drainage holes at the base of the pot - this is an indication your plant has been thoroughly watered. Allow the soil to dry out slightly before watering again.\n\nThe slight elongation of the new leaves may also point to the lack of light. Depending on the cultivar, some snake plants do better with several hours of direct sunlight. With sufficient sunlight, your plants will retain the attractive, compact growth habit expected of the cultivar.\n\nApply neem oil to kill mealy bugs on plant\n\nI have some potted plants that seem infected with mites. I have been applying diluted dishwasher liquid (one teaspoon in 300ml water) on the affected areas. It helps to get rid of the infection, but not completely. What can I do?\n\nPeter See\n\nThe pests attacking your plant appear to be mealy bugs. They suck sap from your plant and if they are in large numbers, the plant can weaken and die eventually.\n\nInspect plants regularly and manage infestations promptly. To manage the current pest population, you can first use a jet of water to wash off adult pests.\n\nNext, apply a solution of summer oil or neem oil pesticide on all parts of the plant - the pesticide suffocates the pests. Repeated applications are needed to keep the pest population in check.\n\nSeveral reasons causing bean seedlings to wilt\n\nI grew this plant from green beans. I notice the shoots bending downwards recently as I was watering the plant. Is this common or is it because the plant lacks water?\n\nTan Rui Yang\n\nThe wilting of your bean seedlings could be due to a number of reasons. They might have dried out. Do the seedlings feel floppy? As plants grow, their demand of water increases and it is important to keep up with their water needs by giving water promptly, especially during hot weather.\n\nNext, check if the roots are healthy. Over-watering can cause roots to suffocate and die, which prevents the uptake of water. As a result, plants will wilt.\n\nThey could also be affected by damping off disease, which causes the seedlings to collapse at the base of each plant.\n\n\u2022 Answers by Dr Wilson Wong, an NParks-certified practising horticulturist, parks manager and ISA-certified arborist.

The renovation works were expected to be completed by the end of May, but this has been delayed to the end of this month.\n\nST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nMichelle Ng\n\nFollow topic:\n\nHDB\n\nPublished\n\nAug 01, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nNot only has Mr Abdul Hadi's home renovation completion date been delayed by three months, the 31-year-old is now looking at an additional $2,000 to $3,000 in renovation costs.\n\nThe increase in costs is due mainly to manpower shortage faced by Renodiction, the local interior design (ID) company he engaged, as skilled workers, such as carpenters, plumbers and electricians, remain stuck in Malaysia.\n\nHome renovation works, which were halted during the two-month circuit breaker period, have been facing delays even after works could resume after the easing of circuit breaker measures on June 2.\n\nBut Mr Hadi, who works as a safety officer in the construction industry and has experienced similar labour shortages first-hand, is taking it in his stride.\n\nWhen the Covid-19 situation got serious, Mr Hadi expected costs might go up, so he set aside some money as a buffer. \"As someone in the construction industry, I understand our ID's perspective and I don't want to pressure him on that front,\" said Mr Hadi, who is expecting a second child next month with his homemaker wife.\n\nRenovations for their four-room Build-To-Order (BTO) flat in Sengkang were expected to be completed by the end of May, but this has been delayed to the end of this month.\n\nLike Mr Hadi, more home owners will likely have to pay more for renovation works as the renovation industry, which is heavily reliant on Malaysian workers, continues to struggle with a labour shortage.\n\nHome renovation costs have increased by 10 to 20 per cent industry-wide in recent weeks, compared with pre-Covid-19 days, according to contractors and ID companies interviewed by The Straits Times.\n\nThis comes even as more home renovation projects have been given the green light by the Building and Construction Authority to resume works. Yesterday, BCA told The Straits Times that around 60,000 renovation projects have been approved, including 24,000 residential projects that were previously suspended.\n\nWhile Mr Hadi can empathise with the predicament contractors and ID companies are in, the increase in costs, coupled with multitudes of delays, may be a tough pill for other home owners to swallow.\n\nDr Sky Tan, president of the Singapore Renovation Contractors and Material Suppliers Association (RCMA), said companies will either absorb the costs or pass them on to their new customers, although most firms will try to negotiate for the best price with their vendors and suppliers before doing so.\n\nHe added that firms will have to factor any possible cost increase into their quotations to new customers, while honouring the stated prices on contracts with existing clients signed before Covid-19 hit.\n\nAround 80 per cent of workers in the trade are Malaysians, said Dr Tan.\n\nCompanies are now pinning their hopes on the resumption of cross-border travel between Singapore and Malaysia, for which applications will kick off on Aug 10.\n\nLong-term pass holders and travellers on essential or official business will benefit from the reciprocal green lane and the periodic commuting arrangement.\n\nTo ensure projects can go ahead, some ID companies have had to hire local workers, who command a higher rate, or make do with a reduced pool of workers.\n\nRenodiction's founder Azri Abbas, 43, said around 70 per cent of his workforce is back at work, as the foreign workers he employs have been cleared of Covid-19 and are allowed to leave their dormitories to resume work. The remaining 30 per cent are Malaysians.\n\nAll of his eight ongoing projects have been affected, with costs going up \"a bit here and there\".\n\n\"I tell my clients, if they don't want to pay extra and are okay to wait a little longer, I'll use my Malaysian workers to complete their homes when they are allowed to come into Singapore. But if they want it completed fast, I will have to hire more local workers so costs will naturally go up a little,\" he said.\n\nBigger companies that have their own in-house subcontractors have it slightly easier, as they are able to prioritise available workers for their own projects, instead of relying on external contractors.\n\nMr Alloyious Koh, 29, chief creative consultant of Carpenters Design Group, said his company is able to manage some of the bigger renovation works such as carpentry and hacking with its current workforce.\n\nWorkers who are still in Malaysia make up around 40 per cent of his headcount. They are mainly in charge of works such as tiling and false ceiling installations.\n\nMr Koh takes a case-by-case approach when managing manpower for his 80 to 100 ongoing projects.\n\n\"For clients who don't have an alternative place to live in or are paying money for rental flats to stay in in the interim, we'll try to prioritise their projects if we have the manpower to do so. We're not a heartless company,\" he said.\n\nMr Michael Ong, 40, founder of TBG Interior Design, said 90 per cent of his workers are back on worksites, with the remaining 10 per cent still stuck in Malaysia.\n\nMr Ong has opted to absorb the additional costs for contracts that were signed before the circuit breaker period. He estimates at least three out of the 12 ongoing projects will not yield any profit, while his overall revenue has dipped 30 to 40 per cent.\n\nHe said: \"Now it's really just wait and see if we can sort out travel agreements with Malaysia. But even then, we must be prepared that it may not be the full workforce.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nHDB\n\nRenovation\n\nBCA/Building and Construction Authority\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19 Special", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/ST_20200801_VNCOST_5856840.jpg?VersionId=h6XLNs9t66IiN6nGBxuTOG_Te6POn_by", "alt_text": "Renodiction's founder Azri Abbas having a discussion with home owner Abdul Hadi (right), in Mr Hadi's four-room Build-To-Order flat in Sengkang last Saturday.

He is also eight in front of new world No. 1, Jon Rahm of Spain.\n\nOn matching his career-low round on the PGA Tour, the 30-year-old attributed his improvement - after several dismal displays since the circuit's restart in June - to being reunited with his coach Pete Cowen.\n\nBefore the Memphis event, the duo had not been able to meet due to the coronavirus pandemic and Koepka revealed he was thankful for the tough love after over four months of separation.\n\n\"With Pete, it's more psychological,\" he said. \"He'll beat me down, tell me I can't do something, he'll jump on me pretty good and I enjoy that when someone tells me I can't do something.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

I never really felt like I was having to work too hard out there, so that's a little different than it has been.\n\n\"The confidence has been there. It is a matter of going out and doing it. It is going to come around. It feels like I am back to normal, so it is good to see a good result.\"\n\nSince suffering a torn patella tendon last year, Koepka has been undergoing stem-cell treatment while opting to put off surgery.\n\nChoosing not to go under the knife has meant hours on the greens tinkering with the mechanics of his swing and his leg positioning, and he is hopeful of recovering the form that has seen him win successive PGA of America Player of the Year awards.\n\n\"We put in a lot of work and found something by making a little adjustment in my set-up - where my weight distribution was going,\" he added.\n\n\"It is clicking and it feels good. It feels back to normal.

Google parent Alphabet Inc fell 3.3% though, the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, as it posted the first quarterly sales dip in its 16 years as a public company.\n\n\"The results were just fabulous, just so strong,\" said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \"These are extremely profitable companies and they produce products that people want.\"\n\nThe four companies are among the top five in market capitalization, representing roughly 20% of the S&P 500's total. Apple's gain pushed it ahead of Saudi Aramco as the world's most valuable public company, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe White House and Democrats were still negotiating on coronavirus relief aid, but not yet on a path toward reaching a deal, according to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, hours before the expiration of a federal unemployment benefit.\n\n\"It seems like they are far apart and supposedly they are working at it and there is a lot of name calling and as usual there is a lot of bad blood between these two parties and they have to come to some compromise, clearly, but they are not there, that's for sure,\" said Ghriskey.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

They had a chance, they say we have not answered all the questions and we have done so.

And it completed a schism that has left James estranged from his 89-year-old father and his older brother, Lachlan, once a dynastic triumvirate that for years held sweeping influence over the world's cultural and political affairs.\n\nA political outlier in his conservative-leaning family, James Murdoch has sought to reinvent himself as an independent investor with a focus on environmentalism, and has taken public stands against President Donald Trump, who counts Fox News, a prime Murdoch asset, among his closest media allies.\n\nWeeks ago, James and his wife, Kathryn Murdoch, jointly contributed more than US$1 million (S$1.38 million) to a fundraising committee for former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.\n\nAnd in February, as wildfires raged across Australia - his father's birthplace - Murdoch issued a rebuke of his own family's media properties, criticising how Murdoch publications have covered climate change.\n\nRupert Murdoch has described himself as a \"climate skeptic,\" while James has lately invested millions in companies that emphasise sustainability.\n\nJames Murdoch remains a beneficiary of his family's trust, meaning he will continue to financially benefit from the profits of Rupert Murdoch's news and information assets. But his last formal link to the family business was through News Corp, which publishes influential broadsheets like The Wall Street Journal as well as powerful tabloids, including The Sun of London and The New York Post.\n\nThe company also oversees several other papers in Britain and publications in Australia.\n\nJames Murdoch had already departed Fox, the family's television and entertainment arm, after his family transferred many of its assets to Walt Disney in a blockbuster sale that was completed last year.\n\nThere were discussions about the possibility of Murdoch joining Disney, but those talks came to nothing.\n\nMeanwhile, his 48-year-old brother was named executive chairman and chief executive officer of Fox, which includes Fox News, Fox Business and Fox-branded sports and entertainment television networks.\n\nJames Murdoch netted US$2 billion from the Disney deal and has tried to rebrand himself as an investor who is focused on environmental companies and causes.\n\nThat interest was apparent during the time he worked under his father, when he championed sustainability projects at Sky, the European satellite giant that was formerly part of the Murdoch empire, and helped pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the National Geographic Society's endowment fund.\n\nA spokeswoman for Murdoch declined to comment further on the reasons for his departure, saying the letter \"speaks for itself.\"\n\nHis father and Lachlan Murdoch, co-chairman of News Corp, said in a joint statement on Friday: \"We're grateful to James for his many years of service to the company. We wish him the very best in his future endeavors.\"\n\nAfter the merger deal with Disney was completed, James Murdoch tended to steer clear of the family business.\n\nHe started his own investment firm, Lupa Systems. (In Roman mythology, Lupa is the wolf goddess who nurtured Romulus and Remus, the twin brothers who became the founders of Rome.)\n\nThe firm specialises in early stage startups, taking on a nurturing role in the fledgling businesses.\n\nMurdoch has also taken a starkly different tack with his media investments. In October, he bought a small stake in Vice Media, the irreverent news brand focused on youth and entertainment.\n\nHe has been less interested in traditional media businesses.\n\nIn August, Murdoch led a consortium of investors to buy a controlling stake in Tribeca Enterprises, which owns the Tribeca Film Festival as well as a production studio. He also put money into Artists, Writers & Artisans, a new comics publisher founded by former Marvel executives.\n\nSee more on\n\nMedia\n\nNewspapers", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/file6uei82joezn1acsqxhol.jpg?VersionId=UJatLyBOjcmOdbG63GTLoeHeKkrhi_cp", "alt_text": null}]}

Its initial public offering fell short of Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman's expectations.\n\nThe kingdom's de facto ruler initially wanted a valuation of US$2 trillion and to raise US$100 billion. But after foreign investors balked at the pricing, the government settled on a smaller domestic offering and raised about US$30 billion, still the largest IPO ever.\n\nThen came this year's plunge in crude prices as energy demand crashed with the spread of the virus. Aramco's second-quarter revenue probably dropped to about US$37 billion from US$76 billion a year earlier, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That's less than the US$59.7 billion in sales that Apple reported for its most recent period.\n\nAramco's stock is down 6.4 per cent since the end of December, though that's far less than the fall of other oil majors. Exxon Mobil has declined 40 per cent and Royal Dutch Shell has dropped 50 per cent.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has benefited, as the pandemic has strengthened the market positions of the world's biggest technology companies, which boast strong balance sheets and fast-growing businesses thanks to an acceleration in the shift to digital services.\n\nThe iPhone maker's shares have gained 45 per cent so far this year.\n\nSee more on\n\nApple\n\nTechnology sector\n\nStock market", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/file7boin1c1o8j1dui9y8l4.jpg?VersionId=DwO.U4vHNnuOBSbwIHnLZDvC9jvtuEPl", "alt_text": null}]}

Other major sporting organisations which have joined the initiative include La Liga, New York Yankees, and the All England Lawn Tennis Club.\n\nSGC will join these other participants in committing to a set of five agreed principles and incorporating them into their club strategy, policies and procedures.\n\nThey are to promote greater environmental responsibility; reduce the overall climate impact from sports; use the platform to educate for climate action; promote sustainable and responsible consumption; and advocate for climate action through communications.\n\nThe initiative will also provide sports organisations with a forum where they will have the opportunity to pursue climate action by learning from one another, developing new tools, and collaborating on areas of mutual interest.\n\nSGC general manager and director of agronomy Andrew Johnston said: \"We have already taken great strides with our sustainability programme in the last two years and are therefore extremely excited to be joining this initiative. We believe it is the right step for us as a club to continue on our journey to tackle climate change throughout the world and the game of golf.\"\n\nSince launching its #KeepItGreen campaign at the SMBC Singapore Open in January 2018, SGC has implemented numerous environmental features such as the creation of its own bee colonies, using rechargeable lithium batteries in golf carts, and banning single-use plastics from both its golf courses. Currently the World's Best Golf Club (World Golf Awards), it has also installed electric vehicle charging sockets and built a sustainable herb garden.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

That's to win a championship and bring it to the city of Los Angeles and fan base.\"\n\nBoth teams showed rust - the Clippers committed 22 turnovers compared to 16 for the Lakers. The Lakers prevailed, despite shooting 39 per cent from the floor to 43.2 per cent for the Clippers.\n\nPaul George had 30 points for the Clippers (44-21), but he missed a three-point attempt at the final horn. Kawhi Leonard finished with 28 points.\n\nAlthough there will no longer be any home-court advantage given that the league is playing out the rest of the campaign in Orlando, according to The Athletic, the Lakers (50-14) will be given the best hotel at Disney World should they secure the top billing by beating champions Toronto Raptors today.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nLeBron James\n\nNBA\n\nBasketball players", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

face paint and feathers, for example.\n\nMany social media users noted that Disney Plus is not accessible in African nations, and that while Beyonce has performed some shows on the continent, her tours haven't included dates there in years.\n\n\"Someone with the range must unpack how our beloved queen Beyonce is reducing blackness and Africanness to aesthetics and the western imaginations of our existence,\" tweeted one user, Paballo Chauke.\n\n\"They must also speak about how it's now profitable to do such gimmicks.\"\n\nStill, the Bey Hive - Beyonce's legion of ardent fans - voiced elation over the release of \"Black Is King,\" which quickly became a top trending hashtag.\n\nSee more on\n\nCelebrities\n\nAlbums", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/106119566_10164118734730601_561407486214434943_n.jpg?VersionId=4dk_mh3gKorle2_YZwCGiySh1y6RrvfD", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

The Brazil forward's contract expires at the end of the season, but Lampard claimed he would have no qualms naming him in his line-up at Wembley despite rumours that Arsenal might be his next destination.\n\nOn the 31-year-old, he said: \"I've known Willian for many years now, as a player and now as his coach. So I would expect nothing less than he's shown already, and that's Willian for you.\"\n\nWhile Lampard is hopeful victory can spur his team to new heights, Arsenal, who can play in the Europa League next term only if they win the Cup, are in the early stages of rebuilding under Mikel Arteta.\n\nCritics feel his side will be the underdogs, pointing out that they froze in last year's Europa League final, crumbling 4-1 to today's opponents.\n\nHowever, the Spaniard yesterday insisted that heavy loss would have no bearing at Wembley, saying: \"A year in football is a different life... so there is not many things to take from that (defeat).\"\n\nA loss today will likely hasten an exit for top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who only has one year left on his deal, although Arteta told reporters that he \"did not fear\" this could be the striker's final appearance for the club.\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, there will be no presentation party, nor will the winning side ascend the steps to the Royal Box as the trophy will instead be awarded on the pitch.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nArsenal\n\nChelsea\n\nFA Cup\n\nCoronavirus\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nWin 2x tickets to New Zealand.

These proteins play different roles at different stages of the virus' life cycle as it replicates and infects other cells in the body.\n\nOther kinds of software can also help scientists develop drugs to inhibit the Sars-CoV-2 virus.\n\nUsing molecular graphic software, Associate Professor Luo Dahai of NTU's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine identified the virus' main protease, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

A surge of new infections in many parts of the world has prompted some countries to reintroduce some travel restrictions. The WHO had said in June it would update its travel guidelines before the northern hemisphere summer holidays.\n\nThe WHO's guidance can be used by governments and industries to help shape policies, but is not enforceable. The updated travel advice is little changed from previous guidance, which also included infection control advice applicable in other settings such as social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands and avoiding touching the face.\n\nThe WHO's emergency committee was set to meet for a fourth time yesterday to assess the raging pandemic.

GDP fell by 17.3 per cent compared with the year-ago second quarter, Istat said, as the coronavirus lockdown took a dramatic toll on the euro zone's third-largest economy.\n\nThe three countries suffered sharper GDP shocks compared with the record 10.1 per cent fall in Germany.\n\nAustria suffered a 10.7 per cent contraction and Belgium 12.2 per cent.

Deals are conducted via private chat groups and social media platforms, away from unwanted attention. But such illicit trades do not escape the watchful eye of law enforcement.\n\nOn Tuesday, three Chinese nationals were arrested when they had tried to sell part of their loot - 46 cartons and 42 packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes in all - to undercover Singapore Customs officers.\n\nCustoms' Suppression and Community Engagement Branch (SCEB) had mounted two operations that day against peddlers who were dealing on WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging app. The media was allowed to observe the night operations in central Singapore.\n\nIn the first operation, the SCEB had made earlier arrangements to buy 20 cartons of contraband cigarettes from a peddler near MacPherson Lane. One of the leaders of the SCEB operation told The Straits Times that unlike street peddlers who sell loose packets of cigarettes, online peddlers prefer selling larger quantities.\n\nThe officer said: \"The only way to lure them out is to make a purchase. But from experience there's no guarantee they will show up.\"\n\nThat night the peddler, who lived at a nearby block, did show up - only to be arrested on the spot by plainclothes Customs officers. In a red plastic bag, he had 15 cigarette cartons wrapped in black tape.\n\n\"The peddler we arrested told us he kept more cigarettes at home,\" said Mr Chua Teck Hui, head of SCEB. \"But we found none there.\"\n\nInitial investigations revealed the peddler's co-tenant had seen the man getting arrested and rushed to their flat to get rid of evidence.\n\nHe threw some cigarettes down the rubbish chute, and also stashed a bag containing 17 cartons and 14 packets of illicit cigarettes on the 12th floor of the block.\n\nIn the MacPherson Lane operation, where 33 cartons and 32 packets of cigarettes were seized, the total duty and goods and services tax evaded amounted to $3,320.\n\nIn a second sting later that night, another peddler was arrested near Jalan Damai in Kaki Bukit.\n\nTwenty-one online peddlers were caught in the first half of this year; 42 were arrested in all, last year.\n\nSome 2.9 million packets of contraband cigarettes were seized from online sellers, street peddlers and smugglers last year - 500,000 packets more than in 2018.\n\nThe number of people caught buying duty-unpaid cigarettes last year - 6,920 - was also up from the 6,115 the year before. This figure has trended upwards since 2016, when 5,184 buyers were caught for the offence.\n\n\"Singapore Customs will clamp down hard on anyone who uses social media and messaging platforms for any duty-unpaid cigarette activities,\" said Mr Chua.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Customs\n\nTax evasion\n\nSmuggling", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/08/01/nz_arrest_010828.jpg?VersionId=LFfFOZEY0xrC2Vz1.P4debNR32hQf1aA", "alt_text": null}]}

She was puzzled to find him watching TV and looking well as her colleague had told her that he did not pick up her phone calls.\n\nWhen she asked him if his bedside phone was working, he stared blankly at her.\n\nRealising that the migrant worker might not understand much English and could have been reluctant to answer the phone, she used gestures to ask him if he had a cough or felt breathless.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Only two months ago, a cyclone pummelled the country's southwest. Along the coast, a rising sea has swallowed entire villages. And while it's too soon to ascertain what role climate change has played in these latest floods, Bangladesh is already witnessing a pattern of more severe and more frequent river flooding than in the past along the mighty Brahmaputra River, scientists say, and that is projected to worsen in the years ahead as climate change intensifies the rains.\n\n\"The suffering will go up,\" said Sajedul Hasan, the humanitarian director of BRAC, an international development organisation based in Bangladesh that is distributing food, cash and liquid soap to displaced people.\n\nThis is one of the most striking inequities of the modern era. Those who are least responsible for polluting Earth's atmosphere are among those most hurt by its consequences. The average American is responsible for 33 times more planet-warming carbon dioxide than the average Bangladeshi.\n\nThis chasm has bedevilled diplomacy for a generation, and it is once again in stark relief as the coronavirus pandemic upends the global economy and threatens to push the world's most vulnerable people deeper into ruin.\n\nAn estimated 24 per cent to 37 per cent of the country's landmass is submerged, according to government estimates and satellite data. By Tuesday (July 28), according to the most recent figures available, nearly 1 million homes were inundated and 4.7 million people were affected. At least 54 have died, most of them children.\n\nThe current floods, which are a result of intense rains upstream on the Brahmaputra, could last through the middle of August. Until then, Taijul Islam, a 30-year-old sharecropper whose house has washed away, will have to camp out in a makeshift bamboo shelter on slightly higher ground. At least he was able to salvage the tin sheet that was once the roof of his house. Without it, he said, his extended family of nine would be exposed to the elements.\n\nIslam's predicament is multiplied by the millions among those on the front lines of climate change. Vanuatu is literally sinking into the Pacific. Pastoralists in the Horn of Africa are being pushed to the edge of survival by back-to-back droughts. In the megacity of Mumbai, the rains come in terrifying cloudbursts.\n\nThe inequity is striking, no matter which way you slice it. One recent analysis found that the world's richest 10 per cent are responsible for up to 40 per cent of global environmental damage, including climate change, while the poorest 10 per cent account for less than 5 per cent.\n\nAnother estimated that warming had reduced incomes in the world's poorest countries by between 17 per cent and 30 per cent.\n\nREPARATIONS\n\nPoor countries have long sought a kind of reparations for what they call loss and damage from climate change. Rich countries, led by the United States and European Union, have resisted, mainly out of concern that they could be saddled with liability claims for climate damage.\n\nIt doesn't help that the rich world has failed to deliver on a US$100 billion (S$138 billion) aid package to help poor countries cope, promised as part of the 2015 Paris accord.\n\nCoronavirus recovery plans have lately begun to open the door to new discussions about debt relief linked to climate resilience.\n\nIn June, the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, led by Belize, pressed for what it called a new compact with private and bilateral creditors \"to deliver debt relief and increase resilience financing\".\n\nCaribbean countries, with their economies ravaged by hurricanes in recent years, now find themselves falling deeper into debt as the pandemic dries up tourism revenues. A study commissioned by the United Nations found that the 20 most climate-vulnerable countries have paid more than US$40 billion in additional interest payments because of losses stemming from extreme weather events.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the flooding of the Brahmaputra reflects the unequal pain of extreme weather.\n\nThe floods began in June. In most cases, heavy rains upstream in neighbouring India swelled the river basins that flow through Bangladesh before draining into the Bay of Bengal. Those who live along the Brahmaputra are no strangers to flooding. When the river swells, work stops, land erodes, people move to higher ground and wait for the waters to recede. They rely on their savings or aid to feed themselves.\n\nThis year was different, though. By the time the river flooded, in June, people were already running out of food, said Hasan of BRAC.\n\nBecause of the lockdown, working people had all but stopped working. Remittances from relatives abroad, many of them newly unemployed, had dried up. In the countryside, people had begun to sell their goats and cattle at bargain prices. They had no food to eat.\n\nWhen the river first swelled, Taijul Islam, the sharecropper from the Kurigram district in the country's north, rushed to save his livestock - cattle, goats, chickens, ducks. A few, he rescued. Many, he lost. The river took away the small vegetable garden next to his house, then his house, where he had stashed roughly 590kg of rice. Then it washed away a small shop that he ran when he wasn't working on other people's land. Also the school that his 6-year-old son attended in the village.\n\nAll he can think of now is where he can go to earn a living. He is the sole breadwinner of his extended family. All nine of them had been living on rice, boiled potato and lentils. Vegetables are unaffordable, let alone fish or meat, which, he said, \"are now unimaginable\".\n\nAkkas Ali, 48, had already been through a bad flood. He moved to Islam's village six years ago, when his old village washed into the Brahmaputra. Two weeks ago, as the river rose, breaking through its embankments, his four acres of farmland went underwater. The village mosque and market washed away. So, too, a secondary school where more than 250 children were enrolled. Ali worried where they would go to school now, if at all.\n\nHis house still stood this week, but the river, which had been 400m, had rushed dangerously close. He was sure it, too, would wash away soon.\n\nThe Brahmaputra is a fearsome, shape-shifting 3,840km river that erupts from the Tibetan Himalayas and spills into northeastern India before merging with the Ganges in Bangladesh and emptying into the Bay of Bengal. It irrigates vast areas of farmland but it's also unpredictable, often swallowing the islands that form within it, like the one where Ali's village once stood.\n\nClimate change, too, is altering its fate - and that of the people who live along its banks. The rains are more unpredictable and the river is rising above dangerous levels far more frequently than it did before, according to 35 years of flooding data analysed by A.K.M. Saiful Islam, a water management expert at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in Dhaka.\n\nThe last five years alone have brought four major floods, eroding people's capacity to adapt, Islam said.\n\nMore and worse floods loom.\n\nEven if average global temperature increase modestly - by 2 degrees Celsius over the average for preindustrial times - flooding along the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh is projected to increase by 24 per cent. With an increase of 4 degrees Celsius, flooding is projected to increase by more than 60 per cent.\n\nNo matter what, Islam, the water management expert, said, the country will have to adapt. That requires money to dredge rivers, maintain embankments, improve drainage and offer aid to those who are repeatedly displaced and impoverished.\n\nAdvocates for the poor say Bangladesh's predicament with disasters illustrates exactly why climate negotiations, postponed until 2021, need to deliver compensation for people who have not caused the problem.\n\n\"People are losing whatever little they have,\" said Farah Kabir, the Bangladesh country director for ActionAid International. \"When and how are they going to be supported? When is the global community going to take responsibility?\"\n\nSee more on\n\nBangladesh\n\nFloods\n\nClimate change\n\nPoverty", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/nz_flood_310769.jpg?VersionId=N7IC0jkGpqRVFh63ITdKzw4RrpXB_y6A", "alt_text": null}]}

Now, VRE is using its technology to target companies adopting remote working, training and conferences. Rather than travelling to a single location or dialing into a call, participants strap on a headset or access an app to be virtually placed in the same room.\n\nVRE's Engage platform allows non-verbal communications via its avatars, which mirror participants' movements, from shaking hands to drawing on a white-board, and body language. It's also trickier to simply tune out by switching off the camera during a video call.\n\n\"There's a reason why people go to classrooms, because you see who's paying attention, you can really interact with people, you can get that eye-contact,\" Chief Executive Officer David Whelan said in an interview earlier this month. Using its technology, \"if one of the students falls asleep, you'll see their avatar will fall asleep, they'll slouch over the desk.\" VR's stock rose 100 per cent in the first six months of the year. Though it has since given up some of those gains, the company's shares are still 60 per cent higher than the pre-Covid 19 outbreak level. Its technology has already been used for medical training at Ireland's Royal College of Surgeons and Oxford University, and for communication between Italian doctors. Opportunities may grow as the coronavirus clouds the future of global travel.\n\n\"The cancellation of major international conferences and events across all industries forced corporates and educators to search for alternative mediums,\" Shane Reilly, an analyst at Dublin-based securities firm Davy, said.\n\nAfter hosting a conference for Taiwanese electronic consumer products company HTC this year, VRE entered a strategic partnership for the distribution and license of the platform, with HTC making an investment of 3 million euros (S$4.89 million) for 20 per cent ownership.\n\nThis month, VRE has signed a memorandum of understanding with Virtual College Limited to provide corporate and health and safety training in the UK and Middle East, and also agreed a multi-year license agreement with Japan-based English education facility Tokyo Global Gateway.\n\n\"Even when coronavirus is eventually done and dusted, the world has really woken-up to how productive people can be from working from home,\" Whelan said. \"The days of jumping on a plane for an hour long meeting, those days are behind us.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nTechnology sector\n\nIreland\n\nInternet\n\nStock market", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/ak-placeholder2.jpg?VersionId=3nocjHwed8gfbcW4BcTXnvsFgPc96WU9", "alt_text": null}]}

Recently I discovered a lump near his hind legs. It looks like a fatty lump. Do I need to take him to a vet to check if it is cancerous?\n\nThe last time I took him to the vet for a routine check-up, he ended up not being able to urinate when he came home. We had to take him to the hospital after that.\n\nJesseca Lim\n\nIt is not possible to tell just from its appearance if a lump is cancerous, which is why it is important to take your cat to the veterinarian to have it checked out. The vet might take a sample by doing a fine needle aspirate or do other diagnostics.\n\nMeanwhile, continue monitoring the size of the lump to see if it grows or if there are changes in its appearance or consistency (hard or soft).\n\nStress could be a factor for your cat's urinary tract issues, which might have developed after a stressful event such as travel, especially if the pet does not usually leave the house.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

This could involve using positive reinforcement, such as treats, to encourage your pet to go into the carrier willingly. Over time, the pet may develop a positive association with the carrier.\n\nAlternatively, there are also veterinarians that provide house-call services. As these consultations are done in a familiar environment at home, it could be less stressful for some animals.\n\nShould my bunny be neutered?\n\nFun fact\n\nDo you know fish feel lonely too? At least, that is the case for tetra fish, a popular freshwater aquarium fish.\n\nTetras are naturally schooling fish. If they are kept alone, they tend to become stressed as it feels unsafe to them.\n\nThat is why tetra fish are usually kept with at least five to seven other tetras in the same tank. While tetras may shoal together, they will bunch up into a tight pack only when they feel threatened.\n\nMy rabbit is a four-year-old Holland lop mixed angora dwarf.\n\nMy friends say that I should have it neutered so that it will have a longer lifespan. Is that true? I did some reading on this and found that, apparently, it is better for my bunny's emotions if it was neutered.\n\nMay I also ask what is the quantity of hay, fresh vegetables or pellets I should provide for my rabbit's nutrition?\n\nFor grooming, I am able to cut its nails and fur. But do I still need to take it to the groomer for ear and gland cleaning?\n\nShynna Neo\n\nThese are great questions. Reasons to sterilise your rabbit include reducing the risk of uterine cancer and other uterine diseases in female rabbits. It can also help reduce problem behaviours such as aggression and urine-spraying in both male and female rabbits.\n\nBunnies should be given a diet of mostly hay - for adults, timothy hay and other grass hay are preferred over alfafa hay, unless otherwise advised by your veterinarian - as it promotes a healthy gastrointestinal system and promotes proper wear of their teeth, which grows continuously throughout their lifetime.\n\nAnother important part of your rabbit's diet is a variety of green leafy vegetables, avoiding those that are toxic to bunnies, such as potatoes and iceberg lettuce.\n\nPellets should comprise only a small portion of the diet and should be given in amounts recommended by your veterinarian based on your rabbit's body condition.\n\nFruit and carrots should be given only as treats in very small amounts. Pellets, fruits and carrots are high in calories and lower in fibre, which can result in obesity and disrupt normal gastrointestinal function if consumed excessively.\n\nIf your rabbit is healthy and actively grooming itself, it should be able to stay relatively clean. You can also help by brushing it regularly and making sure there is no matted fur.\n\nAnswers by Dr Denyse Khor, who cares for domestic pets as well as wildlife.

That was the highest reading since March and dashed analyst expectations for a fall to 50.7. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.\n\nThe PMI echoed upbeat readings from other major Asian export nations, with factory production in South Korea jumping at the fastest rate in more than 11 years, and Japan's output snapping four months of decline.\n\nHowever, analysts caution the recovery could stall amid the resurgence in global infections and as China's factories deal with disruptions from continuing floods.\n\n\"The current rapid pace of recovery is likely to slow in the coming months as the initial boost from re-opening businesses fades,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, of Capital Economics. \"The prop to exports from shipments of goods linked to the pandemic (masks, medical products and work-from-home equipment) is also likely to diminish.\"\n\nReinforcing the downbeat outlook for global demand, industry research released on Friday showed worldwide smartphone sales shrank 14 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter.\n\nThe PMI survey showed new export orders fell, indicating continued pressure on external demand, while companies continued to shed more employees than they hired. However, the pace of declines slowed from the previous month, suggesting a bottoming out in these trends while production and total new orders both hit four-month highs.\n\nSmall companies continue to feel both supply and demand pressure, with a sub-index for them falling further into contraction, said Zhao Qinghe, an official at the National Bureau of Statistics, which publishes the PMI.\n\nLONG ROAD TO RECOVERY\n\nIn the services sector, activity also expanded for the fifth straight month, driven by strong construction as China ramps up infrastructure projects but also suggesting consumer confidence is recovering.\n\nA Reuters poll this month has forecast GDP to expand 2.2 per cent in 2020, up from 1.8 per cent projected in the last poll in April, with recently improving data underpinning the more upbeat outlook.\n\nGauges ranging from trade to producer prices all point to a pick-up in manufacturing, but analysts say factories could have a tough time maintaining momentum as pent-up demand wanes and heavy flooding across large swathes of China disrupts activity.\n\nImports in June rose for the first time since the health crisis hit the economy, as government stimulus stoked demand for commodities, while exports, fuelled by medical goods, also rose in a sign the recovery is gaining traction.\n\nProfits at China's large industrial firms also rose at the fastest pace in over a year that month on easing costs and improving demand.\n\nThe fallout from the global pandemic, however, has left factories operating below strength amid slack demand. June factory gate prices fell in annual terms for the fifth consecutive month.\n\n\"We believe it's still too early for Beijing to roll back the easing and stimulus measures introduced in H1, but it may be reluctant to roll out fresh stimulus measures in H2,\" Nomura analysts wrote on Friday.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nPMI\n\nCoronavirus\n\nEconomic affairs", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/nz_chfactoryy_310773.jpg?VersionId=BvUiOtwDdTzX05_En5.jg7rwho3qbBk3", "alt_text": null}]}

The state recorded eight more deaths linked to the novel coronavirus, including two men in their fifties, also from a record 14 the day before.\n\nThe state, which for months prided itself on a tough approach to social distancing measures, now accounts for more than half of Australia's 198 deaths from the virus and about 60 per cent of the country's 16,900 cases. Most of Victoria's new cases are in Melbourne, Australia's second biggest city.\n\n\"It is clear to all of us that these numbers are still far too high,\" Premier Daniel Andrews told a televised news conference. \"It may well be the case...that we need to take further steps. The data will tell us, the experts will tell us, what and if any next steps need to be.\"\n\nDefence and health officials are door-knocking every positive Covid-19 case in the state but have found one in four people not at home. Those people have been referred to police and may face a A$1,652 (S$1,626) fine, Andrews said.\n\nVictoria is due to end lockdown on Aug 19 and is analysing how the virus is being transmitted in the community, which will guide any new restrictions, he added.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said the spike in coronavirus cases in Melbourne remained a challenge but he was confident a flare-up in larger Sydney was under control.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The first three have been in the post since 2013, while Mr Wolff has been there since 2017.\n\nBut there are eight candidates in all vying to replace Mr Azevedo.\n\nThey will be whittled down to five and then two, in a process based on consensus which is expected to last until mid-November.\n\nWhat should have been a straightforward process has been complicated by US \"politicisation\", a diplomatic source lamented.\n\nThe WTO's General Council began discussing the issue last week, and most expected a quick decision, but were caught by surprise when the United States turned it into a \"political issue\", a Geneva-based trade diplomat told AFP on Thursday.\n\nWhen delegates told General Council chairman David Walker which deputy they wanted to take over temporarily, \"the things that they pointed to were nationality, experience and the duties they carried out\", Mr Rockwell said Friday.\n\n\"It's not a surprise that politics might be part of this process.\"\n\nSpeaking to the membership, Mr Azevedo said it was disappointing that they were unable to decide on an acting director-general, said Mr Rockwell.\n\nSPAT TYPIFIES DEADLOCK\n\nOn Thursday, a Geneva-based trade diplomat said that failure to agree on an interim leader would not spark a \"practical crisis\", because the four deputies would simply carry on handling the areas they are already in charge of.\n\nAnd the General Council could put any outstanding issues that needed urgent attention directly to the membership.\n\nThe problem, the diplomat said, is that \"this is a symptom of conflicts within the membership that are surfacing and impacting even in the most routine and everyday issues. People are exasperated that such a straightforward issue can be politicised in this way.\"\n\nThe United States has said it is willing to accept a compromise in which there would be a month-to-month rotation between Mr Wolff and Mr Brauner until a permanent director-general assumes office.\n\n\"This notion that the US is deadlocking is false,\" a senior US official who asked not to be named told AFP.\n\n\"No one gets this job automatically.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nWorld Trade Organisation\n\nPolitics and government", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/tl-wto-r-310720.jpg?VersionId=I_56UcjTLzrlVn3gjAwMD9z7_rCIXMtG", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

They will have to wait at least another two weeks, he said.\n\nMr Johnson also extended rules making face coverings compulsory in more indoor settings, such as museums and cinemas, and said police will enforce compliance from Aug 8.\n\nWhile the premier insisted he does not want to reimpose a \"full national lockdown\", he said it is vital for the public to obey the rules to avoid more drastic action.\n\n\"Our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control,\" Mr Johnson said in a televised press conference on Friday. \"We cannot be complacent. I won't stand by and allow this virus to cause more pain and more heartache in our country.\"\n\nHis announcement came after ministers rushed to\n\nre-impose restrictions on more than four million people in northern England,\n\nincluding Manchester, barring members of different households from mingling indoors.\n\nThe prime minister said prevalence of the virus in England is at one person per 1,500, up from one in 2,000 at the start of July.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Beyond that level, transmission can begin to take off exponentially.\n\nThe data also showed the number may be at or near one in the rest of England, though in London and other parts of the country, low case numbers and variable transmission \"means these estimates are insufficiently robust to inform policy decisions\", the government said.\n\nEngland's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned that, if the virus is to be kept under control, the country has reached the limit for easing lockdown restrictions in place since March.\n\nAfter being criticised for being slow to go into lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic, Mr Johnson's government is now rushing out new restrictions with little warning.\n\nThe announcement of renewed measures in parts of northern England on Thursday gave residents just three hours' notice of the new rules. It followed\n\nthe re-imposition of quarantine on people coming from Spain last weekend\n\nthat caught hundreds of thousands of tourists by surprise.\n\nThe new measures also highlight the tension between attempts to stamp down on the virus while getting the economy moving again.\n\nFrom Saturday, employers will have more discretion on whether to bring workers back into their offices, a change from guidance that where possible, people should work from home.\n\nAnd the blanket nature of Thursday's fresh restrictions on a large swathe of northern England highlights the risk that the government's test and trace system - designed to reach people who have been in close contact with newly-infected patients - may not yet be effective enough to target small localised outbreaks.\n\nSee more on\n\nBritain\n\nCoronavirus\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/tl-casino-r-310720.jpg?VersionId=oU7j9s9SrCnhNTvsrp9W.z8dz3GwRH6b", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

assisting with police probe after e-bike rider injured in hit-and-run in Hougang\n\nHulkenberg was the centre of attention as he made his first F1 appearance since the end of last season, after Sergio Perez on Thursday\n\nbecame the first Formula One driver since the start of the season to test positive for coronavirus.\n\nBut it was young Briton Lando Norris who topped the early times for McLaren ahead of Red Bull's Verstappen, who soon cut his time to take top spot.\n\nThe session was red-flagged to a halt after 28 minutes when Antonio Giovinazzi spun his Alfa Romeo at Becketts, soon after team-mate Kimi Raikkonen had spun at Luffield.\n\nOnce the debris was cleared, the action resumed, but without Sebastian Vettel, Ferrari announcing that he was grounded by an intercooler problem.\n\nPredictably, the two \"black arrows\" were soon setting the pace with Hamilton ahead of Bottas by six-tenths on the medium tyres until Verstappen responded again on softs to go top.\n\nDespite 30-year-old Mexican Perez's positive test, organisers insisted that Sunday's race will still go ahead as the incident \"will have no wider impact on the event\".\n\n\"Following the announcement that Sergio has tested positive for Covid-19 at the Silverstone Circuit ahead of the British Grand Prix, the team regrets to announce that he will be unable to participate in this weekend's race,\" said Perez's team in a statement.\n\n\"Sergio is physically well and in good spirits, but he will continue to self-isolate under the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety the ultimate priority for the team and the sport,\" added Racing Point.\n\nIt is possible that Britain's quarantine rules mean Perez will miss the fifth round of the championship, also at Silverstone, next weekend.\n\nSee more on\n\nMotor racing\n\nGrand Prix\n\nLewis Hamilton\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url":

Jeremy Tam and Gordon Lam - would likely be banned from the polls, as would any backup candidates.\n\nWhen asked, Associate Professor Sing Ming of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said the disqualification of the pro-democracy candidates comes as the level of support for Beijing and the Hong Kong government is at \"record low\", also mirrored in people's trust towards the \"one country, two systems\" principle.\n\n\"Together with the widespread suspicion and disapproval of the national security law, it is quite natural to conclude that Beijing would like to use the disqualification to preclude the catastrophic result for the pro-Beijing camp,\" Prof Sing said.\n\nThe scope of the disqualification has been wider than anticipated by many observers, he noted, adding that moderates have also been booted out.\n\nIn light of this, Prof Sing said it would be extremely controversial to postpone the election for that long as it would \"create all kinds of legitimacy problems\".\n\nBut Mr Lau Siu Kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said the Legco election \"is no longer just Hong Kong's internal affairs\", but also a national affair that involves national security and questions as to whether external forces have united with the opposition camp to seize power.\n\n\"So that prompts Beijing into doing something to prevent the hostile forces from taking over Legco and to make sure that the national security is safeguarded,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nHong Kong\n\nCarrie Lam\n\nElections", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/hzcarrielam0731.jpg?VersionId=fZNDNcIoPDi256q.hIIoEw08NqgpwHHB", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

This includes working with the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute and the Association of Aerospace Industries (Singapore), or AAIS, to help find new job opportunities for those affected.\n\nThe aviation industry has been severely disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, with global air travel crippled by border closures and airlines scrapping plane orders. Aerospace firms, including component manufacturers and maintenance facilities, are slashing costs and cutting manpower due to declining business.\n\nEarlier this week, aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul firm Eagle Services Asia decided to let go of over 140 workers despite implementing other cost-containment measures earlier, such as a temporary salary reduction and short work week, cancelled merit increases, hiring freezes and discretionary spending cuts. The firm had 829 workers before the retrenchment.\n\nIt was also reported this month that jet engine maker Rolls-Royce would be shedding some 240 jobs in Singapore, or nearly a quarter of its local workforce, as part of a global restructuring. It manufactures fan blades and assembles engines at Seletar Aerospace Park.\n\nMeanwhile, budget carrier Jetstar Asia has let go of 167 staff, a reduced number from the earlier estimate of 180, due to new job placements and some resignations.\n\nMr Sia Kheng Yok, chief executive of AAIS, said aircraft manufacturers and some major aerospace firms had announced global job cuts ranging from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, or between 9,000 and 16,000 jobs. In Singapore, government support has blunted the local impact of these global job cuts, he told The Straits Times.\n\nLast month, Airbus unveiled plans to cut about 15,000 jobs worldwide, saying its future was at stake. As of the end of the first quarter, it had some 830 staff in Singapore in entities spanning the commercial aircraft, helicopter, defence and space businesses. It said: \"Despite the very challenging situation for our industry, we remain committed to our presence in Singapore as our regional hub.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nAirbus\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-airbus-30072022.jpg?VersionId=sNO2DZsblh2j2v9xIXMGVZkpTTwvZnPV", "alt_text": null}]}

You are in good company.\n\nMs Patricia Law, founder of social media agency Goodstuph, bought more than 50 plants during Singapore's two-month shutdown of non-essential services and workplaces.\n\nMs Law, who is in her late 30s, started collecting plants last year when she bought some for her office. She says with a laugh: \"I kind of started progressively, healthily growing my collection. Then I went out of control during the circuit breaker.\"\n\nShe now has 74 plants at home - a 1,000 sq ft walk-up apartment in East Coast.\n\nHer plants are thriving, she says, because she is working from home - she has more control over their watering needs and can also move them around according to the sunlight.\n\n\"It's very therapeutic to care for plants. Sometimes you get a comeback kid - a plant that doesn't do well or looks limpy and you blame yourself as a plant parent but after a while or after watering, it starts thriving - it's very satisfying,\" says Ms Law.\n\nMs Nurul Atirah, a 33-year-old civil servant, similarly developed an indoor plant addiction just last month and has since collected about 80 plants.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The area next to the living room window in her five-room Bukit Panjang flat is now dedicated to her plant collection.\n\n\"I think staying home so much made me want to do something different. It really helps me to destress and pass time quickly,\" she says, adding that her family has been supportive of her hobby so far, with her kids naming her plants and picking favourites.\n\nMs Nurul, who has arranged her plants on white and brown shelves, stools and step-ladders, says the pop of green has made her home a nicer place.\n\nShe says: \"Previously there were only two artificial plants in that spot. I've given them away, they looked a bit sad. Now these plants are all live and I get to see them grow and there's a variety so it contributes to the aesthetics of the home.\"\n\nFor Ms Cheryl Ann Lee, 35, plants have been a big part of her life for the last five years. She has a plant collection with more than 120 plants in her four-room Toa Payoh flat.\n\nMs Lee, who runs a branding agency with her husband and also started a botany side-business The Botanist & Her Thieves with three friends, bought her current home because it came with a spacious balcony where most of her plants are now placed.\n\nPlant parenting has been especially helpful during the circuit breaker as more people spend time at home beavering in front of their computers.\n\n\"Tending to my plants gives me a mental break while working and these snatches of time away from the computer screen are a brief digital detox,\" she says.\n\nLike Ms Lee, those interviewed say parenting plants satisfies their craving to nurture and calms their minds. This could explain why there has been a big spike in demand for houseplants during the circuit breaker period.\n\nClinical psychologist Dr Carol Balhetchet says turning to nature in a time of isolation at home is an understandable reaction.\n\n\"Because of Covid-19, we were all locked in this sterile environment of our homes, but we need connection to nature. More plants give you the feeling that you are still connected to nature. It is an extension of your own space into the outside world.\"\n\nShe adds that on another level, picking up new interests - be it plants, crafting, baking or learning a new language - is a natural way to adapt to the circuit breaker measures.\n\n\"When you are isolated, it is important for your mental and emotional stability that you are still active.\"\n\nTerrascapes, a nursery specialising in exotic plants, saw a 10 per cent increase in sales. It sold about 1,000 plants in the circuit breaker period from April to June after it started retailing its plants online.\n\nTerrascapes founder Sandy Soh says the trend is in part fuelled by social media - with clients often posting on their accounts to share how their plant babies are doing.\n\nInteriors brimming with plants - termed \"jungalows\", a word play on jungle and bungalows - are also popular online.\n\nSG Plant Club, an Instagram page that started posting only on June 4 pictures of various plant collections by local residents, has already attracted close to 1,000 followers.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Leo Tay, founder of nursery The 3 Keys, observed an increase in sales of 20 to 25 per cent during the same period. The number of followers of his Instagram account, which focuses on the plants he retails, also doubled.\n\nPopular plant boutique Tumbleweed Plants saw a surge in demand for its products too.\n\nLocal wellness company Super Farmers' founder Cynthea Lam says sales of her urban farming kits - three separate pots of plants growing kang kong, chye sim and kailan - doubled during the circuit breaker period.\n\nThe vegetables are ready to harvest in 14 days - similar to the length of one stay-home notice period - making them popular purchases.\n\nHer farming kits can be grown indoors, even a hotel room.\n\nShe says: \"The kits are designed for small urban spaces like homes or offices, They can grow pretty much anywhere, on a dining table, on a ledge. They don't need too much fuss or sunlight.\"\n\nSimilarly, ornamental plants that are easy to take care of have been the most popular products during the pandemic. A Tumbleweed Plants' spokesman said that the monstera deliciosa - a houseplant known for its large leaves with natural holes and the snake plant - known for its tall leaves - have been in hot demand locally due to their distinctive aesthetic traits.\n\nThese are also tropical plants that tend to do well in Singapore's climate.\n\nThe 3 Keys' Mr Tay says other plant species like the stephania, the everfresh tree and philodendrons have sold well too as they are comparatively easy to care for. Mini-bonsais have also been a hit, although they require more daily maintenance and care, due to its aesthetic appeal.\n\nHe explains: \"When styling plants, a general rule is to pick either the pot or the plant - which one do you want to see? Some plants have very dramatic foliage so if you want the leaves to be the main attraction, pick a simple, solid-coloured pot and vice versa.\"\n\nMr Charles Loh, a graphic designer with a side business named Mossingarden creating botanical terrariums and selling plants, is also an avid plant collector. He says plants are some of the most affordable decorations for the home.\n\n\"Start small, don't buy something expensive or designer straight away. Find an underutilised spot in your home - maybe your shelves or window - they can brighten up a lot with plants.\"\n\nWhile aesthetics may be important to budding plant parents who want to beautify their homes, Mr Soh says that ultimately a plant is a living thing to take care of.\n\n\"Don't just get a plant that you like. Get a plant that you can grow - something you have the right growing conditions for.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nPlants\n\nDesign\n\nHome & Garden\n\nCovid-19 Special\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/tl-patlaw-o-3107280.jpg?VersionId=5ZrwfAG4.VKnAdgfDo8lssIPeGFAaj5R", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

Ms Negin on Thursday called the US accusation that the consulate would help her flee \"baseless\", given that Chinese officials didn't seize the chance to get Tang out of the country when they first learnt there was a warrant for her arrest, and didn't keep her at the consulate, knowing she'd be apprehended when she left.\n\nProsecutors said Tang's false denials when FBI agents interviewed her at her apartment in Davis about her military affiliation and her membership in the Communist Party mirror the efforts of three other Chinese researchers in California and Indiana to cover up their pasts before they were recently charged.\n\nTang sought shelter at the consulate in San Francisco after the agents interviewed her, according to Ms Negin's filing. Tang was in \"hysterics\" after learning of the warrant for her arrest, leading consulate officials to believe she needed to see a doctor, Ms Negin wrote.\n\nMs Negin said she thinks American law enforcement officials were watching the building and followed Tang's car to a medical office were she was treated.\n\nMs Negin said in an e-mail that the details about Tang's arrest came from a prosecutor who wasn't personally involved in her detention. The request for Tang's release said her husband is a doctor living with their daughter in China. Her filing says pieces of prosecutors' evidence are \"weak and lend themselves to many innocent explanations\", including photographs of Tang in military uniform.\n\n\"Ms Tang apparently attended a prestigious medical school that is run by the military in China,\" according to the filing. \"That does not mean that she was 'in the military.'\"\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in Beijing on Friday that the government was \"closely following the development of this case and we will, as always, provide consular assistance to the people involved.\"\n\nEarlier this week the ministry called for Tang's release.\n\n\"China has launched solemn representations with the US side urging the US side to immediately release the Chinese national and ensure her legitimate and legal rights,\" Mr Wang told reporters on Tuesday in Beijing.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS-China ties\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/tl-jt-ea-310720.jpg?VersionId=5n4XqOVth8gOe0K5Oof04GSbMklAdRFA", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

Both of us felt strongly that a percentage of the salary should be used for a greater purpose.\"\n\nHis Facebook post received more than 4,000 comments, mostly from netizens who expressed their respect for him.\n\nBut some people questioned his motives for making the plan public.\n\nFor instance, former Nominated MP Calvin Cheng called it \"political theatre\", and his post on Facebook sparked discussion on how much Mr Singh would be giving away.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's wife Ho Ching, who shared several of Mr Cheng's posts on the issue, also put up a post on Facebook about the donating of money, saying: \"There are lots of folks who donated and continue to donate quietly, without making any public announcement.\n\n\"Some folks make public announcement of part of their donations, and still maintain privacy on the rest of their regular donations.\"\n\nShe did not refer to Mr Singh or cite specific examples in her post.\n\nLast night, Progress Singapore Party chief Tan Cheng Bock, in a Facebook post, supported Mr Singh's decision, saying it is a \"wonderful and generous gesture and sets a good example for Singaporeans to emulate\".\n\nHe added: \"It is sad and unbecoming, that some people have chosen instead, to cast aspersions on his intentions... It is far better to be gracious and welcome the gesture than to continue to try to score political points. This is very disappointing.\"\n\nPolitical analyst Loke Hoe Yeong - the author of a recent book on the history of the opposition in Singapore called The First Wave - also waded into the discussion.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he said he was \"baffled at the hue and cry from some quarters\" about Mr Singh's decision. Dr Loke said that in 1985, then Minister of State Wong Kan Seng said he would donate half his ministerial salary and MP allowance, and he challenged opposition leaders J.B. Jeyaretnam and Chiam See Tong to do the same with their MP allowance and salary from their legal practice.\n\nMr Wong was responding to a call from Mr Jeyaretnam to cut ministerial salaries by 25 per cent amid a recession that year, Dr Loke added.\n\nOver the years, more than a few MPs and ministers have given away substantial amounts of their allowances and pay.\n\nPM Lee, for instance, donated increases in his salary for several years from 2007, saying he wanted to signal to Singaporeans that his \"primary considerations are for the future of this nation, and not for my own salary\". He has also donated money to fund a raft of awards, such as the Prime Minister's Social Service Award, to encourage more Singaporeans to choose careers in social service.\n\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong has used his entire MP allowance since being elected in 2011 to fund grassroots dinners and charitable donations, among other things.\n\nOthers, such as MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling, spend most of their MP allowance on donations and grassroots activities, and setting up social projects in their constituencies.\n\nSee more on\n\nPritam Singh\n\nLeader of the Opposition", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/st_20200731_ycpritam31_5855002.jpg?VersionId=cTztpQvzHye_dBgbJg3heUycliUJT9zE", "alt_text": "Workers' Party chief and Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh speaking to the media on July 11, a day after the general election, where his party won 10 seats in three constituencies.

Contact details for Dong were not available.\n\nChina has consistently denied any role in hacking and its foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing, Mr Wang Wenbin, rejected as \"baseless\" the accusation that hackers linked to the government had targeted Moderna.\n\nChina leads the world in the development of a coronavirus vaccine and it is more worried that other countries using hackers to steal its technology, he said.\n\n\"We absolutely do not nor need to engage in theft to achieve this leading position,\" Mr Wang said.\n\nThe two other unidentified medical research companies mentioned in the Justice Department indictment are described as biotech companies based in California and Maryland. Prosecutors said the hackers \"searched for vulnerabilities\" and \"conducted reconnaissance\" against them.\n\nThe court filing describes the California firm as working on antiviral drug research and suggested the Maryland company had publicly announced efforts to develop a vaccine in January. Two companies that could match those descriptions: Gilead Sciences Inc and Novavax Inc.\n\nGilead spokesman Chris Ridley said the firm does not comment on cybersecurity matters. Novavax would not comment on specific cyber security activities but said: \"Our cyber security team has been alerted to the alleged foreign threats identified in the news.\"\n\nA security consultant familiar with multiple hacking investigations involving premier biotech firms over the last year said Chinese groups believed to be broadly associated with China's Ministry of State security are one of the primary forces targeting Covid-19 research, globally. This matches the description of the indicted hackers, as ministry contractors.\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nHacking\n\nVaccines\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/tl-moderna-r-3107280.jpg?VersionId=KxXqzt_bjS_oc4Wxx.CaJbMfcqfUaLWG", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

A mysterious, swoon-worthy American-Chinese man sending expensive gifts from abroad. And the promise of undying love after a whirlwind proposal from an eligible Malaysian bachelor.\n\nThey sound like cliches from soap operas, but online scammers have been relying on these carefully crafted profiles to trick gullible women into parting with cash and kind.\n\nWhat these cases also have in common is that they were all cracked by the Singapore Police Force's Anti-Scam Centre (ASC) - which has handled more than 8,600 scam reports in the one year since its establishment.\n\nThe ASC has also frozen more than 6,100 bank accounts and recovered more than $21.2 million that scammers, based both locally and internationally, might have otherwise made off with.\n\nThe amount recovered is equivalent to around 40 per cent of some $52 million in funds that scammers pilfered in the cases the ASC has handled since it started operating on June 18 last year. The remaining 60 per cent of funds has not been recovered.\n\n\"Moving forward, the ASC will continue to strengthen our detection capabilities, as well as enhance our collaboration with more stakeholders and foreign law enforcement agencies, to disrupt scammers' operations and mitigate victims' losses,\" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Aileen Yap, who is assistant director of the specialised commercial crime division at the Commercial Affairs Department.\n\nSome methods that the ASC has used to stop scammers in their tracks include a network of 11 banks that assist in promptly freezing accounts and retrieving bank account holders' particulars whenever unusual transactions are detected.\n\nThis network, which includes financial institutions like DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank (UOB), helped the centre nab a 39-year-old man involved in a massive e-commerce scam in mid-March. A French pharmaceutical firm was deceived into transferring around \u20ac6.64 million (S$10.76 million) to a Singapore bank account to pay for a shipment of surgical masks and sanitisers.\n\nThe ASC managed to retrieve more than $6.4 million, its biggest recovery so far. Around $5.3 million was recovered by UOB, which traced and froze the scammer's account within minutes.\n\nMr Richard Soh, head of investigation at UOB's integrated fraud management department, said scammers now pose a bigger threat as they have developed sophisticated methods to conduct scams and cover their tracks.\n\n8,600\n\nNumber of scam reports that the Singapore Police Force's Anti-Scam Centre (ASC) has handled in the one year since its establishment.\n\n6,100\n\nNumber of bank accounts the ASC has frozen.\n\n\"One syndicate might have multiple accounts and various money outflows, making them harder to detect,\" he said.\n\nAs for love scams, the ASC has also managed to foil some within a day of the cases coming to its attention: an example being a case last month involving three women.\n\nTwo of the women - Ms Tan, 58, and Ms Lim, 50 - were attempting to transfer $3,500 and $2,300 respectively, to help their online lovers pay off \"Customs charges\" for gifts supposedly sent to them.\n\nMs Tan thought that she was receiving a present from abroad from an American-born Chinese online lover, but it was really a scammer using pictures of a Korean man stolen off a public Instagram profile.\n\nA 38-year-old woman known as Ms Koh was also duped into being a money mule for the same syndicate. Convinced she was helping her \"Korean doctor boyfriend\", she accepted and remitted around $5,300 deposited into her account from unknown sources.\n\nThe ASC managed to recover the $2,300 transferred by Ms Lim, and talked the other women out of giving the scammers more cash.\n\nFormer victims say it is best to cut off all contact once scammers ask for money.\n\nCommunications executive Esther Teoh, 27, was approached by a \"Korean\" man on Tinder, who after four months of chatting asked her to transfer $2,000 to a bank account in Britain.\n\nShe did not do so and promptly blocked the man.\n\n\"Once he asked me for money, I saw a serious red flag. I encourage everyone to look out for warning signs, and not be blinkered by false affection,\" Ms Teoh said.\n\nSee more on\n\nPolice\n\nScams", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/af_antiscam_300720_0.jpg?VersionId=eXZubK8OdfHN2kUauGHkZIlOwvg6qTly", "alt_text": null}]}

Japan's economic activity has gradually resumed in recent months after the government lifted a state of emergency at the end of May.\n\n\"This comes as a relief,\" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.\n\nBut she added that the rebound was extremely small compared to the steep drops in April and May when activity was hit hard by lockdown measures.\n\n\"Production activity tends to move in line with corporate earnings.

Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast a higher jobless rate of 3.1 per cent.\n\nThe labour market remained in a \"severe state\" and warranted close monitoring, a government official said, as the decline in the jobless rate was mainly due to a fall in the number of new job-seekers.\n\nThe data showed the number of workers in June fell by 770,000 from a year earlier, the official said, while the number of unemployed rose by 330,000 from a year earlier for a fifth straight month of increases.\n\nThe jobs-to-applicants ratio dropped to 1.11 in June from 1.20 in May, marking lowest reading since October 2014, labour ministry data showed. It means fewer than six jobs were available per five job-seekers.\n\nAnalysts expect Japan's economy to have contracted by more than 20 per cent on an annualised basis in the second quarter as lockdown measures around the world hit business and consumer demand.\n\nPreliminary April-June GDP data will be released on Aug 17, two weeks after the government announces a revision of first-quarter GDP data on Monday to take into account a large downgrade of business spending for the quarter.\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nEconomic affairs\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nEmployment\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service\u200b\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nWin 2x tickets to New Zealand.

Sometimes we forget the economic impact on families associated with this demographic.\"\n\nBesides ordering food from the various eateries under The Social Kitchen, customers may also dine in at the flagship central kitchen.\n\nProject Makan 2.0 - a collaboration involving The Social Kitchen, YMCA, and Shine Children and Youth Services - will be launched on National Day to serve 15,000 meals to disadvantaged families.\n\n\"I'm excited about these projects and am glad to encourage these efforts to make sure children and families have enough to eat, and help businesses make it through this pandemic,\" said Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, who was at yesterday's launch of The Social Kitchen.\n\nSee more on\n\nSocial enterprises\n\nFood and beverage sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/st_20200731_mykitchen31ow5d_5854949.jpg?VersionId=ik0Wm23VYTQSDJLsOkR0pUlHgamMjqUT", "alt_text": "Clockwise from top right: Singapore's first social enterprise cloud kitchen, The Social Kitchen, is co-founded by Mr Alvin Yapp and Mr Ang Kian Peng (on left); a staff member from The Social Kitchen receiving training from an employee of Ming Fa Food"}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/st_20200731_mykitchen315pst_5854948_copy.jpg?VersionId=CoyAZwaWYoWuNuaeq8g_lBni8ACJW2NT", "alt_text": "Clockwise from top right: Singapore's first social enterprise cloud kitchen, The Social Kitchen, is co-founded by Mr Alvin Yapp and Mr Ang Kian Peng (on left); a staff member from The Social Kitchen receiving training from an employee of Ming Fa Food"}]}

As someone in the construction industry, I understand our ID's perspective and I don't want to pressure him on that front,\" said Mr Hadi, who is expecting a second child in September with his homemaker wife, 40.\n\nRenovations for their four-room Build-To-Order (BTO) flat in Sengkang were expected to be completed by the end of May, but this has been pushed back to end-August.\n\nLike Mr Hadi, more home owners will likely have to pay more for renovation works, as the renovation industry, which is heavily reliant on Malaysian workers, continues to struggle with labour shortage.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The remaining 30 per cent are Malaysians.\n\nAll of his eight ongoing projects have been affected, with costs going up \"a bit here and there\".\n\n\"I tell my clients, if they don't want to pay extra and are okay to wait a little longer, I'll use my Malaysian workers to complete their homes when they are allowed to come into Singapore. But if they want it completed fast, I will have to hire more local workers so costs will naturally go up a little,\" he said.\n\nBigger companies that have their own in-house subcontractors have it slightly easier, as they are able to prioritise available workers for their own projects, instead of relying on external contractors.\n\nMr Alloyious Koh, 29, chief creative consultant of Carpenters Design Group, said his company is able to manage some of the bigger renovation works such as carpentry, hacking and painting with its current workforce.\n\nWorkers who are still in Malaysia make up around 40 per cent of his headcount. They are mainly in charge of works such as tiling and false ceiling installations.\n\nMr Koh said he takes a case-by-case approach when managing manpower for his 80 to 100 ongoing projects.\n\n\"For clients who don't have an alternative place to live in or are paying money for rental flats to stay in the interim, we'll try to prioritise their projects if we have the manpower to do so.

In another tweet, he insisted his statement about Sabah was \"historically factual\". He said: \"No country can tell another country what it can and cannot say about what the latter regards as rightfully his own.\"\n\nMr Locsin added, alluding to an international ruling that recognised the Philippines' claims to parts of the South China Sea: \"I don't insist China say only what we want to hear about the arbitral award. It is free to say what it wants, while we say and do what needs doing. That holds for Sabah.\"\n\nHe disclosed that as a response, he would summon Malaysia's ambassador to Manila, Mr Norman Muhammad, to explain Mr Hishammudin's reaction to his tweet.\n\nUpon his election in 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte said he would press the Philippines' contentious claim to Sabah.\n\nThe dispute goes back to 1878, when the Sultanate of Sulu signed a contract, known as a pajak, that allowed the British North Borneo Company administration to occupy Sabah in perpetuity as long as it paid a regular sum of money.\n\nSulu is a group of islands in southern Philippines.\n\nThe Sultan of Brunei gave Sabah to the Sultan of Sulu in 1658, either as a dowry or because troops from Sulu helped him quell a rebellion.\n\nThe British colonial government succeeded the British North Borneo Company. In 1946, Sabah became a Crown Colony. In 1963, it was folded with Malaya, Sarawak and Singapore into the Federation of Malaysia.\n\nWhile the British and Malaysia interpreted pajak to mean sale, the Sulu Sultanate has always maintained it means lease.\n\nEven today, Malaysia pays about RM5,000 (S$1,620) a year to the Sultan's heirs.\n\nSuccessive Philippine presidents have pressed the Sulu Sultanate's case.\n\nSee more on\n\nPhilippines\n\nTerritorial disputes\n\nMalaysia\n\nPoliticians", "images": []}

He was 97.\n\nPresident Tsai Ing-wen, who visited Mr Lee in hospital on Wednesday, described his contribution to Taiwan as \"irreplaceable\" in her condolences to his family.\n\n\"President Tsai believes that former president Lee's contribution to Taiwan's democratisation is irreplaceable, and his passing is (Taiwan's) biggest loss,\" said Secretary-General to the President Su Jia-chyuan, who relayed her message of condolence shortly after Mr Lee's death.\n\nTwo days before his passing, rumours of the former president's death circulated on social media, leading many journalists to camp outside the Taipei Veterans General Hospital, where Mr Lee had been hospitalised.\n\nHe had been in hospice care since early February, after choking on milk at home. He was later diagnosed with pneumonia, and was intubated over the past five months.\n\nDr Hwang Shinn-Jang, one of Mr Lee's physicians, said that the former president suffered from repeated infections during his 174 days in the hospital, but that \"he fought like a warrior for his life\".\n\nHailed locally as the \"Father of Taiwan\" or \"Uncle Ahui\" by his supporters, Mr Lee served as president for 21/2 terms, from 1988 to 2000.\n\nIn 1988, as vice-president, Mr Lee stepped in to fill the seat vacated by the Kuomintang's Chiang Ching-kuo, who died.\n\nHe was reelected president by the National Assembly in 1990.\n\nIn 1996, Mr Lee went on to become the first president to be elected through a democratic vote.\n\nUnlike the majority of the members of the Kuomintang party that followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan after losing the Chinese Civil War, Mr Lee was Taiwanese-born and raised during the Japanese colonial rule.\n\nAfter pursuing his education in Taiwan, Japan and the United States, Mr Lee returned to Taiwan and was taken under Mr Chiang Ching-kuo's wing, becoming the first Taiwanese-born politician in the Chiang family's inner circle.\n\nDuring his 12 years in office, Mr Lee peacefully moved Taiwan towards a free democracy, ending the state of emergency the Kuomintang had imposed in case of conflict with China, amended the Constitution to allow for the direct election of the president and vice-president and had all legislative seats re-elected, to replace the unelected Parliament under the Chiang family.\n\nAnother milestone in Mr Lee's tenure was his Go South initiative, the plan to branch out in Asia and establish trade ties with South-east Asian countries.\n\nBut the initial success of Taiwanese investors fizzled after a series of incidents, such as the 1997 financial crisis, the 1998 anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia and incentives by China that attracted foreign investments, including from Taiwanese businesses who moved their factories to China.\n\nPresident Tsai now has a New Southbound Policy, encouraging the same Taiwanese businesses to put their eggs in various baskets, relying less on China and moving their operations to other countries in South-east Asia.\n\nMr Lee is survived by Madam Tseng Wen-hui, his wife of 71 years, two daughters and their families. His son Lee Hsien-wen died of cancer in 1982.\n\nSee more on\n\nTaiwan\n\nObituary", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/ST_20200731_LEE31AM44E_5855552.jpg?VersionId=A3jIpH90VK_egtpMC4bJn7w8sA6xiA3V", "alt_text": "Taiwan's first democratically elected president Lee Teng-hui, seen in this 2015 file photo, ended the state of emergency the Kuomintang had imposed in case of conflict with China during his term in office."}]}

The back-to-back actions were seen as a sweeping gesture showing how much the national security law enacted last month had strengthened Beijing's hand.\n\nCritics said the disqualification sought to curb the ascendancy of a young, more defiant generation of pro-democracy activists after an overwhelming win in last year's lower-level district council elections.\n\n\"Clearly, #Beijing shows a total disregard for the will of the #Hongkongers, tramples upon the city's last pillar of vanishing autonomy and attempts to keep #HK's legislature under its firm grip,\" Mr Wong tweeted.\n\nChances for a historic majority in the Legislative Council, or mini-Parliament, for the opposition camp will take a further blow if the government decides to postpone the Sept 6 vote, as expected, amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHong Kong has disqualified candidates before, but not on this scale.\n\nThe disqualification of Civic Party candidates signals that Beijing is becoming less tolerant of even moderate democrats, who have for decades been a vocal opposition in the legislature.\n\n\"The government is constructing a CCP (Chinese Communist Party) assembly in Legco to eliminate most of the opposition voices. Outrageous,\" tweeted Mr Nathan Law, a pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker who was kicked out of the legislature. He fled Hong Kong for Britain earlier this month.\n\nThe Civic Party said its existence is not confined to the legislature, often referred to as the Legco, and it will continue to work for its values.\n\n\"When the regime wishes to enslave us, the best thing to do is to stand firm and tell the regime we would not change,\" said party member Kwok Ka-ki, who was among those disqualified.\n\nThe Hong Kong government said advocating self-determination, soliciting intervention by foreign governments, or \"expressing an objection in principle\" to the enactment of the new security law was behaviour that \"could not genuinely\" uphold the city's mini-Constitution, the Basic Law.\n\nCandidates are required by law to pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and the Basic Law.\n\nThe government said there was \"no question of any political censorship, restriction of the freedom of speech or deprivation of the right to stand for elections as alleged by some members of the community\".\n\nBeijing's top representative office in the city, the Hong Kong Liaison Office, said it supported the disqualifications as the candidates aimed to \"paralyse the government\" and \"subvert state power\".\n\nBeijing introduced the security legislation to punish what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces in the former British colony.\n\nCritics of the law say it erodes basic rights and freedoms, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of often-violent anti-government and anti-China unrest.\n\nBeijing says it was vital to plug national security loopholes left open by Hong Kong's inability to pass such legislation on its own, as required by the Basic Law.\n\nHong Kong's last British governor Chris Patten called the disqualifications an \"outrageous political purge\".\n\nLate on Wednesday night, Hong Kong police said they arrested four people aged 16 to 21 for suspected offences under the new security law, the first such detentions outside of street protests.\n\nThe three men and a woman, all students, were suspected of being involved in an online group that pledged to use every means to fight for an independent Hong Kong.\n\nStudent Localism, a group that used to advocate independence, said its former leader Tony Chung, 19, was among those arrested.

Many of them were individuals who had been isolated since new community transmissions were first detected over the weekend.\n\nThe patient who died was a 70-year-old man who appeared to have contracted the virus in Danang, according to the official Vietnam News Agency.\n\nBefore this outbreak, Vietnam had not recorded any local transmission for close to 100 days and appeared to have emerged from the pandemic ahead of its South-east Asia peers through a system of mass quarantine and testing.\n\nWith its borders closed to almost all foreigners since March, locals had lowered their guard about wearing masks and social distancing in public. Many also redoubled their holidays around the country on discounted airfares and hotel rates offered by businesses trying to restart the pandemic-battered tourism industry.\n\nDanang is now in the middle of a 15-day lockdown, with even takeaway food and drink services suspended. The authorities are also converting a stadium into a field hospital. Apart from this, all construction work in Danang has been halted with effect from yesterday, according to local media reports.\n\nDanang resident Huynh Viet said the atmosphere in Danang was calm.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Public gatherings of more than 30 people are banned, mirroring similar restrictions placed in the capital Hanoi earlier this week.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, Vietnam has recorded 546 infections.\n\nPolice have ramped up efforts to ferret out foreigners and locals who have evaded the mandatory quarantine by entering Vietnam illegally. The country shares a porous border of over 4,500km with Laos, China and Cambodia.\n\n\"It's extremely difficult to stop people coming in. And it's very difficult for a country to isolate itself from a pandemic that is affecting the rest of the world,\" said Prof Thwaites. \"This was almost inevitable.\"\n\nDespite the latest setback, Vietnam's economy is poised to grow at around 2.8 per cent for the year if the global situation improves, said the World Bank on Thursday. A less favourable external environment will still see it eke out a 1. 5 per cent growth.\n\nSee more on\n\nVietnam\n\nCoronavirus\n\nTourism", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/bthanoi20200731.jpg?VersionId=BThNbueUBm_qKjGN2cAkyzaP2iQ0hmfS", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

Umno president Zahid Hamidi said yesterday that the party has decided \"not to join PN, but instead empower Muafakat Nasional (MN) with PAS and Barisan Nasional (BN) components\".\n\nBN is the long-ruling multiracial coalition led by Umno that was shockingly ousted in the 2018 general election.\n\nZahid, himself facing a raft of corruption charges, said \"our support to PN governments is only via the BN lawmakers in the federal government and several state governments\".\n\nHe also revealed that Tan Sri Muhyiddin had said his Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia intends to join MN during a meeting with BN parliamentarians on Wednesday.\n\nAlthough Bersatu's entry into MN must be discussed with PAS, it signalled a concession from Mr Muhyiddin after Tuesday's High Court guilty verdicts against Najib angered a large segment of Umno supporters.\n\n\"The reality after the Najib verdict backlash is that Muhyiddin needs the backing of Umno and PAS,\" an Umno leader told The Straits Times.\n\nBut PN sources disclosed that the Prime Minister has not abandoned efforts to formalise PN ahead of polls, expected as soon as the end of the year, despite a ballot not being due until late 2023.\n\n\"The plan is to go ahead regardless of Umno. Wait for the announcement on PN. Registration is done,\" a top official said, adding that PAS has been amenable to being a registered member of PN.\n\nSeat negotiations are hotting up ahead of expected snap elections aimed at ending political instability stemming from Mr Muhyiddin's narrow parliamentary majority of 113 out of 222 MPs, the slimmest any Malaysian government has had.\n\nUmno, Bersatu and PAS representatives met last week to begin duking out overlapping claims in at least a quarter of constituencies dominated by the Malay majority.\n\nIn Bersatu's view, joining MN would provide a clear platform for these negotiations while still pursuing PN as the flagship coalition to seek a new term for its president, Mr Muhyiddin.\n\nDespite its firm stance against becoming a member of PN, Umno leaders have become more amenable towards an extended reign for Mr Muhyiddin, so long as the party's interests are protected.\n\nUmno deputy president Mohamad Hasan said last week the party could review the 2016 decision to sack Mr Muhyiddin - a staunch critic of 1MDB while in government - when Najib was president.\n\n\"He (Muhyiddin) will be a Prime Minister backed by the largest party with the most MPs... There will be no problems facing a general election, for example in the aspect of seat allocations,\" he said.\n\nUmno's advisory council chief, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, who is also the party's longest-serving MP, said that \"handicapped leaders\" such as Najib and Zahid, who are facing graft charges, should make way and sacrifice \"just for awhile, one term is only five years\".\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nUmno\n\nPerikatan Nasional\n\nMuhyiddin Yassin", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-zahidh-30072022.jpg?VersionId=7Zy3T9Vm3xkkkdybyDcmnn12_xmjswIG", "alt_text": null}]}

Low also bought a spare battery for it on Dec 25 last year.\n\nAnother man who delivered the item then carried out some works to attach a cable to the PAB's internal circuitry so that the spare battery could be used with the vehicle.\n\nLow tried to use the spare battery the next day but noticed that there was no connection. He removed it and continued using the original internal battery, the court heard.\n\nLow later noticed that the spare battery appeared bloated and immediately placed it outside his flat at Tah Ching Road in Taman Jurong.\n\n\"Shortly after, the battery started emitting sparks and a fire ensured. The police and SCDF were activated to the accused's home,\" said Mr Ng.\n\nThe LTA prosecutor also told the court on Thursday that there had been 17 reported cases of PAB-related fires in the first half of this year alone.

I think it's time for us to return the mandate to Sabahans,\" Datuk Seri Shafie told reporters yesterday.\n\nFormer Sabah chief minister Musa Aman on Wednesday met the press with 31 other state lawmakers, and indicated he was ready to form a new government to replace the one led by Mr Shafie's Parti Warisan Sabah.\n\nAnother assemblyman defected yesterday, meaning Tan Sri Musa has the minimum 33 seats to form the majority in the 65-seat assembly.\n\nWarisan is backed by the Pakatan Harapan (PH) opposition bloc, with Mr Shafie a staunch ally of former premier Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nThe election has to take place within 60 days of the dissolution. Mr Shafie will remain the caretaker chief of the East Malaysian state until the polls take place.\n\nOnly state assemblymen will be elected during the state election, with the 25 Sabah federal MPs retaining their wards.\n\nThe Sabah legislature has 60 elected lawmakers and five who are appointed by the reigning state government. Until Mr Musa's news conference on Wednesday, Mr Shafie's coalition controlled 45 of the 65 seats, or more than two-thirds.\n\nThe state polls will represent the first major political battle between the five-month-old Perikatan Nasional (PN) government and the PH-led opposition bloc.\n\nThe election in Sabah goes beyond the fight between two arch rivals - Mr Shafie, 63, and Mr Musa, 69.\n\nA victory for PN could help Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin entice several Sabah MPs to his alliance, thus securing a more comfortable majority in Parliament, where he holds only a two-seat majority.\n\nThe election will also be a litmus test for the federal opposition bloc, which remains split over its choice of a prime ministerial candidate.\n\nThe three-party PH is led by Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. The rest of the opposition MPs are lumped together under the so-called PH Plus alliance, consisting of MPs from Tun Dr Mahathir's group and those from Warisan led by Mr Shafie.\n\nThe cooperation and performance of the blocs led by Mr Anwar and Dr Mahathir in Sabah will be a crucial precursor for their working relationship at the federal level, with a national snap general election expected within the next few months.\n\nThe PN alliance led by Tan Sri Muhyiddin is now in control of nine out of the 13 Malaysian states, after successfully toppling PH-led state legislatures in Perak, Johor, Melaka and Kedah. Sabah is the first state to opt for a dissolution of the assembly, rather than allow itself to fall to PN by way of defections.\n\nWith Sabah's dissolution, PH and its partners are now left with just three state administrations in Selangor, Penang and Negeri Sembilan.\n\nIn the 2018 state assembly election, Mr Shafie's Warisan, along with PH parties, won 29 out of the 60 seats contested in the state assembly. Barisan Nasional (BN), led by Mr Musa, also won 29 seats, leading to a hung assembly.\n\nBut Mr Shafie managed to secure crossovers from several BN parties to form the state government.\n\nSabah is home to 3.4 million people, just over 10 per cent of Malaysia's population. Its economic output is the fifth-largest among Malaysia's 13 states, but it is one of the country's poorest states by gross domestic product per capita.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nElections\n\nPerikatan Nasional\n\nPakatan Harapan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/ST_20200731_SABAH31A_5854741.jpg?VersionId=4db2yBh5R_4lRXTli16Y96Wjvb7ZeEvV", "alt_text": "Sabah Chief Minister Shafie Apdal holding up the letter of dissolution of the state legislative assembly yesterday.

But I think we've got to be careful not to slip into some idea that there's some golden immunity that Australia has in relation to this virus.\"\n\nFurther restrictions on movement would damage the economy, which is already in its first recession in 30 years, but failure to control the latest outbreaks would do more economic harm in the long run, Mr Morrison added.\n\nVictoria Premier Daniel Andrews said everyone in the state of more than six million people must wear a mask when outside from Sunday, widening a requirement already in place in Melbourne. He also extended social distancing restrictions, with residents in communities south-west of Melbourne no longer allowed to have visitors to their homes from late yesterday.\n\nCafes, pubs and restaurants would be allowed to stay open, however, because these were controlled environments where social distancing rules could be enforced.\n\n\"Having friends over to your house is not a controlled environment,\" Mr Andrews said.\n\nThe previous record daily count of new infections in Australia was 518 reported on Monday. The country has confirmed over 16,200 cases since the pandemic began.\n\nMr Andrews said that while the latest spike in cases was worrying, the majority of them were in known hot spots such as aged-care homes and the number of untraceable infections was \"much smaller\".\n\nAustralia's most populous state, New South Wales, reported 18 new cases, with six from unknown sources.\n\nThe north-eastern state of Queensland, which had effectively eliminated the virus, said it had found three new cases, two of whom were believed to have contracted Covid-19 while in the New South Wales capital of Sydney. Queensland closed its borders to people from Sydney on Wednesday.\n\nPolice said two 19-year-old women who brought the virus into the state after returning from a trip to Victoria had falsified travel documents and lied to the authorities about their movements. Both now face criminal charges but one of them still refuses to tell officials where she had been. Queensland has also denied entry to anyone who had been to Victoria in the previous 14 days.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nAustralia\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/st_20200731_fdoz_58551142.jpg?VersionId=LPzl7H6lGrUQlxIelHiuEmlCcxJoSn.I", "alt_text": "A Melbourne resident putting out free homemade masks earlier this week for others in the local community to take as they need.

Finding mobile launchers to hit, however, requires close surveillance with satellites that Japan does not currently possess, meaning it would have to rely on help from ally the United States.\n\nJapan's defence ministry could decide on equipment purchases by the end of the year, government officials told Reuters.\n\nThe ruling party deliberations were prompted by defence minister Kono Taro's decision in June to cancel two planned Aegis Ashore sites designed to track and target incoming ballistic missiles from North Korea, citing a risk posed to nearby residents from falling booster rockets and rising costs.\n\nThe LDP document included a recommendation that Japan consider how to acquire a defence radar system on a par with Lockheed Martin's Aegis Ashore system that could also track other threats such as drones and cruise missiles.\n\nAmong proposals being considered by officials is locating the Aegis Ashore at other ground sites, or putting the new powerful radar on ships. US defence company Raytheon has been lobbying senior LDP lawmakers with a proposal to choose its SPY-6 radar rather than using Lockheed's system, sources earlier told Reuters.\n\n\"The government will make a decision regarding this by the end of September and our thinking will be reflected in that,\" Mr Onodera said.\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nDefence and military", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/nz_jpgsdf_310780.jpg?VersionId=pVH_J0uPtMOQRAR9nM7Ph1Nl1juHdXRO", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

It also comes on the heels of Amazon posting its biggest profit in its 26-year history.\n\n\"A project of this scale requires significant effort and resources, and, due to the nature of LEO constellations, it is not the kind of initiative that can start small. You have to commit,\" the company said in a blog post.\n\nThe project will also benefit wireless carriers deploying 5G and other wireless service to new regions, Amazon said.\n\nBy comparison, SpaceX has launched over 500 satellites of the roughly 12,000 expected for its Starlink constellation in low Earth orbit and plans to offer broadband service in the United States and Canada by the year's end. The FCC approved SpaceX's request in 2018.\n\nSpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell, who in February floated the idea of spinning Starlink off for an IPO in the coming years, has said the Starlink constellation will cost the company roughly US$10 billion.\n\nWhile extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide high-speed Internet to people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fibre optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology could also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupts communication.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Given Mr Trump's contempt for the legal limits on his office and his oft-expressed admiration for foreign dictators, it hardly seemed far-fetched to imagine he would at least attempt the gambit.\n\nBut when the moment came on Thursday (July 30), with Mr Trump suggesting for the first time that the\n\nelection could be delayed,\n\nhis proposal appeared as impotent as it was predictable - less a stunning assertion of his authority than yet another lament that his political prospects have dimmed amid a global public health crisis.\n\nIndeed, his comments on Twitter came shortly after the Commerce Department reported that US economic output contracted last quarter at the fastest rate in recorded history, underscoring one of Mr Trump's most severe vulnerabilities as he pursues a second term.\n\nFar from a strongman, Mr Trump has lately become a heckler in his own government, promoting medical conspiracy theories on social media, playing no constructive role in either the management of the coronavirus pandemic or the negotiation of an economic rescue plan in Congress - and complaining endlessly about the unfairness of it all.\n\n\"It will be a great embarrassment to the USA,\" he tweeted of the election, asserting without evidence that mail-in voting would lead to fraud. \"Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\"\n\nThe most powerful leaders in Congress immediately shot down the idea of moving the election, including the top figures in Mr Trump's own party.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts who mounted a largely symbolic challenge to Mr Trump in the Republican primaries this year, said on Thursday that the president's tweet was a sign that Mr Trump was panicked and unmoored.\n\nAlthough Mr Weld has argued for years that Mr Trump had dictatorial impulses, he said on Thursday that the election delay idea was \"not a legitimate threat\".\n\n\"So many dead and the economy in free fall - and what's his reaction? Delay the election,\" Mr Weld said. \"It's a sign of a mind that's having a great deal of difficulty coming to terms with reality.\"\n\nMr Trump has attacked the legitimacy of US elections before, including the one in 2016 that made him president. Even after winning the Electoral College that year, he cast doubt on the popular vote and postulated baselessly that rival Hillary Clinton's substantial lead in that metric had been tainted by illegal voting.\n\nWith that as precedent, there has never been much doubt - certainly among his opponents - that Mr Trump would attempt to undercut the election if it appeared likely he would lose it.\n\nWhile he does not have the power to shift the date of the election, there is ample concern among Democrats that his appointees in Washington or his allies in state governments could make a large-scale effort to snarl the process of voting.\n\nDISTRESS CALL\n\nGiven the extreme nature of Mr Trump's suggestion, there was an odd familiarity to the response it garnered from political leaders in both parties. There was no immediate call to the barricades or renewed push from Democrats for presidential impeachment. Opposition leaders expressed outrage, but most agreed, in public and private, that Mr Trump's outburst should be treated as a distress call rather than a real statement of his governing intentions.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in government, replied to Mr Trump's tweet simply by posting on Twitter the language from the Constitution stating that Congress, not the president, sets the date of national elections.\n\nDemocratic Representative Zoe Lofgren, who chairs the congressional committee that oversees elections, suggested in no uncertain terms that Mr Trump's tweet was another symptom of his inability to master the coronavirus.\n\n\"Only Congress can change the date of our elections,\" Ms Lofgren said, \"and under no circumstances will we consider doing so to accommodate the president's inept and haphazard response to the coronavirus pandemic or give credence to the lies and misinformation he spreads regarding the manner in which Americans can safely and securely cast their ballots.\"\n\nRepublicans, who typically answer the president with a combination of evasion or no comment, did not rush to become profiles in courage by thundering against an out-of-control presidency, and some ducked the issue entirely when confronted by reporters. But many others were blunt in their rejection of Mr Trump's position.\n\n\"Make no mistake: the election will happen in New Hampshire on November 3rd. End of story,\" Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican who is up for re-election, said on Twitter.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida said on Capitol Hill: \"Since 1845, we've had an election on the first Tuesday after November 1, and we're going to have one again this year.\"\n\nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and one of Mr Trump's staunchest allies in Congress, echoed that position, saying: \"We should go forward.\"\n\nOthers were more equivocal, following a well-worn Republican playbook for avoiding direct conflict with the president over his wilder pronouncements. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, asked in a Senate hearing whether he believed it was legal for a president to delay an election, said he was \"not going to enter a legal judgment on that on the fly this morning\".\n\nThat would be an assessment, he said, for the Justice Department.\n\nEven Mr Trump's campaign declined to turn his tweet into a rallying cry, instead playing down the notion that it might have been a policy prescription. Mr Hogan Gidley, a spokesman for the campaign, said Mr Trump was \"just raising a question about the chaos Democrats have created with their insistence on all mail-in voting\" - an obviously false paraphrase of the president's tweet, one that minimised the gravity of what Mr Trump had said.\n\nThe timing of Mr Trump's tweet, as much as the content, highlighted the extent to which he has become a loud but isolated figure in government and in the public life of the country. In addition to failing to devise a credible national response to the coronavirus pandemic, he has not played the traditional presidential role of calming the country in moments of fear and soothing it in moments of grief.\n\nNever was that more apparent than Thursday, when Mr Trump spent the morning posting a combination of incendiary and pedestrian tweets, while his three immediate predecessors - Mr Barack Obama, Mr George W. Bush and Mr Bill Clinton - gathered in Atlanta for the funeral of Mr John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights hero.\n\nAs mourners assembled at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, Mr Trump had other matters on his mind, like hypothetical election fraud and, as it happened, Italian food.\n\n\"Support Patio Pizza and its wonderful owner, Guy Caligiuri, in St. James, Long Island (N.Y.),\" the president tweeted, referring to a restaurateur who said he faced backlash for supporting Mr Trump. \"Great Pizza!!!\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nUS presidential election 2020\n\nDonald Trump", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/nz_trump_310761.jpg?VersionId=zeS3Ng5eno80PkIVyakwJwh4YiLxgcry", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

According to Vogue, she has attended two of its Paris Fashion Week shows and frequently totes its trophy handbags on her travels, most recently, the brand's Solferino bag.\n\nSo it is no surprise that the product du jour is the fashion house's bags.

And her first guest is none other than her husband of 28 years, former United States president Barack Obama, reports Harper's Bazaar.\n\nLaunched on Wednesday, the podcast will examine the relationships that have shaped the lives of guests, which include businesswoman Valerie Jarrett, who talks about mentorship, and television host Conan O'Brien in a discussion on marriage.\n\nIn the first episode, the former first couple look at the bonds they have forged with their respective communities, which they say were integral to both their upbringing and their careers long before their tenures in the White House.\n\nMrs Obama, 56, reflects on her upbringing in Chicago's South Shore community, which has a strong sense of community spirit. Recalling neighbours supporting one another, she says that it shaped her into someone who looks out for others. That emphasis on community is something she sees in her husband too.\n\n\"You know the core of everything you have done politically, what I know about you as a person and one of the reasons why I fell in love with you is...,\" she says, before being interrupted by Mr Obama.\n\n\"It wasn't just my looks. But that's okay,\" the 58-year-old jokes.\n\n\"You're cute, you know,\"she continues.\n\n\"But, no. One of the reasons I fell in love with you is because you are guided by the principle that we are each other's brothers' and sisters' keepers. And that's how I was raised.\"\n\nIn 1985, two years after he graduated from Columbia University, Mr Obama began working as a community organiser in Chicago, setting up a job training programme, a college preparatory tutoring programme, as well as establishing a tenants' rights organisation in Altgeld Gardens.\n\nThe two met four years later, in 1989, when he was interning at a Chicago law firm where she was an associate. The couple tied the knot three years later in 1992.\n\nReflecting on their shared values, Mrs Obama says: \"I can say that my family, my neighbourhood, my notions of community growing up shaped that view, and shaped the choices that I made in life as I felt your experiences shape yours.\"\n\nIn their usual fashion, the couple, in between charming banter, easy laughter and quick \"love yous\", also discuss family life, giving listeners a glimpse into the conversations they have around the dinner table.\n\nReflecting on the legacy they hoped to leave for their daughters, Malia and Sasha, Mr Obama says: \"When you and I think about what's the inheritance we'd like to leave Malia and Sasha, more than anything that it would be is that they're living in a country that respects everybody and looks after everybody; celebrates and sees everybody. 'Cause we know that if we're not around, that those girls are in a society like that, they'll be fine.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nPoliticians\n\nCelebrities\n\nSocial media", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/ST_20200731_TREND31C8J8_5854018.jpg?VersionId=YIpOQKxbx54h1CP2Rx1xyJRXh_1HQQx3", "alt_text": "Mrs Michelle Obama and her guest, Mr Barack Obama, talk about community and family in the first episode of The Michelle Obama Podcast."}]}

Rodzi\n\nFollow topic:\n\nSingapore-Malaysia ties\n\nPublished\n\nJul 31, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nFares on the much anticipated cross-border Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link will be affordable as prices will be set with the low-income group and daily commuters in mind to make the project viable, said Malaysia's Transport Minister Wee Ka Siong yesterday.\n\nHe added that ticket prices will be the same on both sides of the Causeway, factoring in conversion rates.\n\nSMRT Corporation and Prasarana Malaysia, joint venture partners for the project, have already settled on the fee structure.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Johor Baru after a ceremony at the Causeway to mark the official resumption of the project, Dr Wee said: \"Whatever we decide here, say X amount in Malaysia, Singapore will charge the same in Singapore currency. It will not be costly as we need to consider the low-income group and daily commuters to make this project viable.\"\n\nThe fares will be announced before operations begin, he added. The project is scheduled for completion in 2026.\n\nThe 4km RTS Link will connect Woodlands North MRT station on Singapore's Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) to Bukit Chagar, a planned elevated terminal in Johor Baru.\n\nThe current KTM shuttle train service will cease operations within six months after the RTS Link becomes operational.\n\nBoth countries had acknowledged a need to alleviate traffic congestion at the Causeway, which facilitates about 300,000 crossings daily.\n\nThe RTS Link will continue to feature the co-location of Customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) facilities, so that passengers undergo CIQ clearance only once - at their point of departure.\n\n\"If you're a Singaporean commuter, you will only need to get clearance in Woodlands. For Malaysian commuters, you will be cleared at Bukit Chagar,\" Dr Wee said.\n\nThe minister added that the journey would take only five minutes and, during peak hours, trains will be deployed at an interval of 3.6 minutes.\n\nThis would allow up to 300,000 passengers to be transported per day as the RTS Link has a capacity of 10,000 commuters.\n\nIt now costs $5 for an MRT ride from Woodlands to Bukit Chagar via KTM, and RM5 (S$1.60) for a one-way trip to Woodlands from Bukit Chagar.\n\nDr Wee said: \"This is a dedicated railway system from Bukit Chagar so for the distance of 4km, it is using the (Malaysian) LRT system.\"\n\nThe initial plan was for the cross-border link to use the same trains and rail systems as the TEL, for economies of scale.\n\nAs a result of the change, the RTS Link will not use the existing Mandai Depot in Singapore - run by TEL operator SMRT - for heavy maintenance of trains.\n\nInstead, a new depot will be constructed in Wadi Hana, Johor Baru.\n\nSaid Dr Wee: \"We need a maintenance depot, we need to have a place we can do servicing and maintenance, that's why we choose Malaysia.\"\n\n\"It will also create 1,000 jobs for the locals. The land acquisition process will continue with the help of the state government and the depot will be jointly owned by Singapore and Malaysia.\"\n\nThe RTS Link project was suspended from April 1 last year, at Malaysia's request, to allow some time for the country to review the project.\n\nYesterday's ceremony was witnessed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Muhyiddin Yassin, as Singapore's Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung and Dr Wee marked the resumption of the project.\n\nSingapore will be bearing 61 per cent of the RM10 billion project cost, Dr Wee said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore-Malaysia ties", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-rts-30072022.jpg?VersionId=Q7I6Wh8FLMEpq9P7P3AYOUPe0VOVnnhj", "alt_text": null}]}

The two leaders have met three times, but failed to find a compromise over the North's nuclear weapons programme.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

But a focus on post Korean War military spending, the fall of the Soviet Union, and a famine in the mid-1990s that killed an estimated two million people, crippled the economy.\n\nSee more on\n\nNorth Korea\n\nEconomic affairs\n\nEmbargoes and economic sanctions\n\nKim Jong Un", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/nz_pyongyang_310771.jpg?VersionId=8c6Cgp_tLwlSvac2MlBmQSZFjZgjU0Mo", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

Suicide had been an option for him for a year\".\n\nVan Gogh had been in an asylum near Arles and released just three months earlier.\n\n\"The thicket of roots was a symbol of the struggles of life. We cut down the tree and from their stumps new shoots appear.\n\n\"It makes sense, the theme of life and death, and eliminates all these lousy theories which do little for his memory,\" Dr van der Veen said.\n\nThe revolver with which van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest sold for \u20ac162,500 (S$263,000) at a Paris auction last year.\n\nDiscovered in a field near the village, it was billed as \"the most famous weapon in the history of art\".\n\nThe rusty 7mm Lefaucheux had already been exhibited at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.\n\nWhile the Van Gogh Institute said the link with the painter could not be proven conclusively, the bullet extracted from his stomach was the same calibre as the one used for the Lefaucheux revolver.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nArtists\n\nHistory\n\nFrance\n\nNetherlands", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/ST_20200731_VANGOGH3183DS_5853899.jpg?VersionId=mJpWTqBg9B9RxCwmrGbBgjuR_Uqxn3rs", "alt_text": "Researcher Wouter van der Veen, scientific director at the Van Gogh Institute, showing a copy of the postcard (left) which enabled him to identify the location of Vincent van Gogh's final painting, Tree Roots (below)."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/ST_20200731_VANGOGH316A02_5853901.jpg?VersionId=hFpaPFaPdri9wErTqpdnyvv7CmhI0HSu", "alt_text": "Researcher Wouter van der Veen, scientific director at the Van Gogh Institute, showing a copy of the postcard (left) which enabled him to identify the location of Vincent van Gogh's final painting, Tree Roots (below)."}]}

Both have completed Phase 2 trials.\n\nSinovac is teaming up with Instituto Butantan in Brazil, where about 600,000 have signed up for Phase 3 trials.\n\nCanSino Biologics, a partner of China's People's Liberation Army, has published results that said its vaccine, tested in a trial of about 500 participants in China, has produced strong immune responses with only minor side effects.\n\nOutside China, the first large study of the safety and effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine in the United States began this week, according to the National Institutes of Health and the biotech company Moderna, which collaborated to develop the vaccine.\n\nA second company, Pfizer, also announced this week that it had also begun a late-stage study of a coronavirus vaccine. Pfizer has been working with a German company, BioNTech.\n\nThe US government announced last week that it had reached a US$1.95 billion deal to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine by the year's end, but only if the trial proves it safe and effective.\n\nSinopharm and Sinovac are currently building factories capable of producing 300 million doses a year.\n\nFollowing an appeal from Mr Duterte, China's Foreign Ministry assured the Philippines would have priority access to China's vaccines.\n\n\"The Philippines is a friendly close neighbour and we will give priority to its needs once we succeed in developing a vaccine,\" said the ministry's spokesman Wang Wenbin.\n\nSee more on\n\nPhilippines\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nInfectious diseases", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/nz_manila_310757.jpg?VersionId=JvHD.UHgqSWyVDsCkzzoKj8qpCW3llCl", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

(Right) Reality-show star Khloe Kardashian captioned her selfie with the hashtag #womensupportingwomen.\n\nPHOTOS: CINDYCRAWFORD/INSTAGRAM, KHLOEKARDASHIAN/INSTAGRAM\n\nFollow topic:\n\nSocial media\n\nPublished\n\nJul 31, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nNEW YORK \u2022 Over the past several days, Instagram feeds have been overrun with black-and-white images of women both famous and not.\n\nThese photographs are often posed and filtered, taken from flattering angles and accompanied by benign captions about \"supporting women\".\n\n\"Love this simple way to lift each other up. #challengeaccepted. Thank you for nominating me @vanessabryant,\" model Cindy Crawford posted on Monday, along with a black-and-white photo of herself strolling on a beach which looked as if it had been ripped from a Calvin Klein advertisement.\n\nThe premise of the \"challenge accepted\" trend is that these photos promote female empowerment and that nominating friends to take part in the campaign is a way for women to support each other.\n\nSo far, more than three million photos have been uploaded with the #ChallengeAccepted hashtag; many more have appeared without it.\n\n\"The trend is still picking up with usage of the hashtag on Instagram doubling in the last day alone,\" an Instagram spokesman said earlier in the week. \"Based on the posts, we're seeing that most of the participants are posting with notes relating to strength and support for their communities.\"\n\nMany women have included the hashtag #womensupportingwomen in their posts.\n\n\"Challenge Accepted,\" reality-show star Khloe Kardashian wrote in an Instagram post on Sunday. \"To all my Queens - Let's spread love and remember to be a little kinder to one another. #womensupportingwomen.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Instagram users have leveraged black-and-white selfies in support of a vague cause. In 2016, black-and-white photos with the #ChallengeAccepted hashtag were meant to spread a message of cancer awareness.\n\nOver the years, the photo trend has also been used to \"spread positivity\". The challenge has circulated like chain mail. Participants nominate at least one other woman, and often several, to post her own black-and-white portrait.\n\nCelebrities such as actresses Kerry Washington, Jennifer Garner, Kristen Bell and Eva Longoria have helped the campaign gain visibility.\n\nMs Cristine Abram, a public relations and influencer marketing manager for Later, a social media marketing firm, said a video of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking out against Representative Ted Yoho's sexist remarks against her on the floor of United States Congress last week led to a spike in social media posts about feminism and female empowerment, which may have contributed to the latest round of black-and-white photos.\n\n\"That was the spark that led to the resurgence of the hashtag challenge,\" Ms Abram said. \"It's all to do with female empowerment. There was this hashtag that already existed to raise awareness around other large issues. Tapping into that allowed participants to gain traction a lot faster because the algorithm was already familiar with the hashtag.\"\n\nA representative from Instagram said the earliest post the company could surface for the current cycle of the challenge was posted a week and a half ago by Brazilian journalist Ana Paula Padrao.\n\nThough the portraits have spread widely, the posts themselves say very little. Like the black square, which became a symbol of solidarity with black people but asked very little of those who shared it, the black-and-white selfie allows users to feel as if they are taking a stand while saying almost nothing.\n\nInfluencers and celebrities love such \"challenges\" because they do not require actual advocacy, which might alienate certain factions of their fan base.\n\n\"Ladies, instead of posting that hot black-and-white selfie, why don't we ease into feminism with something low stakes, like cutting off your friend who's an abuser?\" tweeted writer Alana Levinson.\n\nOther women have spoken out about the backlash they have faced for critiquing the trend.\n\n\"Currently getting hate mail on Instagram from complete strangers because I said black and white selfies aren't a cause,\" tweeted podcast host Ali Segel. \"Apparently I hate women and don't love myself. I'm minding my own business for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"I think that if this 'movement' featured trans women or differently abled women, or showcased female businesses or accomplishments or women in history, it would make more sense,\" Segel explained further, in a direct message on Twitter. \"But the idea of this as a challenge or cause is really lost on me.\"\n\nOther women suggested that, instead of a selfie, women should share photos of books, articles, products and charities that benefit women. A few wondered whether the trend had been started by men.\n\nTV writer Camilla Blackett suggested that the campaign was little more than a vehicle for attractive photos. \"What is the point of this #ChallengeAccepted thing?\" she tweeted. \"Do people not know you can just post a hot selfie for no reason?\"\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nSocial media\n\nSocial conditions and trends\n\nCelebrities\n\nGender issues", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/st_20200731_women31.jpg?VersionId=LE8rfgjlNikztz3FSDMmHFI9aq1U2Va3", "alt_text": null}]}

Both of them have denied wrongdoing.\n\nFifa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt said last week in a statement that the meetings were legitimate and legal.\n\nInfantino was elected in 2016 to replace disgraced Sepp Blatter, who was also the subject of criminal proceedings in 2015.\n\nYet the Swiss-Italian lawyer could be the second Fifa president to be banned from the sport after Blatter, who is currently serving a six-year ban from all football-related activities.\n\nThe investigations against Swiss Blatter, who is suspected of criminal mismanagement, are still ongoing and he has not been charged. He denies wrongdoing.\n\nOn being elected, Infantino promised to clean up Fifa and to put the focus back on football.\n\nFifa was embroiled in the worst corruption scandal in its history in 2015 which led to several officials being charged in the United States with related offences.\n\nLauber was in charge of Switzerland's probe into the scandal that erupted when Swiss police in May that year raided a luxury hotel in Zurich before dawn.\n\nLauber last week offered to resign after a court concluded he had covered up a meeting with Infantino and lied to supervisors while his office investigated corruption surrounding football's governing body.

Also on the list was Barty's compatriot Nick Kyrgios, who last month blasted the ATP as \"selfish\" for pressing ahead with plans for the US Open.\n\nAustralia's restrictions on international travel have been a concern, with Australian citizens requiring an exemption to leave the country and then being required to quarantine for 14 days upon returning.\n\nEuropean players are also worried that undergoing mandatory quarantine upon returning to their continent will force them to miss high-profile tournaments in Madrid and Rome ahead of the French Open at the end of September.\n\nFrenchman Patrick Mouratoglou, the long-time coach of Williams, believes the US Open must not turn into a national championships and organisers need to address players' health concerns by next week.\n\nNew York reported less than 5,000 new coronavirus cases last week, an improvement since spiking in March and April while areas such as Florida, Texas and California have become hotspots.\n\n\"Now I see that the situation in New York is getting better, much better,\" Mouratoglou said. \"But at the same time I think it's very much about travel restrictions...\n\n\"What about the South Americans? Are they now allowed to travel or not? What about the Australians?\n\n\"You can't have a Grand Slam which is the National US championships, right?

Many conveyed a sense of joyfulness through candy colours, megawatt metallics and frothy fabrics. Others championed good old staples: hard-working denim, chic camel suits and sparkly glad rags for night. Jeffrey Yan reports\n\nFind out what\u2019s new on\n\nST website and app.\n\n1 of 6\n\nBlue Sky Thinking: Carolina Herrera\u2019s classic checks.\n\nPHOTO: CAROLINA HERRERA\n\nJeffrey Yan\n\nFollow topic:\n\nFashion designers\n\nPublished\u00a0Jul 31, 2020, 05:00 AM\n\nBlue Sky Thinking\n\nClassic blue may be the 2020 Pantone Colour of the Year, but the softer sky blue speaks more to the uplift we crave in these times. From the old-school, such as Givenchy's elegant day sheath with gently puffed sleeves and Carolina Herrera's classic checks, to the new age - think Sacai's silk handkerchief dress overlaid with astral prints and Dior's luxe sportswear with maps and zoological motifs - these are the perfect pieces to beat the blues.\n\nGood Jeans\n\nThere is always much comfort to be found in the familiar.\n\nPre-autumn 2020 saw the resurgence of good old dependable denim, interpreted in ways new and old.\n\nTory Burch and Michael Kors both looked to the 1970s - tailored, boxy and worn with silk scarves and knits at the former; at the latter, paired with indigo suede and tan leather extras.\n\nFendi and Balmain had the 1980s on their minds, resulting in statement shoulders, nipped waists and even acid wash.\n\nNew Bourgeois\n\nThe codes of the bourgeois wardrobe - prim skirt suits, camel coats, ladylike blouses - ruled the runways this past year. For pre-autumn, designers injected a dose of the unexpected into the formula to refresh it for a new generation.\n\nAt Max Mara, chocolate suits were trimmed with ruffles and worn with silk tees. Other designers looked to unexpected colour combinations to zing up standard bourgeois browns - petrol blue and fire-engine red at Balenciaga, lilac and blush at Givenchy and mint and oxblood at Gucci.\n\nThe Lightness Of Being\n\nTiers of tulle, fluttering feathers, wisps of chiffon and organza; there was a romantic, unabashedly feminine mood in the air this season, further heightened by standout hues that ranged from sorbet sweet to super saturated.\n\nLightweight dresses in soft sunrise colours were seen at Chanel and Oscar de la Renta, while Fendi, Valentino and Giambattista Valli all had their own takes on frothy, ruffled frocks in pale pastels.\n\nShine On\n\nIn moments of darkness, fashion can offer a glimmer of beauty. A group of designers made this concept literal this season, turning out looks that sparkled and shimmered. Gold and silver goddess gowns showed up at Gucci and Moschino, but high shine does not have to be relegated to only evenings.\n\nChanel, Armani and Oscar de la Renta offered brilliant separates to brighten up the day, while Bottega Veneta and Michael Kors Collection paired liquid dresses with tough-girl boots for street edge.\n\nBandeau Together\n\nThe 1990s revival showed no sign of abating; there was still a penchant for the decade's pared-back fashions this season and the bandeau silhouette was the latest to make a comeback.\n\nWith clean, straight lines and a form that is close to the body, bandeau-inspired pieces make for effortless, minimal styling whether worn on its own or layered. Chanel, Dior and Proenza Schouler all served up iterations in timeless black.\n\nThis article first appeared in Harper's Bazaar Singapore, the leading fashion glossy on the best of style, beauty, design, travel and the arts.

Apple posted rising sales for accessories such as AirPods and services such as the App Store.\n\nThe continued growth in services and accessories also showed the durability of the company's brand, which has prompted investors to view it as a comparative safe haven and pushed up share prices since March.\n\nThe company also saw strong sales in its greater China region, where aggressive pricing during a June holiday shopping season and lower-priced iPhone SE model released in April helped boost sales 2 per cent to US$9.33 billion from US$9.16 billion a year earlier.\n\nApple also announced a 4-for-1 stock split.\n\nApple's fiscal third-quarter revenue and profits were US$59.69 billion and US$2.58 per share, compared with analyst expectations of US$52.25 billion and US$2.04 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nSales in its services segment, which also includes offerings such as iCloud and Apple Music, rose 14.8 per cent to US$13.16 billion, compared with US$11.46 billion a year ago and analyst expectations of US$13.18 billion. Cook told Reuters that Apple has 550 million paying subscribers on its platform, up from 515 in the previous quarter.\n\nSales in the wearables segment that includes the Apple Watch rose 16.7 per cent to US$6.45 billion, compared with US$5.53 billion a year ago and estimates of US$6 billion, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nApple did not give a fiscal fourth-quarter forecast.\n\nApple's results come as most analysts expect the release of at least some of its new iPhone models this fall to be delayed after several major Apple suppliers such Broadcom Inc and Qualcomm have given forecasts that included a delayed fall launch from a major customer.\n\nApple is likely to delay the release of some models until November due to supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus, according to a senior official at a major iPhone supplier with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nApple benefited from remote work and learning trends, reporting sales in its iPad and Mac segments of US$6.58 billion and US$7.08 billion, which beat expectations of US$4.88 billion and US$6.06 billion, according to Refinitiv data.\n\n\"Both had some really significant product announcements at the end of March, beginning of April. I think we have the strongest product line in both areas that we've ever had,\" Cook told Reuters.\n\n\"You combine that with the work from home and remote learning, and it's yielded really, really strong results.\"\n\nBut the global smartphone market was already stagnating before the novel coronavirus caused it to contract, and Apple has leaned heavily into growing its services business, which is where the company's fastest revenue growth occurred during the fiscal third quarter. The biggest component of that business is the App Store, where Apple generates commissions between 15 per cent and 30 per cent on some sales.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cook faced questions from US lawmakers about Apple's practices related to the store, which have come under fire from independent app developers who say its rules and unpredictable approval process put them at a disadvantage against the iPhone maker.\n\nSee more on\n\nApple\n\nCompany results\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/2020-07-30t201309z_1058891015_rc2w3i9r6v1u_rtrmadp_3_apple-results.jpg?VersionId=Dy4qln0U6huX6iohGrKBnXQWxxTXy7g5", "alt_text": null}]}

Monthly active users rose to 2.7 billion, ahead of estimates of 2.6 billion.\n\nFacebook projected that ad revenue for the third quarter is likewise expected to grow faster than Wall Street estimates, despite an unprecedented ad boycott in July that drew the support of companies including Unilever, Starbucks and Coca-Cola.\n\nOnly about 1,100 companies joined the boycott to pressure the social network to take more action against hate speech, out of millions of Facebook advertisers. Although some were among the company's biggest individual spenders, the bulk of Facebook's ad revenue comes from small businesses.\n\nThe company's ad sales in the first three weeks of July grew 10 per cent year-over-year, in line with the rate for the second quarter, it said. It forecast ad revenue growth in the third quarter would be consistent with that July performance.\n\nInvestors were bracing for difficulties in the second quarter, which was the first to reflect the full impact of virus-related lockdowns.

He also assists in collecting swab samples and reinforcing the discharge advice for Swab and Send Home patients.\n\nHow did you prepare for your role?\n\n\"Regular and timely updates about the process changes due to the evolving situation from our management through e-mails and during roll calls helped us better prepare for our roles. These updates are important to help us tighten processes, such as determining area layouts and planning workflows, for the safe management of Covid-19 patients.\"\n\nWhat was the most uplifting moment you experienced?\n\n\"A migrant worker invited me to join him in a video call with his family back in India while I was taking his vital signs. His wife and son thanked me for taking care of him, and gave me words of encouragement. Although the interaction was short, it was heart-warming.\"\n\nMs Lee Mei Ling, senior staff nurse, National Dental Centre Singapore\n\nWhen the Covid-19 situation intensified, patients conveyed by designated ambulances to SGH were sent to the multi-storey carpark, which was converted into a fever screening and triaging area. Ms Lee was deployed there to do triaging, assessments and nursing interventions, such as taking vital signs, and performing electrocardiograms (ECGs). She was also attached to the Mobile Swab Team at various locations to help with registration and ushering, and collating and dispatching swabs.\n\nWhat challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?\n\n\"Tending to the needs of the migrant workers was tough due to the language barrier. To overcome this, we used pictorial charts and online translation tools to communicate with them more effectively.\"\n\nWhat was your biggest takeaway?\n\n\"Different departments have different roles to play, but we share a common goal of giving our best care to our patients. It was an eye-opener to work with doctors, anaesthetists, allied health professionals and nurses from different institutions and specialities. This is an experience that I am very thankful for.\"\n\nMs Ganchalee Sae Gan, senior staff nurse, Singapore National Eye Centre\n\nMs Ganchalee usually works at the Day Ward at the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC), but was deployed to the triage area at SGH's Emergency Department, where she assessed patients who were suspect Covid-19 cases and assisted in collecting swab specimens.\n\nDid you have any concerns when taking up this role?\n\n\"As the first line of contact with suspect cases, I was concerned because I stay in a household of 10 people, with young children and elderly parents. But I strongly believed that there would be no issue if I adhered to infection control measures. I was extra vigilant when attending to patients, and made an effort to stay healthy and hydrated as much as possible. Caring for the sick is my call of duty, and I am willing to contribute wherever my service is needed.\"\n\nWhat were your memorable moments?\n\n\"At the SNEC Day Ward, I did not have the opportunity to put on the full PPE. During my deployment, I had to gown up whenever I attended to patients - now I can even do it with my eyes closed! The group of doctors I worked with was very generous and caring. They would order small treats occasionally to show their appreciation for us. In times of crisis, teamwork among healthcare workers is especially important.\"\n\nMs Vithiya Kaliammah Chandrasegaran, senior staff nurse, KK Women's And Children's Hospital\n\nMs Vithiya provides nursing care for suspect and confirmed Covid-19 patients in the KK Women's and Children's (KKH) isolation ward, where she performs nasal swab tests and monitors their condition. She also looks into the psychological and emotional well-being of patients and caregivers by taking time to explain the condition and care rendered, partnering caregivers in their child's care, and sharing stories of patients who have recovered.\n\nHow did you feel about caring for Covid-19 patients?\n\n\"Initially, I felt nervous. But I knew I needed to be brave. It helped to be doing this with my team, with strong support and encouragement from my supervisors and senior management. My ward took care of high-dependency patients and those who required intensive care. As we were not trained on such specialised procedures, my team participated in a two-week attachment at KKH's Children Intensive Care Unit (ICU), which boosted our confidence.\"\n\nWhat was the most uplifting moment?\n\n\"The first paediatric Covid-19 patient in Singapore was fully cared for by my team. Before the caregiver was admitted into KKH, the young patient would cry when left alone in the isolation room. After a few weeks, the child started to recognise me and smiled whenever I entered. The caregiver was very appreciative of our efforts. I am happiest when my patients recover and get discharged without complications.\"\n\nMs An Xue Qi, senior staff nurse, Singapore General Hospital\n\nWhen the call came for nurses to be deployed to Changi General Hospital's (CGH) ICU to supplement its manpower, Ms An stepped forward and was posted there for one month. She also volunteered to be posted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases' (NCID) ICU when SGH was asked to assist with its ramp-up. She was able to optimise her skills and knowledge in managing ICU patients through these valuable experiences.\n\nHow did you feel about being on the frontlines of this pandemic?\n\n\"Instead of being anxious, I felt honoured to be a part of the team on the frontline. The experience gave me the opportunity to work with and learn from healthcare workers from various institutions. Although we had different working cultures, we gelled as a team and exchanged ideas to improve processes for better patient outcomes.\"\n\nWhat was your biggest takeaway?\n\n\"Being deployed at NCID exposed me to new work procedures, and allowed me to pick up valuable skills and knowledge to manage complex cases. For example, I learnt to care for patients using the ECMO machine, which I have never handled before. This experience also taught me to appreciate everyone in the healthcare setting, from housekeeping staff to frontline workers. By working together and trusting each other, we can overcome this crisis.\"\n\nMs Nerissa Ramirez Lontoc, senior staff nurse, National Cancer Centre Singapore\n\nImmuno-compromised patients, such as those suffering from cancer, are at a higher risk of being infected with Covid-19. At the National Cancer Centre Singapore's (NCCS) Ambulatory Treatment Unit (ATU), Ms Nerissa ensures that each patient is cared for with extra vigilance. For patients who have a potential risk of Covid-19 but are fit for chemotherapy treatment, she cares for them in a separate room.\n\nWhat challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?\n\n\"We had to adapt to evolving instructions and precautionary measures in line with the situation, so my colleagues and I would remind each other about them. Putting on and taking off the PPE repeatedly was also challenging, but these safety measures are in place to protect us and our patients, and we soon got used to it. As a team leader, I try to adopt a positive attitude to encourage my colleagues.\"\n\nWhat kept you going?\n\n\"Being a nurse is not just a job but a calling, and I always endeavour to treat patients with the care and respect they deserve. I feel a great sense of fulfillment knowing that I have done my part to keep our patients safe. It also warms my heart when patients appreciate and encourage us during this trying period.\"\n\nMs Quek Yih Jen, senior staff nurse, Changi General Hospital\n\nMs Quek was part of the CGH Mobile Rapid Triage team that went to different dormitories to triage and treat migrant workers. As the nursing lead of the team, she oversaw the smooth running of the team's operations, including nursing manpower assignments as well as ensuring that medical supplies were sufficient and equipment were functional. She also performed tasks, such as monitoring vital signs and conducting blood and swab tests.\n\nHow did you prepare for your role?\n\n\"I started by getting to know my teammates well, as this would help us work cohesively and bring out the best in everyone. I also underwent training about the right procedures and precautions to take note of during swab tests, and learnt how to run a medical post in a dormitory to ensure that we meet the needs of the migrant workers.\"\n\nWhat kept you going?\n\n\"It was quite a sight to see staff from different departments come together, work closely as a team and persevere through rain and shine. As a healthcare worker, I feel proud to be able to serve the nation and protect people from invisible enemies, such as Covid-19.\"\n\nMs Ng Hwee Lan, nurse clinician, National Neuroscience Institute\n\nMs Ng volunteered to be part of the Mobile Swab Team (MST) in foreign worker dormitories and was subsequently deployed to the CCF at Singapore Expo. As part of the MST, she visited different dormitories and did swab tests for migrant workers. At the CCF, she assisted the Hall In-Charge as a team leader to run the hall and guard everyone's safety. The team also brainstormed and planned activities for the hall residents to facilitate their holistic recovery.\n\nWhy did you volunteer to serve at the frontline?\n\n\"I saw the task as a mission similar to National Service. I had worked through the Sars outbreak in 2003, so I was not fearful to be at the frontlines. It is a privilege to care for the migrant workers. They helped build our nation and now, it is our turn to help them get back on the road to recovery.\"\n\nWhat challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?\n\n\"Although the 12-hour shifts at Singapore Expo were draining, it was very meaningful to witness the hall residents regain their health. The support from my family, as well as the National Neuroscience Institute's (NNI) senior management who visited us on-site several times, boosted our morale and assured us that we were not alone in this battle.\"\n\nMs Jessica Ow, senior staff nurse, SingHealth Polyclinics\n\nMs Ow was deployed to the Swab Isolation Facility at Village Hotel Changi, where she triaged and screened patients who were undergoing self-isolation while they awaited their Covid-19 test results.\n\nHow did you prepare for your role?\n\n\"I attended a refresher course on infection control and conducted an audit on screening processes. Besides adhering strictly to safety measures, such as frequent handwashing and proper wearing of PPE, I kept myself updated with the latest information from the Ministry of Health and SingHealth Polyclinics (SHP), and familiarised myself with the new procedures and protocols.\"\n\nWhat kept you going?\n\n\"My sense of responsibility towards our patients motivates me every day. During my deployment, I saw that some patients were anxious because they did not understand certain protocols. By addressing and clarifying their doubts, they felt more assured and calm. Some of them even thanked us for our patience when we took the effort to explain the situation. The sense of achievement from being part of the team combatting Covid-19 also kept me going.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nBranded content\n\nSingHealth\n\nHealthcare", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/sh_collage.jpg?VersionId=p1wRbF1CYecCX.A3dyvWZl6amJ5J8.DX", "alt_text": null}]}

The NBA said it cut ties last year with Xinjiang, but continues to operate academies in Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, in facilities run by the Chinese government.\n\nOne former coach said he saw a Chinese counterpart hurl a ball into a young player's face and \"kick him in the gut\" according to the ESPN investigation.\n\n\"Imagine you have a kid who's 13, 14 years old, and you've got a grown coach who is 40 years old hitting your kid,\" the coach was quoted as saying. \"We're part of that. The NBA is part of that.\"\n\nNBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum told ESPN only a \"handful\" of complaints about abuse had been received and officials in the league's New York office, including commissioner Adam Silver, were not aware of broad mistreatment of players.\n\nHe added the league is \"re-evaluating\" the academy programme.\n\nAccording to the NBA Academy website, players in these academies range from 14-18 years old.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It's fair to say we were less involved than we wanted to be.\"\n\nThe report comes at a time of fraught relations between the NBA and China. State broadcaster CCTV stopped screening NBA games last year after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nThe NBA began launching international academies in 2016, placing three in China with the aim to unearth the next Yao Ming, the towering former Rockets centre. But the Chinese project was \"fundamentally flawed\" according to Bruce Palmer, a former technical director at a private basketball school in China who was hired by the NBA to evaluate the academies.\n\nThe main problems were that NBA employees were placed under Chinese authority, and the league was prevented from working with China's elite players, Palmer said.\n\nAccording to ESPN, one coach requested a transfer after seeing Chinese coaches hit teenage players, while another left because he could not stomach the lack of education.\n\nEducation was intended as a central plank of the academies, but no formal schooling was provided by the Chinese sport bureaus, the report said. It detailed cramped living conditions at the Xinjiang academy, where rooms meant for two players were accommodating up to 10, sleeping in bunk beds.\n\nPlayers trained two or three times a day, ESPN said, adding that teenagers as young as 13 were often left unsupervised.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nNBA\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton, spoke of Lewis' rise from humble beginnings on a Troy, Alabama, farm to become a leader of the 1960s struggle for equal rights for black Americans.\n\nUltimately, the man known as the\"conscience of Congress\" never gave up his drive to make \"good trouble\" in the cause of justice, Obama said.\n\nObama and others spoke or sang in front of his casket draped in the American flag at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr once preached. King, who was assassinated in 1968, had been a mentor to Lewis.\n\nLewis, who was first elected in 1986 to represent Georgia in the US House of Representatives, died on July 17 at age 80 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. His death came at a time of reckoning across the United States over racial injustice ignited by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.\n\nObama - a Democrat who was the nation's first black president and who awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 - argued that the man whose sharecropping parents \"picked someone else's cotton\" now should be counted among the Founding Fathers.\n\n\"America was built by John Lewis. He as much as anyone in our history brought our country closer to its highest ideals,\" the Democratic former president said.\n\nIn his speech, Bush remembered joining Lewis in Selma, Alabama, for the 50th anniversary of the watershed 1965 march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. \"The story that began in Troy isn't ending here today, nor is the work.\"\n\nThe funeral capped a week of memorial services.\n\nLewis's coffin was escorted across the bridge on Sunday, decades after his beating there drew a national spotlight to the struggle for racial equality, including suppression of the Black vote in the South. And on Monday his casket was taken to the US Capitol in Washington where it lay in state through Tuesday.\n\nEric Terrell, 65, of Atlanta, sat outside the church in his wheelchair, in the heat and thick air of an Atlanta summer morning, waiting to get a glimpse of former presidents Clinton and Bush, but especially Obama. He was camped out before 6.30am so he could bow his head as Lewis' funeral procession rolled by.\n\nAnd he held his homemade sign until his arms got tired. It read, \"Get your a** out and vote.\"\n\n\"He put his life on the line in Selma so we could vote,\"said Terrell, who is black. \"So we better do it,\" he said before joining the throng of onlookers outside the church watching the services on a Jumbotron.\n\nIn an essay written shortly before his death and published in the New York Times on Thursday, Lewis called on the younger generation to get into \"good trouble,\" using perhaps his most famous utterance about the importance of challenging inequality.\n\n\"In my life I have done all I can to demonstrate that the way of peace, the way of love and nonviolence is the more excellent way,\" he wrote, before invoking a famous line from King: \"Now it is your turn to let freedom ring.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nBarack Obama\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/2020-07-30t182353z_678280469_rc2u3i9oz1a2_rtrmadp_3_people-john-lewis-georgia.jpg?VersionId=h98aBAzNrH8nrU2XumU_LBsEEgLfu7P9", "alt_text": null}]}

But if it did, here's how it would work: The Constitution gives states the power to choose the \"times, places and manner\" of elections, but Congress can set national standards.\n\nSince 1845, Congress has set Election Day as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. That date is a vestige of an agricultural economy when fall harvests were completed and Tuesdays didn't interfere with trips to the market.\n\nEvery once in a while, someone proposes a change. The Weekend Voting Act - sponsored by Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Representative Louise Slaughter of New York, both Democrats - would have moved the election to the weekend after the first Friday in November. The Bill died in the last Congress without a vote.\n\nIt would be difficult to push elections back much further without hitting legal and constitutional deadlines. States need time to complete their official counts and certify the results before appointing members of the Electoral College, called electors.\n\nBy law, the Electoral College meets \"the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.\" That's Dec 14 this year. If no election has been held, it would be up to state legislatures to decide how to cast their state's electoral votes and they could choose anyone.\n\nThe final step is for Congress to receive the Electoral College votes. That usually happens Jan 6, but Congress has changed the date in the past. If there's no clear winner by then, the House of Representatives chooses the president from among the top three candidates with electoral votes, with each state delegation getting one vote. The Senate chooses the vice-president.\n\nFinally, there's one deadline that can't be moved without a constitutional amendment. Inauguration Day is Jan. 20, 2021. Trump's term ends at noon that day, whether there's been an election or not.\n\nIf no president or vice-president is chosen by then, the speaker of the House becomes president. That's now Democrat Nancy Pelosi, but there will be an election for a new speaker in January.\n\nBut if a catastrophe were to somehow prevent the election of new members of Congress, the president pro-tem of the Senate would move to the White House.\n\nThat's Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. He was re-elected to a six-year term in 2016, so he would be the one person in the line of succession whose eligibility doesn't rely on an election held in 2020.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUS Democratic Party\n\nUS Republican Party", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/2020-07-29t232335z_1117938208_rc2b3i9sudpk_rtrmadp_3_health-coronavirus-usa-congress.jpg?VersionId=RPf.uz3bfjBUvJr3IoZiMg_s2VfA0A7A", "alt_text": null}]}

Williams, who leads his team in assists with an average of 5.7 per game, said he visited the establishment for food.\n\n\"We know that a lot of teams have had their guys throughout.

All three could be available against the Lakers.\n\nBoth teams also made additions during the break. Guards Dion Waiters and J.R. Smith will replace Avery Bradley, who opted out due to coronavirus concerns, and guard Rajon Rondo is recovering from surgery on a broken thumb. The Clippers added forward-centre Joakim Noah during the stoppage.\n\nFor Clippers star Kawhi Leonard, their upcoming games are about building chemistry.

Leonard and wingman Paul George have played just 32 games together this campaign, although they have been stellar when they shared the floor, outscoring opponents by 11.6 points per 100 possessions.\n\n\"I knew that we had a pretty deep squad,\" Leonard said. \"I knew how talented we could be. It's about executing now.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nFive other teams to watch\n\nMILWAUKEE BUCKS (53-12)\n\nOutlook:\n\nThe Bucks were the dominant team before the suspension, leading the National Basketball Association (NBA) in point differential at 11.2, against 7.4 for the Los Angeles Lakers. And they had the league's best defence and the third-best offence. The Eastern Conference leaders also have Giannis Antetokounmpo, who will likely repeat as the Most Valuable Player, and efficient Khris Middleton as his wingman. They are title favourites, bolstered by likely first-round opponents (Brooklyn Nets or Washington Wizards) who are weakened without their best players.\n\nChallenge:\n\nMiddleton said he did not pick up a basketball for several months during quarantine. And can Antetokounmpo, who is not a strong three-point shooter, overcome defences that load up the paint on him in the play-offs?\n\nTORONTO RAPTORS (46-18)\n\nOutlook:\n\nThe defending champions are deep. Pascal Siakam broke out this year to average career highs in almost every category and establish himself as a star, which helped the team overcome the loss of Kawhi Leonard. Aside from Siakam, five other players - Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, Norman Powell, Serge Ibaka and O.G. Anunoby - averaged double digits in scoring for Toronto. They excelled defensively, second best behind Milwaukee.\n\nChallenge:\n\nCan they hold off the Boston Celtics, who are three games behind, to retain their second seed? The difference between the No. 2 seed and the No. 3 is facing a depleted Nets team and going up against Miami, Indiana or Philadelphia, who might land at No. 6.\n\nBOSTON CELTICS (43-21)\n\nOutlook:\n\nOf their big four - Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Gordon Hayward - only Hayward is not averaging at least 20 points a game. They have also received some heady contributions from rookie Grant Williams.\n\nChallenge:\n\nWhat's the status of Walker's knee? He missed several games during the regular season, and after the long lay-off, coach Brad Stevens suggested that Walker needed more time to ease into play.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER (40-24)\n\nOutlook:\n\nWhen the Thunder traded Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets and Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers, most figured that Chris Paul, who they acquired in their deal with Houston, would land with another team. Instead, he dedicated himself to the Thunder - fifth in the Western Conference - and even made the All-Star team again. The pay-off has been huge, as he helped nurture players like guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 22.\n\nChallenge:\n\nDo they have enough pieces? Dennis Schroder, one of the league's top reserves, has said that he will leave the bubble when his wife gives birth to their second child. She is due next month.\n\nHOUSTON ROCKETS (40-24)\n\nOutlook:\n\nThe mad scientists of the NBA are set to continue with another bold experiment: The small-ball line-up they deployed in February. The idea is to station five players on the perimeter so that they drag their defenders to the three-point line and give Westbrook seams to drive to the hoop.\n\nChallenge:\n\nJames Harden is having another big season, scoring a league-leading 34.4 points a game, and Westbrook's production improved after coach Mike D'Antoni went small.

We need answers,\" they added.\n\nChi Onwurah, Labour Member of Parliament for Newcastle Central, said she would be contacting the Premier League.\n\n\"I know that many constituents will be disappointed and frustrated by the withdrawal of the latest NUFC takeover offer. I will be writing to the Premier League to ask why they took so long and gave so little clarity to NUFC fans,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe city's local newspaper, The Chronicle, published an open letter to the Premier League saying the team's supporters were owed an explanation.\n\n\"A transformative but deeply controversial takeover is off. Having dreamed of something different, the city now confronts the reality of what Newcastle are: unloved, divorced from its people, deeply divided and facing the most uncertain of futures,\" the paper wrote.\n\n\"The Premier League tonight stands accused of blocking a once-in-a-lifetime investment in the city and football club. It is a serious accusation that demands a response,\" it added.\n\nNoting that the Premier League has kept quiet, observing the confidential nature of the owners and directors test, the paper said the time had come for openness.\n\n\"But without clarity or the decency to even acknowledge the festering sores at one of your member clubs, we do not know.

He is also an executive producer of the film, which premiered on Wednesday.\n\n\"I can honestly say, looking back on my career, I don't think anybody really cared to help us,\" the 23-time Olympic champion says. \"As long as we were performing, I don't think anything else really mattered.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, as they have braced for criticism, Olympic officials past and present have noted all the perks Phelps received during his career, including top training and coaching, access to cutting-edge technology and a two-bedroom suite at the Olympic Training Centre in Colorado Springs. Everyone else slept in single or double rooms.\n\nBut that uneven treatment and response to the film, Phelps said, illustrates how officials and coaches view athletes as assets during their brief windows of Olympic glory, but then leave them largely on their own during the years between Games. And when their careers are interrupted or over, the system moves on to the next star.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

More athletes have access to unlimited phone counselling and six in-person therapy sessions with a licensed professional through the employee assistance company ComPsych. The benefit was extended this year to some 4,400 athletes, more than three times the number before the coronavirus pandemic caused the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics to next year.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nMental health\n\nMichael Phelps\n\nOlympics\n\nDocumentaries", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/ST_20200731_ANPHELPS_5853845.jpg?VersionId=FzOjKRgyUZTX2ULIQxnEebA.jDeRcNqn", "alt_text": "Michael Phelps celebrating after winning the last of his 23 Olympic gold medals at the 2016 Rio Games.

Tel Aviv has held competitions to design innovative and beautiful shading structures for sidewalks and public spaces, Ms Vetter said.\n\nCape Town, concerned about water scarcity, has focused on installing water-thrifty spray parks rather than swimming pools to cool residents on hot days, she added.\n\nTokyo, meanwhile, has laid 126km of reflective pavements, in part to cool the marathon course for the now-delayed Olympic Games.\n\nCities like Buenos Aires are running workshops for elderly residents on heat risks and creating a communications network to alert them to heatwaves with phone calls and texts.\n\nAnd others such as Madrid are installing real-time heat sensors - some mobile, mounted on bikes or backpacks - to give a clearer sense of where heat risks are highest, Ms Vetter said.\n\nOne of the smartest way to fund changes, she said, was to piggyback on work already being planned in cities, from road and sidewalk repairs to school upgrades or tree planting campaigns.\n\nMr Jeffrey Raven, director of the New York Institute of Technology's graduate programme in urban and regional design, said it was important to bring residents, climate scientists and urban designers together to look jointly for answers.\n\n\"We work with the communities on the kinds of issues they're facing: job creation challenges, access to services, public health, red-lining, things of that nature,\" said Mr Raven, an architect and specialist in sustainable urban design.\n\nSolutions that address those concerns and heat risks together can be the most effective and welcome, he added.\n\nGetting businesses on board with heat-reduction efforts - through government policy or cost-savings from less air-conditioning in well-designed buildings - also is key, said Calvin Kwan of Link REIT, Asia's biggest real estate investment trust.\n\nCOVID COMPLICATIONS\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic this year has complicated efforts to protect vulnerable city residents from heat, the experts said, as many public and private cooling spaces - from malls to libraries and pools - are closed or limiting entry numbers.\n\nIn New York, city officials have responded by distributing cooling systems to some low-income seniors, Ms Charles-Guzman said.\n\nThe city also is petitioning the state government to give poorer families financial aid to pay summer utility bills - just as some now receive help paying for winter heat, she said.\n\nThat \"would allow us to not have to choose between putting food on the table and staying cool in the summer\", she added, warning that by 2050 New York summers are predicted to be as hot as today in Birmingham, in the southern US state of Alabama.\n\nNew York City has for many years considered setting a maximum permitted indoor summer temperature in rental properties, just as it has a minimum temperature for winter, Ms Charles-Guzman said.\n\nBut that has \"been very difficult to achieve\", she added.\n\nThe poor and vulnerable should continue to be the focus of efforts to ease heat risks in New York and elsewhere, she noted.\n\n\"Our communities are simply not on the same level and they require targeted and different interventions to stay safe, especially in a changing climate,\" she said.\n\nSee more on\n\nWeather\n\nClimate change", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/08574582.jpg?VersionId=fpu.vIHvRm8FvjJyaypcjDtWdZ6wAYmo", "alt_text": null}]}

In addition, the economic slump is set to cause a fall in the birth rate, leaving Australia facing its lowest population increase in more than a century.\n\nThe Federal Government expects net migration - the overall population change due to long-term arrivals and departures - to be just 31,000 next year, a drop of more than 85 per cent compared with pre-pandemic levels. But the numbers could yet be lower, as the current forecast assumes that travel will resume from January, which is not certain. Net migration was 154,000 in 2019-20 and 232,000 in 2018-19.\n\nThe reduced intake will have ripple effects across the economy, crimping total consumer demand and affecting property prices and the construction sector.\n\nAn economist, Mr Chris Richardson, from Deloitte Access Economics, said the lower migration is set to reduce the annual national income by tens of billions of dollars this year and next. He said Australia should return to its strong migrant intake as soon as the Covid-19 health threat passes and borders can reopen.\n\n\"Come the end of 2021, there will probably be a quarter of a million fewer people in Australia than we've been expecting before the virus,\" he told SBS News.\n\nIn recent years, Australia, which has a population of about 25 million, has taken in about 160,000 permanent migrants a year, mainly made up of people on skilled worker visas and family visas. The largest source of permanent migrants in 2018-19 was India, followed by China, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and New Zealand.\n\nBut these figures are due to plunge, as Australia currently allows only citizens and permanent residents and their immediate families to enter the country. As of Thursday, Australia had 16,303 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 190 deaths.\n\nThe government expects Australia's overall population growth to be just 0.6 per cent next year, the lowest rate since 1916-17.\n\nIn addition to the migrant drop, the federal government is expecting Australia's fertility rate to fall due to the weaker economic outlook. In 2018, it was 1.70, slightly above the average of 1.6 for the advanced economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nProfessor Mark Wooden, a labour market expert at the University of Melbourne, said the economic decline caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was likely to prompt some would-be parents to choose not to have a baby but he did not expect a significant decline in the fertility rate.\n\n\"Until a vaccine arrives, people will be putting off a lot of decisions, one of which is having children,\" he told The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nThe falling fertility rate prompted calls for the federal government to consider re-introducing its \"baby bonus\" - a cash handout to new parents introduced in 2004. The bonus was credited with causing an increase in the fertility rate to more than 2.0 before payments were limited to lower-income families in 2009 and effectively abolished in 2013.\n\nThe Treasurer, Mr Josh Frydenberg, said he wanted to support families to have children but was not planning to introduce a new baby bonus.\n\n\"The more children that we have across the country, together with our migration, we will build our population growth and that will be good for the economy,\" he told the National Press Club.\n\n\"The best thing that we can do to encourage more children being born across the country is obviously to create a strong economy for them to be born into.\"\n\nMr Frydenberg also flagged that he wanted Australia's pre-pandemic migrant levels to resume when the health situation allows.\n\n\"We're all beneficiaries of Australia's strong multicultural diverse environments and long may that continue,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nAustralia\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nPopulation/Demographics", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/tl-sydney-a-3007280.jpg?VersionId=BfHssFMptbvd24F9po29twsxkjyWY3Nx", "alt_text": null}]}

With Democrats ruling the Lower House, that seems highly unlikely to happen.\n\nMr Trump has previously insisted that he sees no problem going ahead with the election, where he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden.\n\nMr Trump has bitterly resisted Democratic-led attempts to increase availability of mail-in voting, saying that this will promote fraud and that Americans should line up at the polls as usual.\n\nThe President's sustained attacks on mail voting, combined with Democratic efforts to encourage more of their voters to request and submit absentee ballots by mail, have led to a significant Democratic advantage in mail voting.\n\nIn April, the liberal candidate for a Wisconsin state supreme court race performed about 10 percentage points better in ballots cast by mail than she did on election day, according to a New York Times analysis of the returns.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Seventy eight per cent placed \"a great deal or fair amount of the blame for the global spread of the coronavirus on the Chinese government's initial handling of the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan,\" the survey found.\n\nRepublicans are particularly critical; 73 per cent believe China's early handling of the pandemic contributed a great deal to its spread, compared with 38 per cent of Democrats who say the same, the report said.\n\nFaith in China's President Xi Jinping to \"do the right thing in world affairs\" has also deteriorated.

We are devastated for the fans.

Foreign journalists were barred from this year's haj, usually a huge global media event.\n\nAs part of the rites completed over five days in the holy city of Mecca and its surroundings, the pilgrims converged on Mount Arafat after spending the night in Mina.\n\nA district of Mecca, Mina sits in a narrow valley surrounded by rocky mountains, and is transformed each year into a vast encampment for pilgrims.\n\nThey began the haj on Wednesday with their first \"tawaf\", the circumambulation of the Kaaba, a large structure in Mecca's Grand Mosque towards which Muslims around the world pray.\n\nThe Kaaba is draped in a black cloth embroidered in gold with Koranic verses and known as the kiswa, which is changed each year during the pilgrimage.\n\nPilgrims were brought inside the mosque in small batches, walking along paths marked on the floor, in sharp contrast to the normal sea of humanity that swirls around the Kaaba during haj.\n\nThe haj typically costs thousands of dollars for pilgrims, who often save for years as well as endure long waiting lists for a chance to attend the ritual.\n\nBut this year, the Saudi government is covering the expenses of all pilgrims, providing them with meals, hotel accommodation and health care, worshippers said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nHari Raya Haji\n\nIslam\n\nHaj", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/saudi-religion-hajj-health-virus-161209.jpg?VersionId=xmevxRXmcfV3CWEVx7xdYTB1tObwXCpb", "alt_text": null}]}

It is the only space agency so far to pull off a successful mission on the surface of the Red Planet.\n\nPerseverance is largely the same design as the Curiosity rover, which set down in 2012 and will have the same convoluted but now tried-and-true \"sky crane\" landing choreography.\n\n\"When people look at it, it looks crazy,\" Nasa engineer Adam Steltzner said in a video leading up to Curiosity's landing that described the components: heat shield, parachute, rocket engines and, finally, a hovering crane that lowered the rover to the surface.\n\n\"That's a very natural thing,\" he said. \"Sometimes when we look at it, it looks crazy. It is the result of reasoned, engineering thought. But it still looks crazy.\"\n\nWhile everything worked, the engineers got a chance to take a look at what could be improved this time around. \"We don't usually get a chance to kind of redo or fix the mistakes we made last time,\" Dr Allen Chen, who leads the Perseverance entry, descent and landing team for Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in an interview.\n\nFor example, Curiosity actually landed too slowly, hitting the ground at 2.25kmh instead of the 2.73kmh that had been expected.\n\nThat, by itself, was not a problem. A softer landing is gentler on the spacecraft. But the engineers wanted to understand what had happened in order to make sure that the next landing - that of Perseverance - did not come down faster than intended. It turns out that their calculation of the gravity of Mars was slightly wrong.\n\nIn areas of the planet that possess less mass - like the 154km-wide crater that Curiosity landed in - the pull of gravity is a bit weaker.\n\n\"We didn't have sufficient fidelity in our gravity modelling to understand that the gravity there was actually different than elsewhere on the planet,\" Dr Chen said. \"So that was one thing that we fixed.\"\n\nAnother component that was tweaked was the parachute that is unfurled when the spacecraft is hurling down at supersonic speeds.\n\nA parachute failure in a prototype test of a future Mars landing system led Dr Chen's team to make sure it had not just gotten lucky with Curiosity.\n\n\"That gave us pause,\" he said.\n\nThe engineers are now confident of Perseverance's parachute after tests of a strengthened design.\n\nOne major addition to Perseverance is what Nasa calls \"terrain-relative navigation\". A camera on the spacecraft will take pictures of the landscape and match them with its stored maps. It would then steer to what looks like the safest landing spot it can.\n\n\"I don't need the whole place to be flat and boring,\" Dr Chen said. \"I just need parts of it that I can reach to be flat and boring.\"\n\nWithout this system, there would be more than a one-in-five chance that Perseverance would end up somewhere unfortunate - damaged by a boulder, tipped over on a steep slope or surrounded by sand traps. That would be an unacceptably high risk for such a high-profile and expensive mission.\n\nIf it works, the same technology will be used when Nasa sends a mission to pick up the rock samples that Perseverance will be collecting, part of the so-called Mars sample return. That spacecraft will carry enough fuel that it is able not only to avoid obstacles but also to fly to a specific location, landing within tens of metres of the target.\n\nStill, next Feb 18, the control room at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is expected to be full of nervous engineers watching the telemetry returning from Perseverance. That data will take minutes to travel millions of kilometres - far too far and too slow for anyone at Nasa to make last-second corrections.\n\n\"Mars is not for the faint of heart,\" Dr Chen said.\n\nNYTIMES, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nNasa\n\nSpace and cosmos", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

The drop in GDP was more than triple the previous all-time decline of 10 per cent in the second quarter of 1958.\n\nThe bulk of the historic plunge in GDP reported by the Commerce Department yesterday occurred in April, when activity almost ground to an abrupt halt after restaurants, bars and factories, among others, were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe collapse in GDP and faltering recovery put pressure on the White House and Congress to agree on a second stimulus package.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, whose opinion poll numbers have tanked as he struggles to manage the pandemic, economic crisis and protests over racial injustice three months before the Nov 3 election, said on Wednesday that he was in no hurry. \"This is hard to swallow,\" said finance professor Jason Reed of the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business.\n\n\"Right now, the American economy is speeding toward a fiscal cliff. Not only do we need Americans to take serious action preventing the spread of the disease, but we also need Congress to agree on another stimulus package, and quickly.\"\n\nThe economy contracted at a 5 per cent pace in the first quarter. It fell into recession in February.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

That has tempered hopes of a sharp rebound in growth in the third quarter.\n\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the slowdown in activity.\n\nThe US central bank kept interest rates near zero and pledged to continue pumping money into the economy. Stocks on Wall Street opened lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices rose.\n\nEconomists say that without the historic fiscal package of nearly US$3 trillion (S$4.13 trillion), the economic contraction would have been deeper.\n\nCrucial lifelines in the pandemic, like the extra US$600 in weekly unemployment benefits, are expiring at a time when the economic recovery is showing signs of teetering.\n\nLawmakers are currently debating another stimulus package to support businesses and the unemployed, but the timing of the Bill is unclear.\n\nSupport from Congress has buoyed the economy in recent months, and further action will be crucial in determining the path of the recovery.\n\nIn a separate report yesterday, the Labour Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.43 million in the week that ended last Saturday. A staggering 30.2 million Americans were receiving unemployment cheques in the week that ended on July 11.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy, plunged at a record 34.6 per cent rate last quarter.\n\nThat followed a 6.9 per cent pace of decline in the January-March period.\n\nBusiness investment tumbled at a historic 27 per cent rate. It was pulled down by spending on equipment, which collapsed at a 37.7 per cent rate.\n\nInvestment in equipment has now contracted for five straight quarters.\n\nThe housing market was not spared, with spending on homebuilding tumbling at 38.7 per cent rate.\n\nBut government spending rose at a 2.7 per cent rate, thanks to the historic stimulus package.\n\nThough a smaller import bill helped to narrow the trade deficit and was positive for GDP, it cut inventories, leading to a drawdown of stocks by businesses that subtracted 3.98 percentage points from GDP.\n\nREUTERS, BLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nUS economy\n\nEconomic slowdown\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAd\n\nBoost Your Job Hunt With AI In SG's Competitive Job Market\n\nLearn More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nHow S\u2019pore\u2019s security forces collaborate behind the scenes to keep the nation safe\n\n\u2018Nobody deserves to be alone\u2019: Why Mummy and Acha have fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd\n\nWin 2x tickets to New Zealand.

In defence, Mr Pichai said: \"We today make it very easy for users to be in control of their data. We remind users to go do a privacy check-up. One billion users have done so.\"\n\nRepublican Representatives Ken Buck and Matt Gaetz targeted Google's pulling out of an initiative to help the Pentagon build technology systems while it continued to operate an artificial intelligence lab in China.

In response, Mr Bezos said: \"I do not think that's systematically what's going on\".\n\nMR TIM COOK, APPLE\n\nFor Apple, the spotlight was on its dominance on mobile apps and Apple's App Store. When asked why Apple removed parental-control apps shortly after the company released its own competing version in 2018, Mr Cook said the company was concerned about the \"privacy and security of kids\" as the technology being used at that time had the ability to \"sort of take over the kid's screen and a third party could see it\".\n\nApple was accused of waiving the 30 per cent commission on Amazon's video-streaming service in exchange for better collaboration between the two. Mr Cook argued that \"there is a competition for developers just like there is a competition for customers\".\n\nSee more on\n\nBig Tech\n\nCompetition laws", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/ST_20200731_TECH31C_5854849.jpg?VersionId=6asC4h1kb4vRZ4cghYkltzzZvQAqPbsd", "alt_text": "Mr Jeff Bezos (left) and Mr Tim Cook responding to a slew of questions from US lawmakers.

Gross margin was 28.1 per cent, up from 27.4 per cent a year ago, due to selling prices underpinned by strong demand, stable input prices thanks to diversification in sourcing, and higher sales of house-brand items, which command a higher gross margin.\n\nSheng Siong declared an interim cash dividend of 3.5 cents a share, double what it paid out a year ago.\n\nIt expects elevated demand caused by Covid-19 to ease with the gradual reopening of the economy, while competition in the supermarket industry may stay keen as a result of e-commerce platforms gaining better visibility during the circuit breaker.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Chip demand came largely from data centres bulking up to support a work-from-home economy and growth in online learning.\n\nMemory chip makers, including South Korea's SK Hynix and Micron Technology of the US, have flagged higher demand from this trend too.\n\nSamsung's operating profit in the second quarter rose to 8.1 trillion won (S$9.31 billion) from 6.6 trillion won a year earlier, in line with its estimate earlier this month.\n\nRevenue at the world's top maker of memory chips and smartphones dropped 6 per cent to 53 trillion won. Net profit rose 7 per cent to 5.6 trillion won.\n\nSamsung said a one-off gain at its display business helped boost its profit, without elaborating further. Samsung's display business counts Apple as a customer.\n\nWith stockpiles fuller, Samsung's data centre customers are expected to buy fewer DRAM chips in the second half of the year, arresting the price rise, analysts said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

It would also halve the current end-to-end travel time of about five hours by airplane.\n\nFormer Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad had initially wanted to scrap the HSR as part of a review of his country's mega projects, in a bid to trim a RM1 trillion (S$325 billion) national debt. The Pakatan Harapan administration later clarified that it wanted to delay the onset of construction, as a cancellation would have entailed a high amount of compensation under the HSR agreement.\n\nThe project was then shelved for two years until May 31, when then Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said that Singapore had, in the spirit of bilateral cooperation , agreed to a final extension of the suspension period for seven months till the end of this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Singapore's new Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said the two countries will aim to start work on the RTS Link between Woodlands and Johor Baru as soon as possible. He noted that this partly depends on the pace of preparatory work as well as availability of workers, given the prevailing\n\nCovid-19 situation.\n\nMalaysian media reported last week that construction work on the RTS Link could begin in January next year, once approvals are obtained from the authorities of both countries.\n\n\"We want to start work as soon as we can, and importantly, to complete by end of 2026,\" he said.\n\nMr Ong said he has spoken with his Malaysian counterpart Wee Ka Siong on finding ways to strengthen bilateral transport ties while keeping coronavirus transmission low, and that he also held a short meeting with Malaysia's Senior Minister Azmin Ali about the possibility of resuming the HSR project.\n\nWith the completion of the RTS Link agreement on Thursday, PM Lee said he was optimistic that Singapore and Malaysia could likewise finalise the details for the HSR project by year-end.\n\n\"I hope it will go through, but there's always a lot of work to be done, and I have no doubt that the Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and on the Malaysian side too, they have kept working very hard on this project,\" said PM Lee.\n\nIn a joint statement issued after the ceremony, both countries said they had agreed on three key agreements to resume the RTS project, including a joint venture to form an operating company.\n\nSingapore rail operator SMRT Corp has signed a joint venture agreement with Prasarana Malaysia to form this company, which is named RTS Operations.\n\nThis Singapore-incorporated company will design, build, and finance the RTS Link operating assets including trains, tracks and systems, said SMRT and Prasarana in a joint media release on Thursday. It will also operate and maintain the rail line between Bukit Chagar in Johor Baru and Woodlands North in Singapore.\n\nSaid SMRT chief executive Neo Kian Hong: \"We are excited to work with Prasarana to provide a service on the third land link between Singapore and Malaysia, which will improve the commute of people who work and live on the two sides of the Causeway.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nRailways\n\nJohor Bahru\n\nMalaysia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/ST_20200731_VNINSIDE2_5855113.jpg?VersionId=XYmwrNamg__g6CjVDPGSvOewRP17IP9S", "alt_text": "PM Lee and Tan Sri Muhyiddin greeting each other yesterday at the Causeway, where the two leaders witnessed the ceremony to mark the resumption of the Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link.

Its arrival at Mars is planned for Feb 18 at the site of an ancient river delta.\n\nIt soared into the sky from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 7.50am EDT (7.50pm Singapore time) under clear, sunny and warm conditions, carried by an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.\n\nThe launch took place after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) facility in Pasadena, California where its mission engineers were located was rattled by an earthquake.\n\n\"The spacecraft is in good health and on its way to Mars,\" Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe launch was not without a minor glitch. In the first few hours after liftoff, retrieving precise location and positioning data from the spacecraft was hampered in a brief \"communications issue,\" Nasa officials said, involving the agency's global network of antennas used to communicate with its most distant probes. The issue was quickly resolved.\n\nThis marks Nasa's ninth journey to the Martian surface.\n\n\"It's really kind of a key of a whole bunch of new research that we're doing that is focused on the question ... is there life out there?\" the space agency's science division chief Thomas Zurbuchen said on a Nasa live stream after the launch.\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory director Mike Watkins quipped about the California quake: \"It was just the Earth being excited about going to Mars. It was a very minor event. Everything's fine, and we're on our way to Mars.\"\n\nPerseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250m) crater called Jezero, site of a former lake and water system from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life.\n\nScientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life. Water is considered a key ingredient for life, and Mars billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.\n\nThis was the third launch from Earth to Mars this month, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.\n\nUS Vice-President Mike Pence wrote on Twitter: \"Today is a great day for American leadership in space!\"\n\nHELICOPTER INGENUITY\n\nAboard Perseverance is a 1.8kg autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity due to test powered flight on Mars.\n\nThe thin Martian atmosphere - 99 per cent less dense than Earth's - poses a challenge to Ingenuity, which was designed to be light, with rotor blades that are larger and spin more quickly than needed for a helicopter of its mass on Earth.\n\nSince the first Mars rover Sojourner landed in 1997, Nasa has sent two others - Spirit and Opportunity - that have explored the geology of Martian plains and detected signs of past water formations. Nasa also has successfully sent three landers: Pathfinder, Phoenix and InSight.\n\nThe United States plans to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s under a program that envisions using a return to the moon as a testing platform for human missions before making the more ambitious crewed Martian voyage.\n\nPerseverance will conduct an experiment to convert elements of the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere into propellant for future rockets launching off the Martian surface, or to produce breathable oxygen for future astronauts. Perseverance also will collect and store rock and soil samples intended to be returned to Earth in the future.\n\nSee more on\n\nSpace and cosmos\n\nMars", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/tl-mars-r-300720.jpg?VersionId=ni4XBVzD5W_V5QwJil3XRG0TdqAKlnjF", "alt_text": null}]}

With the recovery faltering, pressure is mounting for the White House and Congress to agree on a second stimulus package.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who is trailing Democratic challenger and former vice-president Joe Biden in opinion polls, said on Wednesday he was in no hurry. Trump on Thursday raised the possibility of delaying the Nov 3 presidential election.\n\n\"This is hard to swallow,\" said Jason Reed, finance professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. \"Right now, the American economy is speeding towards a fiscal cliff. Not only do we need Americans to take serious action preventing the spread of the disease, but we also need Congress to agree on another stimulus package and quickly.\"\n\nGross domestic product collapsed at a 32.9 per cent annualised rate last quarter, the deepest decline in output since the government started keeping records in 1947. The drop in GDP was more than triple the previous all-time decline of 10 per cent in the second quarter of 1958. The economy contracted at a 5 per cent pace in the first quarter. It fell into recession in February.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP slumping at a 34.1 per cent rate in the April-June quarter.\n\nOn a year-on-year basis GDP fell a record 9.5 per cent last quarter.\n\nOutput shrank 10.6 per cent in the first half. The level of GDP has dropped to levels last seen in the last quarter of 2014.\n\nThough activity picked up starting in May, momentum has slowed amid the explosion of Covid-19 infections, especially in the densely populated South and West regions where authorities in hard-hit areas are closing businesses again and pausing reopenings. That has tempered hopes of a sharp rebound in growth in the third quarter.\n\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the slowdown in activity. The US central bank kept interest rates near zero and pledged to continue pumping money into the economy.\n\nStocks on Wall Street fell on the GDP report and Trump's tweet on possibly delaying the November vote. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices rose.\n\nBROAD HISTORIC DECLINES\n\nEconomists say without the historic fiscal package of nearly US$3 trillion (S$4.1 trillion), the economic contraction would have been deeper.\n\nThe package offered companies help paying wages and gave millions of unemployed Americans a weekly US$600 supplement, which expires on Saturday. Many companies have exhausted their loans.\n\nThis, together with the sky-rocketing coronavirus infections is keeping layoffs elevated. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.434 million in the week ending July 25. A staggering 30.2 million Americans were receiving unemployment checks in the week ending July 11.\n\n\"Tens of millions of workers have lost their jobs over the past few months and remain unemployed, and the pace of improvement in the labour market has slowed,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"These US$600 payments are adding about US$75 billion a month to household income, at a time when income from work has plummeted. The loss of huge amounts of unemployment income in the near term would be a significant drag on consumer spending.\"\n\nThere have been claims, mostly from Republicans, that the generous jobless benefits are discouraging some of the unemployed from looking for work. The GDP report showed income at the disposal of households surged US$1.53 trillion in the second quarter compared to an increase of US$157.8 billion in the January-March period.\n\nA significant portion of the income was stashed away, boosting savings to US$4.69 trillion from US$1.59 trillion in the first quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy, plunged at a 34.6 per cent pace last quarter.\n\nBusiness investment tumbled at a 27 per cent rate. It was pulled down by spending on equipment, which collapsed at a 37.7 per cent rate.\n\nInvestment is equipment has now contracted for five straight quarters. Boeing reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday and slashed production on its widebody programs.\n\nThe pandemic has also crushed oil prices, leading to deep cuts in shale oil production and layoffs. Spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells plunged at a record 34.9 per cent rate.\n\nInvestment in homebuilding tumbled at a 38.7 per cent rate.\n\nGovernment spending rose, though state and local government outlays fell. Trade added to GDP, but inventories were a drag.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS economy\n\nGDP\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/tl-us-a-300720.jpg?VersionId=okTfz4G9ipjt3nZeqcfoGXotSp42emFL", "alt_text": null}]}

This will apply to venues such as places of worship, common areas of housing blocks and other external venues.\n\nGuests should be split into fixed groups of up to five people each, with no intermingling or mixing between groups, and a 1m safe distance maintained between groups. But a designated \"wedding party\" group comprising up to 20 people, including the bride and groom, is allowed.\n\nWhile up to 20 people may be present at any one time for wakes and funerals currently, up to 30 may be present from Aug 4.\n\nMOH said that this would facilitate more family members and friends paying their last respects.\n\nIn addition, the ministry will launch a pilot where each wedding couple will also be allowed to hold one wedding reception, with up to 50 attendees - including the couple - for the entire duration of the event, in venues that are permitted to serve food and drinks like hotels and restaurants.\n\nThe ministry said it is exploring the possibility of expanding the list to include more venues such as common areas in public housing estates.\n\nThrough this pilot, the multi-ministry taskforce handling the pandemic here will assess the ability of the organisers and venue owners to ensure that safe management measures are put in place and adhered to.

The boy's life was spared and a ram was slaughtered instead.\n\nMuslims mark the day with prayers and the korban ritual, which involves slaughtering livestock and distributing the meat to the poor.\n\nThis year, the korban will not take place in Singapore. Instead, the slaughter is performed in Australia, and the meat will be chilled and shipped over. Traditionally, one-third goes to the person sponsoring the animal, one-third to family, friends and neighbours, and the rest to the poor.\n\nWhile 65 mosques will be open for Hari Raya Haji prayers on Friday morning, only a total of 8,750 worshippers will be able to attend. Most will hold three sessions with no more than 50 worshippers each time. The worshippers had to book slots online.\n\nOn Thursday, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) reminded Muslims to continue to abide by national restrictions on gatherings in public and private.\n\nThey should limit social gatherings to not more than five people, and households should receive no more than five visitors at one time. Visitors to the cemetery should remember to wear masks and maintain safe distancing of at least 1m.\n\nMuis said: \"In our eagerness to celebrate this special occasion with our loved ones, let us continue to be socially responsible and stay vigilant to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nHari Raya Haji\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/tl-hr-s-300720.jpg?VersionId=jbHKUvRoPkqx4ZDuOg4Dwnqads14Q1xs", "alt_text": null}]}

The company was hit by $919 million in provisions for Keppel Offshore & Marine's contract assets, doubtful debt, as well as share of impairment provision arising from its associate, Floatel.\n\nWithout the impairments, Keppel would have had a net profit of $222 million for the quarter, up 45 per cent from a year ago. The company's quarterly revenue stood at $1.33 billion, down 25.7 per cent from a year ago. Contributions fell across all business divisions due to measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nKeppel yesterday declared an interim dividend of 3 cents per share, down from the 8 cents it had declared for the same period a year ago. This will paid on Aug 20.\n\nChief executive Loh Chin Hua said that Keppel has failed to meet a pre-condition to a $4 billion takeover offer from Temasek Holdings. \"We believe that the 20 per cent threshold in the MAC (material adverse change) clause in respect of net profit after tax has been crossed, which means that the MAC pre-condition in Temasek's pre-conditional partial offer has not been satisfied.\"\n\nMAC clauses can be invoked to end or renegotiate deals, particularly if events occur that are detrimental to the target company.\n\nLast October, Temasek, which already owns about one-fifth of Keppel, offered to buy an additional 30.6 per cent stake.\n\nStill, the deal has a long-stop date of Oct 21, meaning Keppel could make up any shortfall in its third-quarter results, while Temasek also has the right to waive its pre-conditions.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Excluding the impairments, it would have registered a net profit of $393 million for the first six months of the year, 5 per cent higher than a year ago.\n\nRevenue stood at $3.18 billion, down 4 per cent from a year ago. This was due mainly to lower contributions from property trading projects in China, power and gas sales, environmental engineering projects and asset management.\n\nThe offshore & marine division reported a net loss of $959 million, reversing the net profit of $10 million a year ago. Besides the impairments, Keppel's O&M Singapore workforce was reduced to about 1,200 persons for most of the second quarter, from about 24,000 in March. The workforce has since risen to about 5,000. As at end-June, the net orderbook stood at $3.5 billion, which is expected to last the offshore & marine division for at least two years.\n\nMr Loh said that most of the company's businesses have remained resilient, underpinned by the essential services that they provide.\n\nTHE BUSINESS TIMES, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nKeppel Corp\n\nTemasek Holdings\n\nCompany results", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

Without evidence, he claimed that mail voting would be rife with fraud.\n\n\"With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\"\n\nHours later, Trump on Thursday said he did not want to postpone the vote, but remained concerned that millions of mail-in ballots would cause problems.\n\n\"I want an election and a result, much, much more than you,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"I don't want to delay. I want to have the election. But I also don't want to have to wait three months and then find out that the ballots are all missing, and the election doesn't mean anything.\"\n\nTrump cited recent media reports about potential problems with mail-in ballots arriving late and said it could take weeks, months or even years to sort it out. \"Do I want to see a date change? No, but I don't want to see a crooked election,\" he said.\n\nThe US has held elections for more than 200 years, including during the Civil War, the Great Depression and two world wars. Article II of the US Constitution gives Congress the power to set the timing of elections, and the 20th Amendment ends a president and vice-president's term in office on the Jan 20 following a general election.\n\nMultiple congressional Republicans - including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and top House of Representatives Republican Kevin McCarthy - rejected the idea.\n\n\"Never in the history of the federal elections have we ever not held an election and we should go forward with our election,\" said Mr McCarthy.\n\nDemocratic US Representative Zoe Lofgren, who chairs the House committee overseeing election security, rejected any delay.\n\n\"Under no circumstances will we consider doing so to accommodate the President's inept and haphazard response to the coronavirus pandemic, or give credence to the lies and misinformation he spreads,\" ms Lofgren said in an e-mail to Reuters.\n\nMr Trump wrote on Twitter later on Thursday that Americans needed to know the election results on the night of the voting, not days or months later. Mail-in ballots can sometimes take longer to count.\n\n\"Glad I was able to get the very dishonest LameStream Media to finally start talking about the RISKS to our Democracy from dangerous Universal Mail-In-Voting,\" he tweeted.\n\n'DESTABILISING'\n\nMr Trump's tweets will deepen Democrats' fears that he will try to interfere with the election or refuse to accept its outcome should he lose. Mr Biden has called that his biggest fear and has gone so far as to suggest sending in the military to force Mr Trump out if he refused to leave.\n\nDemocrats are preparing for fights over absentee ballots, potential voting recounts and the possibility that Mr Trump's Republican supporters will seek to intimidate voters at the polls.\n\nThe truly dangerous part of his tweet on Thursday was not his suggestion of delaying the election - which is a \"fantasy\" - but his latest claim that voting by mail is rife with fraud, according to Prof Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Marymount University and a constitutional law expert.\n\n\"This is yet another example of the president seeking to delegitimise the election process before it happens,\" Prof Levitt said. \"That is deeply destabilising.\"\n\n'JUST CAN'T HELP HIMSELF'\n\nMr Trump's tweet surprised some White House staffers. The White House referred questions about the tweet to his re-election campaign.\n\n\"The President is just raising a question about the chaos Democrats have created with their insistence on all mail-in voting,\" said Mr Hogan Gidley, the campaign's press secretary. \"Universal mail-in voting invites chaos and severe delays in results.\"\n\nA Republican close to the White House was stunned at the tweet, noting that it followed a period of stability in which Mr Trump stayed on message in response to advice from new campaign manager Bill Stepien and senior campaign manager Jason Miller.\n\n\"Obviously, he just can't help himself. This is starting to look like a real campaign, and then he does this,\" the Republican source said. \"It's awful.

Take stock of your skills.\n\nDetermine what transferable and marketable skill sets you can offer prospective employers that would help you stand out from other job seekers.\n\n2. Be open to opportunities, be flexible\n\nWhile Covid-19 has negatively affected certain industries, it has also opened pathways and accelerated growth opportunities in areas such as e-commerce, manufacturing, information and communications technology, health and social services, and financial services.\n\nJob seekers, especially those from sectors hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, can consider opportunities in new roles or sectors, or short-term jobs that are in high demand during this period.\n\n3. Seek professional career guidance\n\nIf you are feeling lost or unsure about how to start searching for a job, you can approach career ambassadors or career coaches at WSG's Careers Connect centres and SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres.\n\nCareer coaches provide one-on-one guidance and can advise you on how to tailor your resume to the job you are applying for and prepare for job interviews. They can also lend a listening ear.\n\nCareer ambassadors are stationed at the satellite career centres to provide basic career advice and guidance on the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package.\n\nUltimately, Ms Boo said, the onus is on job seekers to follow through on their career action plan.\n\nSee more on\n\nWorkforce Singapore\n\nEmployment\n\nRetrenchment\n\nICYMI", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-sgworkers-30072022.jpg?VersionId=T31wMfWDn4nNUoz9f..P0Pm9u3DIdELj", "alt_text": null}]}

On nine of these days, the daily maximum temperature was below 32 deg C.\n\nThis June was also the wettest in the last decade, due to strong solar heating of the land. Large-scale convergence of winds in the surrounding region and the passage of Sumatra squalls over Singapore on some days also contributed to thundery showers.\n\nThe squalls are organised lines of thunderstorms that originate over Sumatra or the Strait of Malacca, and typically move eastward towards Singapore.\n\nSee more on\n\nWeather\n\nMeteorological Service Singapore", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-sgweather-30072022.jpg?VersionId=.yX1DEYeySRjZvhPaEmB6wqjayzAVNr9", "alt_text": null}]}

Mezzanine investors, firms which lend money in shorter time frames and at higher interest rates, are seen as most at risk.\n\nUnder Hong Kong Monetary Authority rules, banks cannot lend more than 40 per cent of the asset value to commercial property buyers in order to minimise the damage caused by defaults. Mezzanine investors and other shadow banks are not bound by that.\n\n\"There are mezzanine investors that are overly aggressive in providing exceptionally high loan-to-value (LTV) at circa 80 per cent against underlying assets' true value,\" said Mr Ryan Chung, managing director at Huatai International, a major mezzanine investor.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

The actual amount will be less after income tax deduction. It is important I make this clear.\"\n\nThe sum of $385,000 is double the amount regular MPs get, and Mr Singh's decision to give away half of the pay rise drew praise from many observers, who said he was setting a good example for other political leaders.\n\nIn his original post, Mr Singh said he had discussed the offer of the LO position with his wife Loveleen Kaur Walia, after they put their two daughters to bed.\n\nHe said: \"While I am grateful to receive the additional support and remuneration that comes with the title of Leader of the Opposition, the appointment will require more investment of my time and longer hours away from my family.\n\n\"Amongst other things, we spoke about what the salary increase would mean for our family. Both of us felt strongly that a percentage of the salary should be used for a greater purpose.\"\n\nHis Facebook post received more than 4,000 comments, mostly from netizens who expressed their respect for him.\n\nBut some people questioned his motives for making the plan public.\n\nFor instance, former Nominated MP Calvin Cheng called it \"political theatre\", and his post on Facebook sparked discussion on how much Mr Singh would be giving away.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's wife Ho Ching, who shared several of Mr Cheng's posts on the issue, also put up a post on Facebook about the donating of money, saying: \"There are lots of folks who donated and continue to donate quietly, without making any public announcement.\n\n\"Some folks make public announcement of part of their donations, and still maintain privacy on the rest of their regular donations.\"\n\nShe did not refer to Mr Singh or cite specific examples in her post.\n\nOn Thursday night, Progress Singapore Party chief Tan Cheng Bock, in a Facebook post, supported Mr Singh's decision, saying it is a \"wonderful and generous gesture and sets a good example for Singaporeans to emulate\".\n\nHe added: \"It is sad and unbecoming, that some people have chosen instead, to cast aspersions on his intentions... It is far better to be gracious and welcome the gesture than to continue to try to score political points. This is very disappointing.\"\n\nPolitical analyst Loke Hoe Yeong - the author of a recent book on the history of the opposition in Singapore called The First Wave - also waded into the discussion.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he said he was \"baffled at the hue and cry from some quarters\" about Mr Singh's decision.\n\nDr Loke said that in 1985, then Minister of State Wong Kan Seng said he would donate half his ministerial salary and MP allowance, and he challenged opposition leaders J.B. Jeyaretnam and Chiam See Tong to do the same with their MP allowance and salaries from their legal practice.\n\nMr Wong was responding to a call from Mr Jeyaretnam to cut ministerial salaries by 25 per cent amid a recession that year, Dr Loke added.\n\nOver the years, more than a few MPs and ministers have given away substantial amounts of their allowances and pay.\n\nPM Lee, for instance, donated increases in his salary for several years from 2007, saying he wanted to signal to Singaporeans that his \"primary considerations are for the future of this nation, and not for my own salary\". He has also donated money to fund a raft of awards, such as the Prime Minister's Social Service Award, to encourage more Singaporeans to choose careers in social service.\n\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong, meanwhile, has used his entire MP allowance since being elected in 2011 to fund grassroots dinners and charitable donations, among other things.\n\nOthers, such as MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling, spend most of their MP allowance on donations and grassroots activities, and setting up social projects in their constituencies.\n\nSee more on\n\nPritam Singh\n\nLeader of the Opposition", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/tl-pritam-s-300720.jpg?VersionId=EEGcARRlFHwiSn_1viYgRpuXESssyQel", "alt_text": null}]}

Total employment, including those on work passes but excluding foreign domestic workers, made the biggest quarterly fall on record.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries of WSG's work this year is Mr Alvin Lim, 48, who was retrenched last year for the fourth time in 12 years, and was still unemployed when his 77-year-old father, a kidney patient, died in February.\n\n\"I was feeling very sad and down about being retrenched. I wondered 'why me again'. And when my father passed away, it added to my emotional stress,\" said Mr Lim, who had been working as a customer operations manager in a global corporate travel agency and was made redundant when the firm consolidated its projects.\n\nThe father of two teenagers had previously worked as a service manager in the semiconductor industry, and tried unsuccessfully to rejoin the industry at the same level.\n\nThrough the help of a career coach and counsellor from WSG, he picked himself up and landed a temporary job manning a government hotline in April this year. However, it was cancelled a few days before he was due to start because the circuit breaker was announced.\n\nThings finally turned around in May when he started work leading a team of surveyors for the Ministry of Manpower. His boss has since extended his contract in recognition of his good performance.\n\nA WSG spokesman said there has been a steady increase in the number of people seeking assistance through its career matching services over the past three years, which have also seen the agency expanding its footprint in Singapore.\n\nBesides physical contact points at WSG's Careers Connect centres in Paya Lebar, Tampines and Woodlands, and the National Trades Union Congress' e2i centres in Jurong East, Toa Payoh and One Marina Boulevard, job seekers can also get help at Careers Connect On-the-Go, which is a truck that roves around Singapore, and more recently, the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres which are being set up in all 24 Housing Board towns.\n\nOnline, the MyCareersFuture.sg portal was launched in April 2018 to use machine learning technology to help job seekers and potential employers more effectively find a good match.\n\nMr Lim's advice to other job seekers is to not be afraid to grab an opportunity.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that contract roles don't help at all. It may be a three-month job but it could lead to something else, you have to take that first step,\" he said.\n\nWHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE RETRENCHED\n\nWorkforce Singapore principal career coach Belinda Boo said that it is natural for people to feel discouraged if they lose a job or are unable to find a suitable one.\n\nWhile acknowledging the emotions they are going through, it is also important for them not to lose hope, as there are still opportunities, she said.\n\nHere are steps she recommends for coping with a retrenchment.\n\n1. Take stock of your skills\n\nDetermine what transferable and marketable skill sets you can offer prospective employers that would help you stand out from other job seekers.\n\n2. Be open to opportunities, be flexible\n\nWhile Covid-19 has negatively affected certain industries, it has also opened pathways and accelerated growth opportunities in areas such as e-commerce, manufacturing, information and communications technology, health and social services, and financial services.\n\nJob seekers, especially those from sectors hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, can consider opportunities in new roles or sectors, or short-term jobs that are in high demand during this period.\n\n3. Seek professional career guidance\n\nIf you are feeling lost or unsure about how to start searching for a job, you can approach career ambassadors or career coaches at WSG's Careers Connect centres and SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres.\n\nCareer coaches provide one-on-one guidance and can advise you on how to tailor your resume to the job you are applying for and prepare for job interviews. They can also lend a listening ear.\n\nCareer ambassadors are stationed at the satellite career centres to provide basic career advice and guidance on the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package.\n\nUltimately, Ms Boo said, the onus is on job seekers to follow through on their career action plan.\n\nSee more on\n\nWorkforce Singapore\n\nEmployment\n\nRetrenchment", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/tl-alvin-ac-300720.jpg?VersionId=3gKFUWuU3tFYpg7QTD9gbM_H.K1p5g8G", "alt_text": null}]}

The boy's life was spared and a ram was slaughtered instead.\n\nMuslims mark the day with prayers and the korban ritual, which involves slaughtering livestock and distributing the meat to the poor.\n\nThis year, the korban will not take place in Singapore. Instead, the slaughter is performed in Australia, and the meat will be chilled and shipped over. Traditionally, one-third goes to the person sponsoring the animal, one-third to family, friends and neighbours, and the rest to the poor.\n\nWhile 65 mosques will be open for Hari Raya Haji prayers this morning, only a total of 8,750 worshippers will be able to attend. Most will hold three sessions, with no more than 50 worshippers - who had to book slots online - each time.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

He was 97.\n\nPresident Tsai Ing-wen, who visited Mr Lee in hospital on Wednesday, described his contribution to Taiwan as \"irreplaceable\" in her condolences to his family.\n\n\"President Tsai believes that former president Lee's contribution to Taiwan's democratisation is irreplaceable, and his passing is (Taiwan's) biggest loss,\" said Secretary-General to the President Su Jia-chyuan, who relayed her message of condolence shortly after Mr Lee's death.\n\nTwo days before his passing, rumours of the former president's death circulated on social media, leading many journalists to camp outside the Taipei Veterans General Hospital, where Mr Lee had been hospitalised.\n\nHe had been in hospice care since early February, after choking on milk at home. He was later diagnosed with pneumonia, and was intubated over the past five months.\n\nDr Hwang Shinn-Jang, one of Mr Lee's physicians, said that the former president suffered from repeated infections during his 174 days in the hospital, but that \"he fought like a warrior for his life\".\n\nHailed locally as the \"Father of Taiwan\" or \"Uncle Ahui\" by his supporters, Mr Lee served as president for 2 \u00bd terms, from 1988 to 2000.\n\nIn 1988, as vice-president, Mr Lee stepped in to fill the seat vacated by the Kuomintang's Chiang Ching-kuo, who died.\n\nHe was reelected president by the National Assembly in 1990.\n\nIn 1996, Mr Lee went on to become the first president to be elected through a democratic vote.\n\nUnlike the majority of the members of the Kuomintang party that followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan after losing the Chinese Civil War, Mr Lee was Taiwanese-born and raised during the Japanese colonial rule.\n\nAfter pursuing his education in Taiwan, Japan and the United States, Mr Lee returned to Taiwan and was taken under Mr Chiang Ching-kuo's wing, becoming the first Taiwanese-born politician in the Chiang family's inner circle.\n\nDuring his 12 years in office, Mr Lee peacefully moved Taiwan towards a free democracy, ending the state of emergency the Kuomintang had imposed in case of conflict with China, amended the Constitution to allow for the direct election of the president and vice-president and had all legislative seats re-elected, to replace the unelected Parliament under the Chiang family.\n\nAnother milestone in Mr Lee's tenure was his Go South initiative, the plan to branch out in Asia and establish trade ties with South-east Asian countries.\n\nBut the initial success of Taiwanese investors fizzled after a series of incidents, such as the 1997 financial crisis, the 1998 anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia and incentives by China that attracted foreign investments, including from Taiwanese businesses who moved their factories to China.\n\nPresident Tsai now has\n\na New Southbound Policy,\n\nencouraging the same Taiwanese businesses to put their eggs in various baskets,\n\nrelying less on China\n\nand moving their operations to other countries in South-east Asia.\n\nMr Lee is survived by Madam Tseng Wen-hui, his wife of 71 years, two daughters and their families.

Chief of staff John Rogers, once an aide to former president Ronald Reagan, was there. So was general counsel Karen Seymour, famous for prosecuting Martha Stewart. Lawyer David Markowitz posed a particular challenge for Malaysia, digging his heels in the most.\n\nOn the other side, Malaysia brought its top lawyers including Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's attorney Rosli Dahlan, as well as secretary-general of Treasury Asri Hamidon and Securities Commission chairman Syed Zaid Albar.\n\nNegotiations dragged on through the week. Long days stretched into night, with hotel staff delivering boxed meals including local rice dishes, in keeping with Covid-19 measures.\n\nThe talks stalled a few times as Malaysia pressed Goldman to cough up more towards the billions the country alleges were siphoned away to buy condos, jewellery and art.\n\nGoldman's investment-banking group, led at the time by now-chief executive officer David Solomon, collected an unusually high US$600 million for its work raising US$6.5 billion from bond sales for the 1MDB fund.\n\nThe bank has consistently denied wrongdoing, saying that former Malaysian officials lied about how the proceeds would be used.\n\nWhen a US$2.2 billion offer was put on the table, Malaysia said it wasn't enough. Yet the two sides kept at it, both highly motivated to reach a deal.\n\nFor Goldman, a Malaysia settlement would go a long way in securing a resolution with the US Department of Justice, which is also probing the 1MDB affair.\n\nAttorney General William Barr is overseeing the case after getting a waiver because his former law firm represents Goldman.\n\nA defeat of President Donald Trump in November elections could upset that plan if there's no settlement by then.\n\nSeveral Goldman bankers have already paid a price for the scandal. Former South-east Asia chairman Tim Leissner pleaded guilty to US charges including conspiracy to launder money.\n\nFormer banker Roger Ng faces similar charges while Andrea Vella, a former co-head of investment banking in Asia, was banned from the industry by the Federal Reserve this year.\n\nThe Goldman side also felt this five-month old Muhyiddin government was easier to deal with than the previous administration, increasing the odds of a settlement.\n\nPrime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin needed to prove his anti-corruption mettle, even while counting on the backing of Umno, a rival party that was in power during the scandal over the fund formally known as 1Malaysia Development Bhd.\n\nWith his razor-thin majority in parliament, Tan Sri Muhyiddin's attacks on corruption could help win allies across the aisle.\n\nAs talks wore on, Goldman proposed a novel solution to break the impasse: A guarantee that Malaysia would get US$1.4 billion from the seizure of missing 1MDB assets.\n\nThe sweetener wasn't dreamed up on the spot: Goldman had the offer in its back pocket all along in case it was needed to reach a deal.\n\nSWEETENED DEAL\n\nAny additional money recovered would go to the country, while Goldman stood ready to bridge any gap.\n\nThe assets, many of which were allegedly purchased using 1MDB funds by fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho, include a penthouse apartment in Manhattan's art deco Walker Tower, a mansion overlooking the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, and an Andy Warhol \"Campbell's Soup Can\" painting worth US$6 million.\n\nThere's a vintage French \"King Kong\" poster, and a 300-foot super yacht named Equanimity, seized off the coast of Bali that has since been sold.\n\nTo seal the deal, Goldman also agreed to boost the cash portion of the settlement to US$2.5 billion, ending five days of marathon talks.\n\nNegotiators put ink to paper late afternoon on July 24.\n\nDEAL WINNERS\n\nIn the end, both sides can at least claim victory with the settlement.\n\nGoldman gets to move on, ending the reputational hit from the scandal and ensuring there are no further legal claims from Malaysia after the nation agreed to drop all criminal charges against the bank and its executives.\n\nThe lender may not have to pay a dime above the US$2.5 billion in cash.\n\nBased on its valuation analysis of the assets, it sees no significant risk exposure from the US$1.4 billion guarantee.\n\nAlready, the Justice Department has seized more than US$1 billion of assets as part of its 1MDB lawsuit.\n\nMalaysia, meanwhile, says the deal is worth more than US$4.5 billion, including the money it already received from the US.\n\nThat's a sizable amount - worth more than 1 per cent of GDP - for a country that stood up to one of Wall Street's iconic banks.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\n1MDB\n\nBanks and financial institutions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-imdb2-30072022.jpg?VersionId=rU5nAAUfPS7wdzrHgDZ1ET4WBgh.t3hy", "alt_text": null}]}

On the back of this, the MAS established the MAS USD Facility on March 26 to lend US dollars to banks in Singapore. Both the swap line and MAS USD Facility have been extended to end-March next year.\n\nSince its launch, the MAS USD Facility has provided about US$22 billion to banks for use in Singapore and the region, MAS said yesterday. As an international financial centre, Singapore plays a key role in intermediating cross-border US dollar funding within Asia.\n\nThe extension of the facility will anchor market confidence and reinforce the stability of Singapore's financial system, MAS added.\n\nFinancial markets have been under strain from the pandemic as travel restrictions and lockdowns hit economies around the world.\n\nThe Fed's network of swap facilities with 14 central banks, including the MAS, has provided a critical backstop for US dollar funding needs globally, and contributed to central banks' efforts to maintain the stability of financial markets.\n\nThese swap facilities will help sustain recent improvements in global US dollar funding markets and provide certainty to market participants that US dollar funding will remain available to meet their needs, said MAS.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Meanwhile, virtual activities - in place of the usual physical contacts - have not adequately fuelled the economy,\" said Mr Budi Sadikin, head of the economic recovery task force in the government's Covid-19 response team.\n\n\"If we continue to remain in (partial) lockdowns, our fiscal space would no longer be sustained,\" he added.\n\nMr Budi's appeal on Wednesday (July 29) comes as it appears the country could be heading for a recession with a second quarter of negative growth. The forecast is for growth in the April to June quarter to be at least minus 3 per cent.\n\nThe government has set aside 695 trillion rupiah (S$66.8 billion), or about 4.2 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, to mitigate the impact of the pandemic which has led to millions of job losses.\n\nDespite struggling to curb the spread of Covid-19, cities and provinces across the sprawling archipelago have gradually eased restrictive measures imposed as part of partial lockdowns. The world's fourth-most populous country, with 270 million people, declared its first infections in early March.\n\nThe overall number of infections in Indonesia totalled 104,432 as of Wednesday,\n\nwith fatalities reaching 4,975.\n\nBoth figures are the highest in South-east Asia.\n\nOffices in the capital of Jakarta started to reopen in the first week of June, with workers put on a staggered roster and going to the office on alternate days. They have also been told to avoid crowding at meal times and in lifts. Shopping malls were also allowed to reopen in mid-June.\n\nBali, Indonesia's tourism hot spot, is due to reopen on Friday to domestic tourists and to foreign tourists possibly on Sept 11. A slew of strict protocols has been put in place, including requiring visitors to show proof that they tested negative for Covid-19. would be required. The planned reopening to foreign tourists is subject to approval from Jakarta.\n\nWhile stressing the need for strict health safeguards, Mr Budi on Wednesday reassured people about going about their normal business.\n\n\"Doctors today know better how to treat patients, so chances of recovery have much improved. They have higher therapeutic standards, health protocol standards and antiviral drugs are widely available,\" he said.\n\n\"A hundred years ago, 100 per cent of dengue patients didn't make it. Today, if we get dengue, we may recover. This is not because of a vaccine, but better therapeutic standards,\" he added.\n\nGovernment data shows the recovery rate of Covid-19 patients in the country rising to above 40 per cent in July, from 37 per cent, 22 per cent, 10 per cent and 4 per cent in the previous four months respectively.\n\nEpidemiologist Pandu Riono, who teaches at the faculty of public health at the University of Indonesia, remained sceptical about encouraging people to enter a \"new normal\", saying that this could only be possible with increased surveillance and strict health protocols - the wearing of a mask, frequent hand washing and social distancing - in place.\n\n\"Key to surveillance is massive testing, contact tracing and isolating cases. We need to have 100,000 tests per day to contain the pandemic. If we don't achieve this, we may still see cases climb next year,\" Dr Pandu told The Straits Times.\n\nBetween 20,000 and 30,000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are currently taken every day.\n\nSee more on\n\nIndonesia\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nInfectious diseases", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-indolfs-30072022.jpg?VersionId=2ENPC5MvkJz6XpoiZyOInnYSo0npXQY2", "alt_text": null}]}

It would also halve the current end-to-end travel time of about five hours by aeroplane.\n\nWith the completion of the RTS Link agreement yesterday, PM Lee said he was optimistic that Singapore and Malaysia could likewise finalise the details for the HSR project by the year end.\n\nFormer Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad had initially wanted to scrap the HSR as part of a review of his country's mega projects, in a bid to trim a RM1 trillion (S$325 billion) national debt.\n\nThe Pakatan Harapan administration later clarified that it wanted to delay the start of construction, as a cancellation would have entailed a high amount of compensation under the HSR agreement.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Borders are likely to open only very slowly in the absence of a vaccine or an effective treatment.\"\n\nThe company will offer a Covid-19 special early retirement scheme to all ground staff and pilots next week. This will be available to those aged 50 and above, with at least 15 years of service, and up to the level of divisional vice-president.\n\nApplications for early retirement will be subject to approval based on organisational and operational requirements. More details will be provided by the human resources division.\n\nMr Goh also told staff to brace for additional staff measures, given the slower growth trajectory and depressed market conditions.\n\n\"We will be engaging our staff unions on this and will announce the measures when they have been firmed up,\" he added.\n\n\"Our immediate priority is to do everything we can to survive this crisis and be ready for the long trudge ahead of us.\"\n\nThe SIA group announced a net loss of $1.12 billion for the first quarter ended June 30, as demand for international air travel and the group's airlines plummeted amid travel restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn his memo to staff, seen by The Straits Times, Mr Goh shared that industry experts, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), have revised downwards their projections for the recovery of global passenger traffic. They now forecast that it will take between two to four years for passenger traffic numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAmid the ongoing border controls and travel restrictions, and without a domestic market to fall back on, the group operated only 5 per cent of its passenger capacity during the April-June 2020 quarter compared to pre-Covid-19 levels.\n\n\"The load factor for that skeletal network was at 10.2 per cent for the quarter, down from 83.4 per cent,\" said Mr Goh. \"We carried a total of only 38,000 customers during those three months - a whopping 99.6 per cent drop from almost 9.4 million a year before.\"\n\nHe said the current view for planning purposes is that the group's passenger capacity will likely be below 50 per cent of its pre-Covid-19 levels by the end of the financial year.\n\nMr Goh added that the group needs to be prepared for \"a long and hard Covid-19 induced winter\".\n\nShares of Singapore Airlines (SIA) fell to their lowest in more than 21 years on Thursday. It tumbled by as much as 5.1 per cent to $3.35, the lowest intraday price since September 1998, before paring to close 3.12 per cent lower at $3.42.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ctsia3007_0.jpg?VersionId=Wo22ZzsMUHohe01AvS_OPT0zDKv7vLGK", "alt_text": null}]}

I wondered 'why me again'. And when my father passed away it added to my emotional stress,\" said Mr Lim, who had lost his job as a customer operations manager in a global corporate travel agency.\n\nThe father of two teenagers had previously worked as a service manager in the semiconductor industry, and tried unsuccessfully to rejoin the industry at the same level.\n\nThrough the help of a career coach and counsellor from WSG, he picked himself up and landed a temporary job manning a government hotline in April this year. However, it was cancelled a few days before he was due to start because the circuit breaker was announced.\n\nThings finally turned around in May when he started work leading a team of people who conduct surveys for the Ministry of Manpower. His boss has since extended his contract in recognition of his good performance.\n\nA WSG spokesman said there has been a steady increase in the number of people seeking assistance through its career-matching services over the past three years, which have also seen the agency expanding its footprint in Singapore.\n\nIts physical contact points include locations in Paya Lebar, Tampines and Woodlands, and more recently, SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres being set up in all 24 Housing Board towns.\n\nOnline, the MyCareersFuture.sg portal was launched in April 2018.\n\nWorkforce Singapore principal career coach Belinda Boo said it is natural for people to feel discouraged if they lose a job or are unable to find a suitable one. But it is also important for them not to lose hope as there are still opportunities, she said.\n\nIf retrenched, she recommends that job seekers see how their skill sets can help them stand out and be open to opportunities in other sectors or job types.\n\nThere are opportunities even during Covid-19, in areas such as e-commerce and health services.\n\nJob seekers can also seek professional career guidance, said Ms Boo.\n\nWSG's Careers Connect centres' career coaches, for instance, can provide one-on-one guidance and give advice on writing a resume and preparing for interviews. They can also lend a listening ear.\n\nUltimately, though, the onus is on job seekers to follow through on their career action plan, she said.\n\nMr Lim, too, said his advice to other job seekers is to not be afraid to grab an opportunity.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that contract roles don't help at all.

Past reports had said the company was estimated to have more than 10,000 customers.\n\nThe company subsequently implemented a \"Gold Inspection\" scheme on Aug 17, 2012, under the direction of its Malaysian directors.\n\nThe new scheme required clients who had previously purchased gold bars from Genneva to deposit their gold bars with the company for inspection.\n\nThe customers were then told that Genneva would return to them an equivalent quantity and purity of gold after a period of time.

And it is a crucial endeavour because Singapore's two hubs, its seaport and Changi Airport, are akin to \"vital organs to the Singapore economic body\".\n\nLike a body's two lungs, they \"oxygenate and vitalise various parts of the body and... add vitality and competitiveness to all sectors of Singapore\", he said.\n\nThis is why the country's hub status is inextricably tied to jobs and its economic competitiveness, he added.\n\nMr Ong further pointed out that investors have two key considerations on whether to set up shop in Singapore. One is whether their products and components can move through Singapore easily, and the other is the ease with which employees and clients can meet in Singapore or travel from here.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

the Minister for Education before last week's Cabinet reshuffle.\n\nIn announcing his new Cabinet, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said the MOT's emphasis in the next few years will shift from improving public transport reliability to envisioning and realising Singapore's post-Covid-19 connectivity by land, sea and air.\n\nPM Lee said he had picked Mr Ong to helm the ministry, given his \"Cabinet experience and political nous\", as part of the job requires engagement with Malaysia and Indonesia on major bilateral projects such as the High-Speed Rail and the Rapid Transit System Link between Johor Baru and Woodlands, as well as sensitive airspace and maritime issues.\n\nYesterday, Mr Ong noted that while the pandemic has affected both sea and airport operations, the impact on the sea port has not been too drastic and he expects PSA Corp to \"still do quite well\" this year.\n\nBut the impact on the aviation sector has been far greater.\n\nIt is in the business of moving people and has consequently been hit hard by the virus.\n\n\"So in the coming weeks, coming months, the top priority is what steps can we take to revive our aviation hub,\" he said, noting that his ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and various ministries are working together to negotiate reciprocal green lanes.\n\nSingapore has made such agreements with China and Malaysia so far, which allow travellers on essential business and official purposes to replace the customary 14-day self-quarantine with measures such as pre-departure swab tests and the submission of detailed itineraries.\n\n\"Going forward, let's hope (we) can negotiate more reciprocal green lanes,\" said Mr Ong.\n\nHe stressed that it is crucial not to take Singapore's status as an aviation hub for granted, as other countries will be vying for the same business when the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic starts showing signs of being brought under control.\n\nWhen that happens, Singapore once again \"needs to be able to fight back, secure and revive its aviation sector while being able to keep (the) transmission level low and maintaining the health of Singaporeans\", he said.\n\n\"This is a key issue that we will have to grapple with in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nOng Ye Kung\n\nAviation/Aerospace sector\n\nMinistry of Transport\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url":

Wait for the announcement on PN. Registration is done,\" a top official said, adding that PAS has been amenable to being a registered member of PN.\n\nSeat negotiations are heating up ahead of expected snap elections aimed at ending political instability stemming from Mr Muhyiddin's narrow parliamentary majority of 113 out of 222 MPs, the slimmest any Malaysian government has had.\n\nUmno, Bersatu and PAS representatives met last week to begin duking out overlapping claims in at least a quarter of constituencies dominated by the Malay majority.\n\nIn Bersatu's view, joining MN would provide a clear platform for these negotiations while still pursuing PN as the flagship coalition to seek a new term for its president, Mr Muhyiddin.\n\nDespite its firm stance against becoming a member of PN, Umno leaders have become more amenable towards an extended reign for Mr Muhyiddin so long as the party's interests are protected.\n\nUmno deputy president Mohamad Hasan said last week that Umno could review the 2016 decision to sack Mr Muhyiddin - a staunch critic of 1MDB while in government - when Najib was president.\n\n\"He (Muhyiddin) will be a Prime Minister backed by the largest party with the most MPs... There will be no problems facing a general election, for example in the aspect of seat allocations,\" he said.\n\nUmno's advisory council chief Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, who is also the party's longest-serving MP, also said \"handicapped leaders\" such as Najib and Zahid who are facing graft charges should make way and sacrifice \"just for awhile, one term is only five years\".\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nUmno\n\nMuhyiddin Yassin\n\nPerikatan Nasional", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-zahidh-30072022.jpg?VersionId=7Zy3T9Vm3xkkkdybyDcmnn12_xmjswIG", "alt_text": null}]}

It will not be costly, as we need to consider the low-income group and daily commuters to make this project viable.\"\n\nThe fares will be announced before operations begin, he added. The project is scheduled for completion in 2026.\n\n\"That's all we can confirm,\" he said.\n\nThe 4km RTS Link will connect Woodlands North MRT station on Singapore's Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) to Bukit Chagar, a planned elevated terminal in Johor Baru.\n\nThe current KTM shuttle train service will cease operations within six months of the RTS Link becoming operational.\n\nBoth countries had acknowledged that there was a need to alleviate traffic congestion at the Causeway, which facilitates about 300,000 crossings daily.\n\nThe RTS Link will continue to feature the co-location of customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) facilities, so that passengers undergo CIQ clearance only once, at their point of departure.\n\n\"If you're a Singaporean commuter, you will only need to get clearance in Woodlands. For Malaysian commuters, you will be cleared at Bukit Chagar,\" he said.\n\nDr Wee added that the journey would only take five minutes each, and during peak hours, trains will be deployed at an interval of 3.6 minutes. This would allow up to 300,000 passengers to be transported per day, as the RTS Link has a capacity of 10,000 commuters.\n\nAt present, it costs S$5 for an MRT ride from Woodlands to Bukit Chagar via KTM, and RM5 for a one-way trip from Bukit Chagar to Woodlands.\n\nThe RTS Link will no longer use the existing TEL Mandai Depot and a new depot will be constructed in Wadi Hana, Johor Baru.\n\nDr Wee said: \"This is a dedicated railway system from Bukit Chagar so for the distance of 4km, it is using the LRT system (which is different from the MRT system used by Singapore at its station). We need a maintenance depot, we need to have a place we can do servicing and maintenance, that's why we choose Malaysia.\n\n\"It will also create 1,000 jobs for the locals. The land acquisition process will continue with the help of the state government and the depot will be jointly owned by Singapore and Malaysia.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a ceremony was held at the Causeway to mark the official resumption of the much-delayed RTS Link project. It was suspended from April 1 last year, at Malaysia's request, to allow some time for the country to review the project.\n\nThe ceremony as Singapore's Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung and Dr Wee marked the resumption of the project was witnessed by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Muhyiddin Yassin.\n\nSingapore will be bearing 61 per cent of the RM10 billion (S$3.25 billion) project cost.\n\nThe ceremony was also attended by Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and former coordinating minister for infrastructure and minister for transport Khaw Boon Wan, on the Singapore side; and Senior Minister and Minister of International Trade and Industry Azmin Ali, Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein and Johor Menteri Besar Hasni Mohammad, on the Malaysia side.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore-Malaysia ties", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-rts-30072022.jpg?VersionId=Q7I6Wh8FLMEpq9P7P3AYOUPe0VOVnnhj", "alt_text": null}]}

It eventually started to default on returning gold to its customers, but continued to operate the scheme and collect gold from its clients.\n\nCourt documents state that as of Sept 30, 2012, Genneva still owed its clients gold worth almost $45 million in total. Past reports had estimated the company to have more than 10,000 customers.\n\nIn mitigation, Kwok's lawyer James Ow Yong said that his client had not benefited from the scheme.\n\nHowever, District Judge Ronald Gwee said Kwok could have acted as a whistle-blower and reduced the losses suffered by the company's clients.\n\nThe judge backdated Kwok's jail term to Feb 22 last year, when he was remanded.\n\nFor his offence, Kwok could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined up to $15,000.\n\nA case against Genneva's former head of transactions Lim Hong Boon, who is also charged with fraudulent trading, is pending.\n\nSee more on\n\nFraud\n\nSingapore crime", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump have not led to concrete programmes.\n\n\"I have seen maybe 10,000 graphs, charts, proposing various ideas about how to get to Mars, for humans,\" adjunct professor G. Scott Hubbard at Stanford, who is also a former senior Nasa official, told AFP.\n\n\"But putting the money behind it to make it a reality has not occurred.\"\n\nThe mission itself would last two or three years.\n\nToday, Mr Elon Musk's SpaceX and Mr Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are building heavy rockets capable of sending tens of tonnes toward Mars.\n\nALONE, AND FAR\n\nFor the seven-month journey, twenty years of living and working in the International Space Station (ISS) has reassured scientists about the dangers posed by radiation and by weightlessness, such as muscle atrophy.\n\nThe body does not emerge unscathed, but the risks are deemed acceptable.\n\nThen there is the stay on Mars itself, which would last 15 months so that the planets are once more on the same side of the Sun.\n\nThe surface temperature will average -63 degrees Celsius, and though radiation is a factor, suits and shelters exist that would shield astronauts.\n\nIn case of medical emergencies, distance would make an evacuation impossible.\n\nWHAT MISHAPS SHOULD ASTRONAUTS ANTICIPATE?\n\nFirst of all fractures, but plaster casts would often suffice, says Dr Dan Buckland, an engineer and emergency room doctor at Duke University, who is developing a robotic intravenous needle with support from Nasa.\n\nDiarrhoea, kidney stones and appendicitis are generally treatable, except for 30 per cent of appendicitis cases which must be operated and could therefore be fatal.\n\nWith extensive screening of astronauts' genetics and family history, you can greatly reduce the probability of having a crew member who develops cancer over the course of a three-year mission.\n\n\"I have not found a showstopper for going to Mars, in terms of a health condition,\" said Dr Buckland.\n\nOne major issue would be protecting the habitats and vehicles from the ravages of the fine dust that covers the surface.\n\n\"Mars is unique in that there's also a concern about dust storms,\" said Dr Robert Howard of the Nasa Johnson Centre.\n\nThese hellish planet-wide tempests can block out the Sun for months, rendering solar panels useless.\n\nSmall nuclear reactors would therefore be needed.\n\nIn 2018, Nasa and the Department of Energy successfully completed a demonstration project, the Kilopower Project.\n\nUltimately, the goal will be to manufacture materials on site using mined resources, probably with 3D printing machines.\n\nDevelopment is embryonic, but the Artemis program will be a testing ground.\n\nCOLONIES?\n\nMr Musk has proposed colonising Mars, with a first expedition to build a factory that converts Martian water and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into oxygen and methane fuel.\n\n\"Becoming a multi-planet species,\" he said in a 2017 speech, \"beats the hell out of being a single-planet species.\"\n\nDr Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society, likewise advocates for the creation of \"new branches of human civilisation\".\n\nThat no progress has been made since humanity last walked on the Moon in 1972 is, to him, shameful.\n\n\"It was as if Columbus had come back from the New World the first time and then (king and queen) Ferdinand and Isabella had said, 'so what, we're not interested,'\" he said.\n\nNot everyone is convinced.\n\n\"Enough of the nonsense!\" said exobiologist Michel Viso from CNES, the French space agency.\n\n\"We have an amazing planet with an atmosphere, with oxygen, with water... It's criminal, you don't have the right to fool people into thinking there is a 'Plan B', a 'Planet B', that we will have a Martian civilisation.\"\n\nWhether humanity installs a colony or permanent bases, the most important obstacle, for a lasting human presence on Mars, will be to convince people to accept a higher level of risk than for the Moon or the ISS, argues Dr Buckland.\n\nIn the long run, not everyone will return.\n\nSee more on\n\nSpace and cosmos\n\nNasa", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/tl-artemis-a-300720.jpg?VersionId=2Eb3hE8Abd4Jf2i5pmhKZhwC0Og4Oez6", "alt_text": null}]}

Athletes and the IOC family may require testing before/after entering Japan and (we need) strong medical systems around accommodation and transportation plans,\" he added.\n\nJapan currently bans visitors from more than 100 countries in a bid to limit the spread of the virus and Muto said it was \"too optimistic to assume all restrictions will be gone, so we must think of other ways.\" With just under a year to go until the postponed Games, Japanese citizens have expressed scepticism about whether the Olympics can or should be held.\n\nTwo polls in July found the majority of Japanese think the Games should be postponed again or cancelled altogether.\n\nAnd several medical experts have suggested the Games will not be viable without a proven treatment or vaccine for the virus.\n\nMuto said a vaccine would be \"a benefit...

The RTS, for example, will now be a light rail transit (LRT) system.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post yesterday evening that the RTS Link would improve connectivity and ease congestion along the Causeway when it is ready.\n\n\"So it was apt that we marked this milestone with a bilateral ceremony at the Causeway, which has connected our two countries for almost a hundred years.\"\n\nPM Lee, along with Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, witnessed the ceremony at which Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung and his Malaysian counterpart Wee Ka Siong marked the official resumption of the project.\n\nThe 4km line, previously slated to be operational by end-2024, will connect passengers between Johor's Bukit Chagar terminus station and the Singapore terminus in Woodlands North. The Customs, immigration and quarantine facilities will be co-located so passengers have to clear immigration only once, at the point of departure.\n\nBoth countries also reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring the rail link is well-integrated with local transport networks. The Singapore terminus is at Woodlands North on the Thomson-East Coast (TEL) MRT Line, which will serve 32 stations from Woodlands to Bedok by 2024.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

As a result, the RTS Link will no longer use the existing TEL depot at Mandai. A new depot will be built in Wadi Hana, Johor Baru. The cross-border link's capacity remains unchanged at up to 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction.\n\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Transport said that the project would use an LRT system similar to that of a medium-capacity MRT system in Singapore and it would be capable of meeting the peak capacity of 10,000 passengers an hour, in each direction.\n\nSeparately, Malaysia has changed its infrastructure company (InfraCo) to a wholly owned subsidiary of Mass Rapid Transit Corporation. The Land Transport Authority remains as Singapore's InfraCo.\n\nThe rail link is expected to bring relief to the Causeway, which 300,000 people used to cross daily before the pandemic struck.\n\nThe signing turns the page on a project which was agreed to by leaders of both countries a decade ago, but has seen several delays.\n\nBoth countries signed a binding agreement to build the link in January 2018, but key project deadlines were missed after the Pakatan Harapan coalition led by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad came to power in Malaysia less than five months later.\n\nThe deadline to come to new terms was subsequently pushed back four times at the request of Malaysia. The last suspension, to the end of this month, was due to factors such as Covid-19 and Malaysia's change of government.\n\nAsked if he was confident that the RTS Link would begin ferrying commuters by 2026, Mr Ong said: \"We work with whatever government is in charge and we also, as a country, deeply respect and abide by the agreements (we sign) and I'm sure our partner countries are the same.\"\n\nPM Lee said in his Facebook post: \"The pandemic has shown how deeply entwined our two countries are.

Last November, Malaysia proposed amending the scope and structure of the project to cut costs by 36 per cent.\n\nThe experts agree that having the depot in Malaysia instead of Singapore would mean lower costs, including land acquisition and labour costs.\n\nProfessor Lee said having a new depot in Wadi Hana could be the most feasible solution. As the RTS Link will have different rolling stock from the TEL, the operation system would be incompatible with it in terms of the signalling and power systems, he said.\n\nIn terms of commuter experience, Assistant Professor Raymond Ong from NUS said some people might have the misconception that the LRT system the RTS will use is similar to the Bukit Panjang LRT, which is much smaller than the MRT and has been saddled with reliability issues.\n\nThe LRT used in the RTS Link should be similar to the LRT system used in the Ampang Line in Klang Valley, said Prof Ong. This has a similar capacity to the Thomson-East Coast Line, but runs at a slower speed.\n\nThe line is now slated to begin operating by end-2026, instead of by the end of 2024.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nMRT\n\nRailways", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/nz_rts_310724.jpg?VersionId=8xCLlrQvR6YwjNzV4LFtOrAwYyl9iMuZ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

And Japan could face financial penalties if it pulls out if its contract with Lockheed Martin.\n\n\"We are looking at the various options available to us,\" a Defence Ministry spokesman said.\n\nA key battle for the two companies will be winning the support of former defence ministers and deputy ministers, who as early as next month will make recommendations to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThat group, led by former defence minister Itsunori Onodera, was formed in June after current defence chief Taro Kono suspended the Aegis Ashore plan.\n\nIt will weigh in on missile defence and possibly propose that Japan acquire strike weapons for that mission, Japanese officials have said.\n\nJapan under Mr Abe has beefed up its military with stealth fighters designed to fly off carriers, longer-range missiles, new amphibious units and stronger air defences meant to deter threats from neighbours, including North Korea and China.\n\nMr Kono said he ordered the Aegis sites relocated because rocket boosters that accelerate interceptor missiles into space could fall on residents.\n\nBut concern over mounting costs was the main reason for that decision, according to the three sources.\n\nChina is rapidly expanding and improving its ballistic missile arsenal, and in 2017 North Korea tested a missile that flew over the Japanese island of Hokkaido.\n\nWith around three times the range of radars currently used by Japan, both SPY-6 and SPY-7 would greatly enhance Japan's ability to detect multiple attacks.\n\nOne option for Japan that would avoid any political fallout would be to buy both radars, using SPY-6 on Aegis ships and deploying Lockheed's SPY-7 as an early warning radar, one of the sources said.\n\nCHOICE\n\nMr Onodera's backing would make that change more likely because he approved the Lockheed Aegis radar acquisition two years ago.\n\nAt the time, he was unaware that testing in Hawaii could add at least US$500 million to Aegis Ashore's US$4 billion budget, separate sources told Reuters last year.\n\nIn an interview in the Asahi newspaper on Thursday, Mr Onodera said the \"ideal option\" for Japan would be to find a safe ground-based location. He also noted that building Aegis ships would cost both money and manpower.\n\nMr Onodera's office declined an interview request, but one source familiar with his position on the radars described him as \"flexible\".\n\nMr Masahisa Sato, a former deputy defence minister who also served as a deputy minister of foreign affairs, said Japan's choice is between SPY-7 at new sites, with the missile launchers deployed elsewhere, or building Aegis ships equipped with SPY-6.\n\n\"I am recommending an increase in Aegis ships,\" he said.\n\n\"SPY-7 is under development and there is a question about how it would perform in a new configuration,\" Mr Sato added.\n\nLockheed Martin said its system could be adapted to ships, and disputed questions about performance.\n\n\"SPY-7 radar is the most advanced radar in the world today and we believe it is the best solution for Japan's defence needs,\" the company said in an e-mail.\n\nFor its part, Raytheon said the SPY-6 will be deployed on 50 US Navy ships, calling it the \"most advanced radar technology in production today\".\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nArms and weapons\n\nDefence and military", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/tl-jap-r-300720.jpg?VersionId=QtOxjdDqKYVuBykHw9WRU4Oc62FPwMPH", "alt_text": null}]}

Sompura designed a temple for Lord Ram for the city of Ayodhya in the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nTogether with Mr Ashok Singhal, leader of the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) who had contacted him and who has since died, Mr Sompura travelled to Ayodhya to map the land, which was at the heart of a centuries-old dispute between Hindu and Muslim groups.\n\nThe design was in place well before the bitter land dispute was resolved and before a Hindu mob destroyed the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque, at the site, triggering communal riots in which more than 2,000 people were killed.\n\nNow construction of the temple, based on Mr Sompura's design, is set to start, nine months after the Supreme Court handed over the disputed land to Hindu groups and asked the federal and Uttar Pradesh state government to provide alternate land of five acres to Muslims groups in Ayodhya.\n\nOn Aug 5, a Bhumi Pujan - a ritual that is performed before construction can begin - will take place at Ayodhya.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to be among 200 people who will take part in the ritual, capping a core promise of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to its Hindu supporters to build the temple.\n\nMr Sompura's design from 30 years ago has remained, except for the size of the temple.\n\n\"Everyone feels the area where the darshan (the act of seeing the deity) takes place is small. After 30 years, the population has increased too much, there has been so much media coverage of the Ram mandir (temple) and the footfall of people will be much more than in 1990,\" said Mr Sompura's son, architect Ashish Sompura.\n\n\"So we all have decided to do a new floor area. We don't want to change the original design as people have been imaging that model for 30 years.\"\n\nHe is working with his father to update the design, with two additional domes for a total of five, and a floor area of 30,000 sq ft.\n\nIn 1990, he said, his father had designed the temple to accommodate 30,000 to 60,000 worshippers per day. Now they expect 80,000 to 100,000 people every day.\n\n\"We also studied the most-visited temples of India like the Golden Temple, Somnath temple and Tirupati and the daily footfalls before we decided this is the area we want.\"\n\nMr Sompura, whose father's portfolio includes design of the Shiv Temple in Singapore, said the temple will be built entirely of pink sandstone and will take 3\u00bd years to complete.\n\nSo far, construction of the mosque at an alternate site has not started.\n\nThe Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board on Wednesday announced the formation of a trust to oversee the construction of the mosque at an alternate site in Ayodhya. Land has been given by the government in Dhannipur village, 24km from the original site, in Ayodhya.\n\nThe BJP came to national prominence after Hindu hardliners razed the mosque on Dec 6, 1992, plunging the country into months of communal rioting. Anti-Hindu protests over the incident took place in Pakistan, Bangladesh and elsewhere at the time.\n\nA case is still ongoing against VHP and BJP party leaders for the conspiracy to demolish the mosque.\n\nThe beginning of construction, said political analysts, would also be a reprieve for Mr Modi, who is battling the twin challenges of the surging coronavirus cases and the ailing economy.\n\n\"It's an opportunity to talk about something besides Covid-19,\" said political analyst Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay.\n\nHe said the Ram temple was part of a wider platform of the BJP to promote \"religio-cultural nationalism\", whereby the mix of religion and culture is held up as the epitome of India. \"Anybody who raises an obstacle is anti-India,\" he said.\n\nThe construction of the temple has been used as a political tool by the BJP to consolidate Hindu votes in parts of northern India.\n\nStill, the beginning of construction during a pandemic has attracted criticism from some political opponents. India has more than 1.5 million coronavirus cases, with numbers continuing to climb.\n\nAccusing the BJP of using the Ram Temple as electioneering, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said in an interview published in his party Shiv Sena mouthpiece, Saamana, on Sunday that the ground-breaking ceremony could be held through video-conference.\n\n\"This is an event of joy,\" he said. \"Will we allow the spread of coronavirus?\"\n\nAll India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi also urged Mr Modi not to attend the ceremony in his official capacity but as a private citizen, noting that a \"message will go in the country that the PM is supporting people of one faith only\".\n\nThe BJP has dismissed all criticism from the opposition.\n\n\"These comments by various opposition leaders are uncalled for, because the Prime Minister has attended several religious functions, not just of the Hindu faith in the past also. To draw the Ram temple into a political discourse is neither desirable nor necessary,\" said BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli.\n\nSee more on\n\nIndia\n\nTemples", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-indtemple-30072022.jpg?VersionId=1UTeGHnwJcdIKZBdaEq3RTLM7a3nwe0_", "alt_text": null}]}

She told him to delete the video and he formatted his phone and erased all data.\n\nOn Feb 11 last year, Hoon pleaded guilty to a charge of insulting a woman's modesty .\n\nVarious reports were called and he was found suitable for probation.\n\nOn Dec 19 last year, a district judge ordered him to be detained in prison for 14 days and to perform 130 hours of community service.\n\nThe prosecution filed an appeal against sentence the next day.\n\nOn Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Terence Chua argued that a community-based sentence was not justified for an adult who committed a premeditated and \"highly intrusive\" sexual offence.\n\nHe said the incident left an indelible mark on the victim, who is now fearful when using a public toilet.\n\nHoon's lawyer, Mr Mark Lee, argued that a short detention order carries a punitive and deterrent element.\n\nJustice Tay said that Hoon's behaviour was more opportunistic than premeditated, when compared to a past case in which the offender installed a mini-camera on his shoe to take upskirt videos and planted a hidden camera in the toilet.\n\nHoon started serving his detention after the hearing.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts\n\nOutrage of modesty/Insulting modesty", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/af_smu_300720.jpg?VersionId=YloS1idyaEb7a0bLqtVgcpL.RSnrO_Rg", "alt_text": null}]}

Therefore, we always have to be vigilant and minimise the risk of transmission.\"\n\nOther than having a robust and resilient healthcare system, preventive steps to protect citizens from Covid-19 are just as paramount, Dr Phua stressed.\n\nA comprehensive public education system and compliance from the public when it comes to guidelines like mask wearing and safe distancing are critical in slowing the spread of the virus, Dr Phua said.\n\n\"A good public health system should not only inform people to keep to the spirit of the rules, but also have a thorough enforcement system to catch recalcitrant offenders.\"\n\nPost-pandemic, an examination would be needed of how Singapore should allocate the use of its healthcare facilities, said Prof Lim.\n\n\"Do we have enough surge capacity? What should our planning parameters be? There is a cost to carrying excess capacity in peacetime and we only appreciate and thank our lucky stars we have these in times of crisis,\" he noted.\n\nOn the international front, Singapore should also be ready to contribute as a responsible member of the global community to capacity building in other countries that need support, and share its expertise and lessons generously, he added.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus\n\nMinistry of Health", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/st_20200731_tgicu31_58552882.jpg?VersionId=A34MFPim9RCyVnRjsqJrJr0LXpDsOzBM", "alt_text": "Healthcare workers preparing to transfer a suspected Covid-19 patient at a Singapore General Hospital isolation room.

This work, adapted from the 2011 Japanese novel of the same name and starring Jeon Do-yeon , is as slick and accomplished as they come.\n\nThis belongs to the canon of noirish works in which everyone is rotten and the only difference is by how much. In a series of chapters that deal with different timelines and characters, eight persons become involved with a bag of money. As their relationships with one another become clearer, events get bloodier.\n\nKorean thrillers can be just as violent as Western ones, but they also go where Hollywood fears to tread, such as in scenes showing men beating and torturing women. These can be discomfiting to watch, but writer-director Kim Yong-hoon, making his feature debut, intends to make a point about the world in which his characters live. The realistic cruelty, extravagant violence and graphic novel-style black humour come together seamlessly.\n\nWHERE:\n\nThe Projector, Level 5 Golden Mile Tower, 6001 Beach Road MRT: Nicoll Highway\n\nWHEN:\n\nNow showing\n\nADMISSION:\n\n$13.50\n\nINFO:\n\ntheprojector.sg\n\nTHE KINGMAKER (PG13)\n\n101 minutes/The Projector/4.5 Stars\n\nThis documentary opens with Mrs Imelda Marcos, former first lady of the Philippines, handing out cash to the beggars of Manila, clucking with concern.\n\nThat act of minor munificence - when contrasted with the billions she and her late husband Ferdinand Marcos plundered from the treasury and thereby helping create beggars - is infuriating.

That caused it to overestimate the size of the quake and trigger the alert. The warning was issued to Tokyo and 14 other prefectures - areas that account for about half of Japan's total population of 126 million - and halted trains and subway lines in the capital for hours.\n\nThe quake was far enough from shore that no shaking was felt in Tokyo or the surrounding regions.\n\nJapan's early warning system is designed to issue alerts when an earthquake is first detected. When a temblor of a certain size is detected, warnings are issued to smartphones, TV networks and factory lines, and trains are automatically halted, to give people time to prepare before more damaging secondary-waves strike.\n\nSmartphones in Japan generally have the alert enabled by default, which will override mute settings with a loud warning noise. Tokyo residents, who have long expected the arrival of the \"Big One\" - a quake directly hitting the capital area - are also on edge due to the growing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe alert is fully automated. A network of seismographs spans the country, measuring the initial P-waves when an earthquake strikes. Computers then collate the data and issue estimates of the potential size and likely location of the quake.\n\n\"There are many examples of where the alert has been helpful in the past, but these incidents reduce trust in the system,\" a JMA official said at a briefing to explain the alert.\n\nThe system has issued false alarms before. In 2018 an alert was triggered when the system mistook two smaller quakes for one larger one, while in 2016 some operators mistakenly warned of a magnitude 9 quake that had struck Tokyo Bay.\n\nSee more on\n\nJapan\n\nEarthquakes\n\nNatural disasters", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-tokyoquake-30072022.jpg?VersionId=4CkmQNhhsmPcx4IXBBGnjLaLn4ba47by", "alt_text": null}]}

The stock, which has declined by almost half this year, was among the worst performers on Thursday on a Bloomberg gauge of carriers in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nAir traffic the world over has plunged because the pandemic led to tight border controls and a reluctance to travel. The International Air Transport Association said on Tuesday the airline industry is unlikely to recover fully before 2024. The situation is particularly difficult for carriers like Singapore Airlines that have no domestic market to cushion the blow.\n\nSIA's net loss in the three months through June was $1.12 billion, compared with net income of $111 million a year earlier. Sales dropped 79 per cent to $851 million, and traffic measured by revenue passenger per kilometre sank 99.5 per cent.\n\nCGS-CIMB analyst Raymond Yap cut his recommendation on SIA to hold from add following the results. He has a $3.55 price target on the stock.\n\nSIA said on Wednesday its passenger capacity still may be less than half of pre-coronavirus levels by the end of its fiscal year next March.\n\nThe airline also said it is reviewing its network to determine the size and mix of its fleet over the longer term. The review, which should be completed by the end of this quarter, could lead to a material impairment of about $1 billion on the carrying values of older generation aircraft, particularly Airbus SE A380s, SIA said.\n\nThe carrier's fuel hedging policy led to a $535 million loss in the quarter, while there was also a $127 million hit from the liquidation of NokScoot Airlines. SIA owned a 49 per cent stake in the low-cost Thai carrier that collapsed in June.\n\nSIA was operating only to 24 cities by the end of June. Its SilkAir unit ceased most operations except for flights to Chongqing, China, and it suspended flights to the Thai resort island of Koh Samui. Low-cost unit Scoot operated a minimal network to cities such as Hong Kong and Perth.\n\nPassenger capacity at the end of the second quarter is forecast to be about 7 per cent of the level before Covid-19. Out of a fleet of 213 passenger aircraft, only 32 are being deployed, the airline said.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nStocks and shares\n\nCompany results", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/af_sia_300720.jpg?VersionId=azGklNeGH1N1A44Vh4BrzvX36YWmtVe_", "alt_text": null}]}

A mysterious, swoon-worthy American-Chinese man sending expensive gifts from abroad. And closer to home: the promise of undying love after a romantic, whirlwind proposal from an eligible Malaysian bachelor.\n\nThese are not cliches from soap operas, but stories of profiles carefully crafted by online scammers to trick gullible women into parting with not only months of their time and affection, but also their money.\n\nWhat these cases also have in common is that they were all cracked by the Singapore Police Force's Anti-Scam Centre (ASC) - which has handled more than 8,600 scam reports in the one year since its establishment.\n\nThe ASC has also frozen more than 6,100 bank accounts and recovered more than $21.2 million that scammers based both locally and internationally might have otherwise made off with.\n\nThis amount recovered is equivalent to around 40 per cent of some $52 million in funds that scammers attempted to pilfer in the cases that the ASC has handled since it started operating on June 18, 2019.\n\nThe remaining 60 per cent of funds has not been recovered.\n\n\"These results affirm the close partnership between the police and our stakeholders, and that fighting scams is a community effort,\" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Aileen Yap, assistant director of the specialised commercial crime division at the Commercial Affairs Department.\n\nSome of the methods ASC has used to stop scammers in their tracks include an automated system that can log and transmit information on scams and scammers in real time, coupled with its cooperation with banks to promptly freeze accounts and retrieve bank account holders' particulars whenever unusual transactions are detected.\n\nThis network of 11 banks that the ASC works with includes DBS, OCBC and United Overseas Bank. The help of banks resulted in the centre being able to nab a 39-year-old man involved in a massive e-commerce scam in mid-March, that involved the bogus sale of surgical masks and hand sanitisers.\n\nThe scam involved a French pharmaceutical company that was deceived into transferring around \u20ac6.64 million (S$10.7 million) to a Singapore bank account to pay for a large shipment of surgical masks and hand sanitisers.\n\nThe ASC managed to retrieve more than $6.4 million worth of funds on the same day, its biggest recovery so far.\n\nAround $5.3 million worth of scammed monies were recovered by UOB, which was alerted to the transaction at around 7am on March 14. Within minutes, the bank managed to trace and freeze the scammer's account.\n\nMr Richard Soh, head of investigation at UOB's integrated fraud management department, said that scammers now pose a bigger threat, as they have developed sophisticated methods to both conduct the scam and cover their tracks.\n\nFor instance, one syndicate might have multiple accounts to withdraw money from and various money outflows, making them harder to detect.\n\n\"As much as the information we gather from the police is valuable, we also try to go further within a limited period of time to establish the network of scammers.\n\n\"We also use technology on our end to pinpoint scammers in a timely way - and we rely greatly as well on the experience of our team to investigate these financial crimes,\" said Mr Soh.\n\nThe agency also works to intercept and disrupt scammers by collaborating with telcos like Singtel, StarHub, and M1 to terminate mobile lines, with 1,500 local lines suspected to be used by scammers being terminated between January and June this year.\n\nAs for love scams, the ASC has also managed on multiple occasions to foil some within a day of the cases coming to its attention.\n\nAn example was a case involving three women that the ASC was alerted to on June 17 this year.\n\nTwo of the women - a 58-year-old known as Ms Tan and a 50-year-old known as Ms Lim - were attempting to transfer $3,500 and $2,300 respectively to help their online lovers pay off \"customs charges\" for the gifts they were supposedly being sent.\n\nMs Tan thought that she was receiving a present from abroad from an American-born Chinese online lover, but it was really a scammer using pictures of a Korean man that were stolen off a public Instagram profile.\n\nA 38-year-old woman known as Ms Koh had also been duped into being a money mule for the same syndicate - receiving and transferring monies on behalf of the scammers.\n\nMs Koh ended up remitting around $5,300, that had been deposited into her account from unknown sources, to an overseas bank account on behalf of the scammer.\n\nShe was convinced that she was helping to accept and transfer money to her \"Korean doctor boyfriend\" working in a Malaysian hospital and in urgent need of money due to various fictitious mishaps during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe ASC managed to recover the $2,300 transferred by Ms Lim, and also managed to talk the other women out of giving the scammers more cash.\n\nThough the case was cracked within a day, the time and energy involved in the months that scammers set aside just to cultivate these false personas and deepen their bogus relationships with their victims represents a shift in potential scam tactics that could be studied, said the ASC's investigators.\n\n\"Moving forward, the ASC will continue to strengthen our detection capabilities, as well as enhance our collaboration with more stakeholders and foreign law enforcement agencies, to disrupt scammers' operations and mitigate victims' losses,\" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Yap said.\n\nSee more on\n\nPolice\n\nScams", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/af_antiscam_300720_0.jpg?VersionId=eXZubK8OdfHN2kUauGHkZIlOwvg6qTly", "alt_text": null}]}

It did just that - and still earned US$5.2 billion, double its net income from a year prior.\n\nMr Jeff Bezos, who founded the company in July 1994 and is the world's richest person, said in a statement: \"This was another highly unusual quarter.\"\n\nAmazon's shares have risen by more than 60 per cent this year, adding to the wealth of Mr Bezos, its biggest stockholder.

Meanwhile, merchants paid Amazon more to fulfil and sponsor their products in order to reach the company's loyal customers. That resulted in a 52 per cent and 41 per cent jump in seller services revenue and other revenue such as from ads, respectively.\n\nAmazon's cloud services also saw higher demand as companies switched to virtual offices in the pandemic. Revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which sells data storage and computing power in the cloud, rose nearly 29 per cent to US$10.81 billion.\n\nStill, that fell just short of analysts' estimates of US$10.95 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The cloud business of rival Alphabet's Google meanwhile was up over 43 per cent year over year.\n\nTechnology analyst Patrick Moorhead said: \"AWS continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate than last quarter.\"\n\n'EVERYONE WAS BUYING GROCERIES'\n\nMr Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, told reporters that the outsized profit surprised the company because at the time it issued its forecast last quarter, shoppers were buying lower-margin products.\n\n\"Everyone was looking for masks; everyone was looking for gloves; everyone was buying groceries online. That mix is not super profitable,\" he said.\n\n\"What we saw in Q2 was not only did the mix start to shift back to a more normal mix\" but that \"we also were able to ship a lot more than we had originally thought.\"\n\nAmazon also posted a rare operating profit in its international business, which Mr Olsavsky attributed to a step up in customer spending in Europe and Japan during the pandemic.\n\nThe company forecast net sales of US$87 billion to US$93 billion for the third quarter, ahead of analysts' expectations of US$86.34 billion, according to IBES data.\n\nMr Olsavsky said that Prime Day, the company's lucrative summer marketing blitz, would be pushed back to the fourth quarter, excluding its business in India. He also said that per usual the current quarter would see higher costs as the company gears up for the holiday season, even more pronounced now due to higher-than-usual sales.\n\nStill, Amazon anticipates operating profit between US$2 billion and US$5 billion for the quarter, the midpoint of which is higher than analysts were expecting, according to research firm FactSet.\n\nSee more on\n\nAmazon\n\nCompany results\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/31/2020-07-27t034830z_173779744_rc2f1i9yrysx_rtrmadp_3_amazon-com-results.jpg?VersionId=Rh8wAO6XCnfa.26ORgpGGMoHtC7ZYsdJ", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

In this case, though, they lead to Riyadh. Or so it seems. The many arguments of the accused relate to the crux of the defence, which is that his belief and state of knowledge of his accounts and their operations is premised on the alleged Arab donation monies,\" Mr Nazlan said.\n\nNajib, as the first defence witness, had testified that the late King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia had pledged his support to Malaysia during a meeting in early 2010 as the basis of his belief.\n\n\"Importantly, it should be immediately realised, however, that King Abdullah did not articulate the form of the support.\n\n\"In other words, according to the testimony of the accused, King Abdullah did not mention any intention to provide any financial support or donation of monies to the accused. Or to Malaysia,\" Justice Nazlan said.\n\nThe court opined that it was common to read about a leader of an independent country expressing support for the leadership of another in international relations and alliance diplomacy.\n\nThe judge said there were many problems with Najib's testimony.\n\n\"First, the accused did not say he directly heard from, or was personally informed by, the Saudi monarch about the cash donation.\n\n\"Secondly, there was no evidence of the accused attempting to verify this intention attributed to King Abdullah with anyone. Not with the King directly, nor with any of the government officials who could have easily checked to verify the information for the prime minister.\n\n\"There was, thirdly, no evidence if the intended donation would be accompanied by any conditions of use, either. None whatsoever. The accused merely took the word of (fugitive businessman) Low Taek Jho,\" the judge said.\n\nThe court found that regardless of Low's influence within segments of the Arab royalty and Najib's confidence in Low, the accused failed to ensure official confirmation of the intended donations from King Abdullah. This, the judge said, shows Najib's belief that it would have been most improbable the donations were gifted by King Abdullah.\n\n\"In other words, the accused held no such belief,\" he said.\n\nJustice Nazlan also said the claim that King Abdullah wished to make a personal donation to the accused, who is a leader of another country, and for this donation to be paid into the latter's personal bank account appeared \"unusual\" in international relations, even at the personal level between leaders of different countries.\n\nHe said there has been a total absence of any official governmental confirmation - both from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Malaysia - that the accused, as the prime minister, had received the donation in his personal account from King Abdullah during the relevant period.\n\nJustice Nazlan said there was no contact between the true donor and accused before or after the arrival of the funds.\n\n\"Evidence in the form of bank statements of the accused accounts point irresistibly to the true reason for the remittances, which also establishes why the funds could not have been donations.\n\n\"This is because the funds would suddenly appear - as if on fortunate episodes of fortuity and serendipity - in the personal accounts of the accused at the exact moment it was needed, usually when the account balance was very low,\" he added.\n\nJustice Nazlan said Najib's defence was unsustainable because it was wholly contrived.\n\n\"This defence on the knowledge which is premised on the belief of the accused on the alleged Arab donation monies simply cannot hold water.\n\n\"It is very difficult not to characterise the entire narrative of the defence of the 'Arab donation' as a poorly orchestrated self-serving evidence,\" he said.\n\nJustice Nazlan added the defence's contention that the accused had a bona fide belief of the purported Arab donations arriving in 2014 did not pass the threshold of evidential support, basic logic and common sense.\n\nJustice Nazlan delivered the guilty verdict, which was read over two hours, on Tuesday.\n\nNajib was sentenced to 12 years in jail and fined RM210 million in default of five years jail for all seven charges in the case.

Meanwhile, our associates are pushing ahead with their digital transformation to navigate the uncertainties and position themselves for a digital-led recovery.\"\n\nThe company also reassured investors that its network and operations remain resilient, despite earlier workforce and supply-chain disruptions from the pandemic.\n\nFor instance, handset shipments to Singapore have recovered from delays at the start of the outbreak, while resources in Singapore and Australia helped to ease a labour crunch when lockdowns in Malaysia, India and the Philippines affected offshore service centres, Singtel said.\n\nThe company also reiterated its stance on financial prudence at the AGM, citing both Covid-19-related uncertainties, as well as the need to invest in 5G wireless technology, which it billed \"a multi-year investment programme for long-term growth\".\n\nSingtel recently clinched a licence to build and run a nationwide 5G network in Singapore, with the rollout expected to begin from 2021.\n\nWhile the telco does not expect 5G to be a key driver of returns in the near term, it still anticipates new revenue opportunities in the longer run, from consumer applications such as cloud gaming, and enterprise applications such as edge computing.\n\n\"We expect that the industry will see more rational pricing decisions to enable acceptable returns and continued network investments,\" it said of the Singapore market.\n\nSeparately, key Singtel associate Bharti Airtel posted a loss of 151.9 billion rupees (S$2.79 billion) for the three months to June 30, on the back of exceptional items such as adjusted tax charges and provisions for network-related fees owed to the Indian government.\n\nIn all, India-based Airtel clocked 155 billion rupees in exceptional charges for the quarter, after taxes and minority interests, with Singtel's equity share of this coming to $911 million.\n\nSingtel will disclose its share of its regional associates' results - including Airtel's - in August 2020, the group added in another bourse update on Wednesday.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingtel\n\nDividends\n\nCompany results", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/nz_singtel_300770.jpg?VersionId=TGwfpcxZYb6QN8Vptt2BBQBRUle310HW", "alt_text": null}]}

Another told me that he now has a closer relationship with his father because they have a chat over a glass of wine each night.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has fundamentally changed many aspects of liquor consumption in China, having created a new environment for drinking and shifted sales from offline to online.\n\nIn the year's first half, China imported and produced less liquor than during the same period last year, but the country's producers and distributors expect sales to rebound in the second six months.\n\nMr Lu said there have been many changes because alcohol, which used to be drunk mainly at restaurants, has been consumed more often at home in the past six months.\n\n\"At business dinners, big brands are preferred, but when drinking at home, people opt for wine that is a good value,\" he said.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the red wine Caperucita Tinta has been one of the most popular in China, selling for 88 yuan (S$17) a bottle in many places. Produced in the Spanish city of Valencia, it is known in Chinese as Xiao Hong Mao - a reference to the red hoodie on the label.\n\nMr Luan Dawei, 47, general manager of wine sales company Jiashijiu, which has been importing Caperucita Tinta for five years, said three million bottles have been sold in China so far this year.\n\nHe believes a key reason for the wine's popularity is that it is \"light-bodied and juicy\", making it easy to drink. The distinctive label is also a standout feature.\n\nMr Luan's team has placed the wine in more than 100,000 stores across China, and it has also appeared in films. He expects 10 million bottles of Caperucita Tinta be sold in the country this year.\n\nHe said: \"This wine sells well on the Internet, because the pandemic has stopped face-to-face recommendation in restaurants and stores.\"\n\nAccording to the China Chamber of Commerce of Import and Export of Foodstuffs, Native Produce and Animal By-products, in the first five months of this year, the country imported 478 billion litres of liquor, a year-on-year fall of about 30 per cent.\n\nBeverage purchasing specialist Han Liwen from Freshippo, Alibaba's online-to-offline grocery chain, said sales of liquor priced at 200 yuan to 400 yuan a bottle have risen significantly since the outbreak started, in contrast to an overall market decline.\n\nMr Jiao Guoqiang, general manager of COFCO W&W International, said: \"We have broadened our online platforms to sell more wines and are using additional personnel.\n\n\"Before the pandemic, we only focused on JD and Tmall. Now, we are opening stores on Suning, Pinduoduo and NetEase.\"\n\nMr Jiao said that since May, the company has hosted a series of livestreaming shows on the JD and Douyin platforms in conjunction with tastings at its 50-plus stores nationwide. By last month, the shows had been watched more than 1.7 million times.\n\n\"We have introduced wine courses to the livestreaming shows, and customers have welcomed them,\" he said. \"Before the pandemic, clients may have objected to tasting classes being held with a wine master talking on screen, but now they readily accept this.\"\n\nMr Jiao said the market started to recover in May, with the company's sales rising by 100 per cent from the previous month. He is confident about the second half of this year, as he feels that linked online and offline marketing will attract more customers.\n\n\"We are planning to organise 100 livestreaming shows this year,\" he said.\n\nMr Lu, the wine specialist, said: \"Liquor purchasing is mostly based on trust. Once customers trust online platforms, they will get used to this form of buying.\"\n\nBut he still prefers to drink with friends while dining at restaurants, as he believes that wine is \"all about the experience\".\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nAlcohol\n\nOnline shopping", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_liquor_300720.jpg?VersionId=kbglttzF6MRkZIkf1FABy1DAfubNbrfl", "alt_text": null}]}

Get your money back.\"\n\nBanks and non-bank lenders - the array of brokers and investment firms that make up the unregulated 'shadow bank' sector - have lent billions of dollars over the last few years in the world's most valuable real estate market.\n\nLenders and borrowers were happy when prices were rising, but there is now widespread concern as values decline.\n\nMezzanine investors, firms which lend money in generally shorter time frames and at higher interest rates, are seen as most at risk.\n\nUnder Hong Kong Monetary Authority rules, banks cannot lend more than 40 per cent of the asset value to commercial property buyers in order to minimize the damage caused by defaults. Mezzanine investors and other shadow banks are not bound by that.\n\n\"There are mezzanine investors that are overly aggressive in providing exceptionally high loan-to-value (LTV) at circa 80 per cent against underlying assets' true value,\" said Ryan Chung, managing director at Huatai International, a major mezzanine investor in the city.\n\n\"Given office rental has retreated roughly 10 per cent first half (of this year) and occupancy rate is on the soft side, it definitely impacts the asset valuation and potentially triggers financial covenants,\" said Mr Chung, referring to the conditions of loans.\n\nMr Chung said some lenders are now demanding new property valuations in order to check that the latest value does not breach the LTV limit set out in the covenant.\n\nDEFAULTS STARTED\n\nEarlier this month, mezzanine investors demanded Goldin Financial Holdings repay about HK$3.5 billion (S$621 million) on a loan facility pledged to an office tower in a second-tier eastern Kowloon business district.\n\nGoldin sold a residential land plot this week for HK$3.5 billion in order to repay the debt, taking a HK$2.75 billion loss on its original investment. The creditors that lent the senior debt took possession of the 27-storey property.\n\nGoldin bought the tower in 2018 from its chairman for HK$17 billion, making the total LTV ratio 60 per cent. Goldin said this month the property had a market value of between HK$15 billion and HK$16.5 billion, but some valuers and creditors told Reuters that even a valuation of HK$15 billion - which would put the LTV ratio at 68 per cent - was too high.\n\nFalling valuations are worrying banks, which are discussing internally the gap between \"economic realities and market valuations,\" one executive at a major foreign bank with significant mortgage business in Hong Kong told Reuters.\n\nDefaults have already happened, said the financing investor who predicted no improvement in the market, but banks are not disclosing them. \"Everyone is rolling over (extending the loan due date) in hope things will get back,\" the person said. That could work for another three to six months, he said, but after that the situation could be more serious.\n\nAlfred Lam, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Property Finance, said his members were not yet calling in loans but there was rising worry.\n\n\"Our members are concerned,\" he said. \"Some of them previously lent at high LTV, if prices drop another 10 per cent-20 per cent, then even if you receive the asset you can't cover the costs.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nHong Kong\n\nBanks and financial institutions\n\nLoans\n\nProperty prices", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/nz_hkskl_300768.jpg?VersionId=EAC3CMj__4lvAaamCcInrXiVLJaTGgst", "alt_text": null}]}

Aerospace firms, including component manufacturers and maintenance facilities, are reining in costs and cutting manpower due to declining business.\n\nEarlier this week, aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul firm Eagle Services Asia decided to let go more than 140 workers despite implementing other cost-containment measures earlier \"such as a temporary salary reduction and short work week, cancelled merit increases, hiring freezes and discretionary spending cuts\".\n\n\"This is unfortunately a result of current market conditions we are facing, including customer-driven volume declines due to a generational pandemic no one could foresee,\" said the company, which had 829 workers before the retrenchment.\n\nThe firm did not follow due process for the retrenchment exercise by informing those affected last week even before talks with the unions concluded. Legal industrial action, authorised by labour chief Ng Chee Meng, was averted after the company reached an amicable agreement with the unions.\n\nIt was also reported this month that jet engine-maker Rolls-Royce would be shedding some 240 jobs in Singapore, or nearly a quarter of its local workforce. The layoffs, part of a global restructuring, will affect mostly technical roles. The company manufactures fan blades and assembles engines at Seletar Aerospace Park.\n\nMeanwhile, budget carrier Jetstar Asia has let go of 167 staff members, a reduced number from the previous estimate of 180 due to new job placements and some resignations. Most of the redundancies were through a voluntary process.\n\n\"The restructuring process is now complete and the business retains approximately an 80 per cent Singaporean/permanent resident workforce,\" the company told ST, adding that it had recently detailed a recovery plan that includes reducing its fleet to 13 aircraft by February next year.\n\nMr Sia Kheng Yok, chief executive of AAIS, said aircraft manufacturers and some major aerospace companies had announced global job cuts ranging from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, or between 9,000 to 16,000 jobs.\n\nIn Singapore, government support has blunted the local impact of these global job cuts, he told ST.\n\n\"With the weak market outlook persisting for another few years, some companies are having to trim their workforce after exhausting alternative avenues. Together with government agencies, we are identifying measures that can better position the industry for the future.\"\n\nLast month, Airbus unveiled plans to cut about 15,000 jobs worldwide, saying its future was at stake.\n\nAs at end of the first quarter of this year, Airbus employed some 830 people in Singapore in its various entities, covering the commercial aircraft, helicopter, defence and space businesses.\n\nThe planemaker said: \"Despite the very challenging situation for our industry, we remain committed to our presence in Singapore as our regional hub.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nAirbus\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yq-airbus-30072022.jpg?VersionId=sNO2DZsblh2j2v9xIXMGVZkpTTwvZnPV", "alt_text": null}]}

Mr Shafie will remain as the caretaker chief of the East Malaysian state until the polls take place. Only state assemblymen will be elected during the state election, with the 25 Sabah federal MPs retaining their wards.\n\nThe Sabah legislature has 60 elected lawmakers and five who are appointed by the reigning state government.\n\nUntil Mr Musa's news conference on Wednesday, Mr Shafie's coalition controlled 45 of the 65 seats, or more than two-thirds.\n\nA minimum of 33 seats are needed to form the state government.\n\nThe state polls will represent the first major political battle between the five-month old Perikatan Nasional (PN) government and PH-led opposition bloc.\n\nThe election in Sabah, Malaysia's second biggest state by land area after Sarawak, goes beyond the fight between two arch rivals - Mr Shafie, 63, and Mr Musa, 69.\n\nA victory for PN could help Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin entice several Sabah MPs to his alliance, thus securing a more comfortable majority in Parliament, where he holds only a two-seat majority.\n\nThe election will also be a litmus test for the federal opposition bloc, which remains split over its choice of a prime ministerial candidate.\n\nThe three-party PH is led by Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. The rest of the opposition MPs are lumped together under the so-called PH Plus alliance, consisting of MPs from Tun Dr Mahathir's group and those from Warisan led by Mr Shafie.\n\nThe cooperation and performance of the blocs led by Mr Anwar and Dr Mahathir in Sabah will be a crucial precursor for their working relationship at the federal level, with national snap polls expected within the next few months.\n\nThe PN aliance led by Tan Sri Muhyiddin is now in control of nine out of the 13 Malaysian states, after successfully toppling PH-led state legislatures in Perak, Johor, Melaka and Kedah.\n\nSabah is the first state to opt for a dissolution of the assembly, rather than allow itself to fall to PN by way of defections.\n\nWith Sabah's dissolution, PH and its partners are now left with just three state administrations in Selangor, Penang and Negeri Sembilan.\n\nSabah is home to 3.4 million people, just over 10 per cent of Malaysia's population. Its economic output is the fifth-largest among Malaysia's 13 states, although it is one of the country's poorest state by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.\n\nThe Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak are historically known to be allies of the federal government, but the result of the 2018 election, where Umno-led Barisan Nasional (BN) lost federal power for the first time, caused significant change in the region.\n\nThe Sarawak ruling coalition exited BN and formed Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), an independent bloc in Parliament, but since March have backed PM Muhyiddin's PN government.\n\nMr Shafie's Warisan had continued to back PH and its partners despite the collapse of the federal government in late-February.\n\nIn the 2018 state assembly elections, Mr Shafie's Warisan, along with PH parties, won 29 out of the 60 seats contested in the state assembly. BN, led by Mr Musa, also won 29 seats, leading to a hung assembly.\n\nBut Mr Shafie managed to secure crossovers from several BN parties to form the state government.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nPolitics and government", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_sabahpolls_300720.jpg?VersionId=RZvfrFdKkcHNcw65KZmO_WFhxh15E5D3", "alt_text": null}]}

Recalling neighbours supporting each other, she says that it shaped her to be someone who looks out for others. That emphasis on community is something she sees in her husband too.\n\n\"You know the core of everything you have done politically, what I know about you as a person and one of the reasons why I fell in love with you is ...,\" she said, before being interrupted by Mr Obama.\n\n\"It wasn't just my looks. But that's okay,\" the 58-year-old jokes.\n\n\"You're cute, you know,\" Michelle continues. \"But, no. One of the reasons I fell in love with you is because you are guided by the principle that we are each other's brothers' and sisters' keepers. And that's how I was raised.\"\n\nIn 1985, two years after he graduated from Columbia University, Mr Obama began working as a community organiser in Chicago, setting up a job training programme, a college preparatory tutoring programme, as well as establishing a tenants' rights organisation in Altgeld Gardens.\n\nThe two would meet four years later, in 1989, when he was interning at a Chicago law firm where she was an associate. The couple tied the knot three years later, in 1992.\n\nReflecting on their shared values, Mrs Obama says: \"I can say that my family, my neighbourhood, my notions of community growing up shaped that view, and shaped the choices that I made in life as I felt your experiences shape yours.\"\n\nIn their usual fashion, the couple, in between charming banter, easy laughter, and quick \"love you's\", also discuss family life, giving listeners a glimpse into the conversations they have around the dinner table.\n\nReflecting on the legacy they hoped to leave for their daughters, Malia and Sasha, Mr Obama says: \"When you and I think about what's the inheritance we'd like to leave Malia and Sasha, more than anything that it would be is that they're living in a country that respects everybody and looks after everybody. Celebrates and sees everybody.

Forty per cent of firms foresee slower business conditions while 9 per cent are optimistic, resulting in a net weighted balance of 31 per cent of firms predicting business will get worse.\n\nHowever, despite the overall negative outlook, they are slightly more optimistic about the July to December period as compared to the six months from April to September.\n\nIn comparison, manufacturing firms are generally more optimistic than those in the services sector, with a net weighted balance of 7 per cent of firms predicting softer business prospects. Among factors for their subdued outlook are United States-China trade tensions.\n\nServices firms are expecting employment levels to drop for the third quarter, compared with the second quarter. Those in the accommodation industry expect to reduce hiring in the July to September period, in line with their outlook for operating receipts. Business services firms such as travel agencies and event organisers foresee lower employment levels as well as they expect slower business.\n\nAcross all segments, business activity level is expected to decline for the July to December period compared to January to June.\n\nThe accommodation and real estate industries are most pessimistic, with the accommodation segment expecting a fall in demand due to low tourist arrivals amid travel restrictions.\n\nFirms engaged in the rental of commercial and office premises foresee downward pressure on rental rates due to weaker demand for commercial and office spaces.\n\nOperating receipts are expected to decrease for the three-month period ending in September, compared with the previous three months.\n\nAmong manufacturers, a net weighted balance of 7 per cent of firms are predicting a less favourable business situation between July and December, compared with the second quarter of the year.\n\nA large proportion of manufacturing firms - a weighted 83 per cent - expect employment levels in the third quarter of the year to remain similar to the second quarter.\n\nOverall, a net weighted balance of 7 per cent of firms plan to hire fewer workers in the next three months, with all clusters apart from the biomedical manufacturing cluster projecting a smaller workforce for the July to September period.\n\nAcross sectors, the transport engineering cluster is the most pessimistic about the business environment, with a net weighted balance of 43 per cent of firms expecting the operating environment to remain weak in the second half of the year.\n\nThe electronics cluster was the most optimistic, with a net weighted balance of 1 per cent of firms anticipating an improved business outlook in the July to December period. Within the cluster, the semiconductors segment foresees resilient demand from the 5G market, cloud storage and data centres.\n\nHowever, the info-communications and consumer electronics, as well as other electronic modules and components segment, expect orders to be negatively affected by Covid-19 and United States-China tensions.\n\nA net weighted balance of 22 per cent of the biomedical manufacturing cluster predict a weak business situation in the six months ending December 2020, with the softer outlook mainly in the pharmaceuticals segment where there are some concerns over potential delays in the supply chain.\n\nBut the medical technology segment is more optimistic about the operating environment ahead, given that its export markets are gradually re-opening following the global lock-downs in the April to June period.\n\nA net weighted balance of 6 per cent of manufacturers also expect output to decrease in the third quarter of the year, compared with the second quarter, with firms cautious about their production plans.\n\nA majority of manufacturing firms reported no limiting factors that would affect their ability to get export orders in the July to September period.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore companies\n\nBusiness sentiment\n\nCovid-19\n\nSingapore economic data", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_manufacturing_300720.jpg?VersionId=SKMsRs9M0Q0JnPqtxcwtLYSiqsi5lYDY", "alt_text": null}]}

The company was hit by $919 million in provisions for Keppel Offshore & Marine's contract assets, doubtful debt, as well as share of impairment provision arising from its associate, Floatel.\n\nWithout the impairments, Keppel would have seen a net profit of $222 million for the quarter, up 45 per cent from a year ago. The company's quarterly revenue stood at $1.33 billion, down 25.7 per cent from a year ago. Contributions fell across all business divisions due measures to contain the spread of Covid-19.\n\nKeppel declared an interim dividend of 3 cents per share, down from the 8-cent dividend it had declared for the same period a year ago. This will paid on Aug 20.\n\nIts chief executive Loh Chin Hua, chief executive of Keppel said that Keppel has failed to meet a pre-condition to a $4 billion takeover offer from Temasek Holdings.\n\n\"We believe that the 20 per cent threshold in the MAC (material adverse change) clause in respect of net profit after tax has been crossed, which means that the MAC pre-condition in Temasek's pre-conditional partial offer has not been satisfied,\" he said.\n\nMAC clauses can be invoked to end or renegotiate deals, particularly if events occur that are detrimental to the target company.\n\nLast October, Temasek, which already owns about one-fifth of Keppel, offered to buy an additional 30.6 per cent stake at $7.35 per share in cash.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Excluding the impairments, it would have registered a net profit of $393 million for the first six months of the year, 5 per cent higher than a year ago.\n\nRevenue stood at $3.18 billion, down 4 per cent from a year ago. This was mainly due to lower contributions from property trading projects in China, power and gas sales, environmental engineering projects and asset management.\n\nThe offshore & marine division reported a net loss of $959 million, reversing the net profit of $10 million a year ago. Besides the impairments, Keppel's O&M Singapore workforce was reduced to about 1,200 persons for most of Q2, from about 24,000 in March 2020. The workforce has since risen to about 5,000 presently.\n\nAs at end-June 2020, the net orderbook stood at $3.5 billion, which is expected to last theoffshore &marine division for at least two years.\n\nKeppel's property division recorded a net profit of S$197 million for H1, 25 per cent lower on-year, due to the absence of divestment gains from Dong Nai Waterfront City in Vietnam and lower investment income.\n\nMeanwhile, its infrastructure division recorded a net profit of $252 million in H1, up from $59 million a year ago, due to a mark-to-market gain of $131 million from the reclassification of Keppel's interest in Keppel Infrastructure Trust from an associated company to an investment, alongside gains from selling Keppel DC REIT units.\n\nThe investments division sank into the red with a net loss of $27 million for H1, reversing a net profit of $25 million a year ago. This was mainly due to the absence of a re-measurement gain on previously held interests in M1, as well as mark-to-market losses from investments.\n\nMr Loh said that most of the company's businesses have remained resilient, underpinned by the essential services that it provides.\n\n\"However, due to the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and oil prices, we had to take significant impairments related to the O&M business. Without the impairments, Keppel's net profit for H1 2020 would have been higher year-on-year, even after including the loss of $69 million by Keppel O&M,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"We will forge ahead in this difficult landscape, guided by our Vision 2030, a long-term roadmap which transcends the current crisis.

We knew we had lost a massive player,\" Lampard said.\n\n\"We've a real spirit within the group now and it's a real team effort now.\"\n\nWith his hands tied by the transfer embargo, Lampard was compelled to give some of the club's youngsters a chance to prove their worth.\n\nThat they responded so tenaciously and with such verve was a tribute to Lampard's influence.\n\nThe energy and optimism provided by Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount, Reece James, Billy Gilmour and Fikayo Tomori gave the entire club a jolt of adrenaline.\n\nA swaggering 5-2 win at Wolves in September served notice that Lampard and his young prodigies wouldn't be out of their depth, while a mature 1-0 Champions League win at Ajax showed they could handle Europe's elite.\n\nLampard's midas touch hasn't been restricted to the young guns.\n\nHe coaxed consistency from Willian and brought Olivier Giroud back into the fold after the French striker had appeared set to leave in January.\n\nExiled in the first half of the season, Giroud's prolific form since the coronavirus hiatus - seven goals in 10 matches in all competitions - played a key role in Chelsea holding onto their top four berth.\n\n\"What we've done this season is take the opportunity to bring in the younger players and improve the existing players,\" Lampard said.\n\nAt a club where owner Roman Abramovich dispenses with managers in ruthless fashion, Lampard showed he wasn't intimidated by twice dropping error-prone goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga despite the club's fears it could harm his future transfer value.\n\nLampard's furious response to perceived antagonism from Liverpool's coaching staff during their recent clash at Anfield was another sign he is not to be trifled with.\n\nWhile Chelsea's progress under Lampard has been undeniable, they still lost 12 times in the league for only the second time since Abramovich bought the club in 2003.\n\nUnable to fix Chelsea's defensive frailties and often frustrated by their lack of cutting edge, Lampard has been busy in the transfer market and more new signings are on the way.\n\nLampard needs Leipzig striker Timo Werner and Ajax playmaker Hakim Ziyech to hit the ground running next season.\n\nHe has also been linked with Manchester United keeper Dean Henderson, West Ham's Declan Rice and Bayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz as he tries to bridge the 33-point gap to Liverpool.\n\n\"The challenge now is to see what more we can do next season,\" Lampard said.\n\nSee more on\n\nFA Cup\n\nChelsea\n\nArsenal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/nz_frank_300761.jpg?VersionId=QkBlCx.XbSv_5N3pvqTY3hI37MJiKJG.", "alt_text": null}]}

The 85-year-old retired hawker had to give up some of her favourite activities - such as cooking - after undergoing a kneecap replacement about seven years ago and was not able to walk as well as before.\n\nSaid the former Meridian Junior College student: \"I've witnessed how, as my grandparents were growing older, they felt unhappy that they were not able to do many things, being weaker. They had to forgo things that they liked to do, and rely on others.\"\n\nHelping elderly patients like her grandmother to regain independence as they relearn simple daily tasks such as washing and dressing themselves is something Ms Chew hopes to do in her future career.\n\nShe said: \"Being healthy does not only involve not having ailments, but also being able to have a quality of life that is satisfactory to the patient.\"\n\nMs Chew is one of 11 recipients of the Community Care Scholarship, the latest addition to the list of healthcare scholarships awarded by the Ministry of Health this year. These include the Healthcare Administration Scholarship and the Integrated Nursing Scholarship.\n\nThe new scholarship is for a selected few seeking a career in physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and social work. It covers tuition fees and monthly allowances, among other costs, for scholarship holders.\n\nOn Wednesday (July 29), the 11 were among 120 scholarship recipients pursuing a career in the healthcare industry as doctors, nurses, allied healthcare professionals and administrators who were recognised in a virtual award ceremony attended by Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong and Permanent Secretary for Health Chan Yeng Kit.\n\nMr Chan, guest of honour at the event, said the new Community Care Scholarship recognises the importance of allied healthcare professionals in delivering community care services, as well as the need to nurture the next generation of leaders who can make a difference in community care.\n\nHe added: \"With an ageing population and rising chronic disease burden, there will be a lot of challenging work, particularly in the community care setting.\"\n\nBy 2030, about one in four Singaporeans will be 65 or older.\n\nA local study conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School's Centre for Ageing Research and Education and the Ministry of Health found that about 37 per cent of survey respondents aged 60 and over reported three or more chronic health conditions in 2017, almost twice the 19.8 per cent in a 2009 study.\n\nFor another scholarship recipient, Ms Jace Ng, 19, the impending silver tsunami that will soon be hitting the shores of Singapore is a reason why she decided to go into physiotherapy.\n\nShe said most people think of physiotherapy as a form of rehabilitation when they are injured and need to regain mobility.\n\nBut physiotherapy could be a form of preventive care for the elderly as Singapore deals with an ageing population, she added, pointing out that the elderly can be severely injured in a fall, as they are more frail.\n\n\"Many elderly people don't actively engage in exercise or understand how exercise can help them become stronger. Physiotherapy can be a way to teach the elderly to maintain a healthy lifestyle and strengthen themselves, even before they get injured,\" she said.\n\nSee more on\n\nHealthcare\n\nScholarships\n\nAgeing", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/af_physiotherapy_300720.jpg?VersionId=7qx8OnZR8GMk8VoC8TNFiXd2Gl_8Q48j", "alt_text": null}]}

It is in the business of moving people and has consequently been hit hard by the virus.\n\n\"So in the coming weeks, coming months, the top priority is what steps can we take to revive our aviation hub?\" he said, noting that his ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and various ministries are working together to negotiate reciprocal green lanes.\n\nSingapore has made such agreements with China and Malaysia so far, which allow travellers on essential business and official purposes to replace the customary 14-day self quarantine with measures such as pre-departure swab tests and the submission of detailed itineraries.\n\n\"Going forward, let's hope (we) can negotiate more reciprocal green lanes,\" said Mr Ong.\n\nHe stressed that it is crucial not to take Singapore's status as an aviation hub for granted, as other countries will be vying for the same business when the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic starts showing signs of being brought under control.\n\nWhen that happens, Singapore once again \"needs to be able to fight back, secure and revive its aviation sector while being able to keep transmission level low and maintaining the health of Singaporeans\", he said.\n\n\"This is a key issue that we will have to grapple with in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLog in\n\nUnlimited coverage, unmatched value\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nGet Digital Access\n\nMonthly savings\n\n$9.90\n\n$5\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nBilled at $5 monthly for the first year, $9.90 monthly thereafter.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\n$9.90\n\n/\n\nmth\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nNo lock-in contract.\n\nSubscriber-exclusive benefits for One Digital Package:\n\nAccess all subscriber-only content on ST app and straitstimes.com.\n\nEasy access any time via ST app on one mobile device.\n\nmyST: Follow up to 30 authors and 30 topics.\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of Transport\n\nOng Ye Kung\n\nPoliticians\n\nCabinet", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/yu-ongyekung-3007.jpg?VersionId=sQGqAuYSgQ41SuL11b75LJkKtMpWukEx", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

It recouped some of the losses and was last at 93.398.\n\nThe greenback weakness supported the euro at US$1.1792.

One of the cases, an American citizen, first developed symptoms in Danang as early as June 26, the health ministry said.\n\nSuspicions have been raised by authorities that the new infections could have been the result of illegal immigration from China, Vietnam's ancient foe.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\n\nVietnam has gone back into full response mode.\n\nAll flights to and from Danang have been suspended for 15 days, although in the immediate aftermath of the infections, about 21,000 tourists there returned to Hanoi and another 18,000 to Ho Chih Minh City.\n\nHanoi said it would conduct mass testing for all 21,000 those who had returned there from Danang.\n\nAuthorities in the capital have also shut bars and banned large gatherings because of the new cases.\n\nSee more on\n\nVietnam\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/tl-hanoi-a-300720.jpg?VersionId=GEjX5KXTt1xNB9yS6UNxdS_v_4hS_jYg", "alt_text": null}]}

However, it is unusual for a country to close a diplomatic mission of another country without specifying concrete illicit activities of that country.\n\nThis can be regarded as a serious aspect of the confrontation between the United States and China.\n\nThe practice of using the closure of diplomatic missions as a sanction must not spread to other countries and hamper legitimate diplomatic activities.\n\nThe United States has made it clearer that it will step up pressure on China. Based on a ruling in 2016 by an international tribunal at The Hague, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that China's claims of maritime interests in the South China Sea were \"completely illegal.\"\n\nIn his policy speech on China, Mr Pompeo stated that engagement with China by past U.S. administrations that aimed to incorporate China into the international community had been a failure, and called for a change in the engagement policy.\n\nHe also stressed the need for democratic countries to unite to contain China.\n\nIt cannot be denied that the administration of Chinese President Xi Jinping has not listened to warnings from the international community, and has taken measures that ignored the rule of law, trade rules and human rights.\n\nIt is pressing ahead with its militarisation in the South China Sea, as well as breaking an international promise and depriving Hong Kong of its freedom and threatening the world order.\n\nIt is understandable that the United States is trying to change China's behaviour. The question is how and when.\n\nAs opportunities for dialogue between the United States and China have been reduced due to the spread of the novel coronavirus, continued retaliatory battles could escalate tensions and develop into an unforeseen conflict.\n\nIf the United States takes excessive hard-line measures, it will not be able to win the support of Japan and European countries.\n\nSuspicions still linger that US President Donald Trump is showing a confrontational attitude toward China in order to strengthen his support for the presidential election in November.\n\nThe Xi administration also is apparently being forced to take a hard-line attitude toward the United States to avoid domestic criticism of a \"soft attitude\" and maintain its prestige.\n\nBoth the United States and China must regain their composure and find ways to settle the situation.\n\nThe Yomiuri Shimbun is a member of The Straits Times media partner Asia News Network, an alliance of 24 news media organisations.\n\nSee more on\n\nEditorial Notes\n\nUS-China ties", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_us-china-flag_300720.jpg?VersionId=fcSf.poXKA_GoKyPtInSgHL9nDuLjTR8", "alt_text": null}]}

They have broken the track records at both Spielberg and Budapest and it will be thrilling to see them on the iconic Silverstone circuit.\"\n\nThe high-speed track's demanding and fast corners are expected to suit the Mercedes cars, but Wolff said he is taking nothing for granted.\n\n\"We've had a good start to the season,\" he said. \"We resolved the issues that troubled us on the first weekend, won three out of three races and scored a good amount of points, but they highlighted a crucial factor - the importance of reliability in this shortened season.\n\n\"We're one of only two teams that have finished all the races with both cars this year and we know how quickly a DNF (did not finish) can make a points lead disappear.\"\n\nArriving at Silverstone, Hamilton leads Bottas by five points with Max Verstappen of Red Bull third, 30 points adrift, but hoping to close the gap.\n\nThe Racing Point team's base is only a few hundred metres from the circuit entrance and, after demonstrating their speed and potential in Austria and Hungary, they hope to be in a scrap with Red Bull to secure a podium finish before Renault lodge another expected protest at the integrity of their 'pink Mercedes' car.\n\nFerrari, the only team to have interrupted Mercedes' supremacy at Silverstone in recent years, when Sebastian Vettel triumphed in 2018, are likely to continue their struggle for competitive form after a lacklustre start to 2020.\n\nVettel, in his final season at Ferrari, has this year emerged as a close supporter of Hamilton in backing the sport's anti-racism stance and the wider Black Lives Matter movement, which has not seen clear and unambiguous backing from the drivers.\n\nHamilton called for more unity and leadership on the issue following a confused and muddled pre-race 'taking the knee' ceremony in Hungary.\n\nMcLaren's Lando Norris, 20, said this week that the drivers would react and he expected to see \"a better structure and a better plan in place\" than at previous weekends.\n\nThe Briton suggested that Formula One management would be allocating proper time for a ceremony prior to the national anthem.\n\nSee more on\n\nLewis Hamilton\n\nMercedes", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_lewishamilton_300720.jpg?VersionId=M.mMM8Ppp8j77okRiehXPncOcUF.cE9n", "alt_text": null}]}

Strict adherence to the plan allowed the country to claim victory over the virus this spring, stamping out clusters.\n\nFaced with a resurgence that has similarly confounded Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, Vietnamese authorities are moving to contain a fresh cluster that has led to 36 new cases in the past week, for a total of 459 cases as of Thursday (July 30) morning.\n\nOfficials imposed strict quarantines on thousands of people who may have been exposed in the coastal city of Danang, reimposed stay-at-home measures and tightened border and immigration controls to prevent illegal entry.\n\nThe government is now warning the virus could spread to other regions, including Ho Chi Minh City and the capital of Hanoi, where officials are suspending large gatherings such as religious activities and ordering bars to close.\n\nHanoi will conduct mass testing for 21,000 people who recently returned from Danang, Hanoi's ruling body said on Thursday.\n\nThe health ministry sent text messages to all mobile phone users among the country's 95 million people urging anyone who visited Danang from July 1 to come forward.\n\n\"The CDC has been working with us and helped us build up a plan that put in place steps to fight against pandemics,\" said Tran Dac Phu, senior adviser at the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre under the nation's Ministry of Health. \"The government is now very concerned about a second wave. We continue to work with the CDC and World Health Organisation on this.\"\n\nKey to the government's success so far has been its ability to move quickly to test patients, isolate those who are sick, aggressively trace contacts and quarantine for 14 days those who come in contact with positive cases.\n\nIt's also been essential to have consistent and transparent communication with the public, said Dr Matthew Moore, director of the CDC's Global Health Security Programme in Vietnam.\n\nThe agency, which has been in Vietnam for 20 years and has a staff of 58 in the country including eight Americans, works with the government on testing protocols, guidelines to prevent transmission in health-care settings and training in epidemiology.\n\n\"Time and time again they have shut down chains of transmission,\" he said.\n\nVietnam, a country whose 96 million citizens had a gross domestic product per capita of US$2,715 (S$3,730) last year, has been able to control the outbreak because of the government's laser-like anti-virus focus, a one-party political system and a population that didn't need convincing as a result of past disease outbreaks. The US, with a gross domestic product per capita of US$65,280 in 2019, has not.\n\nVietnam's success has been globally lauded.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, has surpassed 4.3 million cases and 149,000 deaths while President Donald Trump has consistently downplayed the spread of the virus. Rather than following the advice of the experts, in July he retweeted a post claiming the CDC was lying about the virus.\n\nThere have been dramatic differences between how Vietnam and US approached the contagion crisis. Within weeks of Vietnam's first reported cases in late January, the government closed schools.\n\nThe Trump administration continues to resist school shutdowns, and has even threatened to withhold federal funding from schools that don't bring back students.\n\nHanoi quickly deploys tests to anyone suspected of exposure to the virus, while the US continues to face testing shortcomings.\n\nDanang's authorities shut down two hospitals where two victims visited and ordered patients, medical staff, caregivers and family members - about 8,800 people in total - to be quarantined for 14 days at centralised bases, hospitals and homes, according to the city's health department. A third hospital also was closed.\n\nVietnam has some key advantages the US doesn't in combating the virus. The Communist Party-controlled government dominates a society with a culture of collectivism, and its tough measures, like willingness to put in place lockdowns when needed, has been met with little resistance from the population.\n\nThis comes despite the fact that its quarantine regime is uncompromising and one of the strictest in the region. The government has placed Vietnamese and even foreigners seen at high risk of infection into isolation, sometimes at remote military camps.\n\nStill, an edge Vietnam has over the US is the consistent message it has sent to the public about combating the virus, said Dr Todd Pollack, an infectious disease specialist with the Harvard Medical School Partnership for Health Advancement in Vietnam.\n\nThe government's communications campaign includes posters in residential and office complexes, text messages, an app to help Vietnamese trace cases near them, regular updates on the Ministry of Health's website and even a pop song encouraging hand-washing and social distancing.\n\nHelping the country fight the virus has been the memory of past epidemics. The Sars outbreak in 2003 during killed five people in Vietnam and the bird flu led to 52 deaths in repeated outbreaks between 2004 and 2008. The country is also currently coping with a diphtheria outbreak that has caused three deaths, leading the government to isolate 700 people in a village in the coffee-growing Central Highlands province of Dak Lak.\n\nVietnam's aggressive anti-virus measures have come at a cost: Almost 31 million workers have experienced job losses or pay cuts amid the restrictions. Vietnam's economy could grow 3 per cent to 4 per cent this year - half the official target of 6.8 per cent, according to a government advisory council.\n\nMeanwhile, the government is getting pushback from some overseas-based companies as it strives to maintain its second-wave vigilance. Companies from South Korea, Vietnam's second-largest foreign investor, are pressuring the government to lift mandatory two-week quarantines of their workers travelling to Vietnam, local media outlet VnExpress reported.\n\nYet the country's decisive actions may have burnished its reputation among companies seeking to diversify supply chains away from China. Some Japanese companies, with financial incentives from their government, are looking to relocate operations to Vietnam. Taiwanese company Inventec, Apple's assembly partner for AirPods, is preparing to establish a unit in Vietnam and other suppliers of the Cupertino, California-based company may follow.\n\nNow the government's all-hands-on-deck counterattack is kicking in again. \"We are improving our quarantine facilities to be able to isolate more people when needed,\" the Ministry of Health's Phu said.\n\nSee more on\n\nVietnam\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nInfectious diseases", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_vietnamese-covid19patients_300720.jpg?VersionId=Rk9XWSQ11ew2xzrgSrzXgg2Mfkwflli4", "alt_text": null}]}

The presence of external actors has added strain to the geopolitical turmoil.\n\nViolations of sovereign rights form one of the most pressing issues in the South China Sea. The biggest incident so far was the West Capella standoff after Malaysia started an oil and gas survey in late 2019 within the Malaysia-Vietnam Joint Defined Area.\n\nThe operation of the West Capella drillship prompted Beijing to dispatch several China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels to trail, and harass, the drillship and its supply vessels.\n\nVietnam also scrambled some of its maritime militia into the area to observe the drillship.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysia doubled-down on its initial move by deploying the Royal Malaysian Navy's KD Jebat, a 2,270-ton guided missile frigate, to protect the West Capella's operation. At one time the Malaysian warship forced a CCG vessel to stand down.\n\nBeijing has simultaneously initiated a showdown with Malaysia at the Luconia Shoals, where CCG vessels maintain a near-constant presence off the coast of Sarawak.\n\nAt the culmination of it all, China sent its survey vessel Haiyang Dizhi 8, along with a flotilla of coast guard and paramilitary vessels.\n\nIn response to the standoff, the US maintained a presence there for a month with an array of multi-day patrols involving the US Navy, and a flyby of US Air Force bombers.\n\nOn top of that, the US conducted five Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea in the first half of the year \"to challenge the unilateral claims of China on the entirety of the South China Sea, and to maintain the act of innocent passage by any ships on the high seas\" and held a joint military exercise with Australia in April.\n\nAnother incident pitted China against the Philippines at Commodore Reef in February. It started when Philippine Navy corvette BRP Conrado Yap encountered a People's Liberation Army Navy corvette during a patrol mission in the area.\n\nAs the Philippine Navy radioed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy to \"continue to their next destination\", the PLA Navy insisted that the Commodore Reef area was a sovereign territory of China.\n\nBRP Conrado Yap later identified that the PLA Navy had their weapons \"aimed\" toward the Philippine Navy.\n\nThis incident not only amounts to a violation of Philippine's Exclusive economic zone (EEZ) but also to the illegal use of threat in high seas, which is in direct breach of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, to which China is a party.\n\nThe rising tension caused a spillover effect on Indonesia, with CCG vessels constantly seen trespassing into Indonesia's Exclusive Economic Zone from December 2019 to January 2020.\n\nThe turmoil has gone unabated when the negotiation of the Code of Conduct (CoC) in South China Sea has been put on hold, mostly because of the pandemic.\n\nThe talks on the CoC, however, have been subject to criticism in the first place.\n\nOne American scholar commented that the current draft, passed in September 2019, had \"very little 'agreed' upon.\" Some points are still very contentious, such as dispute settlement procedures, and fishing and seabed management.\n\nMeanwhile, a scholar from Singapore said that, as the negotiation was suspended, Beijing was consolidating its presence amid the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nAs Asean member states have their hands full in dealing with the pandemic, Beijing wants to raise its leverage in the negotiation when it restarts.\n\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is another source of disputes among claimant states in the South China Sea.\n\nA fleet of more than 300 Vietnamese fishing vessels ventured into Chinese waters around February 2020.\n\nSome vessels were identified to operate with their transponders switched off. Several Chinese analysts suggest that some vessels were there to spy on Chinese military facilities.\n\nSeveral cases of illegal fishing were also identified venturing into Indonesian waters. An incident in March saw Indonesian authorities capture five Vietnamese fishing vessels and detain the 68 crew members.\n\nIn the following month, two Vietnamese fishing vessels were seized in the North Natuna Sea.\n\nThere seems to be no indication that the situation in the South China Sea will simmer down anytime soon.\n\nWith the US set to hold an election in November, President Donald Trump cannot afford to back down against China's assertive behaviour within the South China Sea.\n\nThis will encourage emboldened Southeast Asian claimant states to fight further aggression, as the Philippines has demonstrated in its decision to suspend termination of its Visiting Forces Agreement with the US.\n\nIt only shows that claimant states need support to stake their claims within the area.\n\nWith the CoC negotiation stagnating in these pressing times, there will be a lot of clutter to clean up before any agreement could be pushed forward between the South China Sea littoral states.\n\nThe writer is a Researcher at Department of International Relations, Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Indonesia.

The US$2.4 billion (S$3.3 billion) spacecraft will hit the top of the Martian atmosphere at more than 19,000kmh and then come to a complete stop seven minutes later.\n\nThat the 1-tonne rover will end up on Mars on the afternoon of Feb 18 is nearly certain (presuming it is able to launch before the middle of August, when the planet moves too far away from Earth). The spacecraft navigators will have put the robotic explorer on a collision course with the planet. The only question is whether Perseverance will be on the ground in one piece or smashed to bits.\n\nSpacecraft from Europe and the Soviet Union have made it all the way to the red planet, only to end up as expensive scorch marks on its dusty surface. But NASA has a good track record with Mars. It is the only space agency so far to pull off a successful mission on the surface of the red planet.\n\nPerseverance is largely the same design as the Curiosity rover, which set down in 2012 and will have the same convoluted but now tried-and-true \"sky crane\" landing choreography.\n\n\"When people look at it, it looks crazy,\" Adam Steltzner, a NASA engineer, said in a video that NASA produced leading up to Curiosity's landing that described the components: heat shield, parachute, rocket engines and, finally, a hovering crane that lowered the rover to the surface.\n\n\"That's a very natural thing,\" Stelzner said. \"Sometimes when we look at it, it looks crazy. It is the result of reasoned, engineering thought. But it still looks crazy.\"\n\nWhile everything worked, the engineers got a chance to take a look at what could be improved this time around.\n\n\"We don't usually get a chance to kind of redo or fix the mistakes we made last time,\" Allen Chen, who leads the Perseverance entry, descent and landing team for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in an interview.\n\nFor example, Curiosity actually landed too slowly, hitting the ground at 2.2kmh instead of the 2.7kmh that had been expected. That, by itself, was not a problem. A softer landing is gentler on the spacecraft.\n\nBut the engineers wanted to understand what had happened in order to make sure that the next landing - that of Perseverance - did not come down faster than intended.\n\nIt turns out that their calculation of the gravity of Mars was slightly wrong. In areas of the planet that possess less mass - like the 154km-wide crater that Curiosity landed in - the pull of gravity is a bit weaker.\n\n\"We didn't have sufficient fidelity in our gravity modelling to understand that the gravity there was actually different than elsewhere on the planet,\" Chen said. \"So that was one thing that we fixed.\"\n\nAnother component that was tweaked was the parachute that is unfurled when the spacecraft is hurling down at supersonic speeds.\n\nA parachute failure in a prototype test of a future Mars landing system led Chen's team to make sure they had not just gotten lucky with Curiosity. \"That gave us pause,\" he said.\n\nThe engineers are now confident of Perseverance's parachute after supersonic tests of a strengthened design.\n\nOne major addition to Perseverance is what NASA calls \"terrain-relative navigation.\" A camera on the spacecraft will take pictures of the landscape and match them with its stored maps. It would then steer to what looks like the safest landing spot it can. \"I don't need the whole place to be flat and boring,\" Chen said. \"I just need parts of it that I can reach to be flat and boring.\" Without this system, there would be more than a 1-in-5 chance that Perseverance would end up somewhere unfortunate - damaged by a boulder, tipped over on a steep slope or surrounded by sand traps. That would be an unacceptably high risk for such a high-profile, expensive mission.\n\nIf it works, the same technology will be used when NASA sends a mission to pick up the rock samples that Perseverance will be collecting, part of the so-called Mars sample return. That spacecraft will carry enough fuel that it is able not only to avoid obstacles but also to fly to a specific location, landing within tens of yards of the target.\n\nStill, next Feb 18, the control room at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is expected to be full of nervous engineers watching the telemetry coming back from Perseverance. That data will take minutes to travel millions of miles - far too far and too slow for anyone at NASA to make last-second corrections.\n\n\"Mars is not for the faint of heart,\" Chen said.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nSpace and cosmos\n\nScience\n\nMars", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_perseverance_300720.jpg?VersionId=H5Z5U.retFyNRnSrxjbziMhsSghY.4Eu", "alt_text": null}]}

Its shares gained $0.03 or 1.8 per cent to close at $1.73 on Wednesday, before the results were announced.\n\nHongkong Land: The property developer and investment company on Wednesday night announced a net loss of US$1.8 billion for the first half of the year, compared to a net profit of US$411 million a year ago. This was mainly due to net non-cash losses of US$2.18 billion. The counter closed at US$3.72 on Wednesday, down US$0.05 or 1.3 per cent.\n\nSembcorp Industries, Sembcorp Marine: Both companies' shareholders have expressed concerns about the proposed \"demerger\", especially given the poor macroeconomic conditions. Those present at a dialogue hosted by the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) also wanted to know whether the two firms had considered alternative options. Sembcorp shares finished flat at $1.74 on Wednesday, while Sembmarine shares dropped 0.5 cent or 1.3 per cent to 39.5 cents.\n\nJapfa: The industrial agri-food company's net profit for its first half grew six times to US$76.8 million, thanks to better operating profit in its \"other animal protein\" segment, which was driven by continued high average selling prices for fattened pigs. Japfa shares climbed 4.5 cents or 7.3 per cent to 66 cents on Wednesday, before the results were released.\n\nDairy Farm International: On Wednesday after trading hours, the mainboard-listed firm posted a 35 per cent drop in net profit to US$115 million, despite a 6 per cent increase in total sales. This came amid reduced contributions from its health and beauty segment, Maxim's and convenience stores as a result of Covid-19, curbs imposed by governments to contain the pandemic, and the impact of the contagion on customer behaviours.

But it needs to be a continual, ongoing affair,\" said Dan Basse, president of AgResource Co in Chicago.\n\nEYES ON SOY\n\nThe chances of meeting the target will be clear in the next few months. Soybeans typically account for about half of China's US farm imports and the vast bulk of buying comes in the last three months of the year when supplies from top grower Brazil dry up.\n\nAfter a slow start, Chinese importers booked more than US$2.5 billion in US soy purchases in just the past eight weeks.\n\n\"We may be on the verge of really beginning to ramp up sales to China. I think you're going to start seeing these chunks of soybean sales happening pretty soon because Brazil's getting close to sold out,\" said John Baize, president of consultancy John C. Baize & Associates.\n\nIt's unclear, however, whether China will sustain its appetite over the next five months after its crushers earlier snapped up record volumes from Brazil.\n\nDemand will also depend on China's recovery from a disease that killed hundreds of millions of pigs, reducing the need for feed.\n\nFor soybeans to make up half of the US$36.5 billion target, buyers would have to take some US$2.8 billion a month from July to December, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nThis pace of monthly buying has never been sustained for more than two straight months and only then during the fourth quarter of the year, most recently in 2016.\n\nFalling commodity prices due to the coronavirus pandemic present an added difficulty, with the deal tied squarely to the value of imports. Soybean prices this year have averaged around 10 per cent less than in 2016.\n\nOTHER IMPORTS\n\nTrade in other products, meanwhile, might find it hard to hold their early trajectory.\n\nChinese buyers bought more than US$500 million of corn in the first half of July, but importers are thought to have nearly filled their import quotas and the country's own crop will be ready for harvest from September.\n\nChina also spent record amounts on meat through May, including over US$1.2 billion on pork, according to USDA data, but overall spending on meat is relatively small.\n\nIn total, China's American farm purchases amounted to US$6 billion through May - the latest data available - up just 9.1 per cent from the same period in 2019 and 31 per cent below 2017's level.\n\nThe sales have disappointed US farmers hoping for a Chinese buying bonanza.\n\n\"It's been rocky, to say the least,\" said North Dakota farmer Paul Sproule.\n\n\"They have been making some buys lately, which we appreciate. But with closing down the consulates and the issues with Hong Kong, relations are only getting worse.\"\n\nIn all, a daunting figure of roughly US$25 billion of purchases will be needed for the second six months of the year, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture and office of the US Trade Representative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nChina's Ministry of Commerce also did not respond to a faxed request for comment.\n\nPOLITICAL WILL\n\nChina might not violate the deal if it misses the target due to the impact of coronavirus. The deal grants flexibility in the event of \"a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event\".\n\nAt the same time, politics will come into play.\n\nWith bilateral relations in turmoil, China might want to avoid making itself a bigger target for criticism from US President Donald Trump during the US election campaign by failing to make big agricultural purchases.\n\nThe final volumes of China's soybean purchases will likely depend on whether or not Beijing chooses to replenish government stockpiles.\n\nOverall, China normally requires 7-8 million tonnes a month of soybeans, noted a soy crusher in northeastern China.\n\n\"It would be a separate story if the beans go into state reserves,\" he said.\n\nChina-based sources said China will want to avoid the reputational damage of not meeting its commitments if possible.\n\n\"We will bite our teeth and implement the trade deal. Otherwise, we don't look good on the international stage,\" said a trading manager with a state-run firm.\n\n\"But we would need to buy in an explosive way.\"\n\nLISTEN TO ASIAN INSIDER PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nUS-China ties\n\nTrade\n\nAgriculture/farming\n\nFood and beverage sector", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_soyfarm_300720.jpg?VersionId=vDTRPlgGHDw8dA6vpm3Av7AWwfHz1A_4", "alt_text": null}]}

It is free to say what it wants, while we say and do what needs doing. That holds for Sabah.\"\n\nHe disclosed that as a response, he would summon Malaysia's ambassador to Manila, Mr Norman Muhammad, to explain Mr Hishammudin's reaction to his tweet.\n\nUpon his election in 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte said he would press the Philippines' contentious claim to Sabah.\n\nThe dispute goes back to 1878, when the Sultanate of Sulu signed a contract, known as a pajak, that allowed the British North Borneo Company administration to occupy Sabah in perpetuity as long as it paid a regular sum of money.\n\nSulu is a group of islands in southern Philippines.\n\nThe Sultan of Brunei gave Sabah to the Sultan of Sulu in 1658, either as a dowry or because troops from Sulu helped him quell a rebellion.\n\nThe British colonial government succeeded the British North Borneo Company. In 1946, Sabah became a Crown Colony. In 1963, it was folded with Malaya, Sarawak and Singapore into the Federation of Malaysia.\n\nWhile the British and Malaysia interpreted pajak to mean sale, the Sulu Sultanate has always maintained it means lease.\n\nEven today, Malaysia pays about RM5,000 (S$1,620) a year to the Sultan's heirs.\n\nSuccessive Philippine presidents have pressed the Sulu Sultanate's case, the most audacious being an attempt by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to train and equip a secret Muslim militia to take Sabah by force in 1967.\n\nWhen the plot, known as Operation Merdeka, was uncovered, some 200 of the fighters who were being trained were allegedly killed by their army handlers to cover up the evidence.\n\nThe Jabidah massacre, as it came to be called, became one of the main triggers for rising Muslim discontent and the emergence of Muslim rebel groups that are still around in the region today.\n\nThe 35th Sultan of Sulu and North Borneo, Phugdalun Kiram II, has been pursuing his family's claim to Sabah under Mr Duterte.\n\nMr Kiram took the helm following the death of his brother Esmail Kiram II.\n\nIn 2013, Mr Esmail Kiram II encouraged a last-ditch, violent effort to regain Sabah.\n\nA militia of over 200 men landed near Lahad Datu on Sabah's east coast and began a siege of the neighbouring area.\n\nThe attack left more than 60 people dead, set off the most serious security crisis in Malaysia in more than a decade, and strained the country's relationship with the Philippines.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nTerritorial disputes\n\nPoliticians", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_kotakinabalu_300720.jpg?VersionId=jUHjU0koE6neVvtHII8MekGeB.tJUXkP", "alt_text": null}]}

On the back of this swap facility, it established the MAS USD Facility on March 26 to lend USD to banks in Singapore. Both the swap line and MAS USD Facility have been extended through end-March 2021.\n\nSince its launch, the MAS USD Facility has provided about US$22 billion to banks, for use in Singapore and the region, MAS said in a media release. As an international financial centre, Singapore plays a key role in intermediating cross-border USD funding within Asia.\n\nThe extension of the MAS USD Facility will anchor market confidence and reinforce the stability of the financial system in Singapore, MAS added.\n\nFinancial markets have been under strain from the Covid-19 crisis as travels restrictions and lockdowns shut large swathes of economies around the world.\n\nThe Fed's network of USD swap facilities with 14 central banks, including the MAS, has provided a critical backstop for USD funding needs globally, and contributed significantly to central banks' efforts to maintain stability and normal functioning of financial markets during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThese swap facilities will help sustain recent improvements in global USD funding markets and provide certainty to market participants that USD funding will remain available to meet their needs, said MAS.\n\nMAS said it has continued to maintain a high level of SGD and USD liquidity in the banking system through its daily market operations. This complements the MAS USD Facility, and ensures that funding to banks remains ample so that they can maintain the flow of credit to businesses and individuals in Singapore and the region amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it said.\n\nSee more on\n\nMAS/Monetary Authority of Singapore\n\nUS Federal Reserve\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/nz_mas_300754.jpg?VersionId=yyQecSsA4ecxnCQ05M1iXeOqGx9L0_IV", "alt_text": null}]}

Health authorities also fear the virus is spreading to other states and territories, most of which have gone weeks without recording community transmissions.\n\nQueensland state, which has closed its border to Victoria and the Greater Sydney area, is ramping up testing after two women who visited Melbourne didn't self-isolate on their return and instead went to schools, restaurants and shopping centres for eight days unchecked before returning a positive result.\n\nThe resurgence in Victoria is taking a heavy toll on residents of age-care homes and is placing the health-care system under stress.

When it is ready, the RTS Link will connect passengers between Johor's Bukit Chagar terminus station and the Singapore terminus in Woodlands North.\n\nPM Lee said the RTS Link is a constructive and valuable project, not only in itself but also as it shows cooperation continues to go on with Malaysia despite difficulties like\n\nthe Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"It will make commuting easier; workers can come to Singapore to work, Singaporeans going to Johor or going to other parts of Malaysia can take the RTS Link instead of using the Causeway,\" he said. \"It should ease the congestion, and make it more convenient for people to go back and forth.\"\n\nBoth sides said in a joint statement following the event that the RTS Link will continue to feature co-location of customs, immigration and quarantine facilities, so passengers have to clear immigration only once, at the point of departure.\n\nThe two countries also reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring that the rail link will be well-integrated with local transport networks. The Singapore terminus is at Woodlands North, which will serve 32 stations from Woodlands to Bedok by 2024.\n\nThe joint statement noted that three key agreements to resume the project have been successfully concluded.\n\nFirst, the deal to amend the RTS Link Bilateral Agreement between the governments of both countries.\n\nSecond, a joint venture agreement between Singapore's SMRT RTS and Malaysia's Prasarana RTS Operations Sdn Bhd, to form RTS Operations - the operating company.\n\nThird, a concession agreement to appoint RTS Operations as the operating company for the first 30-year concession period.\n\nThe ceremony at the Causeway was also attended by former Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan, who led the Republic's negotiating team that worked to bring the stalled project back on track, as well as key ministers from both countries.\n\nThe rail link is expected to provide much needed relief to the Causeway. Before the coronavirus pandemic, over 300,000 people crossed the 1km-long bridge every day, including about 100,000 Malaysians who commuted daily between Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nThe signing ushers in a new chapter for the 4km rail link, which was formally agreed to by leaders of both countries a decade ago but has seen a number of delays in recent years.\n\nBoth countries signed a binding agreement to build the link in January 2018, but key project deadlines were missed after the Pakatan Harapan coalition led by former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad came to power less than five months later.\n\nThe deadline to come to new terms was subsequently pushed back four times on the request of Malaysia. The last suspension, to end-July, was due to factors such as Covid-19 and Malaysia's change of government.\n\nThe switch from an MRT to an LRT system is expected to reduce Malaysia's tab from RM4.93 billion (S$1.6 billion) to an estimated RM3.16 billion, the Malaysian government said last October when then Prime Minister Mahathir revealed details of its revised proposal.\n\nExperts have said an LRT system would be cheaper to build, as it is a simpler and smaller system.\n\nBut costs in the long run may be higher should the RTS Link reach the planned capacity of 10,000 passengers an hour in one direction, due to wear and tear and maintenance expenses.\n\nSaid the joint statement: \"The successful resumption of the RTS Link project underscores the deep and enduring bilateral relationship between both countries, and the collective desire to strengthen our win-win partnership.\n\n\"When completed, the RTS Link will ease Causeway congestion, improve connectivity, foster people-to-people ties and generate shared economic and social benefits.\"\n\nPM Lee said he managed to catch up briefly with Tan Sri Muhyiddin at the ceremony, and hopes they will find a way to hold the annual Singapore-Malaysia leaders' retreat this year.\n\n\"We are two close neighbours and there's a lot that we need to talk together about, not least how we can get a safe flow of people between the two territories,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) project, PM Lee said both countries are still in discussions.\n\n\"I hope we'll be able to work something out, because the basic thought behind it is that Singapore and Malaysia are two major economies... and the more we can make it convenient, I think the more business we can do and the closer the two territories will be in terms of rapport, in terms of cooperation and friendship.\"\n\nMalaysia had asked to extend the suspension period of the 350km rail project till May this year, and a second extension till the end of the year, given its change of government.\n\nSingapore agreed to further suspend the project to discuss Malaysia's proposed changes to it.\n\nSee more on\n\nJohor Bahru\n\nMalaysia\n\nRailways", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/kc-rts3007.jpg?VersionId=xVx3brSUJZDhf2Tg3nAYxwOutVdP1_qR", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/kc-rts3009.jpg?VersionId=81znGTwMiITuhyghlw0QESCd3pAy8_Ec", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/kc-rts3010.jpg?VersionId=e9wpzctnVRGv21_RObWDdxFNLTHr74dp", "alt_text": null}]}

The variable supply provided by renewables will need to be coupled with other technologies such as pumped hydro and big batteries.\n\n\"To enable the expected rise in renewable energy, the Integrated System Plan identifies strategic investments in transmission infrastructure and renewable energy zones,\" Audrey Zibelman, AEMO's chief executive officer, said in a statement. Bringing the right resources into the system in a timely manner could result in an A$11 billion net benefit to consumers over the next two decades, she added.\n\nA boom in renewable energy investment in Australia slowed markedly in 2019 as a creaking grid struggled to accommodate the surge in new capacity. Solar and wind farms have congregated in areas with a strong natural resource and access to cheap land, but also in isolated parts of the grid where the strength of the connection is weak. That has forced AEMO to curtail the output of several facilities to maintain system stability.\n\nAEMO's plan seeks to address that, advocating projects including the A$2.1 billion Hume Link, which aims to connect a renewables hub in southwest New South Wales and the Snowy hydro-electric project to Sydney, and the Marinus Link, which will establish a second undersea cable between Tasmania and the mainland to give the island state's abundant wind and hydro resources access to urban centers in the southeast.\n\nAustralia will need to add 26 gigawatts of renewable power, more than double current capacity, to replace retiring coal plants, AEMO said, combined with as much as 19 gigawatts of \"dispatchable\" generation from pumped hydro, fast-start gas turbines and big batteries.\n\nSee more on\n\nAustralia\n\nRenewable energy\n\nFossil fuels\n\nClimate change", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_aus-windturbines_300720.jpg?VersionId=MHpmpxoG18Ec6F.FNPiqJQmTikv.wjxr", "alt_text": null}]}

Apple said without its adjustments, iPhones would have unexpectedly shut down from power spikes.\n\nOutraged iPhone users said that appeared to confirm long-held suspicions that Apple slowed older devices to encourage users to buy new phones. Apple publicly apologized and slashed prices on battery replacements.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple agreed to pay up to US$500 million (S$687 million) to settle a proposed class-action lawsuit related to the battery issues.\n\nSee more on\n\nApple\n\niPhones", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/nz_apple_300749.jpg?VersionId=.xxD2j_aRFMpu4cCr8rHVjYfHOdPrfmH", "alt_text": null}]}

Meanwhile, revenue from its stores in Kunming in China continued to grow at a healthy pace.\n\nSheng Siong's earnings per share rose to 3.07 cents, from 1.23 cent a year ago. Gross margin improved to 28.1 per cent, from 27.4 per cent a year ago, due to selling prices underpinned by strong demand, stable input prices thanks to diversification in sourcing, and higher sales of house-brand items, which command a higher gross margin.\n\nThe company declared an interim cash dividend of 3.5 cent per share, double what it paid out a year ago.\n\nIt expects the elevated demand caused by Covid-19 to ease with the gradual reopening of the economy, while competition in the supermarket industry may stay keen as a result of e-commerce platforms gaining better visibility during the circuit breaker.\n\nThe group continues to look to open new retail spaces.

That would include both returning some facilities outsourced to China back to the United States and basing others in Latin America and the Caribbean in a drive for more so-called nearshoring, Claver-Carone said.\n\nHe gave no details about the scope of possible incentives, but pointed to the administration's use of a US$765 million loan to encourage Eastman Kodak to\n\nproduce pharmaceutical ingredients\n\nin the United States to help fight the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has made \"Buy America\" policies a centrepiece of his administration since taking office in 2017, with those efforts accelerating sharply since the turmoil created by the pandemic.\n\nThe United States and China signed a trade deal in January, but tensions have mounted in recent months over Beijing's handling of the outbreak, a national security law limiting the autonomy of Hong Kong, and other issues.\n\nClaver-Carone said the administration had already been working with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to help them attract US investors, but the pandemic helped convince US companies it was time to get on board. He did not name any companies.\n\nHe said the outbreak had clearly demonstrated the advantages of having suppliers based closer to the United States than in Asia.\n\nThe initiative would not focus on cheap labour costs, but would build on provisions aimed at protecting workers that were included in the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that entered into force in July, he added.\n\nClaver-Carone also said there needed to be an improvement in transparency over Chinese lending in Latin America.\n\nHe said Ecuador in particular was \"not being able to advance and move forward and kind of unshackle itself from that unfair, over-collateralised debt to China.\" Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno has sought to renegotiate the terms of its debt to China, which totalled US$6.5 billion in 2018.\n\nChina invests heavily in Latin America and has been responsible for more than US$40 billion in lending to the region since 2015, according to Inter-American Dialogue data.\n\nThe United States wants to \"collaborate\" with China to ensure its lending practices in the region are more transparent, said Claver-Carone, echoing a push by the World Bank.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nIf he wins a September election, Claver-Carone would be the first US candidate to head the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Latin America's principal development finance institution.\n\nHis candidacy has prompted push-back from some Latin American countries and former leaders, including publicly-shared letters signed by former presidents and ministers stating their opposition.\n\nClaver-Carone, who as a top Latin American adviser for Trump has played a key role pushing for punitive measures against socialist-run Venezuela and Cuba, said he had \"overwhelming support\" from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nHe said 15 countries in the region had publicly supported him for the IDB job and six others, which he declined to name, had privately expressed their backing.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nUS foreign policy\n\nTrade war\n\nChina", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_factory_300720.jpg?VersionId=FVsbwHStFi2kkcVJAM990vRq5wlWapr0", "alt_text": null}]}

At that time, it said it had not breached the MAC clauses.\n\nKeppel shares have fallen 16 per cent this year to trade at $5.68, close to the level they were languishing at when Temasek made its conditional bid of $7.35 per share.\n\nSee more on\n\nKeppel Corp\n\nTemasek Holdings\n\nCompany results", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/rk_keppel_300720.jpg?VersionId=jYGkADwOdPuBjrm8MRpJaMoEYS7lgLEK", "alt_text": null}]}

The organiser, who declined to be named, wrote to SportSG on July 24 to appeal against the suspension.\n\nHe told The Straits Times: \"Whether we committed any wrongdoing or not, we are all suspended. We also didn't do it on purpose. The rules weren't very clear. I saw the guidelines and they were changed again for badminton, which shows that they weren't very clear.\"\n\nAfter the incident, SportSG introduced new measures such as the mandatory wearing of wristbands to identify people from different courts to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nBut SportSG said yesterday that the safe management measures, including the one banning the inter-mixing of groups, were clearly spelt out in its advisory and at its facilities. The agency warned that it will \"act against errant users who have infringed the regulations\", including barring them from the use of ActiveSG facilities.\n\nThe organiser said that he had waited a month to approach SportSG as he was awaiting the swab test results of those who were tested. About half of them were tested and all had received negative results for Covid-19, he added.\n\nA group member who also did not want to be named said the decision was too harsh, as sports facilities had only reopened on June 19, a few days before the incident.\n\nSportSG said on July 18 that there had been about 1,000 cases of safe management violations at ActiveSG facilities since they reopened in phase two.\n\nThe member recounted that the safe distancing ambassador at Jurong East Sport Hall had reminded some in the group to rest or warm up outside the hall if they were not using the courts, but did not mention anything about inter-mixing.\n\nWhile news of the suspension was somewhat expected, he said that SportSG could have engaged the players in its investigation of the incident before meting out the punishment.\n\n\"If only they had given us the (chance to give a) proper statement and called us to tell us why we were suspended and at least hear our side so that when they do choose, they would have made all considerations.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nBadminton\n\nSports and recreation", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_XSPORTS7ZVD_5851860.jpg?VersionId=yMJ.v2A9LwB_tXCO5WDCBp7AizITwJ5e", "alt_text": "Badminton players at Yishun Sports Hall.

This is a challenge they didn't anticipate and they're just getting on with it.\"\n\nHe added the IOC was facing its biggest challenge since 1980, when the United States led a boycott of the Moscow Olympics over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nWhile not wanting to underplay the problems, he thought his close ally Bach's commitment to overhauling the status quo would make it easier for the Olympic movement to ride out the crisis.\n\n\"In terms of the challenges I think we're in a better position because when Bach came in, his mantra was 'change or be changed',\" he said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nOlympics 2020\n\nJapan", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_OLY30_5852581.jpg?VersionId=TK8ZItNDtteYNLDr0tBA4BqCnfzIgYzI", "alt_text": "The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku is lit up in Olympic colours a year to the day the postponed Games are slated to open next July.

McCollum of the Portland Trail Blazers combats the pangs he feels for his fiancee and his dog back home with \"my essential oils and my dehumidifier and my books\" and the occasional indulgence in wine he packed.\n\nGone are the ostentatious arena entrances dressed in the finest fashions and the whirl of big-city night life. Four months after Covid-19 sent basketball into an unprecedented shutdown, the National Basketball Association (NBA) takes a leap into the unknown today as the league bids to resurrect its season at Disney World in Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe Utah Jazz launch the rebooted campaign against the New Orleans Pelicans before James and Kawhi Leonard go head-to-head in a heavyweight Los Angeles derby between the Lakers and the Clippers.\n\nThe two games mark the start of a painstakingly crafted plan to stage the remainder of the basketball season safely in the midst of an ongoing pandemic which has already claimed more than 150,000 lives in the United States.\n\nTo mitigate the risks, the NBA is basing 22 teams within a tightly controlled bubble inside Disney World's sprawling campus in Orlando. Teams will play games at three venues in the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex inside the park, with no fans in attendance and only a smattering of journalists at each game.\n\nAbout 350 players will be housed at three hotels located throughout Disney World, with access to each location severely restricted and visits from outsiders strictly forbidden until the play-offs start.\n\nPlayers arriving in Orlando were required to spend 48 hours isolated in their hotel rooms until they had returned two negative tests for Covid-19.\n\nTesting will continue inside the bubble but it is not known how frequently this will take place.\n\nThis \"bubble\" experiment might even be necessary for the 2020-21 season to be held, National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts said on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm not in the (President Donald) Trump camp in believing it's all going to go away in two weeks, but I'm praying, praying that there will be a different set of circumstances that will allow us to play in a different way,\" he told ESPN.\n\nWhile multi-millionaire stars such as the Lakers' James have joked that entering the bubble felt like starting a jail term, so far the launch of the project has gone smoothly.\n\nPractice games have passed off without a hitch, and the most recent round of testing found zero positive cases out of 346 players tested.\n\nThere have been some early glitches, however, as players adjust to the relatively spartan surroundings of the bubble.\n\nClippers guard Lou Williams was forced to quarantine for 10 days after being photographed at an Atlanta strip club during a trip out of the bubble to attend a family funeral. The Sacramento Kings' Richaun Holmes also landed back in quarantine after he left the bubble to pick up an order of chicken wings.\n\nThe league is spending at least US$180 million (S$248 million) with ESPN's parent company, Disney, on its testing operation to avoid a potential loss of US$1 billion in television revenue.\n\nInside the bubble's three arenas, the legacy of the tumultuous protests which erupted in the weeks after the death of George Floyd in May will be on full view.\n\nGiant \"Black Lives Matter\" slogans have been written on each court, while players will be allowed to wear jerseys adorned with social justice messages ranging from \"I Can't Breathe\" to \"Justice Now\" and \"Education Reform\".\n\nOn the courts, all eyes will be on James and his Lakers teammates as they attempt to return to the pinnacle of the NBA when the season wraps up in October.\n\nThe biggest threat to James' hopes of winning a fourth NBA championship is expected to come from the Eastern Conference, where Giannis Antetokounmpo is aiming to guide the Milwaukee Bucks to their first title in nearly half a century. The Bucks had run away with the Eastern Conference before the hiatus, opening up a 6.5-game lead over the defending champions Toronto Raptors.\n\nAntetokounmpo, who grew up in poverty in Greece as the son of Nigerian immigrants, smiles at the suggestion that NBA players are facing hardship in their confined environment in Orlando.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where you are in life, there's always something to complain, there's always a problem and an issue,\" he said. \"My apartment in Greece, when I was younger, with my four brothers, was way smaller than the suite that I have in the hotel, so I'm just trying to enjoy the moment.\"\n\nAntetokounmpo's viewpoint was echoed by Oklahoma City Thunder's Steven Adams.\n\n\"Let's be clear, mate,\" the New Zealander said. \"This is not Syria.

The decision means City are able to compete in next season's Champions League.\n\nThe full reasoned judgment by the CAS released on Tuesday showed that the fine was to reflect \"a severe breach\" in City's unwillingness to cooperate with Uefa's investigation.\n\nBut noting that the charges of alleged concealment of equity funding were more significant violations, the CAS said \"based on the evidence, the panel cannot reach the conclusion that disguised funding was paid to City\".\n\nThe CAS also indicated that witness statements from senior City executives as well as a letter from owner Sheikh Mansour - all provided to CAS but not Uefa during the first process - could have swung the original verdict in City's favour.\n\n\"The appealed decision is therefore not per se wrong but, at least to a certain extent, is a consequence of MCFC's decision to produce the most relevant evidence at its disposal only in the present appeal proceedings before CAS,\" it said.\n\nThe judgment also found that Uefa's case was hamstrung by the necessity to finalise the appeal before the start of the 2020-21 Champions League as it relinquished a request for more evidence to be provided from City's e-mails.\n\nNine Premier League clubs - Arsenal, Burnley, Chelsea, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester United, Newcastle, Tottenham and Wolves - filed an application to CAS for City to be banned from European competition if a verdict was not reached before the start of the 2020-21 season.\n\nCity's fortunes on the field have been transformed since a takeover from Sheikh Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, in 2008. The club were accused of deliberately inflating the value of income from Emirati sponsors Etisalat and Etihad Airways to meet Uefa's FFP regulations, which limits losses clubs can incur to spend on player transfer fees and wages.\n\nUefa launched an investigation after German magazine Der Spiegel published a series of leaked e-mails relating to City's finances in 2018.\n\nCAS ruled that the leaked documents could be used as evidence but noted that they did not prove the existence of any actual transactions that broke Uefa's rules and no evidence was produced that such payments were carried out.\n\nThe court also pointed out that the leaked e-mails were distributed internally and not sent to sponsors or other parts of the club's United Arab Emirates-based owners.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nManchester City\n\nEuropean football\n\nChampions League\n\nEPL", "images": []}

The fake social media accounts and bots used by the Internet Research Agency and other Russia-backed groups to amplify false articles have proved relatively easy to stamp out.\n\nBut it is far more difficult to stop the dissemination of such articles that appear on websites that seem legitimate, according to outside experts. Facebook has begun labelling stories that appear on state-sponsored news sites like RT and Sputnik. But it is harder for the social media companies to identify and label news articles that are posted on conspiracy-minded sites, according to experts.\n\nThe disclosures, reported by The Associated Press (AP), singled out an information agency registered in Russia called InfoRos that runs several websites that \"have leveraged the pandemic to promote anti-Western objectives and spread disinformation\".\n\nAP identified two people who had served in Russia's military intelligence service as having held leadership roles at InfoRos.\n\n\"One of the things we see with these actors, we know they are going into similar websites and posting fictitious narratives, so it's a very similar operation in some regards,\" Mr Hultquist said.\n\nAmerican intelligence and law enforcement officials have been investigating possible Russian interference in the upcoming presidential elections since earlier this year.\n\nBloomberg reported they were trying to determine if Russia was trying to undermine Democratic contender Joe Biden and warned that election interference this year \"could be more brazen\" than in 2016.\n\nBLOOMBERG, NYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nRussia\n\nFake news\n\nUS presidential election 2020", "images": []}

Now they have hit upon a new target - young women who have become famous on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\n\nIn the latest episode of a long-running culture war, an Egyptian court on Monday convicted two female social media stars on charges of \"violating family values\" and sentenced each of them to two years in prison.\n\nThe court also found three men guilty on charges of helping post the women's videos and received the same sentence, lawyers said.\n\nThe convictions were the first verdicts from a series of at least nine arrests since April of young Egyptian women who are prominent on TikTok, a wildly popular app.\n\nSocial media is a highly contested and often perilous space in Egypt, a country where the government exerts tight control over traditional media such as newspapers and television, and has used courts to patrol digital platforms beyond its reach.\n\nNumerous Egyptians have been jailed for posts on Twitter and Facebook deemed critical of the government, or of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. At least 500 news websites have been blocked.\n\nIn some countries, TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese company, has come under intense scrutiny over concerns that the Chinese government could use it to spy on users. US President Donald Trump is considering steps to ban the app.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe. Select.

Some wear headscarves, a sign that they come from conservative families.\n\nThe backlash has come from Egypt's Parliament as well as the courts, with some lawmakers demanding that the government suspend TikTok, accusing it of promoting nudity and immorality.\n\nMost of the women facing prosecution for their TikTok posts were put in jail without bail. Human rights activists launched a digital campaign last week to demand their release.\n\nThe two women convicted on Monday - Haneen Hossam, 20, and Mawada el-Adham, 22 - gained millions of followers for lighthearted videos they posted to TikTok and other platforms that show them singing, dancing and clowning about. The clips are tame by social media standards and nothing that would raise the eyebrow of a broadcast censor in the West.\n\nThe women wept as a judge at the Cairo Economic Court handed down the sentences, one of their lawyers said. They were also fined nearly US$19,000 (S$26,200) each.\n\nHossam, a second-year archaeology student at Cairo University, was arrested in April for a short Instagram video clip that prosecutors called \"indecent\". In the video, she encouraged women to post videos of themselves to the app Likee, which pays users based on the number of views they receive.\n\nEgyptian prosecutors accused Hossam, who usually wears a headscarf in her videos, of inviting young women to sell sex online. Her lawyer Ahmed Abdelnaby denied the charge. \"Nothing she said in that video violated the law. The video is proof of her innocence, not the opposite,\" he said.\n\nThe second social media star, Adham, a former beauty pageant contestant with 3.2 million followers on TikTok, was on the run for days before her arrest in May, moving between houses in the Cairo suburbs and Egypt's Mediterranean coast. During the trial, prosecutors slammed videos that she posted as \"disgraceful and insulting\", her lawyer said.\n\nIn one of Adham's last videos, before police tracked her down using her phone signal and Internet use, she posed smiling in a velour one-piece jumpsuit with her hair dyed blue.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nEgypt\n\nTikTok", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_FDJAIL_5852497.jpg?VersionId=5uwmMoAjixYTCcu7fktirK.t7rf26Enb", "alt_text": "A TikTok video of Haneen Hossam, one of the two women who were convicted on charges of \"violating family values\"."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

A former businessman, Mr Park was sentenced to three years in prison for helping the late South Korean president Kim Dae-jung arrange for Hyundai, which was operating North Korea businesses, to send US$450 million (S$619 million) to Pyongyang.\n\nHyundai said the money was for business rights, but the court ruled that the payment was to facilitate the inter-Korea summit in 2000 with then North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, and had come through the NIS.\n\nMr Park served about eight months in prison before he was pardoned. The 78-year-old said at his confirmation hearing on Monday that the payment was \"inappropriate\" and that he complied with the court ruling, but the verdict was wrong as the money was wired by Hyundai without his knowledge.\n\nOpposition lawmakers said Mr Park's appointment could send the wrong message to Pyongyang and Washington. Mr Moon is trying to restart inter-Korea economic projects even as nuclear negotiations have stagnated.\n\nThe NIS could play a catalytic role in behind-the-scenes negotiations with the North, but the agency's opaque structure has triggered calls for an overhaul. Many former directors and senior officials have been imprisoned for political meddling.\n\n\"I don't believe the government would seek illicit financial transactions for another summit, but there would be greater temptations to resort to an abnormal approach in finding a breakthrough with North Korea,\" said Mr Cho Tae-yong, an opposition lawmaker who was formerly a deputy national security adviser and nuclear negotiator.\n\nMr Park vowed to transparently carry out policy and steer clear of illegal activity.\n\n\"I would help bring a breakthrough in inter-Korea relations and respond with reform that cleans up the dark side of the NIS' history,\" he told Mr Moon during an appointment ceremony yesterday.\n\nMr Lee, 56, was a prominent democracy campaigner who led a student activist group in the 1980s seen by some as revering North Korea's founding father Kim Il Sung and his \"juche\", or self-reliance, ideology.\n\nHe was sentenced to 11/2 years in prison in 1988 on charges of possessing North Korean propaganda materials and hosting protests that might cause \"social unrest\", but was pardoned six months later.\n\n\"When I was young, our primary cause was to accomplish unification, because dictators exploited the national division to persecute us democracy activists,\" Mr Lee told Reuters in 2018. \"Some people called us North followers but that's not true, though we might have a warmer heart than others towards the North and greater patience to achieve peace.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nSouth Korea\n\nNorth Korea\n\nMoon Jae-in\n\nInter-Korean talks", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_FDMEN5EOX_5852465.jpg?VersionId=TTwG1ccueKjJHP5u7xDUDZqtOaQ9kHoa", "alt_text": "An event in Pyongyang marking the 67th anniversary of the Korean War ceasefire on Monday.

Prosecutors said Lieber in 2011 became a \"strategic scientist\" at Wuhan University of Technology and later contractually participated in the Thousand Talents Programme.\n\nUnder his contract, Lieber was paid up to US$50,000 (S$68,800) a month and living expenses of up to US$158,000, prosecutors said. He was also awarded more than US$1.5 million to establish a research lab, the prosecutors said.\n\nIn exchange, Lieber agreed to organise international conferences, publish articles and apply for patents in the university's name, prosecutors said.\n\nThe four tax-related counts are in addition to two counts of making false statements to the federal authorities that Lieber, 61, pleaded not guilty to last month.\n\nMeanwhile, US federal agencies are investigating suspicious and unsolicited packages of seeds that have been arriving at addresses across America and appear to come from China.\n\nAnyone who receives the shipments should hold on to the seeds and packaging and immediately contact officials, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in a statement. The authorities in Canada also said there have been reports of its citizens receiving unsolicited seed packages, echoing the USDA's warning not to plant them.\n\nREUTERS, BLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nChina\n\nCourt trials\n\nUniversities - overseas", "images": []}

There are real consequences for the United States and our national security.\"\n\nThe report most likely previews attacks that Democratic senators will make against Mr Pompeo today, when he testifies before the committee on his department's budget request for fiscal 2021.\n\nIt will be his first public appearance on Capitol Hill since coming under scrutiny for privately urging Mr Trump to fire State Department inspector-general Steve Linick, who was removed in May after opening investigations into Mr Pompeo's potential misuse of department resources and his effort to push arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\nA State Department spokesman denied the report's conclusions and said Mr Pompeo had successfully enacted the foreign policy goals of the Trump administration, working to advance the interests of the US around the world.\n\nSenate Democrats said in the report that the White House and Mr Pompeo had not nominated enough qualified candidates to key State Department posts, noting that 11 assistant secretary or undersecretary positions are vacant or filled by acting officials.\n\n\"Vacancies and acting posts have had serious ramifications for America's presence in the world, its overseas operations and for US national security,\" the report says.\n\n\"The lack of senior department officials and personnel attrition levels doesn't just mean empty desks. It translates to a lack of US leadership on the global stage.\"\n\nDepartment officials have in turn blamed Democrats in the Senate for the vacancies, saying senators have not considered, and even obstructed, candidates for confirmation.\n\nDemocrats have countered by saying they have approved over 160 nominees for confirmation, but have denied some because some candidates put forward by the Trump administration misrepresented their qualifications or had a history of racist and offensive comments.\n\nThe report also analysed data from a 2019 federal employee survey. It found that 53 per cent of respondents in the department's international organisation bureau said political coercion was tolerated, up from 24 per cent in 2016; while 34 per cent in its legal bureau felt department leadership did not have high levels of honesty or integrity, an increase from 0 per cent in 2016.\n\nSenate Democrats also used the report to highlight a culture of fear and mistrust that career department staff feel towards political appointees under the Trump administration.\n\nThey pointed to reports of a senior adviser in the department's international organisation bureau compiling \"loyalty lists\" after Mr Pompeo became secretary.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nUS politics\n\nUS news", "images": []}

A Moderna spokesman said the company was in discussions with governments about potential supply of the vaccine, called mRNA-1273, but did not provide any details on pricing \"given the confidential nature of the discussions and contracts\".\n\nThe final price for Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine has yet to be determined, said a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nPfizer, Moderna and Merck & Co have said they plan to sell their vaccines at a profit, while some drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson, have announced plans to price their vaccines on a not-for-profit basis.\n\nAstraZeneca agreed to provide the US with 300 million doses of its potential vaccine in exchange for US$1.2 billion in upfront funding, which works out to US$4 per dose.\n\nThe US government has provided Moderna with nearly US$1 billion in funding to support its research and development efforts for its potential Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThe funding is part of Operation Warp Speed, an initiative by the Trump administration to hasten the production of an inoculation for Covid-19, which has so far killed around 660,000 people worldwide.\n\nA study in the New England Journal of Medicine said on Tuesday that Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response and prevented the coronavirus from replicating in the noses and lungs of monkeys.\n\nThe fact that the vaccine prevented the virus from replicating in the nose is seen as particularly crucial in preventing it from being transmitted onwards to others.\n\nThe same outcome did not occur when the University of Oxford's vaccine was tested on monkeys, though that vaccine did prevent the virus from entering the animals' lungs and making them very sick.\n\nIn the Moderna animal study, three groups of eight rhesus macaques received either a placebo or the vaccine at two different dose levels - 10 micrograms and 100 micrograms.\n\nAll vaccinated macaques produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that attack a part of the Sars-CoV-2 virus used to invade cells. Notably, monkeys receiving both dose levels produced these antibodies at levels higher than those found in humans who have recovered from Covid-19.\n\nThe authors reported that the vaccine also induced the production of a different immune cell known as T-cells that may have helped boost the overall response.\n\nREUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nVaccines\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_MODERNA30_5852119.jpg?VersionId=lHl4m2VDb8nAzpK_nvSDZ.Aox1R7O_cW", "alt_text": "Moderna's headquarters in Massachusetts in the US.

With India-China border agreements not holding, the situation required more troops, the officials said.\n\n\"Additional troops rushed by either side will not move back unless there is a rapprochement at the highest political level,\" said Mr B.K. Sharma, a retired major-general and director of Delhi-based think-tank The United Service Institution of India.\n\nFor now, the skirmishes have stopped. And after several rounds of high-level military talks, Beijing said troops were disengaging in most locations.\n\nThe extra deployment to eastern Ladakh comes as the Indian Army is heavily committed - from protecting the 742km disputed border with Pakistan, to counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and north-eastern states, to monitoring every ingress point along its border with China.\n\nIndia yesterday welcomed the first five Rafale fighter jets bought from France in a multibillion-dollar deal and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the jets will make the Indian Air Force \"much stronger to deter any threat that may be posed on our country\", in a veiled warning to China.\n\nStrengthening border defences comes at a huge cost and places new pressure on the nation's military modernisation programme. While New Delhi is the world's third-biggest military spender, its air force, navy and army are still equipped with weapons that are largely obsolete.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of defence spending goes to paying salaries for India's 1.3 million soldiers - one of the world's largest standing armies.\n\nThe remainder is spent on past purchases, leaving the forces with obsolete equipment and not enough ammunition.\n\n\"The additional commitment in Ladakh would put further pressure on serviceability, research and development and capital expenditure as revenue costs rise,\" said Dr Laxman Kumar Behera, a senior research fellow at the Delhi-based think-tank Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.\n\n\"It will be painful if the defence budget isn't increased,\" he added.\n\nBLOOMBERG, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nIndia\n\nChina\n\nAsia's territorial disputes", "images": []}

Putu Astawa, head of Bali's tourism agency, told The Straits Times that care has been taken as the province seeks to strike a balance between its economic and health interests.\n\n\"The most important thing is to prevent the reopening from creating a new epicentre of transmission, so this is a very tough decision to make,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the situation on the island is \"under control\", citing the recovery rate of around 75 per cent among Covid-19 patients.\n\nYesterday, the province saw 61 fresh cases, bringing total infections to 3,310, with deaths remaining at 48, the figure since July 23.\n\nApart from needing to present antibody test results showing no Covid-19 infection, visitors will also have to observe \"strict health protocols\", such as safe distancing, temperature-taking and mask-wearing.\n\nMr Putu said tourism sites must operate at below full capacity and its workers may have to put on additional protective equipment such as face shields and gloves.\n\nThe occupancy rate of hotels in Bali nosedived to 2.07 per cent in May, from 51.56 per cent in the same month last year and 62.55 per cent in December before the outbreak.\n\nThe resort island which closed tourism sites in late March has gradually reopened them since July 9 for Bali residents.\n\nIt has set a goal of welcoming foreign tourists on Sept 11, but Mr Putu said this is still \"subject to approval from the national government\".\n\nExperts have criticised the move by Indonesia to ease social restrictions. They said the premature lifting of a partial lockdown in some regions last month had already caused cases to climb and predict this will last until at least September without stronger intervention.\n\nNationwide, the overall number of cases totalled 104,432, while deaths reached 4,975 as of yesterday. Both figures are the highest in South-east Asia.\n\nDr I. Wayan Gede Artawan Eka Putra, an epidemiologist at Bali-based Udayana University, said that while he saw no issue with the reopening as long as strict measures are taken, what could throw a spanner in the works is the province's reliance on antibody tests.\n\nAccurate detection of Covid-19 can only be achieved with polymerase chain reaction tests, he said.\n\nDr I.

Google operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,\" he said, in the prepared remarks.\n\nThe four were to testify yesterday to a panel of lawmakers investigating how their business practices and data gathering have hurt smaller rivals as they seek to retain their dominance, or expand.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr Bezos said Amazon occupies a small share of the overall retail market and competes with retailers like Walmart, which is twice its size.\n\nHe also said the coronavirus pandemic has boosted e-commerce businesses across the spectrum and not just Amazon.\n\nMr Bezos also laid out how small sellers have succeeded on Amazon's third-party marketplace, a practice that has come under scrutiny from lawmakers.\n\nIn his prepared testimony, Mr Zuckerberg argued that Facebook competes against other companies appearing at the hearing and against others globally.\n\nMr Zuckerberg was also to defend Facebook's acquisitions by saying the social media platform helped companies such as WhatsApp and Instagram grow. Both are owned by Facebook.\n\nHe was also to remind lawmakers of the competitive threat which US technology companies face from China, saying China is building its \"own version of the Internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries\".\n\nMr Zuckerberg also renewed Facebook's call for government regulation.\n\nHe has previously called for more laws in areas where the company has been criticised - such as harmful content in social media, election integrity and privacy.\n\nApple's Mr Cook was to tell the committee that the company \"does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business\" and \"that is not just true for iPhone, it is true for any product category\".\n\nHe was to argue that the company's \"commissions are comparable to or lower than commissions charged by the majority of our competitors\", and \"they are vastly lower than the 50 per cent to 70 per cent that software developers paid to distribute their work before we launched the App Store\".\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nBig Tech\n\nUS news", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_ZUCKERBERG_5852707.jpg?VersionId=5Yo.er8m4D1SDesLyneeK4GZ0AOFQZEO", "alt_text": "Clockwise from above left: Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Sundar Pichai."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_TIM_5852706.jpg?VersionId=jXDhYKC7QkeHnsNgfzIujUimiOC9SPoL", "alt_text": "Clockwise from above left: Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Sundar Pichai."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_PICHAI_5852705.jpg?VersionId=xiLuXs05XioMpbMdxqKlalD0_k1FKFTr", "alt_text": "Clockwise from above left: Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Sundar Pichai."}]}

Prior to last Saturday, the country had not seen any local transmission in over three months.\n\nWhile the law enforcement authorities have stepped up inspections and uncovered dozens of illegal entrants from China over the past month, none of them have tested positive for Covid-19 so far.\n\nThe health authorities had earlier attributed the new infections to a more contagious strain of the coronavirus not detected in Vietnam before.\n\nThe country of 97 million was among the first in South-east Asia to restart businesses and inter-provincial travel after a nationwide stay-home order.\n\nIn May, it launched a local tourism campaign to stimulate the economy, with hotels and airlines offering deep discounts to get people back on the road.\n\nAs a result, there were an estimated 80,000 tourists in the coastal city of Danang when local transmission was detected at the weekend.\n\n80,000\n\nEstimated number of tourists in Danang when local transmission was detected at the weekend.\n\n12\n\nNumber of new coronavirus infections confirmed in Vietnam yesterday.\n\n450\n\nTotal number of Covid-19 infections Vietnam has so far.\n\nMr Nguyen Xuan Binh, deputy director of Danang's department of tourism, told The Straits Times yesterday morning that about 400 tourists remain stranded in the city.\n\nAt least six hotels have offered discounted rates to help them tide over the 15-day lockdown now in effect in Danang, where non-essential travel is prohibited.\n\n\"The rooms have to be inspected by the department of health to see if they meet social distancing regulations,\" Mr Binh said.\n\n\"We are trying our best to help tourists to return home as soon as possible. We are still working with other offices and related departments to offer more help.\"\n\nAll flights and bus and train services to and from Danang were suspended from Tuesday, and residents have been ordered to stay home unless heading out for essential work or errands.\n\nSince the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Vietnam has recorded 450 cases.

But we must follow strict health measures because of the coronavirus,\" the 47-year-old told The Straits Times. \"I feel sad, but also grateful that at least this important ritual is not cancelled.\"\n\nFor Muslims, korban commemorates Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael for the sake of Allah. Allah, in turn, replaced Ishmael with a ram to recognise Ibrahim's obedience.\n\nAs the global pandemic rages on, the World Health Organisation last Saturday published a list of safe practices, including using virtual platforms such as television, radio and social media to restrict social and religious gatherings, as well as observing physical distancing in meat distribution.\n\nIn Indonesia, the world's most-populous Muslim country with 270 million people, the Religious Affairs Ministry has banned public celebrations in unsafe zones with a high incidence of cases.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Instead of in mosques and public spaces, the sacrifice ritual will be carried out at slaughterhouses by smaller teams.\n\nCrowds will also be barred from watching the process on site.\n\nBaznas has joined hands with banks, electronic payment operators and online marketplaces to provide the korban service and is using social media platforms to reach out to donors, its executive director Mohamad Arifin Purwakananta told ST.\n\nThis year, he hopes to receive 25 per cent of the alms funds, including from animal sacrifice rituals, from online channels, up from last year's figure of 15 per cent.\n\n\"Digital technology aside, we must observe the health precautions as best as we can and ensure we perform the korban in accordance with Islamic laws,\" he said.\n\n\"Hari Raya is a happy day for Muslims, a day to celebrate. We will be livestreaming the sacrifice ritual so people can still witness it online.\"\n\nIndonesian online fund-raising platform Kitabisa.com, which has been offering korban services virtually for the last five years, has tied up with 11 partners to perform the ritual in Indonesia and abroad, including in Palestine, Syria and Somalia.\n\nMs Fara Devana, the platform's public relations manager, told ST that the platform has received 4,200 orders as of Tuesday, and expects more in the coming days.

The moratorium was to have ended on Sept 30, before yesterday's announcement of the extension.\n\nTan Sri Muyiddin said individuals who lost their jobs this year and still have not gotten a new job can enjoy the moratorium for another three months, up to Dec 31.\n\n\"After three months, the moratorium period can be extended by the banks, depending on the individual's situation,\" he said in a televised address yesterday. \"For individuals who are employed but have had their wages cut, their monthly instalments will be decreased in tandem with their pay cuts.\n\n\"For example, for housing and personal loans, the monthly instalments will be lowered in tandem with the salary decrease.\n\n\"This will be for a period of at least six months and an extension can be given, subject to the individual's salary at that time.\"\n\nThe premier also said that the banks have committed to implement several measures to help borrowers, both individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nHe said the measures are expected to benefit up to three million individuals and SMEs.\n\nThe measures include paying only the interest during a set time frame, extending the duration of the loan to reduce monthly repayments, and other forms of relief - until the borrowers are financially stable.\n\n\"I hope this targeted moratorium and bank assistance extension will be able to ease the burden of those affected by the Covid-19 economic fallout,\" he said.\n\nMr Muhyiddin said according to the central bank, the moratorium has benefited more than seven million individuals, with a total of RM38.3 billion (S$12.4 billion) repaid up to July 20.\n\nHe added that 243,000 SMEs benefited from the moratorium, with repayments worth RM20.7 billion during the same period.\n\nOther countries that have introduced various forms of moratorium include Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Britain, Canada, Italy, and the United States.\n\nTHE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nBanks and financial institutions\n\nCoronavirus", "images": []}

Mr Khairy had failed in his bid to challenge Ahmad Zahid for Umno's presidency following the party's historic loss in the 2018 election.\n\nThe son-in-law of former premier Abdullah Badawi, he is often seen as the face of moderation within the Malay nationalist party.\n\nUmno is the biggest component in the five-month-old Perikatan Nasional (PN) government led by Tan Sri Muhyiddin, with 38 MPs.\n\nIn contrast, Mr Muhyiddin's Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, the second-biggest party in the PN administration, has 32 MPs.\n\nAnalysts said Umno is currently divided, with different camps pushing the party in different directions, but asserted that Najib still holds sway within the party despite his graft conviction.\n\nUniversiti Utara Malaysia analyst Mohd Azizuddin Mohd Sani told The Straits Times: \"The reality is Umno is divided. Some want to leave Perikatan (Nasional).\n\n\"Some want to move on, and not drag this (Najib) case (with them).\"\n\nThe current No. 2 in Umno, Mr Mohamad Hassan, who flanked Najib in court on Tuesday, had previously called for a snap election to be held in order to return the mandate to the people, underlining the party's fragile relationship with Mr Muhyiddin's Bersatu party in PN.\n\nHowever, one partner that both Umno and Najib seem to have firmly on their side is Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS), with whom they have another partnership, Muafakat Nasional.\n\nUmno leaders such as Mr Puad Zarkashi have asserted that Umno is better off on a Muafakat Nasional platform than with PN.\n\nPAS leaders, including president Hadi Awang, visited Najib at his home immediately after the court proceedings on Tuesday, with Najib describing them as \"true friends\".\n\nDatuk Seri Hadi expressed confidence that Najib would be able to clear his name in the higher courts.\n\nDr Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said: \"Umno, along with PAS, actually won 75 per cent of Malay votes in the last election.\n\n\"The mistake was PAS split Umno's votes. But now that they are together, you are seeing them win a string of by-elections.\"\n\nDr Oh said Najib is still a \"plus\" for Umno even though he is currently unable to contest an election, but some factions within the party would not mind if it were to set the former premier aside.\n\nDr Azizuddin said Najib could still field his son Mohd Nizar Najib, also an Umno member, to replace him in his home constituency of Pekan should he be unable to contest elections - and as a result maintain his influence.\n\n\"As a former prime minister, he can influence Umno's decision. He can pull off something to show he can still dictate things in the party.\n\n\"However, this is subject to Umno allowing it to happen.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUmno\n\nNajib Razak\n\nMalaysia\n\n1MDB", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_NAJIB30_5852103.jpg?VersionId=ov15O_1PZWuKlYHtPBM523EGIaaZpDt.", "alt_text": "Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi (above) said the party would have to \"do something\" after former Malaysian premier Najib Razak (left) was convicted of corruption and money laundering."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/st_20200730_umno30_5852111.jpg?VersionId=UUev8mlNNMQlI1RYONuayMlz3BnAGQxJ", "alt_text": "Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi (above) said the party would have to \"do something\" after former Malaysian premier Najib Razak (left) was convicted of corruption and money laundering."}]}

I thought I knew everything there was to know about economics,\" said Mr Wong, who began his career as a civil servant at the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nThen the Asian financial crisis struck.\n\nSaid Mr Wong: \"One of my first assignments was to put up a paper to my bosses to assess the impact on the regional economies and the implications for Singapore. Nothing that I learnt in school prepared me for such an assignment.\"\n\nMr Wong talked about having to \"scramble\" and plug knowledge gaps yesterday at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), where he launched SkillsFuture\n\n@\n\nNTU, a series of virtual workshops to help Singaporeans keep up with new work demands.\n\nIt was Mr Wong's second day in his new role as Education Minister, and his first official event in his new appointment.\n\nHe said: \"I realised how big a gap there was from my textbook understanding of economics and the way things work in the real world.\n\n\"Since that experience, it has been a journey of continuous learning because there are many, many gaps in my knowledge that I still continue to plug to this very day.\"\n\nThese include keeping up to date on developments, and picking up soft skills like writing policy papers and presenting technical information to a non-technical audience.\n\n\"As a young economist, I learnt very quickly that how you present data and charts is quite important. And I took a lot of time and effort to improve my skills in doing these things; it's not just about using Excel and PowerPoint,\" said Mr Wong.\n\nWith the Covid-19 outbreak, the pace of change has accelerated, and so has the impetus for continuous learning, he added.\n\nLearning does not stop at graduation, he said. \"I know this is a tough period for job seekers, especially for our fresh graduates who are now looking to enter the workforce.\"\n\nThe institutes of higher learning (IHLs) have stepped up efforts for fresh graduates this year, he said. The support includes sourcing job openings and holding career fairs.\n\nIHLs have a heavy responsibility in continuing education and training, said Mr Wong, who served at the Ministry of Education (MOE) from May 2011 to November 2012, where he was Minister of State, and then Senior Minister of State.\n\n\"For a long time, we have been trying to bring IHLs and industry closer together,\" said Mr Wong.\n\n\"In the past, certainly in my first stint at MOE, when I asked IHLs, do you have any industry links, all of them would say 'yes' immediately, we do. Then you ask industry, do you think of your links with the IHLs, and they will tell you that the IHLs tend to be a bit too academic and too far removed from real-world practicalities.\"\n\nBut the situation has changed over the years, he said.\n\n\"We see the importance of SkillsFuture, even in our fight against Covid-19,\" said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHe said doctors at community care facilities were concerned about the possible spread of communicable diseases, given that so many people are housed together.\n\nSo, to pick up early signs of such outbreaks, a group of young doctors developed their own mobile application to monitor patients' conditions and symptoms, said Mr Wong.\n\nThe typical way would be to outsource the work to an IT company, he said, but these doctors also knew how to code, and could develop an app and roll it out within a few days.\n\nAbout 8,750 participants, including fresh graduates and mid-career job seekers, took part in yesterday's event, which was organised with SkillsFuture Singapore and supported by all local universities, polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education.\n\nSee more on\n\nLawrence Wong\n\nNTU\n\nSkillsFuture Singapore\n\nSkills training", "images": []}

These conditions entail arranging staggered pick-up and drop-off timings between employers and dormitory operators and the confirmation of workers' residential addresses on the MOM database.\n\nWorkers must also download FWMOMCare app to update their health and residential status, and download TraceTogether to facilitate contact tracing.\n\nMOM added that many of the 262,000 who have recovered or been tested and found to be free of the virus are staying in cleared dorms, and can resume work as soon as these conditions are met.\n\nThe multi-ministry task force combating the Covid-19 outbreak said last Friday that all migrant worker dorms will be cleared of the virus by Aug 7.

The three unions conducted a secret ballot and workers gave overwhelming support to pursue legal industrial action.\"\n\nFortunately, it was not needed.\n\nWhen the negotiations concluded, the parties had jointly reviewed the final retrenchment name list of more than 140 workers, of which around 44 per cent are Singaporeans.\n\nOn the initial list, which had 144 workers, about 56 per cent were Singaporeans.\n\nWorkers and unions raised concerns a week ago, when on July 22, the management of Eagle Services Asia proceeded to ask specific employees to leave work before finalising the name list with the unions. Others were denied entry.\n\nThis was despite ongoing negotiations with the Air Transport Executive Staff Union, SIA Engineering Company Engineers and Executives Union, and Singapore Airlines Staff Union since early this month.\n\nFollowing talks, Eagle Services Asia - a unionised company with the three unions separately representing administrative officers, engineers and technicians - conceded that the retrenchment process could have been better managed and made adjustments.\n\nMr Ng said: \"I am glad that calm and good sense prevailed ultimately.\" The parties had reviewed the selection criteria and list of retrenched employees to ensure that as far as possible, the Singaporean core is safeguarded, while giving due considerations to its foreign workers, he added.\n\nIn addition to getting a fair compensation package for affected workers, the unions had also negotiated for an additional training grant for affected union members.\n\nEagle Services Asia, a joint venture between SIA Engineering Company and American aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, told The Straits Times it had considered retrenchment only after implementing other cost-containment measures, \"such as a temporary salary reduction and short work week, cancelled merit increases, hiring freezes and discretionary spending cuts\".\n\n\"Employee departures are never easy,\" said the firm. \"This is unfortunately a result of current market conditions we are facing, including customer-driven volume declines due to a generational pandemic no one could foresee.\"\n\nAffected staff - some of whom have been with the firm for decades - had expressed disappointment with the way the situation was handled.\n\nNTUC, which last Friday proposed a Fair Retrenchment Framework, yesterday reiterated that companies should consider retrenchments only as a last resort.\n\nMr Ng said NTUC understands that these are tough times. \"Nonetheless, there must still be fair play and proper process accorded to affected workers,\" he added.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus\n\nNTUC\n\nNg Chee Meng", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_VNEAGLEKLLK_5852356.jpg?VersionId=mbyfQmSu8svx6ONTzQ4gkICO0kh4h.JE", "alt_text": "Workers and unions raised concerns a week ago, when on July 22, the management of Eagle Services Asia asked specific employees to leave work before finalising the name list with the unions.

We only had one laptop at home and it was overall quite tough for the kids,\" said the widowed mother of nine.\n\nHowever, the UOB My Digital Space programme proved to be a lifeline for the family, by providing them with two laptops.\n\nUnder the scheme, UOB gives out digital learning kits to students from low-income families in Singapore, Brunei, Hong Kong and Malaysia. It will eventually include Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nMore than 560 kits have been distributed to students across the region, including about 250 in Singapore.\n\nUOB has also partnered with Singtel and Singapore Press Holdings to help Singapore students by donating a Wi-Fi package and a complimentary subscription to The Straits Times and a vernacular newspaper of the student's choice, as part of these kits.\n\nThe laptops are on loan to the students for a year, with an option to extend the loan period, depending on their needs.\n\nStudents who get the laptops also have access to an online resource centre where they can learn about topics such as sustainability and cyber security, beyond their school curriculum.\n\nRachel said it was a relief to receive the devices as \"there was no need for the kids to fight\" to use the one laptop at home.\n\nHer daughter Joy (not her real name), who is in Primary 1, said she enjoyed having lessons online. She added that now, she does not have to borrow her eldest brother's laptop whenever she has home-based learning.\n\nBesides this initiative, UOB has also raised more than $1.65 million from staff and customers for the UOB Heartbeat Covid-19 Relief Fund, which helps 31 beneficiaries across the region.\n\nIn Singapore, the fund has gone towards producing 500,000 3D-printed face shields for front-line healthcare workers at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, as well as providing essential food supplies to nearly 900 needy families with school-going children for a year.\n\nMs Lilian Chong, executive director of UOB's group strategic communications and brand, said the bank aims to distribute one million pieces of personal protective equipment to healthcare workers and those in need.\n\n\"Given its far-reaching impact, we wanted to extend the reach of our corporate social responsibility programme, UOB Heartbeat, to help vulnerable communities in these trying times,\" she added.\n\nSee more on\n\nUOB\n\nCovid-19\n\nEducation and schools", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_XUOB_5852646.jpg?VersionId=IZHjin1g7auErmakxyti1Pu2abYsLlcB", "alt_text": "Rachel's children using one of two laptops on loan to the family under the UOB My Digital Space programme.

We appreciate the effort of members of the public in reaching out to those who seem to be in need,\" it said. \"However, posting and sharing their circumstances on social media may lead to further distress for these vulnerable groups of people and their families. Such posts may not correctly reflect the circumstances of vulnerable groups of people, who may be elderly, or may not share all the details accurately because of the stressors they are facing.\"\n\nThe MSF encouraged the public instead to link individuals up with a Social Service Office (SSO) or Family Service Centre, to seek help.\n\nOn Monday, a social media user posted on his public Twitter account his encounter on the train with an elderly woman who works as a cleaner. Mr Koh Meng Shuen quoted her as saying that she was seeking additional employment to earn a living.\n\nAccording to his post, she said she earned just $5 per hour working as a cleaner at the hawker centre at Our Tampines Hub. She also told him she lived with two friends in a flat, and struggled to make ends meet after losing both her husband and only son.\n\nMSF said that SSO officers identified the woman, whom they called \"Mdm L\", and visited her on Tuesday to see what help or support they could render.\n\nIt added that she \"indicated she was unaware of being photographed or that her comments and photo would be shared in public on social media\".\n\nThe ministry said Mdm L has a younger son and lives in a five-room flat with his family. \"The family has a domestic helper. Her son provides her with food and shelter, but she works to supplement her other expenses.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (Mindef) confirmed that Mdm L's elder son, a regular warrant officer, died during a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) freefall training session in South Africa in May 2009. \"Full compensation was paid out to his family. Mindef and the SAF extend their deepest condolences to the family,\" said MSF in its post.\n\nBefore the Covid-19 circuit breaker kicked in on April 7 this year, Mdm L received a monthly gross salary of about $1,300, excluding Central Provident Fund (CPF) deductions, the MSF said.\n\n\"Due to reduced business volume, her employer had arranged for her and other full-time employees to work part-time as a way to retain staff. She is currently paid $675 for working part-time in 4-hour shifts (or about $6.50/hr),\" it added. \"We understand from her employer that when business improves, they will review and reinstate the cleaners' part-time employment to full-time.\"\n\nTo help with her lost wages during this period, she is being assessed for the Covid-19 Support Grant, which provides between $500 and $800 monthly.\n\nMdm L is a permanent resident and has not applied for Singapore citizenship, so she does not qualify for schemes like the Silver Support or Workfare, MSF said. However, she receives benefits like the Solidarity Payment that are also extended to PRs. \"In addition, we will support her in other ways. Grassroots organisations will support her with $120 food vouchers monthly for the next six months. We are also arranging for her to get some help for her medical expenses,\" it added.\n\nLast night, Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin urged people to stop looking for Mdm L at her home or workplace, as she and her family were in \"significant distress\" by the publicity.\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of Social and Family Development\n\nSocial media", "images": []}

These include the SAF Scholarship, the SAF Engineering and Medicine scholarships, and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) Scholarship.\n\nThe scholarship recipients, picked for their academic excellence and standout leadership qualities, will pursue their undergraduate studies locally or overseas. The ceremony was held remotely instead of at its traditional Istana venue due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"It's certainly not as grand as the Istana, but the significance of this award is in no way diminished,\" said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in his speech.\n\nHe added: \"The quality of recipients has been maintained, if not enhanced, as the number of applications also hit another record, close to 2,000 applicants in all.\" He dispelled assumptions that the increase was a result of the economic downturn since applications were received last August, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nDr Ng also highlighted how the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel contributed to the nation's efforts to handle the pandemic by building beds.\n\nDSTA also helped build new mobile swab stations, self-check temperature kiosks and analytics software for better contact tracing, among other contributions.\n\nThe military's involvement in setting up community care facilities amid the pandemic impressed Officer Cadet Rajesh Muthu Ramanathan.\n\nThe 19-year-old is one of seven SAF Medicine Scholarship recipients.\n\n\"I felt that this is something that I want to do in the future - to be there for the nation when you're most needed as a front-line worker,\" he said.\n\n\"That's the reason why I took up medicine in the first place, and being in the SAF, I felt, (would provide) another set of challenges and also a greater meaning for me.\"\n\nOfficer Cadet Tang Tai Ran, one of the two women among the seven recipients of the prestigious SAF Scholarship, hopes be a role model for other girls.\n\nThe 19-year-old recalled a scholarship talk she attended in which the panel of scholarship recipients were all men.\n\n\"When I looked at the entire table, I realised that there weren't any female representatives.

They are also advised to avoid taking public transport.\n\nSome experts had earlier said people who are infected may not test positive during the early stages of their illness due to a low viral load.\n\nAssociate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, suggested yesterday that countries such as Singapore may consider swabbing travellers on arrival instead of quarantining them.\n\nHe told The Straits Times: \"This would still help filter out the majority of infected travellers, save money and inconvenience related to quarantine, and could potentially lower the risk of spread to the general population, since those testing positive could then be isolated at hospital or a facility.\"\n\nHowever, he added that quarantine is an effective way of combating the spread caused by imported cases. He noted that Singapore went through two waves of imported cases before the current one - an initial wave of cases from Wuhan, and a larger one in March from areas like Europe and countries like the US that preceded a wave of community cases which led to the circuit breaker.\n\n\"The lesson we learnt from that second wave was that it is vital to ensure that infected cases are quarantined in a way that minimises the risk of spillover. As long as we continue to keep new arrivals separated from the community, then it's not a concern,\" he said, adding that any home-based quarantine regime would need to be rigorously enforced.\n\nLISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_IMPORT30_5852327.jpg?VersionId=We.v4xHsAA2nBjmUtfUDhMUe16qpz.C9", "alt_text": "People boarding a skytrain at Changi Airport on July 1.

The agency said on Tuesday that Sinohydro Corporation will construct the civil and structural components of the plant's Domestic Liquids Modules, which will house various facilities such as biosorption tanks and membrane bioreactor systems required to treat domestic used water.\n\nThe plant's two Domestic Liquids Modules will have a combined treatment capacity of 650,000 cubic metres per day - equivalent to around 245 Olympic-size swimming pools of water. The treated water will undergo further purification to produce Newater, and any excess is sent for processing needs or discharged into the sea. Construction work will start next month and is expected to be completed by 2025.\n\nAs a key component of PUB's Deep Tunnel Sewerage System Phase 2 project, the Tuas plant will be equipped to receive both domestic and industrial used water streams from two separate tunnels for treatment.\n\nA total of 14 bids were made for the contract during the open tender exercise in November last year. It encompasses the civil and structural works for the Domestic Liquids Modules. Separate contracts will be called to equip the Domestic Liquids Modules with its mechanical and electrical components.\n\nIn addition, another seven construction tenders worth $1 billion will be called before the end of next year, including the plant's Industrial Liquids Modules to treat industrial used water. The earlier three construction contracts of the Tuas plant were awarded in January and July last year and in March this year.\n\nThe first was for site development works and the second, for building the Tuas plant's influent pumping stations. The third contract was to build the plant's biosolids treatment facility.\n\nThe Tuas plant will be sited next to the National Environment Agency's Integrated Waste Management Facility. Together, they will make up Tuas Nexus, an initiative which integrates solid waste and used water treatment processes to improve the overall performance of the plant, and optimise land use.\n\nThe Tuas plant will have an initial treatment capacity of around 800,000 cubic metres per day, enough to fill more than 300 Olympic-size swimming pools.\n\nWorth about $6.5 billion, Phase 2 of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System will convey used water from the western part of Singapore to the Tuas plant for treatment.\n\nIt is expected to be completed by 2025, replacing progressively the water reclamation plants in Ulu Pandan and Jurong.\n\nThe Deep Tunnel Sewerage System, a massive underground sewerage superhighway, is the backbone of Singapore's used water management system. The first phase of the system, which covers eastern Singapore and channels used water to the Changi water reclamation plant, was completed in 2008.\n\nSee more on\n\nPUB\n\nNational Environment Agency", "images": []}

I've heard of many successful cases where people in various jobs decide to try new things, decide to even take lower pay, because... (they) need to rebuild (their) careers. So I'm very glad that these changes are happening.\"\n\nThe mid-career attachments can range from four to nine months and must start by March 31 next year. A job is not guaranteed after the attachment, but host organisations can consider hiring workers who perform well when business conditions improve.\n\nWorkers on the attachments will get a monthly training allowance of between $1,400 and $3,000, of which 80 per cent will be funded by the Government, said WSG.\n\nSome firms already on board are GIC, United Overseas Bank and Watsons Singapore.\n\nWSG chief executive Tan Choon Shian said: \"We empathise with the anxieties mid-career individuals face during this difficult time and have stepped up efforts to ensure quality attachments with clear development plans so that they can quickly and confidently embark on permanent jobs once the economy recovers.\"\n\nMr Heng said that employers also have to adapt, picking staff who might not be the perfect fit but are willing to learn.\n\n\"Employers must redesign jobs so that we can make the best use of the skills of our people, make full use of all the tools that we have put out under our Industry Transformation Maps, to both upgrade the skills of our workers and upgrade our operations. And in fact, when the Covid-19 situation passes... they will be able to emerge stronger, they will be more competitive, more productive.\"\n\nThe attachment programmes are part of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package announced in the Fortitude Budget speech in May.\n\nIn total, some 100,000 jobs, traineeships and training places will be created to help job seekers.\n\nWSG is also stepping up efforts to make services more accessible, with SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres set up around the island providing career advice and job matching services. All Housing Board towns will have a centre by Aug 15, with eight opening on Saturday.\n\nThese centres have helped 1,300 job seekers since the first batch of eight centres started operating on July 1, said Mr Tan.\n\nThe agency is also holding virtual career fairs online and setting up SGUnited Jobs and Skills information kiosks in areas with high footfall.

The rate for Singaporeans rose to 4 per cent, from 3.5 per cent, and the rate for Singaporeans and permanent residents combined rose to 3.9 per cent, from 3.3 per cent, preliminary data released by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) yesterday showed.\n\nStill, unemployment remained lower than previous peaks during the global financial crisis and the Sars outbreak, said the ministry.\n\nThe number of unemployed Singaporeans climbed nearly 20 per cent to 79,600 last month, up from 66,900 in March. Together with permanent residents, there were 90,500 unemployed residents last month, up from 76,200 in March.\n\nTotal employment, including those on work passes but excluding foreign domestic workers, plunged by 121,800 in the second quarter - the biggest quarterly fall on record. This is more than four times the fall in the first quarter, and means that the economy has shed a net 147,500 workers in the first half of the year.\n\nRetrenchments more than doubled in the second quarter, with 6,700 workers laid off, up from 3,220 in the first quarter. This was higher than the peak of 5,510 during the 2003 Sars outbreak, but below the 2009 global financial crisis high of 12,760, said MOM.\n\nLayoffs rose significantly in the last quarter in wholesale trade and transport equipment due to lower demand for retail and air travel.\n\nManpower Minister Josephine Teo said yesterday that the contraction in employment was \"quite reflective of the workforce composition\" in terms of the spread between local and foreign workers, but added that the exact breakdown is not yet available.\n\nShe also noted that the jobs situation may not have bottomed out.\n\n\"The outlook is still uncertain,\" she said. \"Singapore is very plugged into the global economy. When there's weakness in global demand, companies are likely to be much more cautious.\"\n\nIn services, the second-quarter contraction in employment was sharpest in food and beverage; retail trade; arts, entertainment and recreation; and education. Construction also saw a steep drop in employment, while manufacturing saw a more modest decline.\n\nMrs Teo noted that the construction, marine and process industries will need more adjustment as they deal with strict requirements for resuming activity on worksites, and said there will be support, as the Government looks into foreign worker levies.\n\n\"We know very well that they've carried the heavier burden on behalf of all of us, and we are very mindful that we will try our best to support them throughout this period of transition,\" she said.\n\nNational Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said he was concerned that the figures may not reflect the full picture, as older workers who are not re-employed, or foreigners whose work passes are not renewed, are not included in the overall retrenchment numbers.\n\nObservers expect unemployment to rise in the coming months, as measures like the Jobs Support Scheme taper off.\n\nYesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat also announced that traineeships will be expanded to cater to mid-career job seekers. They can apply for over 13,000 attachments from Saturday.\n\nMr Heng urged employers to take on workers who may not be the perfect fit but are willing to learn, saying: \"When the Covid-19 situation passes... they will be able to emerge stronger.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nEmployment", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/kcemploy2907.jpg?VersionId=9Cu4kvc1Rsb1IVLFWFg8M72mUxidos5v", "alt_text": null}]}

But without a character to fear or hate, movies lose emotional weight. Villains, too often the most underdeveloped characters, come alive in films released this week.\n\nIn the opening scenes of the documentary\n\nThe Kingmaker\n\n(PG13, 101 minutes, opens today at The Projector, 4.5 stars), Mrs Imelda Marcos, former first lady of the Philippines, hands out cash to the beggars of Manila, clucking with concern.\n\nThat act of minor munificence - when contrasted with the billions she and her late husband Ferdinand Marcos plundered from the treasury and thereby helping create beggars - is infuriating. But it signals this is a work that is not afraid to take sides.\n\nThis fascinating character study of the dowager, who is still active in politics personally and through her son Bongbong (Ferdinand Marcos Jr), covers her past as a beauty queen from the provinces, her husband's rise to power and her time as first lady in the 1960s to the 1980s, when she sought to make Malacanang Palace - the presidential residence - a centre of culture and glamour.\n\nThat fantasy of a Kennedy-style Camelot came crashing down when People Power protesters stormed the palace, revealing to news cameras her infamous shoe collection.\n\nWith almost every word she speaks, the self-proclaimed \"mother of her people\" revises history, gaslights and claims victimhood.\n\nDirector Lauren Greenfield, an American, then cuts to an image or interview that tells the opposite story, showing her to be a liar.\n\nSadly, this tactic only brings to mind a depressing current reality: In a nation with a leader who boasts about making it great again, the comforting lie, once uttered, cannot be reined in with the truth, and Mrs Marcos seems to know it.\n\nDon't let the strange title of South Korean crime thriller\n\nBeasts Clawing At Straws\n\n(NC16, 108 minutes, opens today at The Projector, 4 stars) put you off. This work, adapted from the 2011 Japanese novel of the same name, is as slick and accomplished as they come.\n\nIt belongs to the canon of noirish works in which everyone is rotten and the only difference is by how much.\n\nIn a series of chapters that deal with different timelines and characters, eight people become involved with a bag of money. As their relationships with one another become clearer, events get bloodier.\n\nSouth Korean thrillers can be just as violent as Western ones, but they also go where Hollywood fears to tread, such as in scenes showing men beating and torturing women. They can be discomfiting to watch, but writer-director Kim Yong-hoon, making his feature debut, intends to make a point about the world in which his characters live. The realistic cruelty, extravagant violence and graphic novel-style black humour come together seamlessly.\n\nThe baddies in the reality-based disaster movie\n\nFukushima 50\n\n(PG, 122 minutes, opens today, 2.5 stars) are the bosses of the power company in charge of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which was rocked by explosions following the March 2011 tsunami that struck eastern Japan.\n\nThese executives, intent on saving their reputations, underplayed risks and issued confusing, contradictory instructions during the repair phase of the operation.\n\nThe suits from Tepco (Tokyo Electric Power Company, given a litigation-proof name in the movie) are the most interesting part of the film, but are left unexplored as characters. Instead, as the title suggests, this work celebrates the 50 or so lower-level men and women who remained at their posts when most would have fled.\n\nSo what could have been an interesting look at the anatomy of a disaster becomes a repetitive, pantomime-like reenactment of bravery, with employees volunteering for ever more hazardous jobs.\n\nThe extravagant acting and lack of psychological insight are wearying, proving that disaster films are best attempted decades after the event, safely out of the reach of lawyers or the need to burnish one aspect at the expense of others.\n\nOther films opening this week but not reviewed include Force Of Nature (NC16, 93 minutes, opens today), in which an ex-cop (Mel Gibson), his daughter (Kate Bosworth) and another cop, fallen from grace (Emile Hirsch), must foil robbers attempting a heist in their building during a hurricane.\n\nIn the thriller Unhinged (NC16, 93 minutes, opens today), single mother Rachel (Caren Pistorius) has a scary but all too common exchange of words with another driver at a stop sign. That driver, Tom (Russell Crowe), as the movie's title suggests, has issues with women and reacts violently.\n\nRadioactive (NC16, 110 minutes, opens today) from Iranian-French director Marjane Satrapi (the celebrated animation work Persepolis, 2007) stars Rosamund Pike as scientist Marie Curie, the French-Polish physicist who discovered radioactivity.\n\nSee more on\n\nReviews\n\nMovie review", "images": []}

This encompasses East Coast and Marine Parade GRCs, as well as the single-seat constituencies of Mountbatten and MacPherson.\n\nIt is designed to be a six-month scheme, with each young person given seed funding of up to $5,000 to implement their ideas in the district.\n\nThough the ideas must come from young people themselves, they will be linked up with grassroots advisers who will serve as mentors, and get a monthly allowance of up to $1,000 for their time and commitment. After six months, participants will take part in a symposium to share what they have learnt from the project.\n\nThe CDC will work with institutes of higher learning, such as polytechnics, ITE College East, and Singapore University of Technology and Design to recruit those interested. Applicants do not need to be residents in the district.\n\nDr Maliki, who is also Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Education, was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the South East District Conference, which was attended by several other MPs.\n\nAmong them was Marine Parade MP Fahmi Aliman, who will succeed Dr Maliki as mayor of the district.\n\nDr Maliki said his nine-year stint was meaningful, with much done to reach out to various segments of the community. He said he was confident Mr Fahmi would do an excellent job as mayor. Mr Fahmi jokingly said: \"The minister has assured me there will be a 'warranty period', so any time I have issues or things I need to clarify, he will be there.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCommunity Development Councils\n\nPeople's Association", "images": []}

Fans hoped they would become an official couple.\n\nThe duo were known as the \"koala couple\" in the show. Koala is \"wu wei xiong\" in Mandarin and the pair have the Chinese characters \"wu\" and \"wei\" in their names. They even have a Weibo fan page dedicated to them. The page has since been removed.\n\nHowever, after his marriage announcement, fans are now condemning Pan for being \"dishonest\" and \"ugly\" by taking part in the reality show while dating Xuan, whom Apple Daily Taiwan reported is a Shanghainese air stewardess.\n\nOne netizen criticised his lack of consideration towards Xuan and that his appearance on the show was \"cruel to everyone involved\". Another said Xuan was \"pitiful\".\n\nOthers felt angry for Wu. One netizen said: \"Using other girls. Playing with their feelings and pretending to be affectionate, dedicated and innocent.

These include wines, cosmetics and perfumes.\n\nAnyone who has information about such transactions must alert the authorities, said the DPP.\n\nFor failing to do so, Indonesian Sherly Muliawan, 41, who worked for general wholesale trade firm T Specialist International, was fined $10,000 yesterday.\n\nShe pleaded guilty to five charges under the UN Act involving luxury goods worth more than $1.4 million in total. Seventy-four other similar charges linked to the remaining amount were considered during sentencing.\n\nThe DPP said Singaporean Ng Kheng Wah, 56, was a director and sole decision-maker for the firm. It directly supplied the luxury items to the Korean Bugsae Shop in North Korea from November 2010 to January 2017.\n\nThe shop is owned by North Korean Li Ik, whose son, Li Hyon, had studied in Singapore before helping his father with the business here. DPP Lim said the items were sent to North Korea via trans-shipment through Dalian in China.\n\nNg had deliberately concealed the fact that they were destined for North Korea by failing to declare the final port of delivery to Singapore Customs.\n\nDPP Lim added that Li Ik, and later Li Hyon, would arrange for payment to be made to T Specialist through front companies in China and Hong Kong.\n\nThe court heard that Sherly took instructions from Ng. Her job scope included sourcing the luxury items and ensuring that the Korean Bugsae Shop made payments.\n\nIn July 2017, she became aware of negative news on North Korea and its nuclear activities. She also came across a news article stating that Ng, through his firm, had exported sanctioned luxury goods there.\n\nShe failed to alert the authorities about the transactions even after reading the report, said the DPP.\n\nNg was sentenced to 34 months' jail in November last year after pleading guilty to 10 counts each of cheating and illegally supplying luxury items to North Korea.\n\nT Specialist was fined $880,000.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore courts\n\nCrime", "images": []}

But I did not punch you.\"\n\nMr Sherborne said the admission that Heard hit Depp would have caused \"consternation\" if the roles were reversed.\n\n\"He has never hit a woman in his entire life. Period, full stop, nada,\" Mr Sherborne said.\n\nHe said The Sun's article was \"not researched at all\" and presented in a one-sided manner, effectively convicting Depp of a crime he had never committed.\n\nHeard gave a statement outside the court, saying it had been painful to relive the break-up and have her truth and motives questioned.\n\n\"I stand by my testimony and I now place my faith in British justice,\" she said.

In honour of the composer's 250th birth year anniversary, the work will be brought to life once more on International Friendship Day today.\n\nLed by Singapore's Wong Kah Chun, chief conductor of the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra, the virtual performance, Beethoven 360\u00b0, brings together a cast of musicians from across 25 nations performing music from the renowned German composer's Ninth Symphony.\n\nPieced together with digital submissions by instrumentalists and singers from music institutions worldwide, the show also brings together more than 1,000 participants as part of a global campaign for a singalong in the Ode To Joy segment.\n\nFor postgraduate music student and Beethoven 360\u00b0 participant Goh Mok Cheong, 24, today's premiere is a rare chance to share his passion with his family.\n\nThe bassoonist has trained in music for 11 years and is a freelance musician. He joined the project in May after working with Wong on a similar project in April.\n\nSays Mr Goh: \"My parents do not have a musical background, but Ode To Joy will still be relatable to them. More than just a Covid-19-related virtual performance, this has given us the opportunity to adapt and put across a message of solidarity together.\"\n\nMr Arkadiusz Czopor, managing director of information and communications technology firm T-Systems South Asia, which is a platinum sponsor of the project, says the concert \"builds links with technology that allow us to reconnect through the beauty of Beethoven's music\".\n\n\"We could easily identify with the project and hope that it offers a small token of relief to musicians in Singapore and beyond at a time when artists worldwide are struggling with the effects of the pandemic,\" he adds.\n\nThe performance is also a step forward in deepening cultural ties between Singapore and Germany.\n\nThe show propels the annual German-Singaporean open-air concert, Beethoven Im Garten, into the virtual world for listeners from across the globe to enjoy from the comfort of home.\n\nPresented by the German embassy in Singapore and the Foundation for The Arts and Social Enterprise with funding support from sponsors including Singapore's National Arts Council (NAC) and the Federal Foreign Office of Germany, Beethoven 360\u00b0 is the first partnership of its kind between a foreign embassy and a local cultural institution since the outbreak of the pandemic. The performance is also part of NAC's #SGCultureAnywhere campaign.\n\nGerman Ambassador to Singapore, Dr Ulrich Sante, says the idea for a concert was sparked by his meeting with Wong and the mutual understanding that there was a niche audience that was appreciative of classical music.\n\nDr Sante says the previously outdoor concert, with people of different nationalities sitting together enjoying music, was an inspiration.\n\n\"Not only as a diplomat but as a human being on this globe, that is what I think this globe needs, such a way of communicating with each other without any prejudice,\" he adds.\n\nReflecting on the digitalisation of the concert this year, Dr Sante says the presentation of the music from the Ninth Symphony through the virtual medium was exceptional.\n\nThe concert also marks another key milestone - The Straits Times' 175th anniversary.\n\nMr Warren Fernandez, editor-in-chief of Singapore Press Holdings' English/Malay/Tamil Media Group and editor of The Straits Times, says: \"This year we are marking the 175th anniversary of The Straits Times. So when I heard about the project, Beethoven Im Garten and the Ode To Joy which celebrates universal brotherhood and that sense of all-togetherness, it seemed to make sense.\n\n\"This being the 250th anniversary of Beethoven's birth as well as me being a lover of the music, it all came together and therefore I was very happy to be a part of the project.\"\n\nThe show is optimised for smartphones and tablets but can also be watched on computers.\n\n\u2022 Beethoven 360\u00b0 will premiere on The Straits Times' Facebook and YouTube channels at 8pm today.\n\nSee more on\n\nMusic\n\nDigitalisation", "images": []}

Shanmugam yesterday.\n\nCiting the Hong Kong protests that have lasted since March last year, Mr Shanmugam said they demonstrated the importance of exercising the freedom of assembly responsibly. While the protests initially started as an objection against a proposed extradition Bill, they later spiralled into a broader issue of \"people versus the police\", said Mr Shanmugam, who was speaking during a virtual Home Team National Day Observance Ceremony.\n\nApart from the social and economic reasons for the longstanding protests, he said it was his view that allowing protests by default, with police intervening only when violence occurred, created an \"impossible situation\" for the police, which was known as one of the finest in Asia.\n\n\"You have a large group of peaceful protesters - easy for a small group of instigators to infiltrate these mass or peaceful protests and orchestrate violence... and that puts the police in a very, very difficult situation,\" he added.\n\nThe situation in the financial hub was also worsened by biased media reporting from foreign and local media, which generally left out violent acts against the police and instead, focused on police responses, causing public sentiment to turn against the police, he said. In comparison, in Singapore, protests may be held only at Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim Park. This has allowed Singapore to preserve public order on the streets and avoid disrupting people's lives, while still allowing expression of views in public, he said.\n\nThe second lesson for Singapore, said Mr Shanmugam, is the importance of trust, which is hard-earned and precious for any law enforcement agency. \"Trust is built up when people see that the system is fair and it works for them - the social economic system,\" he added. \"If people don't have trust in the entire system, then no amount of police enforcement action can bring order to a society.

It's like a laboratory, a test of how such an important event can be organised,\" he said, adding that safety measures would include empty seats between moviegoers, temperatures taken at entrances and online-only tickets.\n\nOther festivals cancelled this year include the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado, New York's Tribeca Film Festival and South by Southwest in Austin, Texas.\n\nCannes, the highest-profile festival to cancel, will bestow a \"Cannes 2020\" label on selected films that would have been shown on the Croisette in May but which will now premiere at other festivals.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, NYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nFilm festivals/awards\n\nMovies\n\nItaly\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_VENICE30PIX2_5851050.jpg?VersionId=1KqgpnSH1bLbtGaUXqQAK0eCbstHHttv", "alt_text": "Festival director Alberto Barbera (left) and festival president Roberto Cicutto (far left) after a press conference for the 77th Venice International Film Festival on Tuesday.

Forward-looking term rates are more exposed to market factors on a single day's fixing, such as quarter or year-end volatility.\n\nThe report thus assessed that rather than transitioning Sibor to a new polled benchmark, it would be beneficial in the long run for SGD financial markets to shift to a Sora-centred SGD interest rate market. This will avoid market fragmentation, facilitate transparency and easier comparison of loan pricing, and promote the development of deep and efficient SGD financial markets, said the report.\n\nThis comes as the industry is gearing up to transition fully from SOR to Sora, which is the average rate of unsecured overnight interbank SGD transactions brokered in Singapore.\n\nSOR - the current benchmark used to price derivatives and business loans here - will be replaced by the Sora, given the end of the scandal-tainted Libor after end-2021, as the SOR uses USD Libor in its computation.\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition for existing Sibor users, the report proposed for the transition to be done in a phased approach. Transition of contracts referencing the more widely-used 1M and 3M Sibor will take place after the industry has substantially completed the transition from SOR to Sora, which would essentially be in three to four years.\n\nMr Samuel Tsien, ABS and SC-STS chairman, noted in a statement that major financial centres globally will be moving onto a risk-free rate (RFR)-centred approach or increasing the use of their RFRs.\n\n\"The Sora-centred approach will better position SGD financial markets for the future,\" he said. \"It will allow users of SGD floating rate products, including retail consumers and SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) with products that reference Sibor today, to benefit from a deeper and more efficient market, and greater transparency.\"\n\nMs Jacqueline Loh, deputy managing director, Monetary Authority of Singapore, and an SC-STS member, said the shift to Sora is \"an important step forward by the industry that will enhance liquidity and improve the overall functioning of SGD interest rate markets\".\n\nSibor, which tracks the US Fed's rate movements, has fallen sharply since the Fed cut rates in March. As of yesterday, 3M Sibor stood at 0.438, down sharply from 1.627 per cent on March 3, before the earlier Fed announcement.\n\nTHE BUSINESS TIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nInterest rates\n\nLoans\n\nBanks and financial institutions", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/28/ak-placeholder2.jpg?VersionId=Ra58hRzsVKYtu81xsDk788qn7GDEuNDX", "alt_text": null}]}

Expenditure fell 51.6 per cent to $1.89 billion due to lower net fuel cost and cost-saving measures from capacity cuts, the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday.\n\nSIA had entered the first quarter \"at a time when market conditions were deteriorating rapidly due to the spread of Covid-19 globally\", the group said. \"Demand for air travel evaporated as travel restrictions and border controls were imposed around the world to contain the spread of the virus.\"\n\nPassenger carriage fell across SIA, SilkAir and Scoot, resulting in a 99.5 per cent decline for the company.\n\nThe deep plunge in traffic for all three passenger airlines could only be partially offset by improvements in cargo flown revenue, SIA said.\n\n\"The airfreight capacity crunch, coupled with strong demand for urgent movements of personal protective equipment, pharmaceutical and fresh foods, brought about a significant improvement in cargo load factor,\" SIA said, adding that it has deployed passenger aircraft on cargo missions to boost cargo capacity. But the integration of SilkAir into the group is on track, it noted.\n\nOn its outlook, SIA noted that international air travel is not recovering as quickly as expected, with industry experts such as the International Air Transport Association and International Civil Aviation Organisation projecting that it will take between two and four years for passenger traffic numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe group's passenger capacity by the end of the next quarter is projected to be about 7 per cent compared with pre-Covid-19 levels.\n\nIt further estimates that capacity may be less than half of pre-Covid-19 levels by the end of this financial year. \"We are reviewing the shape and size of our network over the longer term, given Covid-19 and its impact on our passenger traffic and revenue, which will provide clarity on fleet size and mix that (SIA) will need.\"\n\nThe review is expected to be completed by end-September.\n\nThe group's shareholders' equity at end-June amounted to $17.6 billion, buoyed by an $8.8 billion rights issue backed by Temasek Holdings. It also secured $750 million from long-term loans on some of its Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 787-10 planes.\n\nIn all, SIA has raised about $11 billion in liquidity since the start of its financial year in April.\n\nIn a research report yesterday, DBS analyst Paul Yong urged investors to hold on to the company's shares. \"Given the wide and varying degrees of success in flattening the curve or managing the outbreak among various countries, we believe that international air travel demand could take up to a year to gradually recover to pre-Covid-19 levels,\" he said.\n\nThe key risk that the company faces is \"if travel demand remains substantially subdued for a prolonged period\", he added. \"While air travel demand has plunged quickly in recent weeks, a prolonged drop in air travel demand will lead to more losses for SIA.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_VNSIA_5852512.jpg?VersionId=ommcJGGyRaQHIie2IcROkqq91YGOAELh", "alt_text": "Singapore Airlines planes parked on the tarmac of Changi Airport last month as air travel demand evaporated amid travel restrictions and border controls imposed around the world to contain the spread of the coronavirus."}]}

That marks a big change for the industry, where major films were not released for home viewing before an average of three months in theatres.\n\n\"The theatrical experience continues to be the cornerstone of our business. The partnership we've forged with AMC is driven by our collective desire to ensure a thriving future for the film distribution ecosystem and to meet consumer demand with flexibility and optionality,\" said Ms Donna Langley, chair of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, in commenting on the deal.\n\nUniversal distributes the Fast & Furious and Despicable Me franchises, among other films.\n\nAMC, the largest theatre chain with 8,000 screens across North America, will share in the revenue from the on-demand business.\n\n\"AMC enthusiastically embraces this new industry model,\" said AMC chief executive officer Adam Aron, adding it could help studio profits and lead to more new films.\n\n\"This multi-year agreement preserves exclusivity for theatrical viewing for at least the first three weekends of a film's release, during which time a considerable majority of a movie's theatrical box office revenue typically is generated,\" he added.\n\nThe full terms of the deal, which also applies to releases from Universal's Focus Features, were not disclosed. Universal and AMC are discussing distribution plans for Europe and the Middle East, the companies said.\n\nThe agreement comes as the movie industry is facing a sort of reckoning as the coronavirus pandemic has shut down movie theaters across the US and brought movie productions to a screeching halt. AMC Theatres is aiming to reopen its cinemas in August.\n\nStudios have been pushing to make their movies available in living rooms sooner than the typical timeline of roughly 90 days after they debut in cinemas.\n\nThe deal comes as a surprise as AMC and Universal Pictures have been at loggerheads after the latter forged ahead with early digital releases.\n\nAMC in April announced that it will no longer play any Universal Pictures movies on its screens after the studio released the children's film sequel Trolls World Tour directly to on-demand platforms because of the pandemic.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nMovies\n\nCinemas", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_DEAL30_5850648.jpg?VersionId=UJCveSVmygHATe2XRQw96h4UGS9g5yOU", "alt_text": "AMC Theatres announced in April it will no longer play any Universal Pictures movies on its screens after it released Trolls World Tour (above) directly to on-demand platforms because of the pandemic."}]}

Bernstein analyst Kevin Kwek said: \"If no limit was imposed, the Singaporean banks would stand out among the few globally.\n\n\"Nevertheless, it takes away one reason to own the stocks in the face of low interest rates and I expect the stocks will suffer from knee-jerk selling.\"\n\nThe Republic's largest bank, DBS Group, is due to report its second-quarter results next Thursday, together with United Overseas Bank.\n\nOCBC Bank will report the following day. According to chief executive Samuel Tsien, the bank plans to heed the MAS' request.\n\n\"With worsening economic conditions as well as significant uncertainties over how the crisis will evolve, it is only prudent for us to conserve and build up our capital to support our customers during this very difficult period,\" he said in an e-mailed statement.\n\nIn a statement to the Singapore bourse, DBS said it expects to cap its dividend at a total of $0.18 per share per quarter over the next four quarters, or $0.72 per share total.\n\nThe 60 per cent cap \"recognises the interests of shareholders as it is not as severe as the restrictions in some other jurisdictions, which include an outright halt to distributions\", a DBS spokesman said.\n\nIn April, the MAS had urged banks to ensure that sustained lending took priority over discretionary distributions, but added that it did not \"see a need to restrict banks' dividend policies\".\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nMAS/Monetary Authority of Singapore\n\nDividends", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/yq-massg-29072022.jpg?VersionId=t0YraYSBNeDQJ05bsM5a5bc9vclZqp9C", "alt_text": null}]}

This was thanks to an improvement in revenue due to the income recognition of more projects completed during the year, as well as continued cost-control measures at the corporate level.\n\nThe performance of regional markets was mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.45 per cent, while China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index jumped 2.06 per cent and the Shenzhen Composite Index rallied 2.90 per cent.\n\nSouth Korea's benchmark Kospi climbed 0.27 per cent - their highest close since late January.\n\nBut Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slid 1.15 per cent as the yen rose. Malaysia's KLCI added 0.09 per cent. Analysts said markets would struggle to build on the strong gains seen since their March bottom.\n\n\"There's enough stimulus and support in the market from a monetary policy perspective, but also from fiscal, and that keeps a nice floor under the market,\" said Ms Amanda Agati at PNC Financial Services Group.\n\n\"But we also think it's going to be very difficult to make a lot of forward progress in this environment.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nBulls & Bears\n\nStock market", "images": []}

The proceeds will be used to partially finance the redevelopment of the hotel into a biophilic and zero-waste 347-room hotel. Biophilic refers to a design concept that seeks to integrate nature with the built environment.\n\nPan Pacific Orchard was closed for redevelopment in April 2018 and is targeted to open in 2021.\n\nUOL says the 23-storey hotel will set a new benchmark for green hospitality, with its self-sustaining sky terraces using rainwater harvesting systems and solar cells to light up the gardens. Other sustainable features include a food waste management system that transforms kitchen waste into nutrient water for gardens, and water dispensers that eliminate the need for plastic bottled water.\n\nIn January, the hotel was awarded the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Platinum. The award is Singapore's highest environmental certification, recognising projects whose design and performance adhere to best practices in environmental sustainability.\n\nUOL Group chief executive Liam Wee Sin said: \"The inaugural green loan demonstrates our commitment in greening our urban habitat. Pan Pacific Orchard will contribute to our Government's vision to transform Orchard Road into a green oasis in the city.\"\n\nMr Leong Yung Chee, UOB's head of corporate banking Singapore, said: \"While the tourism industry is currently feeling the effects of Covid-19, UOL's move to redevelop the Pan Pacific Orchard will position Singapore well for a future where sustainable tourism is given more focus.\"\n\nShares in UOL closed higher at $6.70 yesterday.\n\nSee more on\n\nLoans\n\nSustainable living/development\n\nHotels\n\nSingapore companies", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/st_20200730_awuol30_58520902.jpg?VersionId=o2s2Gi0JPYQwCoY7CaDcYFkwO1HgCyOU", "alt_text": "Pan Pacific Orchard was closed for redevelopment in 2018 and is targeted to reopen next year.

The oil trader's founder Lim Oon Kuin admitted he had directed the firm to hide about US$800 million in futures trading losses.\n\nOCBC noted that the Lims further paid themselves dividends of US$30 million in 2017 and US$60 million in 2018 from Hin Leong when there were no profits to support such dividends, and withdrew US$19 million from Ocean Tankers shortly before filing for the debt moratorium.\n\nThe serious irregularities extend to the affairs of Xihe and its four units, OCBC said.\n\nIt noted that \"bareboat charters of OCBC-financed vessels were terminated without OCBC's consent, and the Xihe units have persistently failed to... collect payments from Ocean Tankers for months or years, to the prejudice of creditors of the Xihe group, and in breach of contractual obligations owed to OCBC\".\n\n\"Especially in the light of the interlinked businesses, common ownership and leadership of the debtor companies, Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers, independent judicial managers need to be appointed urgently over the debtor companies to investigate the serious irregularities and prevent further prejudice to creditors,\" OCBC said.\n\nSee more on\n\nDebt restructuring/Insolvency\n\nFamily feuds\n\nOil and gas sector", "images": []}

Mr Euben Paraceulles, an economist at Nomura Holdings, estimates the rate could reach 4.5 per cent in the second half of this year.\n\nMr Paul Hoon said he resigned from his job in early June after signing a contract to be a regional supplier quality manager with a US-based firm that designs and builds commercial fans. The day before he was due to start, the firm told him it had \"ceased\" the contract because of the economic blow from Covid-19.\n\nMr Derrick Lim also lost out on a new job.

That's worse than the median forecast of -8.3 per cent and follows a revised 9.1 per cent drop in the first quarter that was the worst dating to 1974 data.\n\nRevised second-quarter figures as well as an updated forecast for GDP growth in 2020 will be released on Aug 14, according to the government report.\n\n\"Locally, the recent surge in Covid-19 cases has clouded the near-term outlook for domestic economic activity,\" the government said in the release. \"Nonetheless, once the local epidemic is contained again and external environment continues to improve, the Hong Kong economy hopefully will gradually recover in the rest of the year.\"\n\nHong Kong reported 118 additional coronavirus cases yesterday, bringing total infections to 3,002, Department of Health official Chuang Shuk-kwan said at a briefing.\n\nThe overall economic situation stabilised somewhat during the quarter, especially in May and June when the virus was largely under control, the government said. On a quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the economy contracted 0.1 per cent in the three months to June.\n\nStill, Hong Kong's economy shows few signs of a recovery after suffering repeated setbacks over the past year. The United States-China trade war and anti-government protests first pushed the city into recession in the second half of 2019. Then the global pandemic this year eroded what little tourism remained, decimating the city's retail, food and beverage and hospitality industries.\n\n\"As an international hub that relies on passenger and goods flows, this figure summarises the sharp contraction of tourism and the event industry,\" said Mr Raymond Yeung, greater China chief economist with Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. \"As the case numbers rise again in July and the government starts to tighten, the outlook for Q3 remains very challenging. Another quarter of negative growth is highly probable.\"\n\nThis latest fall marks four consecutive quarters of economic contraction, equalling the period after the global financial crisis. The current stretch is only one quarter behind the longest recession on record, when Hong Kong's economy shrank for five quarters in 1998-1999.\n\nThe city's unemployment rate has surged to a 15-year high, leaving thousands jobless and the poor even more vulnerable. Retail sales likely had a double-digit fall again in June, according to forecasts of data due today.\n\n\"We expect many small restaurants to shut down and unemployment will rise to around 8 per cent,\" said Ms Iris Pang, greater China chief economist with ING Bank NV. The unemployment rate is currently at 6.2 per cent.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nHong Kong\n\nRecession\n\nGDP\n\nCoronavirus", "images": []}

The status recognises the project's \"strategic significance\", which is expected to inject billions of dollars into the economy and create thousands of jobs, Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe Australia-Asean Power Link envisions connecting the solar farm and battery system in the Northern Territory to Singapore and Indonesia via a 3,700km undersea cable. Similar proposals for long-haul, transnational shipments have been pursued in other regions, including from North Africa to Europe.\n\nThe high-profile boost by the Australian government contrasts with the relatively muted interest from Singapore, which is expected to be its main customer. Singapore's Energy Market Authority acknowledged in November that it had met the project's developer, Sun Cable, but has shown little public appetite in the venture. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment yesterday.\n\nSun Cable says the project can supply a fifth of Singapore's power needs. The project, backed by Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and Fortescue Metals' founder Andrew Forrest, plans to start marine survey work next month. The firm aims to start commercial operations in 2027.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nSee more on\n\nRenewable energy\n\nAustralia", "images": []}

The next race is this weekend's British Grand Prix.\n\n\"The reality is that our car is not competitive.

I am sure of this,\" he added.\n\nFerrari were runners-up last season but Mercedes have won an unprecedented six successive constructors' titles and are favourites to make it seven this year after a dominant start.\n\nSweeping technical and sporting rule changes that were due to come in next year have been postponed to 2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with teams continuing to use this year's cars next year.\n\nElkann said their 2020 car has structural weaknesses that have been around for some time in aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics, and had lost engine power.\n\nHe asked 'suffering' fans to be patient, recalling that Ferrari's golden era with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher only came after a long drought.\n\nSchumacher joined Ferrari in 1996 and had to wait until 2000 for his first title with them, the third of his career, to end a 21-year wait for the Maranello-based team.\n\nFerrari, who last won a title in 2008, have had four team principals in six seasons but Elkann said Binotto was fully supported.\n\n\"Complete confidence,\" he declared. \"Also because Mattia Binotto, who has been at the helm for a year, has all the competencies and characteristics to start off a new winning cycle.\n\n\"He was at Ferrari with (former team boss Jean) Todt and Schumi, he knows how to win. From next year he will be working with two young drivers as ambitious as us.\"\n\nAsked whether Ferrari were right not to renew the contract of four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, who is leaving at the end of this year, Elkann said it was harder to rebuild with those who have already won than those yet to succeed.

I'd been on holiday mode. We actually booked flights, me and my wife booked flights for a little family European holiday.\"\n\nWilliams is still under contract with the Wolfpack, who would normally bar him from playing in the NRL, but the game's hierarchy bent the rules to allow him in due to \"exceptional circumstances\".\n\nThe New Zealander also needed a special exemption to fly into Sydney with his wife and children, as only Australian citizens are being allowed in at the moment.

This national database contains the facial images and identities of four million local residents aged 15 years and above, captured through applications for passports and NRICs.\n\nIts use has so far been limited to official purposes, including verification at border checkpoints and in some government buildings to limit access rights.\n\nWith SingPass Face Verification, private-sector organisations can now tap the nation's digital identity infrastructure to securely verify online transactions without needing to build their own systems.\n\nDBS Bank is the first private-sector entity to pilot the service, which is integrated into its digibank app.\n\nFor a start, its customers can choose to scan their faces - instead of entering their ATM, credit or debit card number and a corresponding PIN - to sign up for an online banking account. Users need to download the latest version of the bank's digibank app, rolled out yesterday, to access the new feature.\n\nIn the coming months, new customers may also be able to scan their faces remotely to verify who they are without having to upload pictures of their NRIC or show up in person to, say, open a bank account.\n\nMr Jeremy Soo, head of Consumer Banking Group (Singapore) at DBS, said: \"Together with GovTech (Government Technology Agency), we aim to support those who are journeying into digital banking for the first time and to help foster resilient digital habits that will last for years to come.\"\n\nThe Straits Times reported on the government-backed facial identification service involving greater use of the national biometric database in November 2018.\n\nDr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative, announced the service in Parliament in February this year.\n\nPeople here are already scanning their faces or fingerprints on their phones to access e-government services via the SingPass Mobile app, which was launched in 2018 and now has 1.6 million users.\n\nHow it works\n\n\u2022 Launch the latest version of the DBS digibank app.\n\n\u2022 Select the identity type: NRIC, Malaysian IC or passport.\n\n\u2022 Enter the identity number.\n\n\u2022 Select SingPass Face Verification to verify the user.\n\n\u2022 Take the selfie.\n\n\u2022 The captured image will be matched instantly against the latest records in the Government's biometric database.\n\n\u2022 Upon successful matching, DBS will send a one-time password (OTP) to the user's registered mobile number via SMS.\n\n\u2022 Enter the OTP and create a user ID to register an online account to access mobile banking services.\n\n\u2022 The facial data will not be retained by the bank.\n\nPrivate-sector firms like insurer NTUC Income are also using the SingPass Mobile app to secure access to their e-services.\n\nSingPass Face Verification takes the mobile service forward by matching captured facial images against the biometric database.\n\nThis step makes it easier to verify high-risk online transactions, including those involving cashier's orders of more than $10,000, said experts.\n\nSaid Mr Kok Ping Soon, chief executive of GovTech, which created the SingPass authentication system: \"We look forward to building more impactful services with the financial sector and beyond to bring greater convenience to our citizens.\"\n\nSingPass Face Verification's launch, with DBS as its first user, follows a successful trial earlier this month with more than 100 seniors and students from ITE College West.\n\nSome users found facial verification to be more convenient as they do not need to remember their PIN number or whip out their ATM, credit or debit card to complete the registration process.\n\nPreviously, those without a card or who could not remember their PIN number had to wait up to five working days to receive their card or PIN number by post to activate their digital banking accounts.\n\nSaid retiree Nancy Yeo, 66: \"Registering for an online banking account by facial scanning was just like taking a selfie photo with my grandchild on my smartphone... it really isn't as complicated as I had thought.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nSingpass\n\nDBS\n\nCyber security\n\nSmart Nation", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/ST_20200730_XSINGPASS_5852432.jpg?VersionId=bF3MkQfeNh3j.ef_ORB6zrLUwQHjD_ph", "alt_text": "Private-sector organisations, such as DBS Bank, can now tap the nation's digital identity infrastructure to securely verify online transactions.

The mall was clean and not overcrowded,\" she declared excitedly.\n\nThey have good reason to feel safe there amid the coronavirus pandemic. The lifestyle and retail complex has rolled out strict safety measures that include SafeEntry at entrances and exits; cleaning and sanitation of high-touch areas such as lift buttons, directories and escalator handrails; and clear signage and floor markers reminding visitors to keep a safe distance.\n\nThe crowd is a far cry from what Jewel saw during the circuit breaker period from early April to June, when almost everything at the attraction screeched to a halt.\n\nDuring the eight-week shutdown, key attractions at Jewel previously teeming with families emptied and less than a sixth of its shops and food and beverage (F&B) outlets remained open.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Jewel staff leapt into action.\n\n\"We had always planned for the next big pandemic,\" said Mr Muhammad Fithri Abdul Jaffar, 33, Jewel's senior manager of retail experience.\n\nStaff were trained to operate in a pandemic before the first case of Covid-19 hit Singapore, based on Changi Airport's past experiences with infectious diseases like the H1N1 virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars).\n\n\"Having crisis and business continuity plans beforehand, such as temperature screening procedures and an isolation plan for visitors who feel unwell, helped us to transition easier when the safe management measures were implemented,\" he said.\n\nWell before the Government-enforced safety requirements for businesses in May, Jewel implemented temperature screening and encouraged tenants to maintain a distance between diners at F&B outlets.\n\nSafety no walk in the park\n\nKeeping Changi Airport's crown jewel safe and clean has by no means been easy.\n\nIts lean team of about 60 employees, which outsources the cleaning of the premises, has had to balance strict hygiene and cleaning protocols with customer experience and the expectations of tenants from more than 280 eateries and shops.\n\n\"For tenants with a big following like Pokemon, Shake Shack and A&W, we worked with them to put floor markers and offered them spaces, like the common corridor, so that they can accommodate customers while making sure they keep a safe distance,\" said Mr Fithri.\n\nHis team speaks to tenants regularly to understand their challenges and help them implement safe management measures properly.\n\nBefore Canopy Park - an indoor park the size of 11 Olympic-size swimming pools on Jewel's top floor - reopened to the public on July 3, staff were redeployed from other tasks to manage crowds and enforce safe management measures.\n\nHigh-touch surfaces and play areas like the Mirror Maze and Sky Nets were coated with a self-disinfecting agent called sdst, which can last for six months. The antimicrobial coating, made in the United States and approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency, kills bacteria, viruses and fungi upon contact and remains in place even with repeated scrubbing and cleaning.\n\n\"Even the turf in play areas is coated with this antimicrobial agent because there may be kids touching it. We do frequent wipe downs of high-touch areas on top of this coating,\" said Mr Alex Foo, 31, a manager in Jewel's Retail Experience team.\n\nMr Julian Hu, 30, a senior executive in Jewel's Guest Experience team, stressed that the park now limits visitors to 25 per cent of its normal capacity.\n\nQuick action to enhance safety and hygiene levels has paid off. Attractions at Jewel received an SG Clean certification from the Singapore Tourism Board, and the mall saw families returning during the mid-term school break in July.\n\nMr Teh, who visited Jewel last Sunday, said: \"There was a general bustling atmosphere within the mall. We saw families with young children and couples. People didn't need to crowd around storefronts and we felt at ease.\"\n\nCommenting on Jewel's safety measures, Mr Kelvin Tan, head of user experience, noted: \"We are committed to ensuring that Jewel continues to be a safe destination for everyone with the necessary precautionary measures in place. Our guests can be assured that their health and well-being are of utmost importance to us, and we hope they can still enjoy a 'sparkling' time in Jewel despite the lingering concerns over Covid-19.\"\n\nHow Jewel is keeping you safe\n\nMinding your gap\n\nCapacity at its parks has been reduced to 25 per cent to ensure safe distancing and contactless payment options are available\n\nSigns of the times\n\nSignage and floor markers where queues are likely to form encourage visitors to keep at least 1m apart\n\nExtra degree of safety\n\nTemperature screening and SafeEntry for contact tracing are deployed at entry and exit points\n\nClean-up crew\n\nHigh-touch elements are frequently cleaned and disinfected, hand sanitisers are easily accessible at high-touch areas and cleaning robots are deployed to assist cleaning efforts\n\nWhat visitors should take note of\n\nScan SafeEntry QR code or allow staff to scan your ID for contact tracing\n\nKeep at least 1m apart from other people\n\nWear masks at all times in public areas\n\nAvoid crowded places\n\nUse contactless payment whenever possible\n\nView the full list of\n\nsafe management measures for attractions here\n\n.\n\n\u200b \u200bBrought to you by\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of Trade and Industry\n\nJewel Changi Airport\n\nTourist attractions\n\nBranded content", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/scrub_robot_jewel.jpg?VersionId=gYmwGPIDn29mwHWfg7G3384nGI_tobU6", "alt_text": "Rain Vortex, Jewel Changi Airport"}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/mr_julian_hu_muhammad_fithri_and_alex_foo_of_jewel_changi_airport_.jpg?VersionId=1WjJdhU.MQSBWYP.nlPtaG3yAko00eKl", "alt_text": "Canopy Park, Jewel Changi Airport, safe management measures"}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/disinfecting_high_contact_area_bouncing_net.jpg?VersionId=RfO4NaM.J_hwTkEgouEWK3RAqWiU4Qj1", "alt_text": "Canopy Park, Jewel Changi Airport, safe management measures"}]}

The largest stands 30 feet (9.1m) tall. The heaviest weighs about 30 tonnes.\n\n\"The sarsen stones make up the iconic outer circle and central trilithon (two vertical stones supporting a horizontal stone) horseshoe at Stonehenge. They are enormous,\" said University of Brighton geomorphologist David Nash, who led the study published in the journal Science Advances.\n\n\"How they were moved to the site is still really the subject of speculation,\" Nash added.\n\n\"Given the size of the stones, they must have either been dragged or moved on rollers to Stonehenge. We don't know the exact route but at least we now have a starting point and an endpoint.\"\n\nStonehenge's smaller bluestones previously were traced to Pembrokeshire in Wales 250km away, but the origin of the sarsens had defied identification.\n\nA sarsen core sample, extracted during conservation work in the late 1950s when metal rods were inserted to stabilise a cracked megalith, provided crucial information.\n\nIt was given as a souvenir to a man named Robert Phillips who worked for the company involved in the conservation work and was on-site during drilling.\n\nPhillips took it with him with permission when he emigrated to the United States in 1977, living in New York, Illinois, California and finally Florida, Nash said.\n\nPhillips decided to return it to Britain for research in 2018. He died this year.\n\nThe researchers analysed fragments of the sample - destructive testing being off limits for megaliths at the site - to establish the geochemical fingerprint of the sarsen from which it was taken.\n\nThat fingerprint matched sandstone still at West Woods and all but two of the Stonehenge sarsens.\n\n\"I hope that what we have found out,\" Nash said, \"will allow people to understand more about the enormous endeavour involved in constructing Stonehenge.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nBritain\n\nHistory", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/2020-07-29t174734z_928658276_rc253i9utpsb_rtrmadp_3_science-stonehenge.jpg?VersionId=RSG2UNH.ZDMYKNoBFqKEtgMt4yx0VRbE", "alt_text": null}]}

In a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied this under oath and was contradicted by a later news report.\n\nBezos answered cautiously that the company had a policy against such actions. \"If we found that somebody violated it, we would take action against them,\" he said.\n\nOn the Republican side, Representative Jim Jordan accused the companies of taking a long list of actions that he said showed they try to hamper conservatives from reaching their supporters.\n\n\"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" he said. The companies have denied allegations of political censorship.\n\nJordan and Cicilline had a heated exchange within 30 minutes of the hearing's start, tangling over Jordan's request to allow another member of Congress to join the panel.\n\nJordan's allegations come after President Donald Trump, who has clashed with several of the biggest tech companies, on Wednesday threatened to take action against them with Executive Orders.\n\n'STREET FIGHT'\n\nCEO Cook rejected the notion there is nothing to stop Apple from raising the commissions it charges in the App Store.\n\n\"I disagree strongly with that,\" he said. \"The competition for developers - they can write their apps for Android or Windows or Xbox or PlayStation. We have fierce competition at the developer side and the customer side, which is essentially so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business.\"\n\nIn his opening remarks, Zuckerberg told lawmakers that China is building its \"own version of the Internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries.\"\n\nCook pointed out that the fiercely competitive smartphone market includes China's Huawei Technologies, which has been a focus of considerable US national security concern.\n\nA detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four tech platforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nApple", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/2020-07-29t184504z_1531396512_rc263i9wzpwn_rtrmadp_3_usa-tech-congress.jpg?VersionId=hmcut_jMKHKZpy2vAxV2A_wg1.jWxIMG", "alt_text": null}]}

People aren't going out to restaurants, bars, gas stations, pharmacies and beauty salons as much,\" he said, although he noted that housing and motor vehicle sales had remained strong.\n\nMr Powell said that the path of the economy would depend to a very high extent on the course of the virus and the measures taken to keep it in check.\n\n\"Social distancing measures and fast reopening of the economy actually go together. They're not in competition with each other,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, the Federal Open Market Committee announced it would keep interest rates unchanged at 0 to 0.25 per cent indefinitely, until it was \"confident that the economy has weathered recent events\".\n\nIt also vowed to use its full range of tools to support the economic recovery.\n\n\"Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment have picked up somewhat in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year,\" it said in its post-meeting statement.\n\n\"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,\" it added.\n\nThe decision had been expected by markets, which had a muted reaction to the news. Separately, Fed officials also announced that they would extend their emergency lending programs until the end of the year.\n\nCalling the pandemic the \"biggest shock to the US economy in living memory\", Mr Powell said there was a need for more fiscal support as he praised the earlier coronavirus packages that had \"kept people in their homes and businesses in business\".\n\nCongress is currently drawing up a fresh coronavirus relief Bill, with the US$600 (S$824) weekly addition to jobless benefits officially set to expire on July 31. But negotiations are stalling as Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on issues such as unemployment insurance and assistance for renters and homeowners.\n\nEven if the reopening goes well, it will still take a long time for certain parts of the economy that involve \"lots of people gathering together in close proximity\" to bounce back, Mr Powell warned, citing restaurants, bars, hotels and travel accommodation as examples.\n\n\"Many of the people who were laid off from those industries... can't go back to their old job. There won't be enough jobs for them. Those people are going to need support if they're to be able to pay their bills, to continue spending money, to remain in their current rental house or apartment,\" he said.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS Federal Reserve\n\nJerome Powell\n\nInterest rates\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": []}

Furthermore, promoting local brands during this pandemic is more important than ever, as recent numbers released by the Singapore Department of Statistics revealed there were 3,706 business closures in May alone.\n\nTo lend a hand, you can raise awareness about your favourite local brands through Partipost, a crowd marketing platform that links brands with real consumers on social media.\n\nIt's accessible to anyone with a social media account - Partipost does not impose a minimum requirement on the number of social media followers each user has, which means aspiring influencers can sign up too.\n\nFrom engaging with small, independent businesses to being part of a supportive local community, here are three reasons why you should sign up with Partipost.\n\n1. Connect with small, independent businesses\n\nUnlike commercial enterprises, most smaller businesses are not equipped with the same budget or resources to promote their products. Hence, developing genuine connections with potential customers via word of mouth supports their sustainability in the long run.\n\n\"Partipost enhances our visibility by providing an opportunity for the public to endorse and create real testimonials for their favourite brands,\" says Mr Jason Koh, 36, business development director of health supplements label Go Pure.\n\nIndeed, Partipost hosts a wide selection of social media campaigns on its mobile app, making it easy for consumers to reach out and spread the word online.\n\nThis usually involves creating an Instagram story or post that promotes a business or product on their personal accounts - from a portfolio of over 300 brands.\n\nThis includes local companies such as telco and digital services start-up Circles.Life, restaurant reservation booking platform Chope and fashion label Saturday Club. To participate, simply follow the campaign requirements, snap a photo and submit your post to the brand for approval via Partipost's app.\n\n2. Earn special perks and payouts\n\nJoining Partipost does not only benefit businesses; users are privy to rewards when they partake in campaigns too.\n\nAs a perk, it offers payouts that range from $2 to over $100 for approved content that accumulates with an increase in engagement. For instance, on top of base payouts that come with creating a post or story, likes, tags and comments are added bonuses that users can earn, depending on the criteria of the campaign.\n\nOnce users have accumulated their earnings, cashing out is a fuss-free and secure process.\n\nAll users have to do is set up a Partipost wallet with their bank account details upon signing up, and their earnings will be deposited into their wallets. They can then withdraw their earnings - a minimum of $5 - before transferring the amount directly to their bank accounts.\n\n3. Be a part of a community\n\nBy encouraging users to generate buzz about their favourite brands online, Partipost helps build a community of fans for these businesses and connect users to other like-minded individuals.\n\nBrands can drive more publicity for themselves by reposting these campaigns on their own social media accounts. This additional exposure helps boost engagement for Partipost users, allowing them to expand their network as well.\n\n\"I joined Partipost three years ago and have uncovered so many local gems since. Through Partipost's campaigns, I found new skincare essentials such as Iryasa, lesser-known eateries such as Poco Loco, DIY workshops such as Streaks n Strokes and more,\" says user Nicole Lee.\n\n\"Being a content creator with Partipost goes beyond just campaigns. It is heart-warming to receive direct messages from followers on products and services that I've reviewed for Partipost.

But it is not all doom and gloom. This Youth Month, we celebrate the youth who are empowering themselves, reflecting optimism and resilience\u2026\n\nFull-time polytechnic student Ruzaini Syazwan spent his nights delivering food to the homeless during Ramadan, while freelance emcee Elson Leong conducted online talk shows and workout programmes to bolster his income amid the pandemic. PHOTOS: RUZAINI SYAZWAN, ELSON LEONG\n\nJeremy Theseira, Content STudio&nbsp;\n\nFollow topic:\n\nNATIONAL YOUTH COUNCIL\n\nPublished\n\nJul 30, 2020, 04:00 AM\n\nLike many among the young grappling with the new normal from Covid-19, Ms Sarah Annuar is upset and wracked with worry.\n\n\"My anxiety and stress levels rose high. A-Levels is seven months away,\" says Ms Annuar, 21, in a letter on May 31.\n\nReferring to Covid-19, she writes: \"You took my precious time studying in school, having consultations and the ability to meet up with friends.\n\n\"How dare you?\"\n\nA final year student at Millennia Institute, Ms Annuar was expressing her initial difficulties with the transition to home-based learning as she prepares for the exams.\n\nIn another letter on May 14, freelance emcee Elson Leong, 30, recounts the impact on his livelihood when the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition level was raised to orange in February.\n\n\"That hit the brakes on almost all my gigs. I was emceeing a Chinese New Year celebration for a German company by the Singapore River that very night. That was my very last 'live' event since.\"\n\n\"I was frustrated.\"\n\nMr Leong, who is also a sports coach developer and personal development trainer, had no income in February and March.\n\nThe letters are just two of over 700 submissions to\n\nDear Covid-19\n\n, a nationwide memory project that sheds light on everyday life during Covid-19. Young Singaporeans are being asked to share their experiences through user submissions in different formats such as photos, poems, songs and letters to preserve this historic moment in time.\n\nLaunched in May, the initiative was conceptualised by the National Youth Council (NYC) in partnership with Singapore-based marketing agency DSTNCT.\n\nWhile the anxiety reflected in the responses is understandable, there has also been a strong streak of the can-do spirit.\n\nMr Leong, for example, got back on his feet by conducting online talk shows and workout programmes, and even delivering parcels to bolster his income.\n\nMr Leong is grateful for the opportunities despite earning only 20 per cent of the income he drew before Covid-19.\n\n\"Though the income is far from what is usual, I am thankful that I have some work to do.\"\n\nYoung Singaporeans are stepping forward - both for themselves and for others - to make the best of a challenging situation.\n\nRecent poll findings show that youth are prepared to take tougher employment options and lower their expectations. A majority (95 per cent) of the young polled in a National Youth Survey by the NYC felt that it was an important life goal to acquire new skills and knowledge.\n\nIn another study, the NYC-Millieu Sentiment Poll on the Economic Situation found that 92 per cent of youth were pragmatic and are willing to consider a variety of alternatives, should their current employment or employment prospects be affected.\n\nFully 45 per cent said they are open to picking up new skills during the Covid-19 pandemic such as digital skills and data analytics.\n\nMr David Chua, chief executive of NYC, shares his optimism, given the many positive examples that show the best of Singaporean youth stepping up.\n\n\"In the midst of this global pandemic, it is admittedly a tough time not only for our young people, but for everyone. Despite this adversity, we have seen our youth staying resilient and capitalising on opportunities.\"\n\nHe adds: \"As Youth Month comes to a close, we want to applaud such youth - from those stepping up to serve the vulnerable to others who are learning new skills and adapting to ways to support themselves and their families.\"\n\nTaking a step back to help others\n\nLife finally seemed to be coming together for Ms Grace Ke, 29.\n\nWithin the past year, Ms Ke started her own clothing business, got married and became a proud homeowner of a four-room Housing Board flat.\n\nShe worked in the advertising industry for six years before leaving last year to start Lunchmoney, a women's clothing business that incorporated pockets in their designs.\n\n\"I felt unfulfilled in advertising as a lot of my work wasn't tangible and the working environment made me very anxious.\"\n\nShe adds: \"I wanted more control over my time, and I also wanted to be able to tangibly know that I created something.\"\n\nWhen Covid-19 struck in January, her fledgling business took a hit. Her supplementary income streams from being a freelance designer and boxing coach were also affected.\n\nBut instead of despair, she felt liberated.\n\n\"I decided then and there that for the first time in my life, I didn't need to sell X number of dresses or clock Y number of hours to validate myself.\"\n\nShe turned her attention to helping those facing a more dire situation and started designing and selling her own masks with a dual objective - to seize a new opportunity and help society while doing so.\n\nAlong with a business partner, Ms Ke started\n\nSatki\n\n- handcrafted masks that are stylish and comfortable. A portion of its sales - 10 per cent - goes to Over the Rainbow, an initiative that provides support for youth mental wellness.\n\n\"Satki has given me meaning to my days. I don't work a traditional job anymore, and being able to commit myself into creating an improved version of what has now become a necessity, while being able to give back to the community has meant the world.\"\n\nHope from helping the hungry\n\nFor 29-year-old Ruzaini Syazwan, this past Ramadan was exceptionally challenging.\n\nThe first-year Nanyang Polytechnic student would spend his day in front of his computer attending lessons online, before heading out in the evening on his motorcycle to deliver food to the homeless across Singapore.\n\nTo curb the spread of the coronavirus, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore closed all mosques on March 24. This meant that the homeless could no longer receive the meals provided by the mosques for the breaking of fast.\n\nTroubled by this, Mr Syazwan decided that he would personally deliver packets of food to them, and appealed for donations via his\n\npersonal Instagram account\n\n.\n\nThis evolved into the Umbrella Initiative, which by the third week of Ramadan, had grown into a 30-man operation that delivered close to 500 meals to the homeless and underprivileged families daily till the end of Ramadan.\n\n\"Towards the end of Ramadan, I was really stretched,\" he says, about juggling school work and managing the food deliveries.\n\n\"But when you've been doing it for two to three weeks, people start to recognise you and the thought of them waiting for food kept me going.\"\n\nTap opportunities, get involved\n\nIn supporting youth through Covid-19, the National Youth Council is spearheading efforts with a host of programmes and initiatives, from personal development to getting involved in the community.\n\nYouth Corps Internship Scheme\n\nGeared towards making a social impact, the internship scheme provides youth with the opportunity to gain insights on social issues and industry experience in the community and social sector, along with volunteering opportunities.\n\nAsia-Ready Exposure Programme\n\nTo be launched next month, the youth development programme will offer opportunities to deepen participants' knowledge of the region and cultivate a holistic understanding of the social and cultural aspects of the Asean states, China and India.\n\nYouth Expedition Project Goes Online\n\nA service-learning experience without leaving the country, the programme allows youth to continue volunteering with overseas communities virtually.\n\nMehGoWhere\n\nLooking for resources to pivot in the new normal? The online portal is filled with resources on jobs and the economy, mental well-being, financial literacy, and ideas on how to get engaged in the community.\n\nGradGoWhere\n\nA digital career toolkit that aims to provide graduating students and graduates with a curated list of career resources and job opportunities.\n\nYoung ChangeMakers Grant (YCM)\n\nGot an idea to help the community?

This was a \"placeholder text... mistakenly published to the site,\" Brad Dayspring, Politico's vice-president of marketing and communication, said.\n\nThe text was quickly taken down but not before leaving a few Washington insiders wide-eyed.\n\n\"Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris to become his running mate for the 2020 election on Aug 1, two weeks before the Democratic National Convention, after keeping his choice close to the chest for months,\" Politico wrote in the premature news item.\n\nIt said that Biden saw Harris as \"a worthy opponent\" during their primary clashes and that she would bring name recognition, her years as a California prosecutor and \"skill as a debater\" to the ticket.\n\nGAME STILL ON?\n\nOf course, it's possible that Politico really did mistakingly run a text that had been prepared just in case of Harris winning - a common practice in news organisations.\n\nAnd it's possible that Biden's notes meant nothing other than that he admires Harris. The same points in the notes could, in theory, be used to praise her during a speech to announce he'd chosen somebody else.\n\nOther candidates, particularly Rice, have been talked up in the final stretch.

It is exceeded by the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Peru and Chile.\n\nThe pace of infections has accelerated since the US death toll passed 100,000 on May 27.\n\nThe epicentre has also moved, to the South and West from the area around New York, which still has by far the highest toll for one state at more than 32,000.\n\nTHREE STATES\n\nCalifornia, Florida and Texas reported record increases in Covid-19 deaths for a second day in a row on Wednesday, according to the Reuters tally.\n\nCalifornia had 185 fatalities in the past 24 hours and Florida reported 217 new deaths. Texas had at least 311 deaths with some counties yet to report.\n\nOnly two other states, New York and New Jersey, have ever reported more than 300 deaths in a single day.\n\nThe three states - the most populous in the country representing 27 per cent of US population - have the largest outbreaks, eclipsing the previous US epicentres of New York and New Jersey.\n\nCoronavirus deaths are rising in 27 states, up from 23 states a week ago, according to a Reuters analysis of deaths the past two weeks compared with the prior two weeks.\n\nThe rising numbers have crushed early hopes the country was past the worst of an economic crisis that has decimated businesses and put millions of Americans out of work.\n\nHealth experts have been saying for months that the US outbreak could be brought under control if guidelines to maintain social distancing and wear masks in public were followed everywhere.\n\nSuch measures became a hot partisan issue after President Donald Trump, who initially played down the seriousness of the health crisis after the first US case in January, refused to wear a mask.\n\nTrump has since come around to supporting masks but has still not imposed a national mandate requiring them.\n\nFlorida commercial pilot Rob Koreman, 50, of Fort Lauderdale, said he had been stunned by the climbing numbers in his state.\n\n\"I'm a pilot and hit so many cities, so many people on board, I have to be aware,\" he said.\n\n\"Basically, none of this should have happened. We needed state coordination, if not flat-out a federal mandate.\"\n\nINDOOR PARTIES\n\nLouie Gohmert, a Republican lawmaker from Texas who has refused to wear a mask in the past, tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, raising concerns that other members of Congress may also have been exposed.\n\nAttorney-General William Barr, who testified to a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that Gohmert took part in, will be tested for coronavirus as a result, a Justice Department spokesman said.\n\nIn a video posted to Twitter, Gohmert said he had worn a face mask frequently in the past week or two, including at Tuesday's hearing.\n\nOfficials in New Jersey, the state with the second highest death toll, again pleaded with young people to avoid large gatherings that have been a breeding ground for the virus.\n\nGovernor Phil Murphy singled out some parties that have led to clusters of new cases.\n\n\"Coronavirus is more easily transmitted indoors. Crowded indoor house parties are not smart or safe,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nWith the scheduled reopening of schools days away in some states, the Trump administration is pushing for students to return to classrooms, while some teachers and local officials have called for learning to remain online.\n\nThe University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), whose forecasts are closely watched by policymakers including the White House, first predicted in March that the pandemic could kill more than 81,000 by July after easing in June.\n\nIn its latest statement on July 14, the IHME said its model now projects the US death toll at more than 224,000 by Nov 1.\n\nIt also said that number was not set in stone.\n\n\"Use of masks is up, but not as high as it should be. If 95 per cent of Americans wore masks each time they left their homes, infection rates would drop, hospitalisations would drop, and forecast deaths would drop,\" the IHME said.\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/30/2020-07-29t181404z_1228383726_rc263i96wlbd_rtrmadp_3_health-coronavirus-usa.jpg?VersionId=1j.Xgd5I8Y9iQ6TbhH3c8hU_ZP9SBS8w", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/23069047f0f972587c899c2e06755fc990e78ca72273f7f35f64c20564b426bb", "alt_text": "Vapes that contain vape juice mixed with potent ingredients like etomidate or ketamine are known as Kpods."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/135815069c3c93763e7dda3f4540319fb53ad2280963d7b539bb90e7887dc989", "alt_text": "The body of a 67-year-old man is transported to a hearse at Block 190A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang on November 4, 2022."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cc17a0a1cfe99acc457eb3a45f35f62430dcfb329734805f6019e3e1bd059a05", "alt_text": "The 31-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three years and a month in jail, and four strokes of the cane ."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e92d817765bf4bee096e3042ea3a63665a33ddabcde25c891cb21454d8d3b9b4", "alt_text": "Keppel Energy Nexus, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya will receive co-funding for the studies."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}]}

We appreciate the effort of members of the public in reaching out to those who seem to be in need,\" it said.\n\n\"However, posting and sharing their circumstances on social media may lead to further distress for these vulnerable groups of people and their families. Such posts may not correctly reflect the circumstances of vulnerable groups of people, who may be elderly, or may not share all the details accurately because of the stressors they are facing.\"\n\nThe MSF encouraged the public instead to link individuals up with a Social Service Office (SSO) or Family Service Centre, to seek help.\n\nOn Monday, a social media user posted on his public Twitter account his encounter on the train with an elderly woman who works as a cleaner. Mr Koh Meng Shuen quoted her as saying that she was seeking additional employment to earn a living.\n\nAccording to his post, she said she earned just $5 per hour working as a cleaner at the hawker centre at Our Tampines Hub.\n\nShe also told him she lived with two friends in a flat, and struggled to make ends meet after losing both her husband and only son.\n\nMSF said that SSO officers identified the woman, whom they called \"Madam L\", and visited her on Tuesday to see what help or support they could render.\n\nIt added that she \"indicated she was unaware of being photographed or that her comments and photo would be shared in public on social media\".\n\nThe Ministry said Madam L has a younger son and lives in a five-room flat with his family.\n\n\"The family has a domestic helper. Her son provides her with food and shelter but she works to supplement her other expenses.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (Mindef) confirmed that Madam L's elder son, a regular warrant officer, died during a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) freefall training session in South Africa in May 2009.\n\n\"Full compensation was paid out to his family. Mindef and the SAF extend their deepest condolences to the family,\" said MSF in its post.\n\nBefore the Covid-19 circuit breaker kicked in on April 7 this year, Madam L had received a monthly gross salary of about $1,300, excluding Central Provident Fund (CPF) deductions, the MSF said.\n\n\"Due to reduced business volume, her employer had arranged for her and other full-time employees to work part-time as a way to retain staff. She is currently paid $675 for working part-time in 4-hour shifts (or about $6.50/hr),\" said the Ministry.\n\n\"We understand from her employer that when business improves, they will review and reinstate the cleaners' part-time employment to full-time.\"\n\nTo help with her lost wages during this period, the MSF is assessing her eligibility for the Covid-19 Support Grant, which provides between $500 and $800 monthly.\n\nMadam L is a permanent resident (PR) and has not applied for Singapore citizenship before, so she does not qualify for schemes like the Silver Support or Workfare, MSF said. However, she receives benefits like the Solidarity Payment that are also extended to PRs.\n\n\"In addition, we will support her in other ways. Grassroots organisations will support her with $120 food vouchers monthly for the next six months. We are also arranging for her to get some help for her medical expenses,\" it added.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin urged members of public to stop going to find Madam L at her home or workplace.\n\nMr Tan said in a Facebook post that some of the SSO officers who located Madam L, told him she has been \"harassed at home\" ever since the post went up.\n\n\"Lady is distraught by all the attention the post has brought to her. The manager at the hawker stall there has stopped any further contact with her,\" he said.\n\n\"I know many of you mean well.

And it's these sorts of guesses that we suggest underestimate how many species are lost when habitat is lost (and how many are saved when habitat is saved or restored),\" he said.\n\nTop stories\n\nSwipe.

Mr Khairy, the son-in-law of ex-premier Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, is often seen as the face of moderation within the Malay nationalist party.\n\nUmno is the biggest component in the five-month old Perikatan Nasional (PN) government led by Prime Minister Muhyiddin, with 38 MPs.\n\nIn contrast, Mr Muhyiddin's Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, the second biggest part in the Perikatan Nasional administration, has 32 MPs.\n\nAnalysts said that Umno is currently divided, with different camps pushing the party in different directions, but asserted that Najib still holds sway within the party despite his graft conviction.\n\n\"Reality is Umno is divided. Some want to leave Perikatan (Nasional). Some want to move on, and not drag this (Najib) case (with them),\" Universiti Utara Malaysia analyst, Professor Dr Mohd Azizuddin Mohd Sani, told The Straits Times.\n\nThe current Umno No 2 - Mohamad Hassan - who flanked Najib at court on Tuesday, had previously called for a snap election to be held in order to return the mandate to the people, underlining the party's fragile relationship with PN.\n\nUmno supreme council member Puad Zakarshi on Wednesday also criticised Mr Muhyiddin's administration following the court decision, seemingly questioning why only Umno politicians are facing charges and not leaders from Bersatu, Mr Muhyiddin's party.\n\nHowever, one partner that both Umno and Najib seem to have firmly on their side is PAS, with whom they have another partnership called Muafakat Nasional. Umno leaders such as Mr Puad have asserted that Umno is better off on a Muafakat Nasional platform than with Perikatan.\n\nPAS leaders, including president Hadi Awang, visited Najib at his home immediately after the court proceedings on Tuesday, with Mr Najib describing them as \"true friends\".\n\nDatuk Seri Hadi expressed confidence that Mr Najib would be able to clear his name in the higher courts.\n\nDr Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said: \"Umno along with PAS actually won 75 per cent of Malay votes in the last election. The mistake was PAS split Umno's votes. But now that they are together, you are seeing them win a string of by-elections.\"\n\nDr Oh said that Najib is still a \"plus\" for Umno even though he is currently unable to contest an election, and some factions within the party would not mind if it were to set the former premier aside.\n\nDr Azizuddin said that Najib could still field his son, also an Umno member, to replace him in his home constituency of Pekan should he be unable to contest in elections, and as a result, maintain his influence.\n\n\"As a former prime minister, he can influence Umno's decision. He can pull off something to show he can still dictate things in the party. However, this is subject to Umno allowing it to happen,\" he said.\n\nMr Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, a senior associate at Vriens & Partners, noted: \"There are those within Umno who have held the view that Najib is becoming more baggage than asset, and the party's efforts should be focused towards strengthening the party's position within PN.\"\n\nHe said while Najib could still utilise his pull to garner support among Malays, it would be a challenge to convince voters that he is a victim of persecution.\n\n\"There's too much bad press on him already, which may give the impression of UMNO 'defending the indefensible.' But the litmus test for UMNO would be to start a new chapter and to take stock of its current pool of leaders and decide where the party goes from here,\" Mr Shazwan said.\n\nSee more on\n\nNajib Razak\n\nMalaysia\n\nUmno", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/yq-najib-29072022.jpg?VersionId=kATvXmQ3lsz4K0TyZnKTcrBIcMsi.EXO", "alt_text": null}]}

We think a state election should be called and we return it to the people to decide,\" Datuk Leiking said, as quoted by The Star.\n\nMr Musa said he has received statutory declarations from the assemblymen confirming their stand to join the new alliance he is leading.\n\n\"I also wish to inform that (federal) Home Minister Hamzah Zainudin and the political secretary to the prime minister had paid a courtesy visit to the governor this morning to notify him that the new alliance that is in support of PN has attained a simple majority to form the government,\" he said.\n\nMr Musa was Sabah's chief minister for 15 years until Umno's shock defeat in the May 2018 election, to PH-backed Warisan.\n\nHis comeback gathered momentum after all 46 counts of graft levelled against him, when PH was in power, were withdrawn on June 9.\n\nIf Mr Musa is successful, this would make Sabah the fifth state lost by PH and its allies after its federal government collapsed at the end of February.\n\nPH was left without majority support in the federal Parliament, after Tan Sri Muhyiddin led some 40 MPs out of the coalition.\n\nPN currently controls nine of Malaysia's 13 state governments, having captured Johor, Melaka, Perak and Kedah in the last five months since coming to power.\n\nPH and its allies are confined to ruling the state assemblies of Selangor, Penang, Negeri Sembilan and, for now, Sabah.\n\nSeveral pro-Shafie lawmakers have claimed they were enticed with up to RM32 million (S$10.4 million) each to switch camps.\n\nA change in Sabah could significantly strengthen Mr Muhyiddin's grip in the federal Parliament as well, where his PN government holds only a slim majority with 113 of Parliament's 222 lawmakers.\n\nSome of the 10 Sabah MPs currently in federal opposition could also be persuaded to cross the floor, if PN were to take over the state.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nPakatan Harapan\n\nMuhyiddin Yassin\n\nCorruption", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/yq-musaaman2-29072022.jpg?VersionId=Mi.99wjRPF2MEMqcII3W0fUcFu_gczXe", "alt_text": null}]}

Shanmugam on Wednesday (July 29).\n\nCiting the Hong Kong protests that have lasted since March last year, Mr Shanmugam said they demonstrated the importance of exercising the freedom of assembly responsibly.\n\nWhile the protests initially started as an objection against a proposed extradition Bill, it later spiralled into a broader issue of \"people versus the police\", said Mr Shanmugam, who was speaking during a virtual Home Team National Day Observance Ceremony.\n\nApart from the social and economic reasons for the protracted protests, he said it was his view that allowing protests by default, with police only intervening when violence occurred, created an \"impossible situation\" for the police force, which was known as one of the finest in Asia.\n\n\"You have a large group of peaceful protesters - easy for a small group of instigators to infiltrate these mass or peaceful protests and orchestrate violence... and that puts the police in a very, very difficult situation,\" he added.\n\nThe situation in the financial hub was also worsened by biased media reporting by foreign and local media, which generally left out violent acts against the police and instead, focused on police responses, causing public sentiment to turn against the police, he said.\n\nIn comparison, in Singapore, protests may be held only at the Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim Park. This has allowed Singapore to preserve public order on the streets and avoid disrupting people's lives while still allowing expression of views in a public setting, he said.\n\nThe second lesson for Singapore, said Mr Shanmugam, is the importance of trust, which is hard-earned and precious for any law enforcement agency.\n\n\"Trust is built up when people see that the system is fair and it works for them - the social economic system,\" he added. \"If people don't have trust in the entire system, then no amount of police enforcement action can bring order to a society. Because the public has lost trust in the entire system, so why should they follow the rules?\"\n\nThis can be seen in the United States, where the Black Lives Matter movement is a wider manifestation of distrust of the police after years of \"perceived institutionalised racism and brutality\", said Mr Shanmugam.\n\nIn Singapore, however, the situation is different, with 90 per cent of Singaporeans expressing trust in the police in public perception surveys. Other Home Team agencies, including the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), Singapore Prison Service and Central Narcotics Bureau, also have \"very high levels of trust\" that have been earned over the years, he said.\n\nBut trust is easily lost, and maintaining it starts from the political level and down the line, to every Home Team officer, he added.\n\nIn his speech, Mr Shanmugam also acknowledged the Home Team's front-line efforts in the Government's Covid-19 response, in addition to its day-to-day responsibilities.\n\nThe ceremony recognised 168 Home Team officers, volunteers, organisations, team projects and operations, as well as members of the public for their contributions over the past year.\n\nAmong those who received the Minister for Home Affairs National Day Awards was 31-year-old Staff Sergeant (SSG) Muhd Khairul Anuar from SCDF, a Hazmat Specialist at Tuas Fire Station.\n\nHe joined the SCDF in 2012 after witnessing firefighters in action when he was 11 years old, and has attended to several major incidents including the oil tank fire in Jurong in April 2016, an oil storage tank fire in Pulau Busing in March 2018, and a chemical waste fire at 48 Tuas Crescent in December last year.\n\nSee more on\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs\n\nPolice\n\nK Shanmugam\n\nHong Kong protests", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/yq-cvd-29072022.jpg?VersionId=Ox8FN0IpK40yMu_HBom69yFi1LuIoIlh", "alt_text": null}]}

The Mail has justified publishing Meghan's letter on the basis that she had revealed its existence in People, via her friends, and that was what drove her father to disclose its contents.\n\nOne section of the Mail's article was titled: \"HOW MEGHAN'S MEDIA FIGHTBACK LED HER DAD TO REVEAL LETTER HE WANTED TO KEEP SECRET\".\n\nMeghan has told the court in a written statement that she did not authorise her friends to speak to People. She said they \"made a choice on their own to speak anonymously with a US media outlet... to defend me from the bullying behaviour of Britain's tabloid media\".\n\nThe identities of the five are known to the Mail because they were named in a document filed to court by Meghan's lawyers in July as part of the legal proceedings. Associated Newspapers disputes that the document should be treated as confidential.\n\nIn her witness statement, Meghan said \"for the Mail on Sunday to expose them (her friends) in the public domain for no reason other than clickbait and commercial gain is vicious and poses a threat to their emotional and mental wellbeing\".\n\nShe also accused the Mail of seeking to \"create a circus and distract from the point of this case - that the Mail on Sunday unlawfully published my private letter\".\n\nIn written arguments in response, Associated Newspapers' lawyers accused Meghan of using \"extravagant and extreme language\" to express an opinion not based on evidence.\n\nIt said the Mail had shown restraint by not publishing the names even though there was no legal restriction preventing it from doing so.\n\nJudge Mark Warby will give his ruling on whether the friends can be named at a later date.\n\nSee more on\n\nBritain\n\nRoyal families\n\nMedia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/2020-07-09t090334z_819112382_rc2lph9xy2os_rtrmadp_3_britain-royals-meghan.jpg?VersionId=zHgNNEKSEplRFfLGhMkXScg_qjUj0cuH", "alt_text": null}]}

But in the last week or two, I have worn a mask more than I have in the whole last four months.\"\n\nRepublican Representatives Mike Johnson and Kay Granger and Democratic Lawmaker Ra\u00fal Grijalva said they would self-quarantine after being in contact with Gohmert, according to statements from their offices or media reports.\n\nMasks, which health experts say help prevent coronavirus transmission, have become a symbol of America's bitter political divide, with some Republicans, including Gohmert, shunning them after President Donald Trump long refused to wear one in public.\n\nGohmert's announcement prompted new discussions among congressional leaders about coronavirus safety protocols and a declaration by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that all members and staff are now required to wear masks on the floor of the House.\n\nPreviously, they had been encouraged to wear masks on the floor and required to wear masks in committees, although some lawmakers, mostly Republicans, did not comply.\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Committee Chairman Representative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat, scolded several Republicans, including ranking member Jim Jordan, for failing to wear masks.\n\nGohmert said he wore a mask during the proceedings.\n\nIn a Twitter posting on Wednesday, Nadler wished Gohmert a \"full and speedy recovery.\"\n\nCovid-19 has killed more than 150,000 people in the United States, and almost 4.4 million have tested positive for the virus, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nInfection rates have begun to soar in recent weeks after states lifted earlier restrictions on social gatherings and travel.\n\nIncluding Gohmert, 13 members of Congress have been diagnosed with or suspected to have Covid-19. The other 12 have all recovered and Gohmert said he was asymptomatic.\n\nRepublican Rand Paul in March became the first US senator to contract the disease. He faced criticism from his colleagues after spending time walking maskless around the Capitol, even using its gym, while waiting for test results.\n\nAfter recovering, Paul, a physician, also shunned a mask, arguing that he is now immune. Other medical professionals have said it is unclear whether a person can contract Covid-19 a second time or how long immunity may last.\n\nGohmert said he would now wear a mask. But when asked about mask policies, he told the broadcaster: \"If somebody feels strongly that everybody should wear a mask then they shouldn't be around people that don't wear masks.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nUS news\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nUS Republican Party", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/2020-07-28t191603z_1790933242_rc2j2i9ot3m4_rtrmadp_3_usa-congress-justice.jpg?VersionId=_4enRck33iR8rIDH2RhFX5opvvpGcMkb", "alt_text": null}]}

This encompasses East Coast and Marine Parade GRCs, as well as the single-seat constituencies of Mountbatten and MacPherson.\n\nIt is designed to be a six-month scheme, with each young person given seed funding of up to $5,000 to implement their ideas in the district.\n\nThough the ideas must come from young people themselves, they will be linked up with grassroots advisers, who will serve as mentors, and get a monthly allowance of up to $1,000 for their time and commitment. After six months, participants will take part in a symposium to share what they have learnt from the project.\n\nThe CDC will work with institutes of higher learning, such as polytechnics, ITE College East, and the Singapore University of Technology and Design to recruit those interested in making a difference. Interested applicants do not need to be residents in the district.\n\n\"This attachment is not just free labour; I don't want it to turn out that way,\" Dr Maliki said. \"So we are very careful about curating this experience. We want to try to get more seniors - grassroots leaders and activists on the ground - to help mentor them.\"\n\nMaking reference to the Singapore Together movement launched by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, he added: \"It's not just about having conversations - if you feel passionate about something, do something about it.\"\n\nDr Maliki was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the South East District Conference, which was attended by Mr Heng and several other MPs.\n\nAmong them was Marine Parade MP Fahmi Aliman, who will succeed Dr Maliki as mayor of the district.\n\nDr Maliki said his nine-year stint has been meaningful, with much done to reach out to various segments of the community.

The rules weren't very clear.

If you choose to punish a group of 29 people, it's as if to say the group intentionally and, in a coordinated fashion, chose to break the guidelines,\" he added.\n\n\"If they gave us the (chance to give a) proper statement and called us to tell us why we were suspended and at least hear our side so that when they do choose, they would have made all considerations.\"\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a third badminton player said: \"Most of us are abiding by the law.

He was president for 22 years until his suspension in 2015, following a complaint lodged by Dr Singh.\n\nThe case was amended again to add various claims for alleged losses relating to guest rooms that the club operated from its premises.\n\nThese include an alleged failure to collect fees from guests who stayed in the rooms, and an alleged failure to obtain approval of the MC before paying commissions to online booking agents for marketing the rooms.\n\nIn dismissing the \"missing\" property claim, Justice Ang said the club had not identified the items that were supposedly removed and failed to prove that Mr Rashid has misappropriated the laptop.\n\nIn relation to Mr Rashid's bonuses, the judge noted that Dr Singh was the only person who testified that these had been \"secretly\" paid out.\n\nJustice Ang said this was not supported by objective evidence. He pointed to letters setting out the bonuses that were copied to individuals in charge of human resources.\n\nAs for the uncollected fees, the judge said there was no evidence that the MC had ever authorised the collection of fees from guests.\n\nTurning to the commissions paid to booking agents, the judge said MC members from 2007 to 2013 testified that this was done with their knowledge.\n\nFinancial reports also stated that money was being paid to booking agents.\n\nThe judge noted that just like the case of the bonuses, Dr Singh was the only MC member who had said he did not know the club was using booking agents.\n\n\"After reviewing the totality of the evidence... I came to the conclusion that Dr Singh was simply not being truthful in this regard,\" he said.\n\nCommenting on the verdict, Mr Rashid said he was \"elated that justice has been served\", while Mr Goh said he was \"happy to clear his name\".

Putu Astawa, head of Bali's tourism agency, told The Straits Times that care has been taken as the province seeks to strike a balance between its economic and health interests.\n\n\"The most important thing is to prevent the reopening from creating a new epicentre of transmission so this is a very tough decision to make,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the situation on the island is \"under control\", citing the recovery rate of around 75 per cent among Covid-19 patients.\n\nOn Wednesday (July 29), the province saw 61 fresh cases, bringing total infections to 3,310, with the number of deaths remaining at 48 since July 23.\n\nApart from needing to present antibody test results showing no Covid-19 infection, visitors will also have to observe \"strict health protocols\" such as safe distancing, temperature-taking and mask wearing.\n\nMr Putu said tourism sites must operate at below full capacity and its workers may have to put on additional protective equipment such as face shields and gloves.\n\nThe occupancy rate of hotels in Bali nosedived to 2.07 per cent in May, from 51.56 per cent in the same month last year and 62.55 per cent in December before the outbreak.\n\nThe resort island, which closed tourism sites in late March, has gradually reopened its tourism sites since July 9 for Bali residents.\n\nIt has set a goal of welcoming international tourists on Sept 11, but Mr Putu said this is still \"subject to approval from the national government\".\n\nExperts have criticised the move by Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous nation of nearly 270 million people, to ease social restrictions, including reopening tourism sites, across the vast archipelago. They said the premature lifting of a partial lockdown in some regions last month had already caused cases to climb and predict that this will last until at least September without stronger intervention.\n\nNationwide, the overall number of cases totalled 104,432, while deaths reached 4,975 as of Wednesday. Both figures are the highest in South-east Asia.\n\nDr I. Wayan Gede Artawan Eka Putra, an epidemiologist at Bali-based Udayana University, said while he saw no issue with reopening the island for tourism as long as strict measures are taken, the province's reliance on antibody tests is problematic.\n\nAccurate detection of Covid-19 can only be achieved with polymerase chain reaction tests, he said.\n\nHe added that testing in Bali should be increased significantly, as it is now only half the World Health Organisation's benchmark of one test per 1,000 people each week.\n\nDr I Gusti Agung Ngurah Anom, chairman of the Bali chapter of the Indonesian Hospital Association, said hospitals will be able to cope with any spike in infections after the reopening.\n\n\"We are prepared,\" he said, adding that Bali will soon have additional 17 isolation beds to add to the 550 beds at 15 hospitals for Covid-19 patients.\n\nTourism-related businesses welcomed the move to reopen Bali for local tourists, saying they are ready to comply with the health protocols.\n\nMr Hariyadi Sukamdani, chairman of Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association, said that hotels and restaurants in Bali will ensure that they adhere to protocols such as maintaining a distance of at least 1m between customers and having staff wear masks and gloves when serving guests.\n\n\"There will be no compromise in implementing the health protocols. It's a must,\" he said. \"If we are disciplined, we can control the transmission.\"\n\nHe added that the hotels and restaurants have coordinated with the health agency and hospitals to take quick action if any guests display Covid-19 symptoms.\n\nMr I. Ketut Ardana, chairman of the Bali chapter of the Indonesian Tour and Travel Agency Association, said that based on his assessment so far, Balinese visitors and operators of tourism sites have been observing the health guidelines.\n\n\"It's not a difficult thing for business players in Bali as we are used to prioritising cleanliness, health and safety. We only need to reinforce them further,\" he said.\n\nApart from Bali, Banyuwangi, a laid-back town in East Java, Indonesia's new epicentre of infections, began to open its doors for domestic tourism on Wednesday, hosting several meetings held by ministries and government institutions.\n\nSee more on\n\nIndonesia\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nTourism", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/yq-balicov-29072022.jpg?VersionId=yKj2Uq2x7.dRS8gv8HeVnIn2rAUBmTUh", "alt_text": null}]}

While almost twice as many who received ventilation were men, the mortality rates were similar gender-wise, the study said.\n\nPatients were staying in hospitals for an average of 14 days, with those not on ventilation hospitalised for an average of 12 days while the duration for those who needed help breathing rose to 25 days.\n\nProfessor Reinhard Busse, an expert on healthcare management at TU Berlin, noted that on average, 240 days of ventilation would be required for every 100 hospitalised patients.\n\n\"These are important numbers to prepare for a second wave of the pandemic.

This includes victims of the 2002 Bali bombings.\n\nThe 2018 Terrorism Law has been lauded for opening the door for past terror victims to seek compensation through the LPSK.\n\nHowever, the law requires the recently issued implementing regulation to detail the payment mechanism for the victims, thus enabling the LPSK to disburse the compensation funds.\n\nLPSK deputy chairman Edwin Partogi Pasaribu said the new regulation was a significant advancement of the rights of terror victims. It also revised an outdated implementing regulation, which was crafted before the 2018 law was enacted.\n\n\"This government regulation is needed because it is an extension to the 2018 Terrorism Law,\" Mr Edwin told The Jakarta Post on Monday (July 28). \"This government regulation accommodates victims rights on three events: past terror attacks, future terror attacks and terror incidents that affected Indonesians living abroad.\"\n\nThe LPSK estimated that around 1,100 people could fall into this category of past terror victims - about 400 of whom have already sought compensation from the agency long before the new regulation was issued.\n\nBut without the revised regulation, the LPSK could not process the requests from victims of past cases that had been closed by the court without any compensation orders.\n\nThe LPSK has compensated a number of victims of past terror attacks before the new policy was enacted, such as the victims of the 2016 church bombing in Samarinda, East Kalimantan and the 2016 Thamrin bombing in Jakarta, although payments were made only after the perpetrators were sent to jail.\n\nSucipto Hari Wibowo, chairman of the Indonesian Survivors Foundation (YPI), a civil organisation that helps victims of terrorist attacks, welcomed the government's move, saying that the assurance over the compensation could help terror victims to become more resilient and overcome dark chapters in their lives.\n\n\"This is the kind of intervention that should have been made from the get-go. In the past, payment of compensation was stalled due to the absence of regulations,\" said Mr Sucipto, who himself was injured in the 2004 Australian Embassy bomb attack in Kuningan, South Jakarta.\n\n\"This intervention can help motivate victims psychologically as they transition to become a survivor.\"\n\nAnother organisation that works with victims of terror attacks, the Alliance for a Peaceful Indonesia (AIDA), has been pushing for the issuance of the regulation, considering the three-year deadline for the government to resolve compensation for victims of past cases since the enactment of the 2018 law.\n\n\"Although it cannot replace material and immaterial damages the victims and their families have suffered, the fulfillment of compensation is an integral part of the government's protection of victims' [RIGHTS],\" AIDA's chairman Hasibullah Satrawi said in a statement.\n\nThe new regulation also stipulates the rights of Indonesian victims of terror attacks abroad to seek medical and psychological assistance, and compensation from the government. This was a provision the LPSK formulated after the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, in which one Indonesian was killed and two others were injured.\n\nPresidential expert staff member Dini Shanti Purwono said the new regulation represented the Jokowi administration's commitment to protect victims of terror attacks at home and abroad.\n\n\"The government understands the difficulty and pain experienced by families who have become victims of terror acts, which is why it was amended -- to ease their financial burden,\" Ms Dini said in a statement.\n\nSee more on\n\nIndonesia\n\nTerrorism", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2020/07/29/tl-indo-a-290720.jpg?VersionId=HIQgHMvS4X_yTQehHovLQAJaSiiOjly7", "alt_text": null}]}
