It can also be used for outpatient treatment of schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety, subject to a 15 per cent co-payment by the patient for each claim.\n\nHighlighting the gap between Medisave and Medishield Life claim limits on treatment for physical versus mental health, Ms Ong renewed\n\nher call for eliminating this difference,\n\nand for Medisave to be allowed for services at government or quasi-government funded community organisations so that young people and those who have less resources are not deterred from seeking help because of cost.\n\nIn January last year, the Health Ministry said the waiting time for new subsidised appointments at public hospitals in 2018 was 27 days to see a psychiatrist and 28 days to see a psychologist. Social workers told The Sunday Times that waiting times are much longer since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSome opt for private healthcare as a result, said Head of Shine Children and Youth Services' community outreach team ResiL!ence Eric Sng who added that private treatment can range between $4,000 and $5,000 with an average rate of $120 per session.\n\n\"Maybe it's time to review this because there could be the impression that mental health treatment is less costly,\"said Mr Sng, noting that he met a young person in their 20s who could not afford treatment.\n\nBut the vigour directed towards addressing gaps in the system in the past two weeks has given some hope.\n\nMs Geraldine Tan, a mother of three children aged between 12 and 20, said: \"Many friends, with young who harbour suicidal thoughts, have asked me what (school) counselling is like since one of my children received such help after being bullied in secondary school.\n\n\"I tell them that the system has benefited my children as well as myself,\" she added, \"And I hope that, with more acceptance, many can seek help for mental health like we do for other illnesses.\"\n\nGetting help\n\nNational Care Hotline:\n\n1800-202-6868 (8am - 12am)\n\nMental well-being\n\nFei Yue's Online Counselling Service:\n\neC2.sg website\n\n(Mon to Fri, 10am to 12pm, 2pm to 5pm)\n\nInstitute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline:\n\n6389-2222 (24 hours)\n\nSamaritans of Singapore:\n\n1800-221-4444 (24 hours) /1-767 (24 hours)\n\nSingapore Association for Mental Health:\n\n1800-283-7019 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n\nSilver Ribbon Singapore:\n\n6386-1928/6509-0271 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n\nTinkle Friend:\n\n1800-274-4788 (Mon to Fri, 2.30pm to 5pm)/\n\nTinkle Friend website\n\n(Mon to Thu, 2.30pm to 7pm and Fri, 2.30pm to 5pm)\n\nCounselling\n\nTOUCHline (Counselling):\n\n1800-377-2252 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n\nCare Corner Counselling Centre (Mandarin):\n\n1800-353-5800 (Daily, 10am to 10pm)\n\nSee more on\n\nMental health\n\nCounsellors/Psychologists\n\nChildren and youth", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/hzchild310721.jpg?VersionId=b23b3v2aybCkfNJ37YbY4R5w_qs3rb4R", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/48d5632e09073c7a436ba3352ced1cc0207fd77acb34b3d4d3f80e77b18262ea", "alt_text": "Pioneer contemporary artist Amanda Heng is the most senior artist to stage a solo at the Singapore pavillion International Art Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

So they thought that they could go outside.\n\n\"They wanted just to have a bit of open air, to relax after a tough day of competition, after a tough lockdown period.\"\n\nBoth athletes had been beaten to the gold medals by different Japanese judokas last week.\n\nThe official said the pair had their accreditation revoked on Friday, but that they have now left Japan to return home.\n\nTokyo 2020 organisers said yesterday that they had taken disciplinary action on Friday against at least one Olympic participant, without revealing how many people were involved or their identity.\n\n\"Since the accreditation has been revoked, (they) can no longer have access to Tokyo 2020 facilities,\" organising committee spokesman Masanori Takaya said.\n\n\"It is impermissible that a person goes out from the Olympic Village for sightseeing.\"\n\nAthletes are tested daily while in Japan, where they are living in biosecure \"bubble\" conditions and must leave the country 48 hours after they have finished competing.\n\nAthletes and staff who test positive for Covid-19 or are contact-traced are isolated in separate accommodation in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.\n\nSo far, dozens of athletes and team staff have been quarantined at the Games, with 21 new Games-related Covid-19 cases yesterday - none are athletes - for a total of 241 infections since July 1.\n\nThere was a record high of 4,058 cases yesterday in Tokyo.\n\nOrganisers have said they are trying to improve conditions for athletes who are quarantined, following mounting complaints over a lack of air, food and basic necessities while in isolation.\n\nSome have criticised the conditions in the current quarantine hotel, including Dutch skateboarder Candy Jacobs, who was quarantined early in the Games, calling them \"inhumane\".\n\nGermany's independent elite athletes group Athleten Deutschland has urged the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to act.\n\n\"It... appears... athletes who test positive have to spend their quarantine in prison-like conditions, while IOC members stay in expensive luxury hotels and are provided with high daily allowances,\" said Maximilian Klein, the organisation's representative for international sport policy.\n\nAmong the biggest issues are lack of fresh air and training facilities, the quality of food which Athleten Deutschland said is \"neither rich nor balanced\", small living quarters and an absence of basic amenities such as laundry.\n\n\"It's unfortunate for all of us but particularly also the athletes the extra measures that have to be taken in terms of isolation and we fully sympathise with everyone who's had to go through this,\" said IOC spokesman Mark Adams.\n\n\"There are certain regulations that the Japanese health authorities imposed - we can't do much about that - but there are things that can be done.\"\n\nTakaya said organisers had managed to provide more space for them outside their rooms while teammates could bring food.\n\n\"The situation has been improved and we are trying to implement a more flexible approach to accommodate these positive cases,\" he said.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nOlympics 2020\n\nCovid-19\n\nJapan", "images": []}

The Netherlands and defending champions Brazil are tied for the lead on 70 points. Germany are third on 73.\n\nStill, they have the distinction of finishing as Asia's top pair. Japan and China were 18th and 19th respectively and did not make the medal race comprising 10 boats.\n\nThere had been some uncertainty as to whether Low and Lim had made the top 10 because they had dropped to 13th in their final race yesterday. However, the Race 11 disqualification of the Americans worked in the 2018 Asian Games champions' favour.\n\nLow, 28, said: \"We didn't know (about the achievements) and we didn't expect it.\"\n\nLim, 24, added: \"Only when (Singapore chef de mission and former sailor) Ben Tan told us, then we knew for sure. It's pretty unreal.\n\n\"That's our first win at the Olympics, we'll keep that forever. Winning a race is always challenging in these kinds of fleets. It's always special. We haven't won many races in our careers in the FX actually, so this is a special one.\"\n\nIn the 49erFX, catching speed and position are key. Singapore Sailing Federation (SSF) general manager Chung Pei Ming said: \"A lot of effort is put into testing equipment, settings and sailing techniques in various conditions.\n\n\"If we are able to go faster... by even 1 per cent, it gives us the advantage and freedom to manoeuvre at the front of the fleet.\"\n\nThis they did to perfection in the 11th race, with Low adding: \"We knew we got it right, we got the speed, all we needed to do was just to protect (our position).\"\n\nThey had finished no higher than 11th in six races on Tuesday and Wednesday. But on Friday and yesterday, they were third, second, seventh, eighth, first and 13th.\n\nLow said: \"It's been so intense. The other teams in the top 10 are super experienced and super good. We just want to recover as much as possible and be fresh for the medal race and enjoy the race.\"\n\nThe other Singaporean sailors in Tokyo are Ryan Lo (men's Laser) and Amanda Ng (windsurfing). Lo finished 21st out of 35 after 10 races. Ng was 26th out of 27 after 12 races in the women's RS:X class.\n\nSSF president Lincoln Chee was encouraged by their performances as they work towards a better showing at Paris 2024. Noting Low and Lim's coach Fernando Kuo's contributions, he said: \"We are so happy for Kimberly and Cecilia... (they) showed great commitment, talent, hard work and sacrifice.\n\n\"Ryan and his coach Nenad Viali also deserve a shout-out as Ryan finished among the top 10 in two races in one of the most competitive classes in sailing.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nOlympics 2020\n\nTeam Singapore\n\nSailing\n\nSports and recreation", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_DLSAIL01_6738571.jpg?VersionId=Cef7H7smbmYUHKRpbN1JOEZiMl57nbvm", "alt_text": "Cecilia Low (left) and Kimberly Lim racing in the women's 49er FX off Enoshima Yacht Harbour on Friday.

It's easy to get caught up in the headlines and go no further.\n\nIt's easy to be turned off. Yet, with some caveats, I think the benefits of putting some of your money into Chinese stocks and bonds are more compelling than the reasons for staying away.\n\nChinese stocks may be part of your retirement nest egg\n\nMany Americans already hold Chinese securities indirectly without realising it, because global stock and bond funds contain them. Until I checked, I wasn't sure about my own retirement accounts, which mainly contain Vanguard index funds. Yes, a smattering of Chinese stocks and bonds are tucked away in them. Other large fund providers, like Fidelity, BlackRock, State Street and T. Rowe Price, include Chinese securities in global funds.\n\nIf you learn that you're invested in Chinese securities as part of a broadly diversified portfolio, don't panic, on purely financial grounds, anyway. And if you do not have any money in China yet, it may make sense to start, in small doses and through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, despite the current troubles. With certain reservations, I think holding a piece of Chinese financial markets is a good thing.\n\nThe fundamental reason is simple: Chinese markets are important, and they are becoming even more so.\n\nA portfolio in 2021 isn't global without China\n\nThe teachings of finance since at least the middle of the 20th century have recommended that investors hold thoroughly diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds, reflecting the entire financial universe, in an appropriate asset allocation. And in the 21st century, China is a vital part of global financial markets.\n\nTo exclude Chinese securities from global portfolios at this stage strikes me as roughly equivalent to insisting that the Earth is flat.\n\nAs Mr Jason Hsu, founder of Rayliant Global Advisers in China and an adjunct professor of finance at UCLA, said: \"In China, the invisible hand of capitalism wears a red glove, and regulations can be very heavy-handed. Yet it's still an important place to invest.\"\n\nPartly because of such issues, major global index firms are not yet allowing China to punch its full weight based on the value of its US$10 trillion (S$13.5 trillion) stock market and US$16 trillion bond market.\n\nChinese stocks account for a bit more than 4 per cent of global stock indexes and Chinese bonds make up more than 7 per cent of some global bond indexes.\n\nReasons for concern\n\nUndeniably, there are excellent reasons for Americans not to put money into China. First, the political differences, short and long term, can scarcely be overstated.\n\nUS officials say China is now America's most threatening adversary and engages in pervasive human rights violations. Chinese leaders proclaim the superiority of their own approach.\n\nMr Xi Jinping, the head of the Communist Party and China's paramount leader, warned early last month that any foreign powers trying to stop China's ascendance would \"crack their heads and spill blood on the Great Wall of steel built from the flesh and blood of 1.4 billion Chinese people.\"\n\nBut it is also worth noting that since the reopening of China in the 1970s and 1980s, there has been \"a remarkable improvement in the quality of day-to-day life for hundreds of millions of people\", Mr Andy Rothman, an investment strategist for Matthews Asia, said.\n\nRegulatory issues are troubling\n\nEven if you are inclined to invest some money in China, you will quickly find that a host of nettlesome regulatory issues plague Chinese public companies, particularly the roughly US$2 trillion worth listed on American exchanges as ADRs, short for American depositary receipts.\n\nThe US has designated dozens of these companies as being so connected to Chinese military and intelligence services that they are potential threats to national security. Some have been barred from trading in the United States and delisted from major global stock indexes.\n\nA three-year clock ticks for the rest of the Chinese companies traded in the US. Under a US law passed last year, they must submit financial audits to US regulators, yet China does not permit such information to leave the country.\n\nThat may be impossible for these companies to resolve. \"We don't expect they will comply,\" said Ms Elizabeth Kwik, an investment manager for Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong. The odds are, she said, that \"they will be 'coming home' to China\", where they can be traded without problems.\n\nChinese regulators have their own unsettling concerns about big tech companies. In November, they blocked the initial public offering (IPO) of Ant Group, the finance giant. Ant is a sister company of Alibaba, the e-commerce colossus, whose founders include billionaires Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai.\n\nFor many basketball fans, Mr Tsai is best known as the owner of the Brooklyn Nets and boss of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden.\n\nIf you want Chinese shares, you can bypass New York\n\nOn the face of it, shares of Chinese Internet giants traded in American markets through ADRs might seem to be safer for Americans than shares sold in local markets like Shanghai, Shenzhen or even Hong Kong.\n\nYet in some respects, regulatory requirements for IPOs in China can be more stringent than those imposed by American regulators, Mr Hsu of Rayliant Global Advisers said.\n\nOne reason is that inexperienced investors in China who engage in \"social gambling\" move the local stock market even more than \"meme traders\" do in the US, he said. To calm the market, Chinese regulators require companies to have solid cash flow and earnings for listing on the domestic market, known as the A shares market. That is not needed for an IPO in the more laissez-faire US.\n\nI would be careful about buying individual stocks. But I do like the idea of participating in the growth of China's consumer market through fund portfolios, though I tilt towards index funds. Maintaining an indirect business connection with China, despite the ebb and flow of politics, seems to me humane and, potentially, lucrative.\n\nBut I've come to accept that I'm a die-hard globalist. If you can't abide by this kind of thinking, I wouldn't lose sleep over it. Stay local in your investing, then.\n\nYet be aware that Chinese spending is already so consequential that you will get some exposure to it anyway, through companies like Boeing, Caterpillar, General Motors, Ford Motor and Nike.\n\nChina is so important, it's impossible to ignore.\n\nSee more on\n\nInvest\n\nChina\n\nInvestment\n\nStock market", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/rk_chinese-stocks_010821.jpg?VersionId=N0wTObEk2nDRfbPtkU9h1ioFS52uCpDl", "alt_text": null}]}

Yet it had its pitfalls: Neither the aircraft radar nor bombsight was technologically advanced enough. It also heavily depended on the weather, with bombs regularly missing their targets.\n\nThen there are the pragmatists, embodied by Hansell's successor, General Curtis LeMay, who believed in a go-big-or-go-home approach to war.\n\nHis scorched-earth philosophy was most evident in the indiscriminate firebombings of Tokyo in 1945 that left an estimated 100,000 civilians dead.\n\nHis thinking was that it would be better to force the enemy to surrender early, as a prolonged war would cause more suffering.\n\nGladwell, who is renowned for his bestsellers such as The Tipping Point (2000) and Outliers (2008), looks at the American war effort in Europe and the Pacific.\n\nIn his vivid character sketches, both Air Force leaders spring off the page.\n\nHansell, his chivalry likened to fictional character Don Quixote, would lose his job to LeMay after repeated failed missions.\n\nAnd LeMay would eventually be rewarded by the Japanese government in 1964 with the highest accolade for a foreigner - the First Class Order of Merit of the Grand Cordon of the Rising Sun - despite the massive civilian death toll he caused.\n\nBy ensuring peace came by the summer of 1945, he was said to have prevented millions more from dying of starvation in winter and was even thanked for rebuilding Japan's Air Self-Defence Force.\n\nGladwell adeptly interweaves historian accounts and his own research to portray the wartime effort, while also tracing the roots of inventions such as the bombsight and napalm.\n\nHe makes his preference for the humane approach clear, acknowledging feeble attempts by soldiers to ease their guilt via rationalisation: \"Wasn't it true that a lot of the war effort happened in living rooms as well as factories?\"\n\nYet The Bomber Mafia feels like a glib and superficial effort which, at 288 pages, does not do sufficient justice to the moral and practical dilemmas of a war effort.\n\nGladwell does not extrapolate, even briefly, as to how these two bombing strategies were applied in subsequent war efforts where the US failed, such as the Korean War which began in 1950, the Vietnam War from 1955 to 1975 and, more recently, the \"unwinnable\" war in Afghanistan.\n\nIf you like this, read:\n\nOutliers: The Story Of Success by Malcolm Gladwell (Penguin Books, 2009, $17.07, major bookstores). The book looks at what makes extreme overachievers and postulates the \"10,000-hour rule\" hypothesis that one can become an expert at something by devoting that many hours to it.\n\nSee more on\n\nBooks\n\nReviews\n\nBook review\n\nNon-fiction books", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_WSBOMBER01_6735253.jpg?VersionId=xTgXFqtULQOPw1fYA7ajhMHDpt1sFbP7", "alt_text": null}]}

This is more than double the 6,988 cases notched on July 1.\n\nTraffic police and plainclothes police were seen standing by at the scene, The Star daily reported. Some marshals donning white safety hats and medics with red safety hats were also present.\n\nCity police chief Azmi Abu Kassim warned that those who violated Covid-19 health protocols would face police action.\n\nHe was quoted by The Star as saying that police have not received any application or notice from the organising committee of the proposed gathering.\n\nDistrict police said yesterday that they would call up the organisers and those who took part in the rally.\n\n\"Under the movement control order, no public assemblies are allowed, including social gatherings, and sports activities,\" Dang Wangi district's police chief Mohamad Zainal Abdullah told a news conference.\n\nPolice later estimated that about 450 people attended the rally. The organisers claimed 2,000 people participated.\n\nYouth activist Sarah Irdina, 20, said she was detained for nearly 11 hours, three days ago, over her Twitter posts about the planned protest.\n\n\"This failed government's inhumane treatment of those that fight for a better Malaysia is what keeps hurting us Malaysians, when their job is supposedly to protect us. This is why we #lawan (fight),\" she wrote on Twitter on Friday.\n\nThe protest comes as Mr Muhyiddin faces a constitutional crisis amid pressure to step down after clashing with the King, Sultan Abdullah Ahmad Shah.\n\nThe palace on Thursday insisted that the King did not endorse the government's unilateral move to withdraw the ordinances under the state of emergency, which he proclaimed in January. The state of emergency is due to expire today.\n\nMr Muhyiddin's government took the position that the Constitution obliges the King to act in accordance with the government's advice.\n\nThere had been calls, even from Mr Muhyiddin's own allies in Umno party, for him to quit.\n\nThe protesters dispersed peacefully after two hours, police said.\n\nSee more on\n\nMalaysia\n\nMuhyiddin Yassin\n\nProtests", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_WKM1_6738391.jpg?VersionId=tX2uEfITpuYLkSa.togIQMYMTzXCETiE", "alt_text": "Protesters rallying in Kuala Lumpur yesterday as they called for Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin to step down and criticised the Malaysian government's handling of the pandemic.

Initial photographs from the scene showed Mr Siddiqui's body with multiple wounds but fully intact.\n\nBut by that evening, when the body was handed over to the Red Cross and transferred to a hospital in the southern city of Kandahar, it had been badly mutilated, according to two Indian officials and two Afghan health officials there.\n\nThe mutilation was reported by an Indian website, Newslaundry, in the days after Mr Siddiqui's killing.\n\nThe New York Times reviewed multiple photographs, some provided by Indian officials and others taken by Afghan health workers at the hospital, that showed Mr Siddiqui's body had been mutilated. One Indian official said that the body had nearly a dozen bullet wounds and that there were tyre marks on Mr Siddiqui's face and chest.\n\nOne of the health officials in Kandahar said that the body, along with Mr Siddiqui's press vest, had reached the city's main hospital around 8pm on the day he was killed. His face was unrecognisable, said the official, who added that he could not determine exactly what had been done to the body.\n\nA Taleban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied any wrongdoing on the part of the insurgents, saying that they were under orders to treat bodies with respect and to hand them over to local elders or the Red Cross.\n\nBut the Taleban were in control of the area at the time, and some photographs showed what appeared to be the group's fighters standing around Mr Siddiqui's body, which was then intact.\n\nSee more on\n\nAfghanistan\n\nTaliban\n\nMedia", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/topshots-topshot-nepal-india-afghanistan-conflict-photographer-072501.jpg?VersionId=F3OKbtOPrqZvfoEGy4ND3bn_hgA.iGJ7", "alt_text": null}]}

It is what makes me who I am.\"\n\nNAOMI OSAKA (JPN) TENNIS\n\nAfter beating Serena Williams to win her first Grand Slam title at the 2018 US Open, Osaka was hailed as one of the sport's rising stars. She won three more Grand Slam titles and became the first Asian player to be ranked No. 1 in singles.\n\nIn June, she made headlines for choosing to skip press conferences at the French Open, in order to protect her mental health. She said expecting players to answer questions after a loss amounted to \"kicking a person while they're down\" and objected to being asked questions \"that bring doubt into our minds\".\n\nShe later withdrew from the tournament, though not before being fined by organisers, and there were mixed reactions to her decision.\n\nOsaka, 23, later revealed that she has \"suffered long bouts of depression\" since the 2018 US Open and has \"had a really hard time coping with that\".\n\nShe highlighted that she is introverted and often wears headphones at tournaments as that \"helps dull my social anxiety\", adding that she is not a natural speaker and gets \"huge waves of anxiety before I speak to the world's media\".\n\nROBERT ENKE (GER) FOOTBALL\n\nEnke was a German goalkeeper who started his senior career with hometown club Carl Zeiss Jena, before going on to play for some of Europe's biggest clubs, including the likes of Borussia Monchengladbach, Benfica and Barcelona.\n\nHowever, his spell at Barcelona turned sour as he struggled to nail down regular football and had loan spells in Turkey and the Spanish second division. It was also during this period of time that he suffered from depression.\n\nEnke seemed to have recovered after making a return to Germany with Hannover in 2004, when he was voted German sports magazine Kicker's Bundesliga Goalkeeper of the Year for the 2005-06 season. But he had to battle through a personal tragedy when his daughter died in 2006.\n\nStill, he fought on and was named Goalkeeper of the Year again in the 2008-09 season.\n\nBut depression caught up with Enke again and just a few months before the 2010 World Cup, where he was set to make the squad, he took his life in front of a train on Nov 10, 2009 at age 32.\n\nLaura Chia and Clarence Yeo\n\nSee more on\n\nMichael Phelps\n\nNaomi Osaka\n\nMental health\n\nSports and recreation", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_MENTALSIDE01GWNC_6738390.jpg?VersionId=7c7nEQAhbwbmuX9ncg4e7J78_g7sgtRv", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_MENTALSIDE01RAKD_6738392.jpg?VersionId=F5DuPJkU8Eem.HlesgUPviNs8WUQoZQa", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_MENTALSIDE01_6738389.jpg?VersionId=l5ni3MBCJ2i_Lgq7bwQTitQ5srtlam_Z", "alt_text": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/95b2ddb75e97591d84cc3c6a9ae47e487db011fd6af502bec0cc83c97e0c3292", "alt_text": "Slug: vcjeff \nST Photo: Gin Tay\n\nActing Minister for Transport Mr. Jeffrey Siow deliver his speech at the  Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium in Raffles City Convention Centre, July 14, 2025."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6553b871cd10fca92dff47014a5becebbacabf67e0d7b35b1b184b324507348c", "alt_text": "The card is inspired by Singapore\u2019s iconic landmarks such as The Esplanade and The Marina Bay Sands."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a84595ca2b0271f6366f826e0b722be7679285cc51c46087bee66b92fa7df697", "alt_text": "Mr Don Shiau\u2019s interest in Singaporean Chinese naming conventions began in 2024, when he noticed that his identity card listed both his dialect and pinyin names."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/495529ef0f8ccfd0abeb37fbd556e284395ddc96a09479bbc3543d373b232012", "alt_text": "For the first half of 2025, Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.2 per cent year-on-year."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/48d5632e09073c7a436ba3352ced1cc0207fd77acb34b3d4d3f80e77b18262ea", "alt_text": "Pioneer contemporary artist Amanda Heng is the most senior artist to stage a solo at the Singapore pavillion International Art Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8fc9d25ab25b2f098d41011ce7efd957d248c1d2149a45c94e406f3a212be78", "alt_text": "Singaporean Zin Nwe Nyunt, 58, had admitted that she did not know where the money came from."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f1560a8cd70e3aacd19b82dfe1332f7ca864a81ec0ae6b939339962eef66d19b", "alt_text": "A 23-year-old e-bike rider was injured in a hit-and-run accident at the junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and Upper Serangoon Road."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/210c50fd035b334082a09051fb924cba6c9651e902048318dc1515b93d578840", "alt_text": "Open water swimmer Chantal Liew being given nutritional drinks during a race using a modified fishing rod."}]}

They even verified who he was, the investigation claims.\n\nAfghan army men, including the commander of the unit he had been embedded with, who came to the mosque to rescue Mr Siddiqui, were also killed.\n\nMr Siddiqui had reported to his editors that he had sustained a shrapnel wound to the arm during a clash between Afghan troops and the Taleban in Spin Boldak, but said that he had been treated for the injury, according to Reuters.\n\nLater, as he was interviewing local shopkeepers, the Taleban attacked again, the news agency said, quoting an Afghan commander.\n\nFollowing reports of his death, a Taleban spokesman told CNN-News18: \"We are not aware during whose firing the journalist was killed. We do not know how he died.\"\n\nThe spokesman, Mr Zabiullah Mujahid, was quoted as saying: \"Any journalist entering the war zone should inform us. We will take proper care of that particular individual.\"\n\nMr Siddiqui's death sent shock waves through the south Asian media community in particular. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 as part of the Reuters team covering the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani said on Twitter that he was \"deeply saddened with the shocking reports\" of Mr Siddiqui's death.\n\nBut the investigation claims that the killing was both deliberate and brutal.\n\nThe Sunday Times was separately shown, by the Indian government source, pictures and a video of Mr Siddiqui's bullet-riddled body, with his head battered, being examined and lying wrapped in a white cloth in a simple plywood coffin.\n\nThe Afghan investigation found that Mr Siddiqui was with a team of the Afghan National Army in the Spin Boldak region, near the Pakistan border, to cover ongoing fighting there. The Taleban have since taken over the area and are collecting taxes from the locals, the Pakistani daily Dawn reported on Wednesday.\n\nAt a spot around 500m from a Customs post, they came under attack by the Taleban.\n\nA team of three, plus Mr Siddiqui, were apparently separated from the Afghan army unit commander. Mr Siddiqui, who was injured by shrapnel, was reportedly taken to the mosque where he was being treated, the investigation found.\n\nThe manner in which he was shot, with several rounds piercing his body and his head injured, indicated a purposeful act aimed at sending a clear signal to foreign journalists, the investigation contended.\n\nAsked to comment on the latest reports, a Reuters spokesman told The Sunday Times on Friday: \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague Danish Siddiqui... We are working to verify the facts around Danish's death... and will continue to honour his memory.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nAfghanistan\n\nTaliban", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_NIDANISH_6738156.jpg?VersionId=n_5h00NiG5Fux8LCkzSfTEJ8d9IFCugG", "alt_text": "Photographers paying homage to Reuters journalist Danish Siddiqui at Swayambhunath Stupa in Kathmandu on July 20, and a photo of the 38-year-old placed at the site.

The outbreak occurred in Provincetown on Cape Cod, according to Barnstable County health authorities.\n\nThe CDC study found vaccinated individuals had a similar amount of virus presence as the unvaccinated, suggesting that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with the Delta variant could transmit the virus.\n\nCDC director Rochelle Walensky said this was a \"pivotal discovery\" leading to CDC's recommendation last week that masks be worn in areas where cases were surging as a precaution against possible transmission by fully vaccinated people.\n\n\"The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones,\" Dr Walensky said.\n\nThe CDC said 469 cases were found among Massachusetts residents from July 3 to 26 related to the Cape Cod outbreak.\n\nOf those, 74 per cent were among fully vaccinated people. The CDC said its study excluded residents of 22 other states. Barnstable County reported that as at Friday, 934 cases in total had been associated with the outbreak.\n\nThe CDC said that overall, 79 per cent of the vaccinated individuals who were infected with Covid-19 also reported symptoms such as cough, headache, sore throat and fever. Four had to be hospitalised.\n\nVaccinated individuals had received one of the three available shots made by Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson, the data showed.\n\nThe study's authors recommended the local health authorities consider requiring masks in indoor public settings regardless of vaccination status or the number of cases in the community. The CDC said that people with Covid-19 reported having been at densely packed indoor and outdoor events including bars, restaurants, guest houses and rental homes.\n\nTop US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Friday he hopes regulators could start granting full approval for the Covid-19 vaccines as soon as this month, a move he said could spur unvaccinated Americans to get the shots.\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna two-dose vaccines and Johnson & Johnson's one-dose shot are currently being administered under emergency use authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nFull approval by the FDA could push more Americans to get the Covid-19 vaccine as it might reduce their fears about the safety of the shot and make local officials more comfortable about implementing vaccine mandates, Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the White House, said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nIn addition, formal FDA approval would give physicians the ability to prescribe a third dose of the vaccine to people with weakened immune systems on an off-label basis, Dr Fauci said.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech, as well as Moderna, have filed with the FDA to ask for full approval for their vaccines. Johnson & Johnson has not yet requested full approval for its Covid-19 shot.\n\n\"Given what we've been through now and the number of months that have gone by since the (emergency use authorisation), I would hope that within the very reasonable period of time in the future we'll see that. I hope as we get into the middle of August, that we're almost there,\" Dr Fauci said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSEE VIEWS\n\n\u2022A27\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nInfectious diseases\n\nVaccines", "images": []}

You have to be an all-rounder - you have to have a good CCA record, secure a good internship at a reputable company.\n\n\"This constant competition emphasised by social media channels by their peers - when everyone is posting about good things - exacerbates competition, and young people find it stressful.\"\n\nPsychologists say the deluge of attractive posts can trigger feelings of inferiority or inadequacy, especially among young people with less experience to differentiate the social media world from real life.\n\nIn a ministerial statement on the death last week of a River Valley High School student, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing\n\nhighlighted the challenges young people face,\n\nincluding the social pressure of the online world in encouraging constant comparison.\n\nMr Chan, who spoke on June 27, noted that young people are already dealing with family and peer relationships, expectations of themselves and their parents, and the difficulties of coping with the rigours of Singapore's education system.\n\nMental health advocates and social agencies say young people are vulnerable to relying on social media for self-worth and self-image, even as they try to forge their own identity.\n\nSaid assistant director of Touch Mental Wellness Andrea Chan: \"Seeing good things can draw much envy and comparison, while identification with bad things can lead to a negative spiral.\"\n\nGetting likes is rewarding for the brain through an increase in dopamine similar to an adrenaline rush, added Dr Emily Ortega.\n\nAnd the reinforcement of pleasure-seeking posting on social media can result in addiction, said the head of psychology at the Singapore University of Social Science.\n\nMs Lee Yi Ping, principal case manager and programme lead of Community Health Assessment Team, said: \"In the event a young person feels disappointed or rejected by the responses received, the distress is often left unnoticed unless the young person openly talks about it with another trusted person.\"\n\nSupport must come from family and friends who can constantly remind the young people that no matter how challenging a life circumstance can be, they can overcome it.\n\nShe added: \"With timely and appropriate medical and psycho-social interventions by formal sources of support like helping professionals, coupled with informal sources of support like family and friends, young people stand a better chance with recovery and reclaim of capability to pursue their ambitions in life.\"\n\nThe experts say if these pressures are left unchecked, negative thoughts and feelings from social media can contribute to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.\n\nSenior counsellor at Jurong Pioneer Junior College Elaine Tay said she had young people tell her that they sought help after an influencer shared that they were seeing a therapist or seeking help for their mental health issues.\n\nShe said: \"I have students who say 'I was following this influencer and he shared that he's going through depression and I would like to get help to get better as well'.\"\n\nMeanwhile, more mental health advocacy groups and agencies like Re: Mind Singapore have taken to social media in the past five years to provide bite-sized information to educate the public about mental health and how to seek help.\n\nIn a dialogue on July 30\n\nbetween the Education Minister and students from secondary schools and junior colleges,\n\nthree young people shared that social media had helped sensitise them to mental health issues.\n\nMr Steve Loh, founder of e-buddy Myloh, an app which provides evidence-based psychological advice, self-care strategies and helps tracks mood changes, note that many young people often need support in the middle of the night when they may not have access to immediate human care.\n\nHe said: \"From our focus group discussions with young people, we find that there are those who wake up at 2am, with a panic attack, and all they need to do is talk and find something that can help them.\"\n\nThe bottom line is that social media can be used healthily, experts said, if young people are taught how to navigate the pressures of the online world.\n\nMr Tan said that social media has been a great way to stay connected with people and make new friends.\n\nThe TikTok influencer added that the platform has also allowed him to have an outlet to express his creativity.\n\nHe said: \"I do gain a lot of happiness from seeing how my videos make people laugh. It keeps me motivated to make more.\"\n\nMs Tamlyn Richards, 23, who graduated from James Cook University this year and has over 8,000 followers on TikTok, said: \"I've learnt to take a break from social media when I feel it's starting to distract me from present moments and when I start comparing likes or my own appearances to others.\"\n\nGetting help\n\nNational Care Hotline:\n\n1800-202-6868 (8am - 12am)\n\nMental well-being\n\nFei Yue's Online Counselling Service:\n\neC2.sg website\n\n(Mon to Fri, 10am to 12pm, 2pm to 5pm)\n\nInstitute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline:\n\n6389-2222 (24 hours)\n\nSamaritans of Singapore:\n\n1800-221-4444 (24 hours) /1-767 (24 hours)\n\nSingapore Association for Mental Health:\n\n1800-283-7019 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n\nSilver Ribbon Singapore:\n\n6386-1928/6509-0271 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n\nTinkle Friend:\n\n1800-274-4788 (Mon to Fri, 2.30pm to 5pm)/\n\nTinkle Friend website\n\n(Mon to Thu, 2.30pm to 7pm and Fri, 2.30pm to 5pm)\n\nCounselling\n\nTOUCHline (Counselling):\n\n1800-377-2252 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n\nCare Corner Counselling Centre (Mandarin):\n\n1800-353-5800 (Daily, 10am to 10pm)\n\nSee more on\n\nMental health\n\nSocial media\n\nChildren and youth\n\nInternet\n\nRiver Valley High School death", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/rk_tanyeoshilee_010821.jpg?VersionId=_nLj4ZdFJJTp2WdBpVLq8t2v7ZKa5jSF", "alt_text": null}]}

The Federal Trade Commission reports similar figures, with 44 per cent of people aged 20 to 29 losing money to fraud, more than double the 20 per cent of people aged 70 to 79.\n\nWhen we look at the kinds of scams that work on young people, there's nary a Nigerian prince in sight. The targeted activities vary widely, from the online shopping that these victims may do nearly every day to their once-in-a-blue-moon handling of paper cheques. Illegal schemes also target the student debt payments they must make and the jobs they seek to afford them.\n\nSo let's lay out what these scams look like - and remind ourselves how we might best reach young people who think they are invincible.\n\nOnline retail scams\n\nThe false promise of a rare or surprisingly cheap product isn't a new form of flimflam, but the Internet sure makes it easier - especially if you're accustomed to frequently buying online.\n\nOnline purchase scams accounted for 64 per cent of the reports of lost money to the Better Business Bureau last year, up from just 13 per cent in 2015. And according to the bureau's data, 83 per cent of young adults who were exposed to such scams fell for them, more than any other age group.\n\nAmazon is everywhere - including as a vector for fraud. Given its size, con artists try to impersonate Amazon more often than any other company's brand.\n\nThe company offers some geeked-out advice for spotting trouble in an unsolicited \"Amazon\" offer: - Real Amazon sites have a dot before amazon.com in the URL.\n\nIf you get a message saying you need to update your payment method, always go directly to the Amazon site on your own to see if it's true - not through a link in the message.\n\nThe company does not send links that have strings of jumbled numbers in them.\n\nEmployment scams\n\nMillions of people were left jobless through no fault of their own during the pandemic, so it's no surprise that these scams proliferated. And grifters took to offering bogus jobs that are particularly attractive to young adults.\n\nPostings for foot-in-the-door, exposure-to-creative-industries gigs like assistants and receptionists are common ploys for people with bad intentions. The same goes for postings for warehouse and shipping work, an area that boomed during the pandemic and offers jobs for which many people are qualified.\n\nThe scams frequently request dates of birth and Social Security numbers, which can be used to commit the worst forms of identity theft. Another form of fraud asks for a few hundred dollars to cover supplies or training for positions that turn out not to exist.\n\nOf survey respondents who encountered employment scams, 32 per cent said theirs had originated on the job listing site Indeed, far surpassing other popular platforms.\n\nJobs platform Indeed seems well aware of this and posts tips to avoid this form of fraud. The company probably ought to force you to read the warnings before letting you look at a single listing. Among them is a kind of self-own: \"Never agree to a job that involves opening multiple accounts and/or posting ads on Indeed or on other sites.\"\n\nIn short, Indeed wants you to watch out for Indeed scammers getting you to use Indeed to run Indeed scams.\n\nFake-cheque scams\n\nThese often involve a very real piece of paper, which appears to be drawing on a business or personal bank account, or rendered as a money order or a cashier's cheque. It looks so authentic that the recipient doesn't catch on and the bank doesn't immediately reject it.\n\nThen comes the con, which is a follow-up message asking for some of the money back: \"Sorry, this is an accidental overpayment\" or \"Please use some of the money to perform mystery shopping of online money transfer services.\"\n\nThese cheques can arrive in the mail, appearing to be a prize or a rebate - just the kind of payment that your banking app can quickly digest through your phone's camera. Often, they're a twist on an employment scam: A hustler overpays the applicant the hustler just hired, supposedly by accident - and then wants some of the money back.\n\nPeople in their 20s are more than twice as likely as older adults to fall prey to this sort of thing, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nMany of them have not used cheques much, and they may not be aware that while federal rules require banks to make funds from cheques available quickly, those same banks may take many more days to root out a fake one. Once they do, they usually want the money back from the victim for having introduced the bad cheque into the system.\n\nStudent loan scams\n\nThis is already a problem, but it could get a lot worse very soon.\n\nTens of millions of borrowers have their federal student loan payments on pause right now, thanks to governmental efforts to keep them out of financial trouble during the pandemic. But as soon as Oct 1, a switch will flip and most of those people will need to start the repayment process.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Education offer tips for scam avoidance. And when the Pennsylvania attorney-general shut down an entity called Unified Holding Group, it revealed some eye-opening details about just how elaborate these cons can be.\n\nAmong other things, the company told borrowers to ignore outreach from their legitimate loan servicers and had just-stilted-enough-to-be-legit language on its website saying things like \"We find integrity fosters a positive reputation and a sense of security in all our business interactions.\"\n\nSo what can we do\n\nIt is deeply unsatisfactory to default to \"more awareness\" as a partial solution to scams that prey on systemic complexity and inequity that should not exist in the first place. But here we are. Again.\n\nYoung adults out on their own could stand to slow down a bit. Perhaps Instagram instabuying is not necessary, for instance. And remember that scammers succeed more often with the stressed and the lonely. If you are either, stay wary.\n\nEarly education is crucial. If there's a personal finance class in your child's school, ask the teacher whether there's a section devoted to fraud and thievery. Studying the techniques of the crooked with wonder, awe and begrudging respect as opposed to scolding didacticism might improve things.\n\nEven better would be your own educational campaign - a kind of true-crime drama. Chances are you've seen a scam in action, even if you were not taken in. So unspool tales of your own near-victimisation - or worse. Sure, you might become the subject of temporary mockery. But the story is likely to stick.\n\nSee more on\n\nInvest\n\nFraud\n\nScams\n\nFinancial literacy", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/rk_scams_010821.jpg?VersionId=6BZphIvj90tKbPOR.TNacH2CqHFMuWmm", "alt_text": null}]}

But fewer of those buyers are tapping a once-popular investment strategy: leasing out units for income.\n\nThe idea fell out of favour as rents dropped during the pandemic amid a mounting pile of apartment vacancies. Of all New York City condo units purchased last year, just 2.7 per cent were listed for rent within six months of closing, according to data compiled by StreetEasy. In 2017, the share was a record 11 per cent.\n\n\"It's a strategy that has a lot of risk right now,\" said Ms Nancy Wu, an economist at StreetEasy. \"Renting it out is very notably not-profitable because of how much rents have been dropping.\"\n\nLandlords have struggled to keep units filled since the pandemic shuttered offices and sent New Yorkers scurrying to the suburbs for more work-at-home space.\n\nOwners spent the past year discounting rents and upping incentives like free months to draw in tenants. Still, the number of empty units on the market has been discouragingly high. In June, despite a 38 per cent drop from the previous month, there were 11,853 available apartments in Manhattan alone.\n\n\"No investor wants to go up against a landlord who has a hundred or 200 vacancies,\" said Mr Stephen Kliegerman, president of Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing, who oversees sales in new condo buildings. \"They think, 'Great, I have to give away six months free, well then why am I buying this now?'\"\n\nSome investors have started stepping back into the rental game as Covid-19 infections decline in the city and employers plot a return to the office, pushing some workers to once again seek out urban homes to avoid a long commute.\n\nAbout 5.6 per cent of all condo sales through June this year ended up being listed as rentals, StreetEasy said. They're hitting the market in less-pricey locations that typically appeal to university students and young professionals.\n\nThe Vandewater, a newly built condominium near Columbia University in upper Manhattan, had New York's biggest share of condos-turned-rentals this year, with 10 of this year's 28 sales - 36 per cent - being listed for rent by their new owners, StreetEasy said.\n\nThat includes a one-bedroom unit that sold there in April for US$1.3 million (S$1.8 million). It was listed for rent in May at US$4,900 per month, according to StreetEasy. The 733 square foot apartment - in a building with a pet spa and a heated pool - found a tenant at the end of June after the asking rent dropped to US$4,750.\n\nIn Manhattan's financial district, 28 per cent of condos sold this year at 130 William Street were quickly listed for rent. The median rent being sought for units at the luxury tower with Hudson River views is US$5,500, compared with the US$3,500 median for the neighbourhood at large, StreetEasy said.\n\nRents dived during New York's pandemic shutdown last year. Now the attractive pricing in a reopened city is luring tenants back. In June, 9,642 new leases were signed in Manhattan - the most for any month since 2008, according to appraiser Miller Samuel Inc and Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Brooklyn saw 2,141 new leases, the second-best month on record.\n\nThe demand means that more individual condo buyers might soon aspire to become New York landlords again, Mr Kliegerman said. \"They didn't know how long it would take for the market to come back so they just held off. We definitely see the investors coming back.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nInvest\n\nProperty prices\n\nRental\n\nCondominiums", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/rk_landlords_010821.jpg?VersionId=UikPr70BtJx2Kxe7OrZbGKdycEWjjgIa", "alt_text": null}]}

These jobs made up the biggest number of vacancies unfilled for at least six months last year.\n\nSingapore General Hospital's (SGH) chief nurse Ng Gaik Nai said that with an ageing population, complex disease and advancement in care management, there is a demand for more nurses.\n\nShe said: \"Nurses are also needed at the community level to educate residents on how to stay healthy... and to ultimately reduce the number of readmission cases.\"\n\nShe said that with upcoming facilities on the SGH campus, such as a new emergency medicine building and elective care centre, more nurses will be needed to fill roles there.\n\nNurse retention is also a concern, said Healthcare Services Employees' Union president K. Thanaletchimi.\n\nThe former Nominated MP said: \"Due to the long working hours and the heavy demands of healthcare professionals... many of them leave the profession as they feel mentally burnt out, or are no longer able to cope with both work and personal commitments.\"\n\nAnd with the Philippines recently\n\nsuspending permits for nurses who want to work abroad,\n\nthe shortage could worsen. Foreign nurses make up about one-third of the overall nursing workforce in Singapore.\n\nThomson Medical's director of nursing, Ms Siti Hosier, said that recruiting nurses into the private sector has always been competitive. But the pandemic has made it more challenging as more nurses are joining vaccination and swab operations.\n\nPrivate healthcare group IHH Healthcare Singapore says that half of its nursing workforce is made up of foreign nurses.\n\nThe healthcare group's director of nursing, Mrs Josephine Ong, said: \"The pandemic has added further strain to the manpower shortage as our nurses were redeployed to help set up quarantine and community care facilities, vaccination and swabbing operations.\"\n\nThe group operates four hospitals here, including Mount Elizabeth Hospital. To help ease its nurses' workload, some paperwork and non-clinical tasks were handed over to other departments.\n\nSimilarly, at Farrer Park Hospital, screening duties and health declaration processes are handled by other employees so that the nurses can focus on caring for patients and do clinical work.\n\nSince January, the IHH Singapore hospitals have hired more healthcare assistants, and next year, new patient care associate jobs will be created to support nurses.\n\nMrs Ong said that there are plans to use robotics and artificial intelligence to assist nurses with some clinical tasks.\n\n\"Working longer shifts is not the solution to cope with a shortage of nurses as they need adequate rest to do their best for patients,\" she emphasised.\n\nWhen Mr Hari Shoran Silvarajoo, 34, was a Singapore Airlines flight attendant seven years ago, an elderly man fainted during a flight to Europe. He did not know what to do then, but thankfully, a doctor was on board.\n\nMr Hari said: \"I had the knowledge based on my basic first-aid training in SIA, but I did not have the confidence to actually attend to the man.\"\n\nMr Hari later enrolled in a nursing course at an Australian university.\n\nHe has been a nurse with Woodlands Health for more than five years now, and is attached to Sengkang General Hospital's emergency department.\n\nHe said: \"Time is crucial in the emergency department. Decisions have to be made within seconds. You can see the effect of your work immediately, which is very gratifying.\"\n\nLike Mr Hari, some nurses joined the healthcare sector as mid-career professionals. Most others joined after graduating from nursing courses in universities, polytechnics or the Institute of Technical Education.\n\nOver the years, Singapore has been promoting nursing and trying to retain nurses through campaigns, recognition and awards, salary adjustments, scholarships and education opportunities.\n\nThe Government announced\n\nsalary hikes of 5 per cent to 14 per cent for nurses\n\nfrom last month.\n\nMs Thanaletchimi said: \"While the salaries of nurses in Singapore have increased considerably over the years, they are not as competitive as the salaries in some developed countries, especially for entry-level nurses.\"\n\nCurrently, the median starting salary for a degree-holding registered nurse is about $3,500.\n\nAssociate Professor Elaine Siow from the nursing programme at the Singapore Institute of Technology said the pay hike could make nursing more comparable to other professions here, and help improve staff retention.\n\nSingapore also\n\naims to have up to 700 advanced practice nurses (APNs)\n\nwho can prescribe medication for patients by 2030. As at May, just 57 of 294 of such highly skilled nurses had prescribing rights.\n\nAPNs are senior nurses who typically have a master's degree and can take on greater roles in diagnosis and treatment.\n\nMs Ng said SGH is identifying and training suitable nurses to become APNs, as the hospital needs more of them to provide clinical supervision in wards.\n\nLast year, the National Nursing Academy was set up to help nurses further their knowledge and skills through courses and training.\n\nMs Bella Tan, Nanyang Polytechnic's programme director for nursing, said that nearly 500 nurse specialists are trained in the polytechnic's advanced and specialist diploma programmes each year.\n\nA 2020 paper about the challenges of nursing in Singapore, published in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Oncology Nursing, stated that institutions' and the government's attempts to improve the nursing shortage over the years had met with limited success.\n\nBut existing programmes have helped to attract aspiring nurses.\n\nWorkforce Singapore's (WSG) nursing-related professional conversion programmes have attracted more than 1,500 mid-career local workers since 2003.\n\nMr Timothy Merrill Goh, 31, who is pursuing a diploma at Nanyang Polytechnic to become a registered nurse under one of these professional conversion programmes, aspires to be an APN some day.\n\nHe worked in the events industry for three years, but the pandemic affected the sector badly.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Mr Goh will be a nurse at the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nHe said: \"During my clinical attachment at NUH, it was heartening to see patients getting discharged. Sometimes I would also receive a small word of thanks from them, which made me feel appreciated and certain I had made the right career choice.\"\n\nIn 2019 and last year, about 4,400 students in total enrolled in nursing courses at various institutes of higher learning, said the Ministry of Education.\n\nCovid-19 has helped to raise the profile of nurses by highlighting their work as front-liners and healthcare heroes.\n\nThis has translated to a rise in interest in the profession.\n\nWSG said there was about a 70 per cent increase in placements for the nursing professional conversion programmes last year, compared with the 2019 numbers. And this year, there was nearly a 50 per cent rise in applications for the programmes, compared with last year.\n\nProfessor Emily Ang, head of the National University of Singapore's Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies, said the school received more than 1,100 applications for its undergraduate nursing programme this year, up from more than 800 applications last year.\n\nShe said: \"Among the applicants, there are many who chose nursing over medicine and more prestigious courses, even though their results qualify for those programmes.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nHealthcare\n\nHospitals\n\nEmployment", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/07/31/yq-ttsh-31072021.jpg?VersionId=l9zPF3tKHL8QoYxlBCUm4kfuI3Gpln36", "alt_text": null}]}

We kept going back to the adviser to make sure we could retire.\"\n\nRetirements in the pandemic by those at the top of the income ladder were often by choice.\n\nAnd for that slice of corporate employees, working from home for some or all of the pandemic scrambled their thinking on work and life. They had been working for decades in an office, and suddenly at home with a spouse, they began to see the possibility of a different life.\n\n\"The vast majority of our clients have at least inquired about what their plan would look like if they retired earlier,\" said Leverty Financial Group founder Mike Leverty, whose clients include many executives at large companies like 3M and Target.\n\n\"We haven't seen people wanting to delay retirement. They're getting a flavour of what retirement will look like in working from home. In the last year, we've been asked to redo a lot of plans.\"\n\nDeciding to retire early is about more than crunching the numbers, of course. It is also about psychologically preparing yourself to leave work and leave behind some part of your identity.\n\n\"You need a discipline to work from home and not go into the office,\" said historian and author Rainer Zitelmann, whose books include The Wealth Elite and The Rich In Public Opinion. \"No one is watching you. In the pandemic, people started thinking about what else they wanted to do.\"\n\nMr Jesse Coffee, a wealth adviser at True Private Wealth Advisers, said that before the pandemic, it was generally clients around age 62 who were initiating pre-retirement talks with him. In the past year, that age has dropped to 54 or 55, he said.\n\n\"People have realised what's really important,\" he said. \"If you want to just go out and hike, it doesn't cost a lot of money. If my lifestyle isn't going to need all that much money, maybe I can move to somewhere less expensive, have some low-cost hobbies and retire early.\"\n\nAn adviser's job is, of course, to do the maths on whether retirement is even possible and what it may look like.\n\nBut leaving a career, particularly for people who have risen up in a company doing work they enjoy, is not an easy decision to make. Working from home in the pandemic gave some people a taste of what retirement could be like, something they would not have experienced if they had kept going into the office or travelling for work.\n\n\"It's allowed them to reset and take a step back,\" Mr Leverty said.\n\nHe said there was no question that retiring early would reduce wealth, but that is a trade-off for what could be more time - to spend with family, explore activities like charitable work or pursue new interests.\n\nA life-altering event four years ago got Mr Mark Nagel thinking about retiring as soon as possible. When he slipped on ice and pulled a muscle, what seemed like a minor injury would result in the amputation of one of his legs.\n\n\"Early retirement became a requirement at that point,\" said Mr Nagel, 55. \"You just never know when something is going to happen. So why wait until next year?\n\nHe worked for 31 years at Ecolab, a water and hygiene company, and said he had always told himself that when the stock topped US$200 a share, he would have enough to retire.\n\n\"The pandemic hits, we had already hit the US$200-a-share mark, but now the bottom is dropping out,\" he said. \"There were a few weeks when I said maybe this is not going to be the time. Or maybe this new lifestyle of 100 per cent working where I want to work is not so bad.\n\n\"At the same time, we had this goal and this plan. We knew what we had to do. As the stock started climbing, we decided to stick with the plan.\"\n\nMr Nagel's wife, Tammy, who will turn 55 this year, plans to work a few more years at Boston Scientific, he said.\n\nMr Coffee, the wealth adviser, said that for him, \"it comes down to what you're spending, especially in retirement, when you don't have the big pay cheques coming in\".\n\nPeople with large incomes are \"used to being able to spend money on whatever they want\", he said. \"They're taking trips without thinking about the cost. In retirement, you have to put some thought behind it.\"\n\nThe timing of Ms Janochoski's retirement was particularly good this year. Her youngest child, a daughter, just finished graduate school; one son is getting married; and her other son and his wife are expecting a baby.\n\n\"I could have kept working from home, but I had a good run,\" she said.\n\n\"With everything going on with the kids and the baby coming, and we're financially OK, this was as good a time as any.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nInvest\n\nRetirement planning\n\nWorking life\n\nWork from home", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/rk_retirement_010821.jpg?VersionId=6ZLD0_dGs5OJUwwayRvvNFOtS8i6pOrX", "alt_text": null}]}

Congressmen,\" Mr Trump said, referring to Republicans, on a phone call with Mr Jeffrey Rosen, according to Mr Donoghue's notes. The Dec 27 phone call came days before Mr Rosen was appointed acting attorney-general.\n\nThe notes showed Mr Rosen told Mr Trump the department could not and would not \"change the outcome of the election\". Mr Trump's representatives did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department ordered the IRS to provide Mr Trump's tax returns to the House panel, saying the panel has invoked \"sufficient reasons\" for requesting it.\n\nThe department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded it had erred in 2019 when it found the committee's request for Mr Trump's taxes to be based on a \"disingenuous\" objective aimed at exposing them to the public. The committee engaged in a two-year legal battle with the Treasury Department after then Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin defied a subpoena for the taxes.\n\nIn a court filing late on Friday, the Treasury Department said it was prepared to hand over Mr Trump's tax returns to the committee and would not object to giving him 72 hours' notice before the documents are handed over.\n\nAfter another legal fight, the Manhattan district attorney's office in February separately obtained Mr Trump's tax and financial records in a criminal investigation centring on his company, though the material was not publicly disclosed.\n\nDuring Mr Trump's presidency, the Justice Department was accused by Democrats of bending to his personal and political goals. Its recent actions illustrate a different approach under Mr Biden.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, welcomed the department's action, saying access to the documents represents \"a matter of national security\".\n\nUniversity of Minnesota law professor Richard Painter, who was ethics counsel to former president George W. Bush, said the department \"is no longer going to simply kowtow to Donald Trump\". He added: \"Every other president has disclosed their tax returns, and finding out what the conflicts of interest are on the president or a former president who may have made decisions that now have to be revisited - that's critically important.\"\n\nIt has been a tough week for Mr Trump. Four police officers on Tuesday testified before a House panel about the violence carried out by his supporters during the Jan 6 Capitol riot.\n\nThat same night, the Justice Department revealed it would not defend a Republican congressman named along with Mr Trump in a civil lawsuit accusing them of helping to incite the riot, while a US congressional candidate he endorsed in Texas lost her run-off election.\n\nMr Trump also fumed as a bipartisan agreement on Mr Biden's massive infrastructure Bill advanced in the Senate, a feat Mr Trump failed to achieve.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nDonald Trump\n\nUS politics", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_FDTRUMP01_6738226.jpg?VersionId=y1XWPC42VOyn_FP6rxKnGBOQ3bHMeZ3e", "alt_text": null}]}

There were no new deaths. The other 25 cases were imported infections originating overseas.\n\nA majority of the local cases were reported in eastern Jiangsu province, the authority said.\n\nMore than 200 infections nationwide have been linked to a Delta cluster in Jiangsu, where cleaners at an airport in the city of Nanjing first tested positive on July 20.\n\nThe outbreak is geographically the largest in several months, challenging China's aggressive containment efforts, which have relied on mass testing, lockdowns and swift contact tracing.\n\nThe new cases reported yesterday in Fujian province and Chongqing included one patient who visited the tourist city of Xi'an, Shaanxi province, and an international cargo crew member at Xiamen Airlines who had recently travelled from abroad, the authorities said.\n\nState media footage broadcast yesterday showed residents of Chongqing, a municipality that is home to more than 30 million people, queueing up for virus tests.\n\nThe authorities in one city district ordered emergency mass testing late on Friday for people who had visited venues linked to confirmed cases.\n\nNanjing city authorities ordered all tourist attractions and cultural venues not to open yesterday, prompted by the spike in domestic transmissions.\n\nHundreds of thousands have already been locked down in Jiangsu province, while Nanjing has tested all 9.2 million residents twice.\n\nChina has previously boasted of its success in snuffing out the pandemic within its borders after imposing the world's first virus lockdown early last year as Covid-19 seeped out of Wuhan, then the country's epicentre of the disease.\n\nBut an outbreak last month driven by the fast-spreading Delta variant has thrown that record into jeopardy, potentially dampening China's summer tourist season and holiday consumption.\n\nThe tourist city of Zhangjiajie in Hunan province, where a handful of cases attended a single theatre performance, locked down all 1.5 million residents and shut all tourist attractions on Friday, according to an official notice.\n\nAt least 18 cases have been traced back to the city, the state tabloid Global Times reported. Famed for its striking rock formations, the city is where part of the Avatar blockbuster was filmed.\n\nIn Beijing's Changping district, where two locally transmitted cases have been found, 41,000 people in nine housing communities were placed under lockdown on Thursday.\n\nMost of the early Nanjing patients had been vaccinated, a senior doctor in the city was quoted as saying by local media last month, leading online users to question the efficacy of domestic vaccines.\n\nChina is now studying if it is necessary to give booster vaccine shots to vulnerable groups such as the elderly, people with underlying diseases and those who work in high-risk areas, said Mr Wang Huaqing, an expert with the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, at a press briefing yesterday.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nInfectious diseases", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_WLCHINA2_6738519.jpg?VersionId=Ddjj5MyiOUksz38cIkCmJAXEFQ1OUj_A", "alt_text": "A man receiving nucleic acid testing in Huaian, in Jiangsu province, on Friday, as China raced to contain its worst Covid-19 outbreak in months.

So I made the decision and prayed about it and got the impression that we would be ok.\" They were not.\n\nHer husband, the father to their four children, had tentacles of tubes spilling from his body, hovering between life and death. The patient in the room next to her husband's had died hours earlier.\n\nThat day, July 13, Ms Greene decided to add her voice to an unlikely group of people speaking out in the polarised national debate over vaccination: the remorseful.\n\n\"If I had the information I have today, we would have gotten vaccinated,\" Ms Greene wrote.\n\nCome what may, she hit \"send\".\n\nAmid a resurgence of coronavirus infections and deaths, some people who once rejected the vaccine or simply waited too long are now grappling with the consequences, often in raw, public ways.\n\nA number are speaking from hospital beds, at funerals and in obituaries about their regrets, about the pain of enduring the virus and watching unvaccinated family members die gasping for breath.\n\n\"I have such incredible guilt,\" Ms Greene said one morning as she sat in the fourth-floor lobby outside the ICU at Utah Valley Hospital in Provo, which looks out to the mountains where her family once went hiking and four-wheeling. \"I blame myself still. Every day.\"\n\nThe recent surge of infections and hospitalisations among unvaccinated people has brought the grim realities of Covid-19 crashing home for many who thought they had skirted the pandemic. But now, with anger and fatigue piled up on all sides, the question is whether their stories can actually change any minds.\n\nSome people hospitalised with the virus still vow not to get vaccinated, and surveys suggest the majority of the unvaccinated are not budging. Doctors in Covid-19 units say some patients still refuse to believe they are infected with anything beyond the flu.\n\n\"We have people in the ICU with Covid who are denying they have Covid,\" said Dr Matthew Sperry, a pulmonary critical care physician treating Ms Greene's husband. \"It doesn't matter what we say.\"\n\nCovid-19 hospitalisations in Utah have risen 35 per cent over the past two weeks, and Dr Sperry said ICUs across the 24-hospital system where he works are 98 per cent full.\n\nStill, some hospitals swamped with patients in largely conservative, unvaccinated swaths of the country have begun to recruit Covid-19 survivors as public health messengers of last resort. The hope is that one-time sceptics might just persuade others who dismissed vaccination campaigns led by President Joe Biden, Dr Anthony Fauci, and armies of local doctors and health workers.\n\nTheirs are \"scared straight\" stories for a pandemic that has thrived on misinformation, fear and hardened partisan divisions over whether to get vaccinated.\n\n\"People are creating news from their hospital beds, from the wards,\" said assistant professor Rebecca Weintraub of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School. \"It's the accessibility of the message: 'I didn't protect my own family. Let me help you protect yours.'\"\n\nIn Springfield, Missouri, where coronavirus cases spiked this summer, Mr Russell Taylor sat in a hospital gown, an oxygen cannula draped across his face, to offer a pro-vaccine testimonial in a hospital video. \"I don't see how I could not get it now,\" he said.\n\nA Texas man who had to undergo a double-lung transplant after contracting the virus made a plea on local television for others to get vaccinated.\n\nIn Utah, Ms Greene said her husband had left the family's vaccination decisions in her hands. She initially planned to get the shot as soon as her next-door neighbour, a physician, got his.\n\nBut she had concerns about the vaccine, and found plenty of reasons to hesitate when she scrolled through social media or talked with anti-vaccine friends.\n\n\"You need to watch this,\" one wrote to her.\n\nClicking on a few links took her down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories touted by anti-vaccine attorneys and YouTubers, and videos in which anti-vaccine doctors and nurses decried the Covid-19 shots as \"bioweapons\".\n\nCovid-19 crashed into the family's world in late June when their two oldest sons brought the virus home from a church camp where nine boys got infected. The virus swept through the family. Then came the day that Ms Greene's husband, a hunter who hiked across mountains, had to be rushed to the hospital when his oxygen levels cratered.\n\nThese days, Ms Greene begins her hospital visits with a spiritual reading and ends each night by gathering their children - aged eight to 18 - to talk about their father and the prayers he needs.\n\nHer views shifted as the virus ravaged her husband's body and doctors put him on a ventilator. They shifted as she talked with doctors and nurses about the unvaccinated patients pouring into hospitals and sat outside the ICU, listening to life-flight helicopters arrive.\n\nMs Greene said she had made an appointment to get her children vaccinated.\n\nNYTIMES\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nInfectious diseases\n\nVaccines", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_WKREMORSE1A_6738123.jpg?VersionId=b_q6b0bSXOKeNqMxQpF91e1b40OVFPEr", "alt_text": "Mr Glen Arnell (right) and Ms Mindy Greene visiting her husband Russ at Utah Valley Hospital in Provo, Utah on July 23.

The Spaniard will start 15th.\n\nMick Schumacher did not take part in qualifying with his Haas team unable to repair his car in time, after the German's crash in final practice earlier yesterday. He was also hit with a five-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change after Haas were forced to replace it due to damage.\n\nThe lead-up to this week's race has been all about the aftermath of the controversial collision between Verstappen and Hamilton at the British Grand Prix on July 18.\n\nMercedes ramped up the war of words with Red Bull on Thursday by accusing them of attempting to tarnish Hamilton's reputation.\n\nThe accusation came after Red Bull failed to win a review into the 10-second penalty handed to Hamilton for the crash.\n\n\"In addition to bringing this incident to a close, we hope this decision will mark the end of a concerted attempt by the senior management of Red Bull Racing to tarnish the good name and sporting integrity of Lewis Hamilton,\" said a Mercedes statement.\n\nRed Bull had claimed that the penalty was \"insufficient\" and sought a review of the decision.\n\nThe first-lap crash at Silverstone ended Verstappen's race and left the Dutchman in hospital.\n\nHamilton went on to win and slash Verstappen's championship lead to just eight points - the latter currently has 185 points.\n\nVerstappen blasted his rival for being \"disrespectful and unsportsmanlike\" for celebrating while he required medical treatment.\n\nOn Thursday, FIA, the governing body, said that Red Bull had not provided any \"new, significant and relevant elements\" likely to justify a review of the decision taken during the race. Earlier on the same day, Hamilton said he would have no hesitation in repeating the move on Verstappen.\n\n\"Growing up, wheel-to-wheel racing was always the best, from karting. The most exciting part of motor sport is when you see close racing,\" he added.\n\n\"I don't believe our behaviour was disrespectful. It was my home Grand Prix and we worked incredibly hard to get a result. Emotions were running high.\"\n\nVerstappen distanced himself from claims of \"dirty driving\" made by his team boss Christian Horner. But he still insisted the 10-second penalty was too lenient.\n\n\"I don't think the penalty was correct because you take out your main rival and, especially with the speed we have in our cars, we are miles ahead of, let's say, the third-best team.

He said: \"We are fighting the same virus but a virus that has become fitter.\"\n\nThe vaccines that are currently approved by the WHO all provide significant protection against severe disease and hospitalisation from all the variants, including the Delta variant, he added.\n\nThe dire warnings from the WHO officials came as the United States adopted a tough new approach to boost the flagging vaccination rate amid rising case numbers.\n\nData has also shown that those vaccinated can be hit by \"breakthrough\" infections which, while not severe, can be spread to others. In one cluster of infections in Massachusetts, three-quarters of those affected had been fully vaccinated.\n\n\"Acknowledge the war has changed,\" the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an internal briefing which was reported by the Washington Post. It recommended several tougher measures, including making vaccination mandatory for healthcare professionals, and a return to universal wearing of masks over the mouth and nose.\n\nThe Delta variant is as transmissible as chickenpox, the CDC said, recommending that even those who are fully vaccinated should wear masks in indoor settings in places with high transmission rates.\n\n\"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raise concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus,\" CDC head Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.\n\nBut unvaccinated people are still 10 times more likely than those vaccinated to become seriously ill or die. Most of the new cases in the US are in states with relatively low levels of vaccination.\n\nIn Provincetown, Massachusetts, case \"breakthrough infections occurred, but vaccines were still highly effective, saved lives\", the dean of Baylor College of Medicine's National School of Tropical Medicine, Dr Peter Hotez, tweeted.\n\nIn Asia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan have posted record Covid-19 infections driven by Delta. The variant has also led to a spike in cases in Singapore.\n\nThe Philippines has announced a plan to put Manila in lockdown for two weeks.\n\nIn Australia, troops will be deployed from tomorrow to help patrol Sydney, which is gripped by a crisis caused by Delta.\n\nIn Japan, the surge in cases has clouded the Olympics.\n\n\"Infections are broadening. The situation is extremely severe,\" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said, warning that infections were still to peak.\n\nBut Myanmar is the country deepest in crisis. Last week, its seven-day rolling per capita death rate reached 6.29 deaths per one million, the Associated Press reported - more than twice as high as the per capita death rate in India at the peak of its Covid-19 crisis in May.\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nCovid-19\n\nWHO\n\nInfectious diseases", "images": []}

The world must not be silent in the face of Iranian terrorism that also harms freedom of shipping,\" Mr Lapid said in a statement.\n\nUS and European sources familiar with intelligence reporting said Iran was their leading suspect for the incident, which a US defence official said appeared to have been carried out by a drone, but stressed their governments were seeking conclusive evidence.\n\nAl Alam TV, the Iranian government's Arabic-language television network, cited unnamed sources as saying the attack on the ship came in response to a suspected, unspecified Israeli attack on Dabaa airport in Syria.\n\nThere was no immediate official reaction from Iran to the accusation that it may have been responsible.\n\nIsraeli news website Ynet said the assessment in Israel was that there were two attacks on the ship, spaced several hours apart.\n\nThe first caused no damage, and the second hit the bridge, causing the casualties.\n\nIt quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying: \"Israel will find it hard to turn a blind eye\" to the attack.\n\nTensions have risen in the Gulf region since the United States reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 after then President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from Teheran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.\n\nThe US regards the possibility of Iran obtaining nuclear arms, an ambition Teheran denies, as a direct threat to its ally Israel.\n\nThe United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which provides maritime security information, said the attack was not piracy. The vessel was about 280km north-east of the Omani port of Duqm when it was attacked, it said.\n\nAccording to Refinitiv ship tracking, the medium-sized tanker was headed for Fujairah, a bunkering port and oil terminal in the United Arab Emirates, from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nIran\n\nMaritime and shipping\n\nIsrael", "images": []}

He has a chance of winning two more golds in today's final session when he starts as favourite in the 50m freestyle and will be part of the men's 4x100m medley relay team.\n\nShould he end with five golds, he would match Phelps' haul from his last Games in Rio and surpass the four golds the American great won in London.\n\nIt has been a disappointing Games in the pool for the US team, who won 16 gold medals at each of the last two Olympics but head into today's final events on eight.\n\nDressel admitted yesterday he was hurting after smashing his own world record to win the 100m butterfly.\n\nThe two-time world champion exploded from the blocks and turned first, roaring home to touch in 49.45 seconds to better the 49.50 he set at the 2019 world championships.\n\nHungarian 200m fly champion Kristof Milak was second in 49.68 - only the fourth man ever to go under 50 seconds - and Noe Ponti of Switzerland third in 50.74.\n\n\"It was a really fun race to be a part of and exciting for the sport,\" said Dressel. \"It was well executed, my body wasn't as good as it could have been, it was the body I was given on this day, I felt better yesterday.\n\n\"It hurt really bad but it was fine. What a close race. Two of the fastest times in history.\n\n\"You don't get that very often, so to be a part of that is very special. The event is only going to get faster.\"\n\nDressel's was the fourth world mark in the Tokyo pool, with a fifth set later in the morning session when an Adam Peaty-led Britain claimed a world record of 3min 37.58sec in the mixed 4x100m medley relay. The Americans finished fifth to deny Dressel a chance for another gold.\n\nBut Katie Ledecky brought some cheer to the US with a third Olympic 800m freestyle title.\n\nDespite losing her 200m and 400m crowns to Australian Ariarne Titmus, Ledecky - who won the inaugural 1,500m title - remains the undisputed queen of the longer distances.\n\nThe 24-year-old led all the way to touch in 8:12.57 and outpace Titmus, who clocked a personal best 8:13.83 to earn silver ahead of Italy's Simona Quadarella.\n\n\"She (Titmus) made it tough and so it was a lot of fun to race and I just trusted myself, trusted I could pull it out and swim whatever way I needed to,\" said Ledecky, who revealed she planned to keep going potentially up to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I'm at least going to '24, maybe '28, we'll see,\" she said.\n\nShe leaves Tokyo with golds in the 800m and 1,500m and silvers in the 400m and 4x200m relay.\n\nTitmus was not too disappointed yesterday, saying: \"In the 800 when she's pretty much in a class of her own, so over the moon to be on the podium.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Australian backstroke star Kaylee McKeown added the 200m title to her 100m crown in an eye-popping 2:04.68 ahead of Canada's Kylie Masse, who also won the silver in the 100m final.\n\nSeasoned Australian campaigner Emily Seebohm took bronze in her fourth Olympics.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nOlympics 2020\n\nOlympics\n\nCaeleb Dressel\n\nSwimming", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_SWIM01_6738293.jpg?VersionId=YuD6nDoS6Hbyc1v.vyCp83pdGP96cFEs", "alt_text": "American Caeleb Dressel on the way to winning the 100m butterfly gold and breaking his own world record in the process yesterday.

However, coach Philippe Aw was confident that, as long as they kept their performances up, the win would eventually come.\n\nHe sang the same tune after the match, saying: \"What's pleasing is that even before today, we stuck with the process and the boys have developed individually and as a team over the season.\n\n\"Today we came here with a game plan and the boys carried it out perfectly.\"\n\nKraljevic said: \"We conceded some silly goals and it was difficult after that. They gave us problems on the counter-attack. We tried our best but we were second best.\n\n\"We concede too many goals in every game, it becomes difficult to even draw when it's like that. We need to cut that out.\"\n\nBalestier made four changes to the line-up that lost 3-1 to Geylang International in their previous match, with defender Ho Wai Loon and attacker Iqbal Hussain making their first starts.\n\nThe Young Lions made two changes to the squad that drew 1-1 with Tanjong Pagar, with Khairin Nadim Rahim and Zulqarnaen Suzliman featuring in the starting XI.\n\nAfter a cagey first 15 minutes, the Young Lions were awarded a penalty when a brilliant lofted ball from Hami Syahin Said allowed Ilhan Fandi to run into the box, only to be brought down by Tigers' Amer Hakeem Nazri.\n\nHami stepped up to notch the opening goal despite goalkeeper Zaiful Nizam Abdullah getting a palm to his effort.\n\nThe away side then doubled their lead in the 34th minute through winger Daniel Goh.\n\nGoh slotted in from close range against his former club, after the Tigers failed to clear their lines from a Joel Chew free kick.\n\nThe Tigers returned from the half-time break determined to turn in an improved display and, two minutes after the restart, they got a goal back through substitute Hazzuwan Halim.\n\nThe Young Lions' third arrived in the 86th after Hami's cross was tapped in by Harhys Stewart.\n\nBalestier spiced things up in the last minutes when Sime Zuzul scored the Tigers' second.\n\nBut the Young Lions held on to land their first three points of the season.\n\nSee more on\n\nSingapore Premier League\n\nSingapore football", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_DGSOC01NLU2_6738587.jpg?VersionId=HlPovYEn3IDhDPBKEj8s3ylzECqI9BK9", "alt_text": "Khairin Nadim Rahim (left), Daniel Goh and Ryhan Stewart celebrate after Goh scores for Young Lions in their 3-2 win over Balestier Khalsa at the Toa Payoh Stadium yesterday.

A PMI reading of over 50 indicates expansion, while one below that figure suggests contraction.\n\nChina's fragile economic recovery is being threatened by a recent resurgence of the Delta variant of the coronavirus that is threatening to dampen holiday consumption over the summer.\n\n\"On the whole, China's economy continues to maintain expansion momentum, but the pace has slowed down,\" said NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe.\n\n\"In July, some companies entered the equipment maintenance period, which in addition to the impact of extreme weather such as localised high temperatures, floods and natural disasters, (caused) relatively weakened manufacturing growth compared with June.\"\n\nAlthough Mr Zhao did not refer to specific extreme weather events, flooding in central Henan province caused more than 70 deaths and billions of yuan worth of damage last month. Henan is home to key Foxconn plants that manufacture Apple iPhones.\n\nOverall, export and import indices dropped last month, after a major port closure in the first three weeks of June stifled international trade at a key point in the global shipping network.\n\n\"The most alarming signal is the new export order index, which (at 47.7 per cent) is at the lowest level since July last year,\" said Mr Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, in a note.\n\n\"Exports have been a main growth driver this year. This PMI data release makes me even more cautious about growth outlook in H2,\" he added, referring to the second half of the year.\n\nChina's non-manufacturing PMI also slightly slowed by 0.2 percentage point to 53.2 last month, although it was still showing growth.\n\nHowever, the service industry recovered slightly, with expanded sectors including aviation, catering and accommodation.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nSee more on\n\nChina\n\nChina economy\n\nPMI\n\nManufacturing", "images": []}

My face? What about my life? My story? Why does my name refer to events I had no hand in? I return to these questions because others continue to profit off my name, face, & story without my consent. Most recently, the film #STILLWATER,\" Ms Knox wrote in a lengthy post on her Twitter account last Thursday.\n\nThe Stillwater film-makers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMs Knox and her Italian boyfriend at the time of the murder, Mr Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted in 2009 of killing 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher.\n\nMs Kercher had been found sexually assaulted, with more than 40 wounds, including a deep gash in the throat, in the apartment she shared with Ms Knox in Perugia, a picturesque city in Italy's central Umbria region that attracts students from around the world.\n\nMs Knox and Mr Sollecito were eventually acquitted of the charges, after Italy's Court of Cassation threw out a second guilty verdict against both of them in 2015, saying there was insufficient evidence to convict either of them.\n\nRudy Guede, a local man, was found guilty of the murder in Perugia and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.\n\nMs Knox, now 34 and working as a criminal justice activist, said that the movie \"reinforces an image of me as a guilty and untrustworthy person\".\n\n\"I have not been allowed to return to the relative anonymity I had before Perugia,\" Ms Knox said. \"My only option is to sit idly by while others continue to distort my character, or fight to restore my good reputation that was wrongfully destroyed.\"\n\nShe invited McCarthy and Damon to hear her point of view by appearing on her podcast, Labyrinths, which deals with issues ranging from justice to her personal life.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSee more on\n\nMovies\n\nActors", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_FDMOVIEA01_6738228.jpg?VersionId=brrVYBXZIu0axRpVpXL3iBuSBd6cwyfi", "alt_text": "Ms Amanda Knox (above), who was convicted of murder in Italy before being acquitted, says the movie Stillwater, which stars Camille Cottin and Matt Damon (both at left), reinforces an image of her as guilty and untrustworthy."}, {"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_FDMOVIE01_6738225.jpg?VersionId=XwcqYtL3Hy8RWhZnoO.QORyN82FhPDOf", "alt_text": "Ms Amanda Knox (above), who was convicted of murder in Italy before being acquitted, says the movie Stillwater, which stars Camille Cottin and Matt Damon (both at left), reinforces an image of her as guilty and untrustworthy."}]}

In a stunning Olympic record of 10.61 seconds, the second-fastest time ever, Elaine Thompson-Herah of Jamaica outclassed a talented field to win her second consecutive gold.\n\n\"This is super special,\" said Thompson-Herah, who stood bare-footed in the mixed zone later, her spikes in her hand. Perhaps her scorched feet just needed to cool down.\n\nHer margin of victory was a decisive .13sec over compatriot Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who won gold in 2008 and 2012 and finished in 10.74. A third runner from the island nation, Shericka Jackson, took bronze in 10.76. One might say the Jamaican national championships were being held in Tokyo.\n\nFor the fourth Olympics in a row the champion was a Jamaican. For the second time Jamaica have taken home all three medals. Since the 1992 Olympics, in the women's and men's 100m, they have won 19 medals, seven of them gold. Their national motto is Out of Many One People. Perhaps they should consider inserting the word Fast before People.\n\nAs Fraser-Pryce grinned and said: \"The legacy we have is incredible. Athletes can draw information and inspiration from everywhere.\" Asked what the reaction might be back home, she smiled again and said: \"I hope they're not defying curfew orders.\"\n\nThe race was supposed to be a renewal of the rivalry between double-barrelled names, but when asked about it later both resisted the bait.\n\nFraser-Pryce is 34 and 1.52m while Thompson-Herah is 29 and 1.67m but really there was no contest. The latter started slower, finished faster and like that Bolt guy from 2008 was celebrating before she crossed the line.\n\nThe late Florence Griffith-Joyner's fantastic timings from 1988 - 10.62 at the Seoul Olympics, 10.49 at Indianapolis - have hung heavily over the women's 100m. There is suspicion over them and yet they stand. Today, finally, 33 years later, the first one fell.\n\nAsked if a world record was possible if she had truly powered through the finish, Thompson-Herah smiled. \"If I wasn't celebrating,\" she said, \"most definitely.\" Somehow runners from Jamaica are capable of being intense and cool all at once. It almost seems unfair.\n\nOnce through the finish line, Thompson-Herah kept running till she fell on the floor. Relief and disbelief will do that. The stadium might have been empty but her tank was full of talent. \"I have never run this fast,\" she said. \"It's not soaked in yet.\"\n\nThe greats do not require crowds to find a spark and the run was even more astonishing if you consider Thompson-Herah's struggle with an Achilles injury. \"Two months ago,\" she said, \"I didn't think I would be here. But I believe in myself and I believe in God.\"\n\nBy 9.50pm on a sultry night the long jumpers had gone home and hefty fellows were done twirling and hurling the discus into distant postcodes. In the bowels of the stadium they must have watched, for in this stadium the sprinters are the accepted gods.\n\nNo Olympic race finishes faster than the 100m and yet its explosion briefly stops the planet. In the stadium the lights were turned off in the introduction and the names of finalists projected on the 100m strip. It seemed excessive theatrics for a race that is naturally dramatic.\n\nFastest Human anyway is the hippest sobriquet on earth and often involves the most entertaining people. In 1968, the eventual winner Wyomia Tyus did a dance behind her blocks but Thompson-Herah offered only a smile and then shot away. Asked later if the fast track and modern spikes had helped, she dryly said: \"Training.\"\n\nFraser-Pryce has already been honoured with a statue in Jamaica and now Thompson-Herah clearly deserves one. With two Olympic 100m golds her name will forever be mentioned alongside Tyus (1964, 1968), Gail Devers (1992, 1996) and Fraser-Pryce (2008, 2012).\n\nShe is not done either and when asked if she might chase Bolt's record of three consecutive 100m golds, she replied: \"I have my years. I'm not 30, not 40.\"\n\nNo, just fast.\n\nSee more on\n\nOlympics 2020\n\nAthletics\n\nSports and recreation\n\nJamaica", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_RBOLY01F_6738716.jpg?VersionId=FPjxrvpoHXyXJn7yuZwFcOBQO_94_C.l", "alt_text": "Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah had started to celebrate back-to-back Olympic 100m wins even before crossing the finishing line ahead of two-time winner Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, bronze medallist Shericka Jackson and fourth-placed Marie-Josee Ta Lou fr"}]}

Thanaletchimi said: \"The salaries of nurses in the intermediate and long-term care sector largely run by voluntary welfare organisations are still comparatively lower than in the public healthcare sector.\n\n\"There is an apparent shortage in the number of locals joining the community care organisations, and institutions work with lean manpower.\"\n\nIt was announced in Parliament last year that the Government will\n\nset aside $150 million over the next three years\n\nto boost the salaries of community nurses.\n\nThen Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor had said then that, after three years, the Health Ministry will factor in the higher salary levels in its funding to community care providers.\n\nMr Ardi S.

Other dating couples are also calling it quits after almost 1\u00bd years of seclusion, heightened anxiety and more time to re-evaluate their priorities.\n\nLocal Facebook community Singapore Breakup Support Group, created in 2019, saw an increase in heartbroken individuals seeking advice during the circuit breaker period last year.\n\nSince March last year, the group has received at least two inquiries a month from those seeking help to cope after breaking up. From just two people, it now has nearly 10 volunteers helping to run its support service.\n\nDating and recovery coach Cherlyn Chong, who runs online business www.stepstohappyness.com, saw a 10 per cent increase in clients who had split up over the past year, compared with 2019. She estimates she now has 28 clients on the mend from break-ups.\n\nHer divorce and break-up group for women on Facebook also saw a 15 per cent surge in members over the same period. Called Get Over Him, it now has some 10,000 members.\n\nWith six years of experience in helping the heartbroken - both men and women - move on, she notes that \"prolonged distance does not make the heart grow fonder\".\n\n\"Right now, there is a sense of hopelessness and it feels like there's no end in sight. Without the ability to engage in our love languages, it becomes harder to feel loved and stay connected.\"\n\nThe five love languages - quality time, physical touch, acts of service, words of affirmation and receiving gifts - were coined by American author and marriage counsellor Gary Chapman.\n\nHe says that understanding one's primary love language, or the way one prefers to express and receive love, allows for better communication and conflict resolution in a relationship.\n\nCounsellors note that engaging love languages like physical touch and spending quality time together was more possible pre-Covid-19 for unmarried couples, but under the current circumstances, it has become increasingly difficult to do so.\n\nSophia (not her real name), a university student, broke up with her boyfriend of two years in June last year after incessant arguing, which was exacerbated by not being able to meet up.\n\nIncreased conflict due to misunderstandings brought about by communication issues precipitated the end of their relationship.\n\nTheir fundamentally different moral values - he was religious and she was not - also became painfully apparent.\n\nSophia says: \"The pandemic definitely affected our communication since we would usually argue and talk it out in real life.\n\n\"We would try to settle our disagreements via video call or texting, but a lot of unintentional miscommunication happened because there was no body language to reference and it was hard to read tone over texts.\"\n\nSimilarly, 20-year-old student Cassie (not her real name) cited a lack of physical meetings as a factor in her worsening relationship, which ended in December.\n\nEscalating conflict brought their differing priorities to the fore. She was concerned about her health and family; he was more focused on his personal interests. They decided to part ways.\n\nTravel restrictions due to closed borders brought about by Covid-19 also led to the demise of some longdistance relationships.\n\nFor instance, 25-year-old marketing analyst Lim Li Xuan called it quits in April last year when her former boyfriend had to fly home to Spain after the circuit breaker was announced.\n\n\"I was sad, but I knew that a long-distance relationship wouldn't work because he's not much of a texter and for long distance to work, the whole relationship has to be online,\" she says.\n\n\"The pandemic definitely played a part in us ending the relationship prematurely. We didn't have any problems that caused us to be unhappy, but rather, we just weren't ready to give up our whole lives for each other and relocate.\"\n\nIt was painful, she adds, as her heartbreak played out against the backdrop of the global crisis.\n\nHer regular counselling sessions helped her to cope and move on.\n\nCounsellors from three different practices interviewed by The Sunday Times say that the pandemic was not the main factor in the break-up cases they saw, but merely a trigger. It widened faultlines that had already existed in the relationships.\n\nMr Joachim Lee, principal psychotherapist and deputy executive director of Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre, notes that couples who lack a strong foundation find it difficult to weather the challenges wrought by the pandemic as they \"struggle to relate as stressors build up\".\n\n\"The circuit breaker and heightened alert periods meant that the emotional needs of some couples could not be met, unlike in conventional dating conditions, straining the relationships. Some felt disconnected, resulting in conflicts and unfortunately, in some cases, a break-up,\" he says.\n\nMs Jean Chen, director and psychotherapist at private counselling practice Relationship Matters, adds that increased job worries and economic uncertainties during this period, combined with a lack of assurance and positive emotional responses, proved to be a recipe for romantic disasters.\n\nShe says: \"Emotional responsiveness towards each other is very important. When there is a lack of care for hurt feelings in conversations, communication breakdowns happen.\n\n\"And when there is a lack of reassurance or comfort for each other, break-ups happen.\"\n\nPsychotherapists and counsellors interviewed say the essential traits needed for couples to weather the ongoing storm are gratitude, empathy and self-awareness.\n\nMr Jonathan Siew, principal counsellor of Care Corner Counselling Centre, who has seen a 5 per cent increase in unmarried couples coming for help since 2019, says one way forward is to practise mindfulness.\n\n\"I think we can benefit from having a better understanding of ourselves, how we function and how relationships function,\" he says.\n\nHe outlines a basic lesson in honing self-awareness.\n\n\"First, identify behavioural patterns. For example, if your partner did something to upset you, you may want to ask questions like, 'How did I respond to it?',\" he says.\n\n\"The idea is to establish an understanding that we co-create situations and we sometimes feel frustrated and upset. It's normal.\n\n\"But if you can go a little deeper, start to recognise what's underneath the feelings. Is it sadness? Humiliation?\"\n\nBut, should all efforts at staying together fall through, dating and recovery coach Ms Chong offers some sage advice for those moving on.\n\n\"What needs to happen first is a huge forgiveness of the situation, themselves and their ex. Yes, there will be sadness, frustration and anger, especially amid the pandemic, but the next step is to accept that it happened and not deny reality,\" she says.\n\n\"Lastly, create a goal where you will take this as a lesson and become better. After all, time doesn't heal all wounds, action does.\"\n\nFor Ms Jenn Chow, who usually relieves stress by going for karaoke sessions or clubbing, the lockdown period forced her to focus inwards and find new coping mechanisms after her three-year relationship ended last August.\n\nThe 23-year-old sales executive says: \"This was my first time without having any distractions. I used all my time to heal properly and really paid attention to my emotional and mental health.\"\n\nShe picked up bullet journalling, read and doodled for personal growth and reflection.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I am the only one who can help me, so I have to be there for myself,\" she says.\n\nSee more on\n\nCovid-19\n\nDating/Relationships", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_LIFBREAK_6734384.jpg?VersionId=mbfapuHsfRdi5HNqWFCDb6RUcrh_Fdw5", "alt_text": null}]}

Some are worried about the side effects.\n\nMr Ho noted that many residents who turn up have the intention to get their jabs, but are hesitant and need some convincing.\n\nMany are also accompanied by caregivers who are seniors themselves and who had not planned on getting jabbed, as they are worried that no one will be able to take care of their family members should they suffer from any side effects.\n\nThis was the case for Madam Ho Ping, 84, who accompanied her husband for his first jab. She said in Mandarin: \"My husband has many illnesses, so I'm worried that if I get jabbed too and experience side effects, I won't be able to look after him if he is unwell.\"\n\nAfter receiving assurance from the doctors that side effects from the jab are usually mild, she agreed to receive the vaccine with him.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Teo Pek Leong, 72, said that he had not found time to take his wife, Madam Lee Lye Choon, 70, for her jab, as she is a wheelchair user and needs kidney dialysis weekly. He said: \"I often am very tired after I bring her (for dialysis) so it's good that this (mobile) centre is close by.\"\n\nSee more on\n\nCoronavirus\n\nMinistry of Health\n\nInfectious diseases", "images": [{"image_url": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2021/08/01/ST_20210801_CTNOYK_6738212.jpg?VersionId=XX2zDhVKob0vAw6vOG3U3Vcs091Fx4ig", "alt_text": "A mobile vaccination team at 22A Whampoa Precinct Hall yesterday.
