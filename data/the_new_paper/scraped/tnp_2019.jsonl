He asked us to go to the court on the grounds that the case had been transferred there, but when we went, we did not find any trace of the case,\" the father added.\n\nHe said when he viewed his daughters' bodies at the morgue before taking them back to Saudi Arabia, \"we found bruises filling both their faces... especially the younger one, which confirms they were heavily beaten before they died\".\n\nThe New York City medical examiner's office, local police and the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. - REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2483d7acca2c963171b3516bf0c10580864d59ad049551c8feac4b4b879927be/NP_20211210_PROTEST10_7055858.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Parents' groups in S.

But maybe \"this\" means too much.\n\nWinning the English Premier League remains their object of desire and the pressure is finally beginning to tell.\n\nYesterday morning's (Singapore time) 1-1 draw with Leicester City should have provided a seminal moment in this season's title race. Instead, the Reds remain stuck in manual gear.\n\nJuergen Klopp's side remain the masters of their own destiny, but the enemy within could become a greater threat to that status than anything Manchester City could possibly muster.\n\nOf late, no teams find playing at Anfield more intimidating or paralysing than its permanent residents.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nWhenever excitement starts to build, fear and loathing again take a firm grip of the wheel.\n\nLiverpool's own players have been on the receiving end of a brand of hostility from the Anfield crowd traditionally reserved for their opponents.\n\nKlopp knows the power the home crowd can wield, both good and bad. It is why he continually implored them to bring the noise throughout this season.\n\nEvery pre-match press conference and set of programme notes has been dedicated to carrying variations of that rallying cry. Against the Foxes, his message fell on deaf ears.\n\nHistory is in the mind for Kopites as much as it could be in the making this season.\n\nDropping points to a team outside of the EPL's top six for the first time this term can be considered par for the course after 24 games of relative invincibility, but the past continues to plague them.\n\nHELPING HAND\n\nMoments after Sadio Mane had given the table-toppers an early lead, Rafael Benitez was name-checked with more gusto than any other chant emanating across the famous stadium.\n\nThe Newcastle United manager's helping hand to his former club in toppling City 2-1 just 24 hours earlier also came with its own stark reminder of the failings from their recent past.\n\nUnder Benitez, Liverpool were booed off after a draw with West Ham - fittingly their next opponents - allowed them to a marginal gain in the 2008/09 title race.\n\nMany saw it as two points dropped while others coined the short-lived mantra of \"Boo if you're top of the league\".\n\nBut they relinquished the lead after a few more draws and eventually finished second, four points behind champions Manchester United.\n\nYears of parsimony by the club's erstwhile American owners had made Anfield a breeding ground for serial unrest.\n\nA failure to put other mid-table sides to the sword ultimately proved Liverpool's undoing.\n\nThat similar opposition, as well as a relegation-threatened Huddersfield Town and Burnley, will form five of their final seven opponents at home is an understandable cause of consternation.\n\nBefore a ball had even been kicked against Leicester, amateur mathematicians were calculating the margins for error that the Reds could afford en route to the title.\n\nThe conversation has shifted from how many points Liverpool can run away with, as they try to land a first league title since 1990, to how many they can get away with dropping.\n\nBy the current reckoning, 12 wins and two draws will be enough for them to finish top.\n\nLogic and reality, however, rarely tally where Anfield and the EPL title are concerned.\n\nIn 2014, they were tipped to take 10 points from their final four games. They managed just seven points, and finished second, just two points behind champions Manchester City.\n\nWhile Klopp's side appear better equipped to handle the pressure of \"squeaky-bum time\" than their predecessors, averting the fans' gaze from the exit door may be their greatest challenge yet.\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/020e618aab7aa5eb6a025293c135863c07e1d035dfe7e5062ae390f8b1766e36/NP_20190201_RBSOC01_4594850.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Liverpool's Naby Keita goes down in the penalty box, but the referee deems Leicester's Ricardo Pereira (far left) is not at fault.

The clip has garnered about 300,000 views.\n\n\"With all these interactive components and the use of technology, we hope to encourage younger Singaporeans to come to River Hongbao with their friends and family to enjoy the excitement of Chinese New Year,\" said Mr Ang, who is an MP for Jurong GRC.\n\nThe festival will be on from Sunday to Feb 10 from 2pm to 11pm daily. The event will be extended to 1am on Chinese New Year's Eve on Feb 4.\n\nBy\n\nDerek Wong\n\nRead articles by Derek Wong\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/030f1a88f8f523f6f5970357c752ac3d066c754877aef934619e268bd1fcb049/NP_20190201_DWRIVER01_4594956.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(From left) Chen Jian and Selina Lim Yi Hui, both JC 2 students from Hwa Chong Institution (College), and Laura Lee and Rae Tng, both Sec 4 students from Nanyang Girls' School.

For Captain Wu Huimin, the Year of the Pig is even more significant as he was recently appointed Royal Caribbean's first Asian cruise captain - his all-time \"goal\" after joining in 2014 and working as staff captain on Quantum of the Seas.\n\nGiven that the cruise line was founded in Norway, most of its captains hail from Scandinavia - until the 44-year-old took the helm.\n\nHe told The New Paper in an e-mail interview: \"I consider my appointment a positive step towards the global nature of our company.\"\n\nThe timing could not have been better, as Royal Caribbean announced on Wednesday that it was heading into 2019 with record bookings and seeing higher demand from Chinese tourists (over half a million sail with the brand every year), sending its shares up as much as 7 per cent.\n\nCaptain Wu studied at Shanghai Maritime University, joined the cruise industry in 2000 and never looked back.\n\nHaving sailed with different merchant vessels and cruise lines for 24 years, he has spent \"half of those years\" celebrating Chinese New Year at sea instead of in his hometown of Qingdao, in the Shandong province of China.\n\nNaturally, he has developed a set of traditions that he seeks to carry forward with his crew, including gathering all the passengers to count down to Chinese New Year together.\n\nRoyal Caribbean's cruises in Asia offer special holiday programmes during the season, including a reunion dinner complete with lo hei yusheng, festive-themed games, entertainment shows, decorations all around the ship and red packets for the children.\n\nCaptain Wu said: \"I enjoy working across larger teams and interacting with people from different nationalities.\"\n\nStill, he admitted that being away from his wife and 10-year-old son \"does not get easier\" over the years, but technology has helped him connect with loved ones back home.\n\nHe said: \"On special occasions such as Chinese New Year, I will try to video-chat them to join in on their festivities if time permits.\"\n\nThis Chinese New Year, Captain Wu is excited that his family will be joining him on board Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas for the first time.\n\nBut his top priority is still the guests sailing with him this festive period. He said: \"It is important that I focus on my role - delivering top-notch service and ensuring they arrive safely at their destination.\"\n\nBy\n\nRuth Phang\n\nRead articles by Ruth Phang\n\nTOURISM & TRAVEL\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Beef sausages for Muslim and Jewish guests who don't eat pork are also available.\n\n\"Sausage is what we in Germany are known best for, next to beer,\" said the father of two. \"If that's what tourists are looking for, why not give it to them?\" - AFP\n\nTOURISM & TRAVEL\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She probably could have won her debut if not being hampered during that Polytrack 1,100m race in Restricted Maiden (RM) on Oct 7 last year.\n\nThe bay New Zealand-bred made amends next start on Nov 11 when she came with a withering run from worse than midfield to beat another RM field over 1,200m on turf.\n\nHer winning time, 1min 10.36sec, was noteworthy.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nBrown has managed to keep Ararat Lady in pink condition for her first campaign this year. If you have seen the way she won her trial on Jan 15, you would have been mesmerised.\n\nCarrying a hefty 69kg, she beat Twickenham, who captured the Group 3 Committee's Prize over 1,600m in 2016 and 2017. Ararat Lady is competing in only Class 4 Div 2 in tonight's Race 5 over the Poly 1,100m. Based on that, it would take a good horse to beat her.\n\nThe Michael Clements-trained Raheeb has an almost identical form as Ararat Lady, just that the Kiwi-bred gelding was unplaced in his debut. But that was in a Group 2 affair, won by top juvenile Be Bee.\n\nAfter that run, Raheeb ran second to the promising Nowyousee in RM over the Poly 1,000m before being third-time lucky in RM over 1,200m in a smart 1min 10.72sec on a yielding track. All his outings were in 2017, the last being on Nov 24 that year.\n\nWhatever problems he has seems to have been fixed, as the horse has been catching the eye with his rousing gallops in his morning hit-outs and trials.\n\nClements has put the four-year-old chestnut through two trials for his comeback and he finished creditably well in both. It was evident he was not out to break any records but still ran on nicely to finish second in both.\n\nFreshness will be key to his comeback in Sunday's Race 8, a Class 4 Div 2 event over 1,200m.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

His family lived across the street, in number 21.\n\nThe identical buildings were constructed in the 1930s, but Cuaron's house was remodelled by subsequent owners, so he opted for the one opposite.\n\nCuaron has said that production designer Eugenio Caballero did such a good job recreating his childhood home that his family felt like they were inside the real thing when they visited the set.\n\nThe owner of number 22, Ms Gloria Monreal, said that turning her home over to the production team was \"a party\".\n\nFar from resenting the stream of tourists outside her front door, she said she was \"very happy\" to chat and pose for pictures, and even invites them to sign a guest book.\n\n\"It would be nice to have all these lovely people write about what the film meant to them and give it to Alfonso as a gift,\" said Ms Monreal, who knew Cuaron as a boy. - AFP\n\nMovies\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

From there it was all Kvitova, who was firing winners from all angles and reeling off the next three games in a row to close out the set.\n\nShe led 5-1 in the second set and missed two match-points before ending an Azarenka comeback in a tie-break.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nSep 23, 2022, 03:22am\n\nFederer bids emotional farewell to tennis at Laver Cup\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Unfortunately, I couldn't convert the match-point earlier,\" Kvitova said.\n\n\"I made a double-fault, I really don't know why, but it happened. I really wanted to finish it earlier but, unfortunately, I had to fight back in the second set and then I did quite well in tie-break.\"\n\nTwo-time Australian Open winner Azarenka, who has tumbled down the rankings since the birth of her son Leo and an ensuing custody battle, has still not reached a WTA final since winning the 2016 Miami Open.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Kvitova will face eighth-seeded Donna Vekic of Croatia, who cruised past lucky loser Veronika Kudermetova 6-4, 6-3.\n\nElsewhere, Russian veteran Vera Zvonareva battled back from a set down to beat fifth seed Julia Goerges of Germany 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 as she looks to rediscover the form which took her to the 2010 Wimbledon and US Open finals.\n\nThe 34-year-old, now ranked 97th, will next face third seed Daria Kasatkina.\n\nKasatkina is yet to play a match in the tournament, having enjoyed an opening-round bye before advancing after Maria Sharapova pulled out with a shoulder injury. - AFP\n\nTennis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 02:25am\n\nChinese tennis player Peng Shuai denies making accusation of sexual assault\n\nFeb 4, 2022, 08:01am\n\nBarca official resigns after calling Spanish tennis star Nadal an 'enemy of the state'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nInvestor Options Most Don’t Consider\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9cbd2d56f8a382b7f8398b68bbc859288b2fc3a8321e03ff2587da52e5564f55/NP_20190201_PETRA01_4594770.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Kvitova has risen to world No. 2 after reaching the Australian Open final last week.

It didn't transmit to me and I don't think it did to my teammates but, obviously, you get that feeling as well from the crowd and it's not really necessary at the moment.\n\n\"But obviously everyone wants to win so bad and that's what we want as well.

You will have to ask him why he didn't give a penalty.\"\n\nHowever, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand felt that teams must take the good with the bad.\n\nSaid the BT Sport pundit: \"We lost a title one time for a handball or an offside, it's part and parcel of it.

Charlie Daniels completed the rout in stoppage time.\n\nIt was Chelsea's worst league defeat since 1996 and the heat will be on Italian Sarri, whose side have now lost consecutive league games without scoring a goal.\n\nAfter a 2-0 defeat at Arsenal, the former Napoli boss slammed the mentality of his players.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nFollowing the latest setback, he locked them in the changing room for nearly an hour, having told the rest of the coaching staff, including Chelsea great Gianfranco Zola, to leave.\n\n\"In that moment, I wanted to talk to them alone, without anybody,\" said Sarri, who replaced Antonio Conte before the start of the season.\n\n\"I needed to understand, it was so different in the first and second half.\n\n\"In the first half, we could never see that the second half would be a disaster.\n\n\"We stopped playing. We didn't play like a team. It's difficult to understand why.\n\n\"I'm not able to motivate these players. We need to play with a different mentality.\"\n\nChelsea's fans looked on in shock as their team crumbled, and when loanee Higuain was hauled off, some of them sang: \"You don't know what you're doing\" to Sarri.\n\nDaniels' goal in injury time meant Arsenal moved above Chelsea into fourth spot by virtue of more goals scored.\n\nAsked if his squad was good enough to finish in the top four, Sarri said: \"I think so, maybe we are not at the top of the Premier League at the moment, but we are competitive.\n\n\"We cannot lose 4-0 against Bournemouth. I want to respect Bournemouth, and you know I like very much the coach Eddie (Howe), but it's impossible to lose 4-0 here...\n\n\"Maybe it is my fault that I am not able to motivate them.\n\n\"But the team is very strong, it is also able to win without the coach.\"\n\nFINGER OF BLAME\n\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer, however, pointed the finger of blame back at Sarri, saying it is his job to motivate his players.\n\n\"That was an embarrassing defeat and performance,\" the EPL's all-time top goalscorer said on the BBC.\n\n\"When your back is against the wall, you look to your team to find something, and he was forced to do that again for the second game in a row.\n\n\"It's his job to motivate the players.\n\n\"Bournemouth said they targeted Jorginho as a weakness and they stood on him.\n\n\"Sarri has got his man Gonzalo Higuain in now, and it has to improve.\"\n\nFellow former England striker Dion Dublin agreed, saying that Sarri's criticism of his team should have been done in the dressing room rather than in the media.\n\nHe said on the BBC: \"I think Sarri calling the players out will have a detrimental effect.\n\n\"I don't think they like to hear their manager say those kinds of things. In public, it is not the done thing, for me.\n\n\"If a manager wants to say anything, just keep it in the dressing room.\n\n\"When you tell the public you're expecting a reaction, that is not going to help that togetherness they seem to be lacking at the moment.\"\n\nWith Howe admitting that he targeted Jorginho by instructing Brooks to shut him down, former Everton midfielder Leon Osman questioned Sarri's utilisation of N'Golo Kante.\n\nHe said on the BBC: \"Chelsea seem a little bit soft through the core when their backs are against the wall and the going gets tough.\n\n\"The guy you expect to help - N'Golo Kante - isn't deployed where you would want him, in front of the back four to stop the opposition getting opportunities. He's at right-wing at times.\n\n\"It is a strange situation.\n\n\"Sure, he brings more offensively now, but why would you want that when you have a player who does what he does?\n\n\"Jorginho played in there and Bournemouth scored four.\"\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/43a195df9256453eb147964d158c3950c329db4bd13e194b2e89a40fcc69577c/NP_20190201_CHEL01_4594307.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Some Chelsea fans booed manager Maurizio Sarri (left) when he took off new loan signing Gonzalo Higuain.

It wasn't the plan to play with him for the 90 minutes,\" Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said, after Son's energetic performance injected some life into Spurs.\n\n\"I said maybe we need to take a little bit of a risk to keep him playing.

Preliminary estimates put growth at 3.3 per cent last year, down from 3.6 per cent in 2017.\n\nMOM data showed that the typical Singaporean in full-time work earned more last year, with median income - including employer contributions to the Central Provident Fund - rising 3.3 per cent year on year to $4,183 as of June.\n\nBut the pace of growth slowed from the 5.9 per cent seen in 2017.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:21am\n\n'I still can't get over it': Flight, cabin crew mull over new course after Jetstar Asia closure\n\nMore related stories\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah said the slower income growth is consistent with the slower pace of economic growth, and both are expected to be lower this year as well.\n\nMOM noted in its report that year-on-year income changes are prone to fluctuations because data is captured from a sample survey.\n\nReal median income actually grew over the last five years, at an average of 3.6 per cent per year, higher than the 1.7 per cent per year in the previous five years.\n\nOver the same period, real income of Singaporeans at the 20th percentile - those earning lower wages - grew at an even faster pace, at an average of 4.3 per cent a year.\n\nIn terms of employment, the workforce grew by 39,300 last year, excluding foreign domestic workers.\n\nOf these additional workers, 28,400 were Singaporeans or permanent residents, while 10,900 were foreigners.\n\nThe ministry said the increase last year was driven by the service sector, with more residents employed in industries such as community, social and personal services and information and communications.\n\nThe number of workers in construction and manufacturing fell for the third and fifth consecutive year, respectively.\n\nCIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said the growth in the service sector was due to improving external demand in the first half of 2018.\n\n\"But I expect hiring this year to be more selective as businesses watch their costs amid the uncertain environment.\"\n\nThe annual average unemployment rate fell to 2.1 per cent last year from 2.2 per cent in 2017. The rates were 3 per cent for Singaporeans and 2.9 per cent for residents, down from 3.3 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.\n\nFewer workers were laid off last year as the economy continued to expand. A total of 11,020 workers were retrenched in 2018, down from 14,720 in 2017 and a peak of 19,170 in 2016.\n\nHowever, MOM noted in a statement that labour market trends from September to December last year were mixed, with a slight uptick in unemployment rates compared with the third quarter of 2018.\n\nIt expects local workforce growth to remain modest going forward.\n\nJOANNA SEOW, MANPOWER CORRESPONDENT\n\nEmployment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 10:34pm\n\nNearly 40 employers offer 450 roles at job fair for retrenched Jetstar Asia staff\n\nJun 11, 2025, 05:29am\n\nNTUC exploring options to match retrenched Jetstar Asia staff to roles at SIA Group\n\nApr 28, 2025, 03:33am\n\nSingapore's Q1 unemployment up slightly\n\nJan 30, 2025, 11:43pm\n\nEstate cleaners give manager kickbacks for fear of losing jobs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Unless they create a lot of amenities and attractions for people to go to, it will be one big empty park.\"\n\nIncluded in the confirmed plans for the 2.4km Orchard Road are different offerings among the Tanglin, Somerset, Orchard and Dhoby Ghaut areas.\n\nBut stakeholders have said that landlords and retailers must play their part in the transformation inside the malls.\n\nThe Singapore Retail Association (SRA) agrees that more than infrastructure improvements are needed.\n\nThis year's Great Singapore Sale, which it organises, will be \"revamped\" and will promote local designers and talents, said SRA president R. Dhinakaran.\n\nA leading retailer with dozens of shops on Orchard Road who declined to be named said that while malls must be willing to compromise on rental income to support lifestyle offerings from young entrepreneurs, there may be roadblocks as most malls on the shopping belt are under real estate investment trusts, which are driven to maximise profits.\n\nOrchard Road developers and mall managers were mostly mum on their plans to participate in rejuvenation efforts or align their tenant mixes with the themes of the sub-precincts.\n\nWisma Atria, Ngee Ann City, The Centrepoint, Tanglin Mall, The Cathay and the Cathay Cineleisure Orchard mall, 313@Somerset and Plaza Singapura declined to comment or did not respond by press time.\n\nFar East Organization's chief operating officer for its retail business group Mavis Seow said its mall Orchard Central already caters to the younger crowd in the area, while Orchard Turn Developments said that Ion Orchard is working closely with associations and government organisations.\n\nnp_20190201_tforchard01_4594923.pdf\n\nTIFFANY FUMIKO TAY\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0419a00ae90d4d90a00b3a529eb16d9bdeb6f6dc3fcaf891dc527a13231c1492/NP_20190201_TFORCHARD01_4594980.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(Above) Dhoby Ghaut Green, could be spiced up to rev up Orchard Road.

His office declined to comment.\n\nThe Malaysian finance ministry directed queries to the prime minister's office, which did not immediately respond to questions.\n\nMRL and CCCC declined to comment.\n\nIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said this week he had seen the reports of the cancellation but was unaware of the specifics.\n\nIn a separate development, Malaysia has remitted to Singapore $15 million as payment for the abortive costs the Republic incurred as a result of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project being suspended, The Straits Times reported.\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Transport (MOT) said in a statement yesterday that it has received confirmation from the Malaysian government, through diplomatic correspondence, that the reimbursement has been made.\n\nThe amount was agreed on in September 2018, when both countries inked a deal to suspend the HSR project for about two years, up to May 31, 2020.\n\nThe reimbursement was to be made by the end of this month.\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He suffered a collarbone fracture, rib fractures and an injured wrist. The same day, Dr Yip, who has a private practice at Gleneagles Medical Centre, carried out surgery on the fractured collarbone.\n\nThe operation stretched till July 8 and the patient was discharged that day. Dr Yip certified him fit for light duties from July 9. The worker saw Dr Yip on July 11 and July 18 for post-surgical reviews and was similarly certified fit for light duties.\n\nDuring Dr Yip's inquiry, SMC's expert said \"a minimum of two weeks of sick leave should have been given at discharge with reassessment thereafter\".\n\nSELINA LUM, LAW CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Commanders answer for the training and safety of their men. To do so, commanders have to be fully committed and personally and intimately involved in their unit's training, operations and safety,\" he said.\n\nLt-Gen Ong said he, as well as the army, air force and navy chiefs and commanders at all levels, will make more visits to SAF units to ensure training is safe.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting yesterday, Army Chief Goh Si Hou said this year's Exercise Wallaby, the largest overseas training exercise for the SAF, could be scaled back.\n\n\"We're looking at re-scoping the scale of our exercises, including our overseas exercises... so that we can really free up capacity and allow every unit to focus on their training,\" he added.\n\nOn Jan 24, Lt-Gen Ong announced the unprecedented move of reducing training tempo across all three services, which refers to the duration, frequency and intensity of training activities, to focus on safety.\n\nAll services have been tasked with reviewing how they would lower their training tempo after the Army lifts its safety timeout. No details were given on when the new IGO will be set up, its size and composition, or who will head it.\n\nThe army, navy and air force have their own safety inspectorates.\n\nDefence analyst Ho Shu Huang of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies said the new IGO could reflect an acknowledgement that there are still gaps in safety that need to be closed, even if the safety regime is generally robust.\n\n\"There may have, unfortunately, been areas which were overlooked, and the Inspector-General's job is to ensure complete and absolute compliance. Ninety-nine per cent might not be good enough - 100 per cent is what is demanded now.\"\n\nSAF training safety has come under the spotlight after Corporal First Class (NS) Pang's death - the fifth reported since September 2017, before which the SAF had four years of zero training- and operations-related fatalities.\n\nA Committee of Inquiry led by a State Court-nominated judge was convened last Friday.\n\nBy\n\nLim Min Zhang\n\nRead articles by Lim Min Zhang\n\nDeath\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:25am\n\nDriver who killed motorcyclist in crash had view obstructed by sunshade\n\nJul 4, 2025, 03:08am\n\n69-year-old woman found dead in Changi flat after days of foul smell\n\nJun 9, 2025, 08:05am\n\nCollision involving lorry claims life of 27-year-old e-bike rider\n\nJun 2, 2025, 02:34am\n\nPrivate-hire driver who worked 15-hour shifts 'for my kids' dies of stroke\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nInvestor Options Most Don’t Consider\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/176ebc90a71263eaf1f4a9047297d69b5f57817eb2eee2df0e417567475430cc/NP_20190201_MICALL01_4594946.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chief of Defence Force Melvyn Ong (centre) with Chief of Army Goh Si Hou (second from left), Chief of Air Force Mervyn Tan (third from left), Chief of Navy Lew Chuen Hong (third from right) during a panel discussion.

These occur when laptops or mobile phones full of sensitive information are left somewhere vulnerable.\n\nIf these items get stolen or the culprit happens to gain access to the system, he or she may leak sensitive data online.\n\nThe HIV leak incident shows that even some of the country's most prominent organisations are vulnerable to such incidents.\n\nOrganisations must prioritise data security if they are to maintain the trust of their employees, users, consumers, and for healthcare organisations, their patients.\n\nThe root of the matter is that we're talking about the personal health and identifiable information (PII) that someone might need to commit crimes or steal a person's identity.\n\nThe biggest challenge when it comes to data security is not only how you secure the data, it's how you secure its usage.\n\nThe need for strong security measures is evident and it is equally clear that action needs to be taken right away.\n\nOVERCOMING THE CHALLENGE\n\nWith this case, educating the healthcare organisation's top management and employees about the impact of poor security and its consequences on patient retention will help.\n\nEducation should include creating awareness about state regulations involving protecting patient information.\n\nWhether due to indifference or ignorance of what security solutions are needed, organisations don't always adequately protect themselves.\n\nAs threats become more advanced, they must find solutions that fill their gaps.\n\nWho people disclose their medical status to is an extremely personal decision.\n\nThe inquiry into the HIV leak is vital to ensure patients can be confident that the healthcare service will properly safeguard details of their health and treatment records.\n\nSecurity cannot be an afterthought.\n\nBreaches negatively impact the patient and the broader healthcare ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to making healthcare organisations more resilient to a data breach with security enabling technologies, patients' concerns about their personal information should also be addressed.\n\nTransparency and communication is key, as data breach victims are often more concerned with how an organisation responds to a breach than the fact that it had occurred.\n\nThey want to be able to trust that an organisation can handle and not just prevent, a data breach.\n\nOrganisations can also leverage on available technology that allows clear audit trails of whoever is accessing the data and the ability to encrypt the data so that it cannot be saved into any device to prevent any leaks.\n\nThe road to recovery after a data breach isn't an easy one. But it's definitely one any organisation can learn from. Cybersecurity must be a core part of business strategy and culture.\n\nThe writer is chief technology officer of AntiHACK.me, the first vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform based in Singapore.\n\nDEXTER NG\n\nTechnology\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 22, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSafeTravel website crashes due to surge in travel pass applications\n\nNov 15, 2021, 10:00pm\n\n5.9 million customers hit by RedDoorz data breach\n\nOct 28, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAll government agencies to accept digital ICs from next week\n\nOct 5, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew cyber-security tool to protect Singaporeans' phones\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

This has come down from 43.2 hours in 2017 and a high of 46.6 hours in 2010.\n\nThe fall last year was due to a slight decrease in hours among people working full time, as well as a rising share of part-timers in the workforce, said the ministry.\n\nThe figure is for the usual hours worked per week, which covers a typical weekly work schedule, including regular overtime hours, even if workers are not paid for them.\n\nBut some industries still had a higher than average share of workers pulling long hours.\n\nNearly three in 10 workers in the transportation industry, such as taxi drivers and private-hire car drivers, and the storage sector, worked more than 48 hours a week last year.\n\nAbout one in four workers in financial and insurance services and food and beverage services also did so. People with relatively long hours include financial and investment advisers, financial analysts, chefs, cooks and hawkers.\n\nSingapore Business Federation chairman Teo Siong Seng said there have been more efforts in recent years to encourage part-time work and other flexible arrangements to bring older workers and mothers back into the workforce.\n\n\"If the hours are shorter but more workers are available, it would still be all right for businesses.\n\n\"At the same time, they have to see how to adapt and improve productivity,\" he said.\n\nHuman resources experts find the trend encouraging.\n\n\"Shorter work hours may mean refreshed and motivated employees, increased efficiency and thus productivity, which in turn benefit businesses,\" said Adecco Singapore country manager Mark Hall.\n\nMr Josh Border, Randstad's director for sales, marketing, human resources and secretarial divisions, said businesses can continue to lower the number of hours worked by investing in digital tools and introducing more flexible work arrangements \"so that employees can work during a period of time when they face the least amount of distractions and are the most productive,\" he said.\n\nPart-time work has become more prevalent, with 10.9 per cent part-timers among residents last year, up from 8.4 per cent in 2009.\n\nFOR MORE, READ THE STRAITS TIMES TODAY\n\nJOANNA SEOW MANPOWER CORRESPONDENT\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Around 16,000 valid claims are lodged a year with almost all receiving compensation under the Act.\n\nSince 1995, employers have to buy work injury compensation (WIC) insurance for those who do manual work and those non-manual employees in factories earning up to $1,600 a month. The WIC provides greater assurance in the event employers are unable to pay compensation.\n\nThe proposals, which are open for public feedback, would mean non-manual employees not working in factories and who earn up to $2,600 are also covered by WIC.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:21am\n\n'I still can't get over it': Flight, cabin crew mull over new course after Jetstar Asia closure\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a statement yesterday: \"While the proposed amendments may lead to higher WIC insurance premiums, the incremental cost is estimated to be manageable (at less than 0.01 per cent of annual total labour cost), with greater impact to companies with more injury claims.\"\n\nMore than 24,000 uninsured workers will benefit from this expanded mandatory insurance coverage by April 2021.\n\nThe MOM also proposes to expand the scope of who gets compensation.\n\nOnly injured employees on medical leave are now compensated with their average monthly earnings.\n\nBut the ministry said it \"intends to expand compensation to those placed on light duties as a result of work injury, such that they are no worse off than those given medical leave\".\n\nThe Act will also lift maximum compensation levels by at least 10 per cent to keep pace with wage growth and rising medical costs.\n\nAn injured employee in the future will receive up to $45,000 within a year from the date of accident in medical expenses, up from $36,000 now.\n\nBy\n\nSue-Ann Tan\n\nRead articles by Sue-Ann Tan\n\nEmployment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 10:34pm\n\nNearly 40 employers offer 450 roles at job fair for retrenched Jetstar Asia staff\n\nJun 11, 2025, 05:29am\n\nNTUC exploring options to match retrenched Jetstar Asia staff to roles at SIA Group\n\nApr 28, 2025, 03:33am\n\nSingapore's Q1 unemployment up slightly\n\nJan 30, 2025, 11:43pm\n\nEstate cleaners give manager kickbacks for fear of losing jobs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/34b64d7363694ac9e8934dfb37172ef5144fc987c86e731abe25200e3c88e8ad/NP_20190201_SAWORK01_4594896.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Act will lift maximum compensation levels by at least 10 per cent to keep pace with wage growth and rising medical costs.

Thai amateur Atthaya Thitikul, 15, was third on 146 after a 71.\n\nAmanda said: \"I was not feeling too great with my swing (on the opening day), but I tried to keep it (the ball) in play.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTiger Woods moots part-time return\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"And if there was a chance for a birdie, I'd take it.

The format was expanded to include 18 Asians from seven countries (China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand).\n\nBut the new and tougher format has drawn the thumbs-up from the golfers, even if only one out of the 18 participants managed to get her ticket punched.\n\nAmanda, who plays on the China Tour, said: \"It's good to have qualifying... (as) I get the chance to play against overseas players.\"\n\nApichaya added: \"Because this is a big tournament, I feel it is okay for just one of us to qualify for the finals.

He said he would be leaving for the United Kingdom to understudy several trainers after Feb 10. He has been granted a trainer's licence and will start when the new Hong Kong season begins in September. - HKJC\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8d7e2f5655a7086fc18a4d748081a8c42b85c0bd296d2c67dc74a98627bf4871/NP_20190201_HK01_4592805.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Fans enjoy the moment with jockey Douglas Whyte as he rides by for a final time at Happy Valley on Wednesday night.

Chelsea collapsed to a 4-0 thrashing at Bournemouth as the EPL's supposed lesser lights continued to cause mischief at the top end of the table. Liverpool, seeking a first title since 1990, have still increased the gap over City from four points to five, but it was night of jitters at a freezing Anfield. To make matters worse, Leicester's scorer Harry Maguire had been fortunate to still be on the pitch after a professional foul on Mane with the score 1-0 to the home side. Liverpool also had a strong penalty claim waved away in the second half when Naby Keita was fouled by Ricardo Pereira. \"If that is not a real chance and goalscoring situation, I do not know what is,\" Klopp said of Maguire's escape. Of the penalty claim, he said: \"It was probably the clearest penalty situation we have had. The ref was in the best position on the pitch. You will have to ask him why he didn't give it.\"\n\nMane's opener came after a superb passing move but thereafter Liverpool's inspiration ran dry and Maguire scored from close range shortly before half-time after the hosts failed to deal properly with a free-kick. \"We have a point more, not exactly what we wanted, but it is fine,\" Klopp said of the draw.\n\nCHELSEA DRUBBING\n\nTottenham Hotspur looked as though they were also about to stumble but came from behind to beat Watford 2-1 with late goals for Son Heung Min - in his first game since returning from the Asian Cup - and Fernando Llorente at Wembley. It left Mauricio Pochettino's side just two points behind Manchester City and seven off Liverpool, opening up the possibility of a three-horse title race. Perhaps of more importance for third-placed Tottenham, however, is the seven-point lead they have over Arsenal and Chelsea in the battle for fourth spot. Chelsea's 4-0 defeat at Bournemouth - a second consecutive league loss - left the spotlight on manager Maurizio Sarri who locked himself in the changing room with his players for 45 minutes after the game. It was only the second time since the EPL began in 1992 that Chelsea have suffered a four-goal defeat and the first since a 5-1 loss to Liverpool in 1996. They had dominated the first half with Mateo Kovacic's header being touched onto the bar by Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc. But even with Gonzalo Higuain making his first EPL start, they lacked penetration. The second half was a horror show as Joshua King scored twice either side of one for David Brooks with substitute Charlie Daniels completing the rout in stoppage time. Bournemouth's win came a year after they beat Chelsea 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. It was Daniels' goal that meant Chelsea slipped below Arsenal on fewer goals scored and with Manchester United only a further two points in arrears, Chelsea's top-four hopes are wavering. Southampton and Crystal Palace remain too close to the relegation zone for comfort after a 1-1 draw at St Mary's in which Palace had goalscorer Wilfried Zaha sent off. James Ward-Prowse secured a point for Southampton with a 77th-minute equaliser. -\n\nREUTERS\n\nliverpool\n\nLeicester City\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025, 09:17am\n\nLiverpool's Diogo Jota dies in car crash in Spain: reports\n\nMay 21, 2024, 07:18am\n\nSalah hints at staying with Liverpool next season\n\nMay 7, 2024, 08:01am\n\nVan Dijk wants to be part of Liverpool transition post-Klopp\n\nMay 6, 2024, 02:09am\n\nLiverpool get back on track with 4-2 win over Spurs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

TNP FILE PHOTO\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 30, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nImperial Falls is fit and fresh\n\nPennywise winds up his work with smart gallop on training track\n\nShare this article\n\nWhile the attention is being grabbed by the race for honours in the Class 3 sprint where Pennywise, Elusive Emperor and Revolution - among others - will be vying for honours, take nothing away from the Class 4 Division 2 event over the 1,200m.\n\nThat's when Raheeb and Imperial Falls cross swords while looking over their shoulders for the likes of David's Star, My Gold and Red Claw.\n\nIn yesterday's paper, we singled out Raheeb as one of the star workers on Tuesday. That, after he ran the 600m in 37.1sec.\n\nWell, we now know that Imperial Falls is up to the challenge. That, after he turned in a faultless gallop yesterday morning.\n\nTaken out by Michael Rodd, Imperial Falls covered the 600m in 39.5sec. It was a fine piece of work from the five-year-old.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nStill a maiden after eight starts, we reckon he will shed that tag in the not-too-distant future.\n\nThe question is, can he do it when returning to racing after a break of over six months?\n\nWell, he wasn't a dud on debut when racing fresh. That day, when having his first Kranji outing, he did well to finish a smack-up sixth in what was a tight finish.\n\nJust a length and a half separated him from the winner - and it must be said, he had a torrid trip, being held up for clear running at around the 450m mark.\n\nIn his subsequent seven starts, he missed making the board just twice. Last time out, on June 3, he again didn't have things go his way over the 1,400m. But he still managed to come from near last to finish second behind Little Big Man.\n\nIf any horse deserves to break the duck, it's Imperial Falls and, come Sunday, you can bet trainer Cliff Brown will have him turned out as right as a racehorse can be.\n\nAs mentioned, the Class 3 sprint is shaping up to be a really good one. We steered you towards Revolution after his work on Tuesday morning.\n\nBut yesterday, on the training track, we saw Pennywise and Elusive Emperor work up a storm.\n\nWith Barend Vorster doing the steering on Pennywise and apprentice T Krisna astride the latter, the pair matched strides over the 600m. They covered the trip in a sizzling 34.7sec.\n\nIt was like the Ricardo Le Grange stablemates were throwing down the gauntlet at Revolution.\n\nWell, why not?\n\nWhile Elusive Emperor is getting long in the tooth and has not won a race since December 2017, Pennywise is the one going places.\n\nStill a three-year-old, Pennywise is a horse in a hurry. Owned by long-time Kranji supporter Bernard Kantor, he has been leaving them dead in the trials.\n\nIndeed, since his last success in November, the chestnut has had three hit-outs at the trials - winning two of them rather emphatically.\n\nA month ago, he beat Augustano when running the 1,000m in 59.78sec. Then, more recently, he beat Despacito by two lengths when humping 60kg.\n\nPennywise won't be in Class 3 for long. He's just too smart.\n\nGuide to next Wednesday and Friday's Kranji trackwork\n\nGALLOPS BY HORSES ENTERED ON WEDNESDAY (FEB 6)\n\nTUESDAY\n\nSG3 - 1,400M:\n\nAffleck (V Duric) 37.2.

It initially covered more than 30 hotels' owners/operators.\n\nINFORMATION\n\nBy June 2016, it had narrowed its focus on the exchange of commercially sensitive information relating to the provision of hotel room accommodation to corporate customers.\n\nA CCCS spokesman told TNP the investigation was triggered by its own detection efforts.\n\nThe spokesman added: \"We completed investigations into the... infringing conduct of Capri and Village Hotels and Capri and Crowne Plaza and issued a proposed infringement decision in August 2018.\"\n\nThe hotels are all located in the east of Singapore.\n\nThe CCCS had found WhatsApp conversations between sales representatives of Capri and Village Hotels, and Capri and Crowne Plaza comparing and fixing hotel room rates for specific customers.\n\nCCCS said the exchange of commercially sensitive information relating to corporate customers is likely to have influenced the hotels' strategies when negotiating with corporate customers.\n\nFollowing the investigations last year, CCCS sent each party a notice of its proposed infringement decision.\n\nMr Toh Han Li, CCCS' chief executive, said the exchange of non-public commercially sensitive information between competitors is harmful to competition and customers in the market.\n\nThis is because it reduces the competitive pressures faced by competitors in determining their commercial decisions, including the price they will offer to customers.\n\nHe added: \"This can result in customers having less competitive prices and options after such exchanges.\n\n\"If a business receives such information from its competitor, it should immediately and clearly distance itself from such conduct and report it to CCCS.\"\n\nBreakdown of penalties\n\nBy\n\nAngelii Trissha Mohan\n\nRead articles by Angelii Trissha Mohan\n\n$793,925\n\nAscendas Frasers, which used to own Capri by Fraser Changi City Singapore (right), and operator Frasers Hospitality\n\n$216,526\n\nFrasers Hospitality and Frasers Hospitality Trustee, which currently own Capri by Fraser Changi City Singapore\n\n$286,610\n\nFar East Organisation Centre, which owns Village Hotel Changi (right), and Orchard Mall, which owns Village Hotel Katong (far right).

Among the doctors I have spoken to, most of us are shocked.\n\n\"One of the central tenets and the bedrock of the medical profession is patient confidentiality, and trust is important.\"\n\nThe patient information was leaked by Mikhy Farrera Brochez, an American who allegedly obtained it through the mishandling of information by Singaporean doctor and National Public Health Unit's (NPHU) former head, Ler Teck Siang - Brochez's partner.\n\nThe NPHU holds much of Singapore's public health data, from food poisoning to diabetes to smoking control.\n\nDr Chia stressed that most doctors are careful with data.\n\nHe said the kind of information Ler had access to would be available to a small select group.\n\n\"He was at a high level in the ministry, even higher than me, a Member of Parliament. The information he could access, not even I can.\"\n\nDr Chia pointed out that since 2016, additional safeguards have been put in place by the MOH, including tightening access protocol.\n\nThis included a two-person approval process to download and decrypt information as well as disabling the use of unauthorised portable storage devices on official computers as part of a government-wide policy.\n\nBut he said: \"No matter how much security, when someone is in a position of trust and betrays that trust, it is no longer just a system flaw. Security can be improved, but no matter how secure the gate, if the gatekeeper (in this case Ler) betrays the trust and opens the door or lets the door be opened, this allows the data to fall into the hands of someone else.\"\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Next, the US courts will determine whether the extradition request meets the requirements of the US-Singapore extradition treaty.\"\n\nIf so, the US Secretary of State may then issue a surrender order if the requested US state is ready to surrender him.\n\nSingapore Management University's law don Eugene Tan said OSA does not just apply to Singaporeans, but the difficulty is that the dissemination of stolen data took place outside of Singapore.\n\n\"The authorities will probably have to charge Brochez under a relevant law that provides for extra-territorial reach and which is also an offence in the jurisdiction from which Singapore is seeking extradition from,\" he said, citing the Personal Data Protection Act as one possibility.\n\nPeter Low and Choo's Andre Jumabhoy noted that Singapore's extradition treaty with the US was entered into in 1931, when Singapore was still a British colony.\n\nAs such, a foreseeable difficulty is that Brochez's potential offence may not form part of the list of \"extraditable\" offences under the extradition treaty.\n\nThe lawyer added: \"It may be possible to allege theft or receiving of stolen property, but that would depend on whether such information would amount to 'property' under US law.\"\n\nBy\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c3f2be476a81fc2a806f7a10a7e7345b2353efb0820ad231a90c1d3d39a840f2/NP_20190131_HIV31_4591604.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mikhy Farrera Brochez is wanted in Singapore for stealing MOH records and leaking them online.

After his release in April last year, he was deported.\n\nLer was sentenced to 24 months' jail last September for abetting Brochez's cheating offence, which he has appealed against.\n\nHe also faces another charge of mishandling confidential information under the Official Secrets Act.\n\nOn Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) revealed that the personal details and HIV status of 14,200 individuals had been leaked online by Brochez.\n\nIt is believed that Ler, then the head of the National Public Health Unit, had downloaded the confidential information onto a thumb drive, which somehow ended up with Brochez.\n\nExperts agreed the incident highlighted several flaws in Singapore's systems from healthcare and education to how stringent the checks are for job applicants with certificates from overseas institutions.\n\nTemasek and Ngee Ann polytechnics told TNP that they verify the educational certificates submitted at the point of application against the original certificates.\n\nProf Tan added: \"We don't know how the consequences will be played out and can't say how extended they will be.\"\n\nDr Carol Balhetchet, a clinical psychologist who has experience in child psychology, said that she is \"baffled\" and \"appalled\" that Brochez was able to teach and practise for eight years.\n\nShe said: \"Children, particularly those who might have special needs, behavioural issues or learning difficulties, and their parents had trusted him.\n\n\"If you give the wrong advice, the emotional and mental impact is unimaginable. To have someone unqualified doing this is really scary.\"\n\nDr Balhetchet, who is also a part-time polytechnic lecturer, said the fact that Brochez, with falsified qualifications, was allowed to teach polytechnic students is shocking.\n\n\"It tarnishes the reputation of the polytechnics and the field of psychology as a whole.\"\n\nThis article has been edited for clarity\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But they threw out another plan - backed by EU supporters - that would have tried to force through a Brexit delay if no new deal with the EU emerged by February 26.- AFP\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Employers also contribute a smaller proportion.\n\n\"With longer life expectancy and a smaller base of family support, Singaporeans need to be even more self-reliant in securing a stream of lifelong income for retirement,\" PAP.SG said in a paper released yesterday.\n\nIn the paper, which was submitted to the Government, the group said increasing CPF contribution rates for workers beyond 55 would help boost their retirement adequacy and ensure older workers are paid the same as younger colleagues for doing the same job.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 06:16am\n\nWhen is it acceptable to address a stranger as 'uncle' or 'aunty'?\n\nMore related stories\n\nA motion will be tabled on matters in the paper at the next Parliament sitting on Feb 11, said Mr Tan, who is also Speaker of Parliament.

Such homes already exist in some areas.\n\nThe paper added: \"Moving forward, our seniors want more diverse housing options. Many seniors prefer to maintain their independence and age in place.\"\n\nOther suggestions include providing an allowance for full-time caregivers like those caring for frail parents and encouraging exercise among seniors.\n\nSEOW BEI YI\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Starting in April, the Orchard Road Business Association will begin a year-long trial to bring activities, such as retail and food and beverage pop-ups, to the pedestrian walkways.\n\nSide streets such as Killiney Road and Orchard Turn will also be enhanced for better connectivity, while elevated link bridges may be built to make it easier for visitors to cross the junctions of Orchard and Paterson roads, the agencies said.\n\nDhoby Ghaut will be a green zone with family-friendly attractions such as outdoor playgrounds. Tanglin will be branded a mixed-use neighbourhood with arts and artisanal choices, with the conserved Tudor Court, for example, housing more arts and cultural offerings.\n\nSomerset will strengthen its positioning as a youth hub with new lifestyle options and the possible transformation of the Grange Road open-air carpark into a dedicated events space, the agencies said.\n\nTo \"bring back the Orchard\", NParks is also looking to plant more trees and shrubs along Orchard Road, starting next year, with a different colour palette for each sub-precinct.\n\nExperts said that the ideas are a good move, but the real transformation needs to happen inside the street's malls.\n\nA public exhibition on the plans for Orchard Road is being held at Orchard Fountain Corner beside 313@Somerset until Feb 13 to gather feedback.

To that end, respondents asked for greater support in terms of access to housing, quality early childhood education and an improved work-life balance.\n\nOther suggestions included providing more subsidised childcare services, school supplies and more outreach programmes to reach lower-income families.\n\nTapping a wider community network, like local grassroots organisations, would allow these children to receive more comprehensive support, they said.\n\nMany Singaporeans acknowledged the need for the country to maintain a competitive edge and suggested that companies foster a spirit of innovation by developing research capabilities and encouraging employees to undergo training.\n\nThey also noted the ongoing fight against terrorism and the need to stay vigilant and resilient, and suggested that the Government work with companies to instil in their employees the concept of total defence.\n\nAs for building a more caring society, some participants said volunteering should be made compulsory for tertiary students, while others suggested perks for working adults to volunteer, such as tax rebates or days off from work.\n\n- RACHEL AU-YONG\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

They are wrong!\" Mr Trump said in a Twitter post.\n\nThe hearing came weeks after Mr Trump cited victory over ISIS to justify his declaration of an immediate pullout from Syria - a move that alarmed the US defence establishment and its Middle East allies.\n\nAnd it came before Mr Trump's planned second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for hoped-for denuclearisation talks.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Dan Coats told the committee that the US intelligence community believe it is unlikely that Pyongyang will agree to completely denuclearise.\n\nIn his Twitter response yesterday, Mr Trump said: \"North Korea relationship is best it has ever been with U.S. No testing, getting remains, hostages returned. Decent chance of Denuclearization... I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un shortly. Progress being made-big difference!\"\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan duly responded on Twitter, saying that Mr Trump's refusal to accept the US intelligence community's assessments shows the extent of what he called the president's \"intellectual bankruptcy\".- AFP\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2483d7acca2c963171b3516bf0c10580864d59ad049551c8feac4b4b879927be/NP_20211210_PROTEST10_7055858.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Parents' groups in S.

Meanwhile, a significant 17 per cent q-o-q (12 per cent y-o-y) increase in staff costs from bonus provision and expansion in corporate segment hires also pressured the results.\n\nWe raise our 2019, 2020 and 2021 revenue forecasts by one per cent, 2 per cent and 2 per cent, leading to higher profits of 19 per cent, 21 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, and a higher target price.\n\nWe have assumed that M1 can maintain its 80 per cent dividend payout policy even though the balance sheet will be pressured from a $188 million license fee payment for the 700Mhz it was awarded in 2016.\n\nThere was no earnings, capex and payout guidance for 2019 as management awaits the results of the voluntary general offer.\n\nNonetheless, our profit forecasts and target price translate to non-compelling dividend yields at current levels. If Konnectivity gains control and implements structural changes to revenue generation and costs, this would be an upside to our base case.\n\nCDL HOSPITALITY TRUST\n\n| BUY (MAINTAINED)\n\nJAN 30 CLOSE: $1.63\n\nTARGET PRICE: $1.80\n\nRHB Research Institute, Jan 30\n\nOver the next three years, we expect a 4 per cent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) distribution per unit (DPU) growth.\n\nRevenue per available room (RevPAR) rose 5.1 per cent YoY for the first 27 days in Jan 2019, with healthy forward bookings seen for most of its hotels.\n\nSome disruption is expected at the Orchard hotel in 1H 2019 due to upgrading works.\n\nDespite 2019 being an odd year (even years typically have more biennial events) management noted that corporate demand (about 55 per cent of total) is expected to remain stable with a pick-up from sectors such as IT, pharma and infrastructure.\n\nMaldives operations have bottomed out. The Dhevanafushi Maldives Luxury Resort will be rebranded and opened as Raffles Maldives Meradhoo in early Q2 2019, and is expected to command a 20-30 per cent increase in room rates.\n\nOutlook for its Japan and European hotels (UK, Germany and Italy) remains positive, on the back of a better events calendar, despite supply growth. The Australian market is expected to remain stable on the back of largely fixed rentals. RevPAR for the Grand Millennium in Auckland is expected to taper after a strong growth over the last two years.\n\nGearing remains modest at 34.2 per cent, which means the company has about $300 million in debt headroom for acquisitions.\n\nManagement still sees more opportunities in the European market due to attractive yield spreads. While Singapore remains the preferred market, the recent surge in capital values has made yield-accretive acquisitions difficult.\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

In the same span of time, Ng returned a total of $119,527.50 to her on the pretext that these were returns from the investments.\n\n\"She did so to convince the victim of the existence and profitability of the investments and thus to delay discovery of her offences and encourage the victim to continue giving her monies for investment,\" said the DPP.\n\nMs Chua became suspicious only in 2016 when she wanted to withdraw some of the principal sums invested to pay for a car. Instead of giving her the money, Ng kept on stalling, claiming she was out of the country on business matters.\n\nNg also invented excuses such as work troubles and regulatory obstacles in withdrawing money from foreign investment schemes.\n\nMs Chua finally lodged a police report on Oct 7, 2016.\n\nThe court heard that Ng also swindled six other people including her close friends and goddaughter.\n\nThey were each cheated of sums between $1,600 and about $58,000.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The company has only once before cut iPhone prices, shortly after it debuted in 2007.\n\nApple did not say in which countries it would adjust iPhone prices. Resellers in China already began cutting iPhone prices earlier this month after Apple lowered its sales forecast for the quarter ended in December.\n\nThe company priced its new iPhone XS, which was released in September, at US$999 ($1,350), the same price in US dollars as its predecessor, 2017's iPhone X.\n\nThat worked for US consumers, but in countries such as China and Turkey, the local currency had fallen so much against the US dollar, it made the phone significantly pricier than its predecessor a year before.\n\nApple had essentially asked the consumer to bear the cost of the strengthening dollar.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Cook said Apple would adjust foreign prices in some markets by resetting them at or close to what they were one year before in local currencies. Effectively that means Apple will absorb the cost of the strengthening dollar.\n\n\"We've decided to go back to (iPhone prices) more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago, in hopes of helping the sales in those areas,\" said Mr Cook.\n\nIn the company's quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, Mr Cook also highlighted the impact of foreign exchange problems in Turkey, where he said the local lira had depreciated by 33 per cent against the dollar and Apple's sales were down by $700 million from the previous year.\n\nIn November, Apple also cited currency pressure on its prices in Brazil, India and Russia.\n\nApple has not said when or how often it might reset its prices because of foreign currency changes.- REUTERS\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

DP Info is part of Experian.\n\nQBE's survey of SMEs, however, found firms are still lagging behind the digital wave.\n\nWhile 65 per cent of companies polled said they were aware of the government's support to help businesses digitalise, only 30 per cent have used it.\n\nThis highlights a disconnect between awareness and uptake, said QBE.\n\nBy\n\nNg Jun Sen\n\nRead articles by Ng Jun Sen\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Market observers have noted that the Chinese side has remained fairly silent.\n\nMost Asian markets traded sideways yesterday. On the local front, stocks ended the day in lower territory, with the Straits Times Index retreating 0.42 per cent or 13.31 points to 3,174.38. Advancers outnumbered decliners 215 to 166, as 1.4 billion shares worth $1.17 billion changed hands.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Federal Reserve is set to announce its monetary policy decision following a two day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Market expectations are for zero Fed hikes this year.\n\nBut Ms Esty Dwek, senior investment strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, warned that markets shouldn't be too complacent.\n\n\"We do not think the Fed's pause will be that long, unless data significantly disappoints in the coming months,\" she said.\n\nShe expects a pause through till March but predicts a hike in June may be on the cards if \"data stabilises and trade tensions don't escalate\".\n\nHowever, any gains were offset by some index heavyweights, including the local banks. DBS led losses, giving up 1.16 per cent to $23.94, while United Overseas Bank retreated 0.9 per cent to $25.30. On the other hand, OCBC shed 0.09 per cent to $11.39.\n\nA handful of Reits also headed lower, save for OUE Hospitality Trust, which tacked on 4.32 per cent to $0.725. Yesterday, it posted higher distribution per stapled security (DPS) for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018. DPS rose to 1.28 Singapore cents, up 0.8 per cent from 1.27 Singapore cents.\n\nOtherwise, CapitaMall Trust ended the day down 1.67 per cent to $2.36. Mapletree Commercial Trust also declined 2.23 per cent to $1.75, as did Starhill Global Reit, which retreated 0.69 per cent to $0.72.\n\nBrighter spots were among offshore and marine stocks.\n\nThe US government slapped sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA this week, with the move expected to ease supply glut worries.\n\nSingapore's three biggest shipyard stocks traded mixed on Wednesday. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding gained 3.65 per cent to $1.42 and Sembcorp Marine put on 0.63 per cent to $1.60. However, Keppel Corp was 0.33 per cent lower at $6.07.\n\nIn other news, corporate guidance from technology firms remain one to watch, even as Apple delivered earnings in line with analysts' expectations.\n\nTest-handling machine supplier AEM Holdings rebounded strongly, especially after Maybank Kim Eng initiated a \"buy\" on the stock.\n\nShares surged 9.39 per cent to $0.99.\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nLYNETTE TAN\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Because the tastes are all so comforting, this restaurant offers one of the best festive menus overall.\n\nThe other yusheng that I like boasts a very modern take.\n\nBlue Lotus' Yu Sheng (from $48) has herbs and vegetables, aromatic spices, nuts, crispy salmon skin, silver bait and rice vermicelli, topped with spring onion-infused olive oil and wild honey yuzu dressing.\n\nThe result is an unforgettable, not-too-sweet dish with lots of textures and flavours.\n\nIt's available at all Blue Lotus outlets (Novotel Singapore on Stevens, Quayside Isle, Tanjong Pagar Centre and 991B Alexandra Road). You can also order online at www.bluelotus.com.sg/chinese-new-year-2019.\n\nPEN CAI\n\nPen cai seems to be taking a back seat this year, but there is nothing quite as festive as a steaming bowl of premium ingredients soaking in a flavourful brown sauce.\n\nCrystal Jade's Bountiful Abalone Treasure Pot (from $268.80) is one of my top picks.\n\nIt has 18 ingredients, so no one will feel left out. The best bits here include the scallop, fish maw and pig trotter. A soulful, rich sauce is a must for pen cai, and Crystal Jade's version does not disappoint.\n\nAnother trusty restaurant where the food can't go wrong and offers a good pen cai is Wah Lok Cantonese Restaurant (Carlton Hotel Singapore, Tel: 6349 1292). Just order any pen cai it has on the menu and it should satisfy.\n\nThe Longevity Poon Choi (from $408) is one example.\n\nSOUP\n\nTo me, soup is essential to any successful dining experience. The better the soup, the better the experience.\n\nThe Double-boiled Whole Chicken stuffed with Bird's Nest and Duck Foie Gras Dumplings ($308.15, for six, takeaway only) from Min Jiang at One-North is one of the best I've tasted.\n\nThe sweetness and richness of the soup come through, enhanced by the richness of the dumplings. The luxurious ingredients are great for those who want to impress, but it is the broth itself that makes the dish perfect.\n\nMAINS\n\nI find it hard to dislike anything offered at Folklore (Destination Singapore Beach Road, Tel: 9021-9700). I even like that you will have to assemble this dish on your own. It adds to the fun.\n\nThe Popiah set ($60) is like any other popiah spread, but the individual elements - like the hand-shredded turnip and the pork belly cooked in prawn and pork stock - are good enough to eat on their own.\n\nIt will be available from Feb 4. You can order it for takeaway, but it is priced at $321 (good for 20) and you'll need to give Folklore five days' notice.\n\nAnother impressive main to try is the roasted pork belly roulade with minced seafood ($368) at Man Fu Yuan (InterContinental Singapore, Tel: 6825-1131). You need to give the restaurant three days' notice.\n\nThe crispy skin of the pork and the umami of the seafood inside make for a heavenly combination. The price tag is a bit high - even for an impressive-looking 4kg roll - but it's worth the splurge because one bite of it and you'll be in hog heaven.\n\nBy\n\nYeoh Wee Teck\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Yeoh Wee Teck\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c5310473e8c4dbd5e8ffc61efedb23f1788311362f6d96d48f53adc4b2eaf397/NP_20190131_YECNY31RPKC_4591166.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Blue Lotus' Yu Sheng (above) is a modern take on the CNY dish while Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant's Prosperity Yusheng is a traditional delight.

Last year, it had none.\n\nThen there were the closures, most notably that of Singapore's only three-Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon Restaurant.\n\nBut RWS' latest, Table65, helmed by Dutch chef Richard van Oostenbrugge, could restore the shine.\n\nHe was a chef at the two-starred Bord'Eau Restaurant Gastronomique and his new restaurant in Amsterdam, Restaurant 212, was recently awarded a star by the Michelin Guide.\n\nTable65 is for those who want fine dining without the stuffiness. The service is excellent, the place looks amazing and you get tableside light displays worthy of a Universal Studios ride.\n\nYou can choose between an eight-course Experiential Menu ($218)and a five-course Discovery Menu ($148), or order from the a la carte menu if you're a small eater.\n\nIt does overwhelm, but the moment you are perched on the stool and the light switch is on, it's all systems go.\n\nIt begins with a trio of fish, with cold smoked horse mackerel, jelly of tomato consomme with marinated anchovy and cured mackerel.\n\nThe first taste of the glorious jelly sets the tone, jolting me with its brightness.\n\nThe 'Os a moelle' ($29) is a visual treat, with veal tartare encased in a translucent bone made out of the concentrated stock of smoked herring.\n\nFor additional luxury, it is topped with Beluga caviar.\n\nThe Ravioli of Belon oyster ($42) may not be as pretty, but it is superior in taste.\n\nThe veloute sauce has to work hard to pull off the marriage with veal shank, shellfish juice and oyster puree, but the pleasant hint of hazelnut does come through.\n\nA touch of burnt lemon is also thrown in the mix. This is a true one-bite sensation.\n\nFor me, the menu is at its weakest when it came to the binchotan-roasted Toh Thye San duck ($34), served with a dark chocolate mole.\n\nThis feels heavy and overwrought, and perhaps can do with an element less.\n\nThe signature dessert is Apple ($29). The sugar glass dome is probably too whimsical for some, and I would rather dive straight into the delicious Granny Smith apple sherbet.\n\nA meal at Table65 is very good, but you do wonder after if it could have been even better.\n\nWhile everyone's trying and you don't want to be the negative Nelly, you will probably leave feeling you could have actually had a dazzling experience.\n\nTable65\n\nHotel Michael, Level 1, Resorts World Sentosa Tel: 6577-6688 Thursday to Sunday, 6.30pm to 10.30pm\n\nBy\n\nYeoh Wee Teck\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Yeoh Wee Teck\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

There are better Pakistani restaurants than this in Pakistan.\"\n\nBut he said the accolade has still been a \"great source of pride\" for Hong Kong's 18,000-strong Pakistani community.\n\n\"It's bringing a very niche personal story back to life. This culture, this cuisine is sort of unknown outside of Pakistan, outside of Punjab, so in a very small way I think we've shed a positive light on the work, on who we are and where we come from,\" he explained.\n\nIt was the second star achieved by Black Sheep, the restaurant group founded six years ago by Mr Hussain and his business partner, veteran Canadian chef Christopher Mark, and has seen rapid success.\n\nBut he said the hard work has only just begun.\n\n\"I joke with the boys and I say that, 'It's the first Pakistani Punjabi restaurant in the world to win a star, let's not be the first one to lose a star.'\" - AFP\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nInvestor Options Most Don’t Consider\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f61d258cbcdca7837cded36e37c4d5fb12ee5a6ba807bdf9158cb0f4347cd6ce/NP_20190131_PUNJAB31M8AK_4590393.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "His father's old tandoor ovens helped him achieve his dream.

It is such a convenient solution.\n\nThe palm-size Hokkaido scallops I bought from a seafood supplier were satisfyingly large.\n\nIf you have to make do with smaller scallops on a half shell, simply adjust the recipe according.\n\nScallops usually come frozen, which is convenient as you can take them out of the freezer to cook whenever you feel like it.\n\nI especially recommend beer or a Japanese whisky highball to go with the scallops.

Rinse the scallops and place in fridge to dry for an hour. Use kitchen paper to pat dry the scallops to remove excess water.\n\n2. Pre-heat the oven grill to 220 deg C for 10 minutes.\n\n3. In a bowl, add the mayonnaise, mentaiko and lemon juice. Mix well.\n\n4. Place the scallops on a foil-lined baking tray.\n\n5. Divide and spoon the mentaiko mixture among the scallops.\n\n6.

That's Rafaello for you. Kind, honest and, I'm sure, a good horse to have in the yard.\n\nAlready a winner of 10 races, he seems gung-ho enough for more challenges.\n\nThose who stayed on from trackwork to take in the trials on Tuesday would have been impressed with his effort.\n\nHe didn't just beat the rest. He did it in style.\n\nIndeed, all that his jockey Barend Vorster had to do was point him in the right direction.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThat was easily accomplished. While Rafaello was always in touch with the leaders, Vorster decided on the scenic route home.\n\nSo it was, Rafaello had daylight in front of him when they straightened for the run home.\n\nSACRIFICED\n\nBy then, Nova Vocal was ready to be sacrificed at the altar of pacemaking and, with 150m to travel, he began to give ground.\n\nAt the same time, and after looking like he had been snookered in midfield, Blizzard - the mount of Daniel Moor - and Triple Trio decided to make a race of it.\n\nIt was all in vain. Scrubbed along by Vorster, Rafaello had flown the coop.\n\nLike a good horse, he cleared away over that final stretch. Indeed, it was under his own steam that he kept going.\n\nAnd when the winning post loomed, Rafaello had put 41/4 lengths between himself at Triple Trio, who nosed out Blizzard.\n\nBut it was all about Rafaello. He had won in a canter and he had run the trip in 60.61sec.\n\nLast time out, in the New Year Cup, the Ricardo Le Grange-trained moneyspinner was the $27 second pick in that 1,200m sprint.\n\nHe was shouted the winner 150m out but was swamped by Constant Justice, who got the verdict by a neck.\n\nIt was tough luck for his owner - Mr \"Rocket Man\" himself, Alfredo Crabbia - but Rafaello isn't done yet. So keep him on your radar. In the same trial, Blizzard wasn't disgraced.\n\nFor most of the trial, the son of Starcraft seemed packed in with the midfield bunch and it was only at the 250m mark that he had clear running room.\n\nHe came home with a flourish and was doing his best work at the finish.\n\nHe was already a six-year-old with eight wins in Hong Kong and Japan when he arrived here in June.\n\nSix months later, the Kranji faithful had their first glimpse of this big fella who had, by then, banked in over $3mil in stakemoney.\n\nCarrying the confidence of the grandstand - he went off as the $9 favourite - the weight of expectation took its toll and he finished sixth.\n\nNext stop was the New Year Cup and, while he did not win, there was still plenty to like about the way he charged home after being unsighted when the field straightened.\n\nHe made the board, finishing fourth. Following that, he was sent to the trials.\n\nThe first one was 10 days ago and he finished a good second behind Countofmontecristo.\n\nTuesday's gallop would have topped him up sufficiently for his next assignment - the $200,000 Fortune Bowl on Wednesday.\n\nTuesday's barrier trial results\n\nTRIAL 1 (ORT)\n\n1 Ocean Crossing (D Moor)\n\n2 Hostwin Chevalier (B Woodworth)\n\n3 Gifted Heart (I Azhar)\n\n4 Nate's Honour (M Rodd)\n\n5 Vittoria Perfetta (V Duric)\n\nMargins and time:\n\n½ , ¾, hd, dist (1min 3.39sec)\n\nTRIAL 2\n\n1 Secret Squirrel\n\n2 King Warrior (G Boss)\n\n3 Caribbean Lady (M Lerner)\n\n4 Centenary Diamond (M Rodd)\n\n5 Libeccio (I Amirul)\n\n6 Super Jackpot (S John)\n\n7 Catch The Tiger (M Kellady)\n\n8 Mystic Pride\n\n9 Cash Is King (B Thompson)\n\nMargins and time:\n\n1 ½, hd, ns, shd, ns, 2½, 2¼, hd (1:03.04)\n\nTRIAL 3\n\n1 Rafaello (B Vorster)\n\n2 Triple Trio (Duric)\n\n3 Blizzard (D Moor)\n\n4 Nova Strike (S Noh)\n\n5 Nova Vocal (Rodd)\n\n6 Well Deserved (Thompson)\n\n7 Pusaka (Amirul)\n\nMargins and time:\n\n4¼, ns, shd, shd, 1¾, 2¼ (1:00.61)\n\nTRIAL 4\n\n1 Mettlesome (Boss)\n\n2 The Capital (R Iskandar)\n\n3 Always Innocent (Thompson)\n\n4 Royal Pavilion (Kellady)\n\n5 Little Big Man (Duric)\n\n6 Mo Almighty (Rodd)\n\n7 Astrojet (S Shafrizal)\n\n8 Majulah (N Zyrul)\n\n9 Irving Lipschitz (Moor)\n\nMargins and time:\n\nNs, ns, 1½, hd, 1¾, 1½, 2, 4¾ (1:02.13)\n\nTRIAL 5\n\n1 Atlantean (Woodworth)\n\n2 Super Ray (Boss)\n\n3 Elite Saint (Rodd)\n\n4 Golden Win (TH Koh)\n\n5 Extra Win (Thompson)\n\n6 Morpheus (Zyrul)\n\n7 Qilin Top Form (John)\n\n8 Cloud SHadow (Noh)\n\nMargins and time:\n\nNk, ¾, ½, 3½, nk, 1½, 1½ (1:01.43)1\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

We didn't put no defensive pressure on them at all. And they carried on the entire game.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 22, 2022, 02:18pm\n\nAfter cardiac arrest, Jurong Pioneer JC basketballer Xu bounces back for A-levels\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We are just not good enough to turn it on. So we have to get off to really good starts, obviously tonight was one of those nights where we didn't play well defensively.\"\n\nThe Rockets' defence allowed Okafor to rack up 27 points with 12 rebounds, while Holiday posted 19 points, six rebounds, eight assists and six blocked shots for the Pelicans.\n\nThey were missing five of their top six rotation players and reeling from the trade request of All-NBA centre Anthony Davis, who is also sidelined with a finger injury.\n\nThe Pelicans trailed by as many as 15 points and took the lead for the first time only with 2min 6sec remaining in the third quarter, when Kenrich Williams (eight points, 16 rebounds) scored on a backdoor lay-up for a 90-88 edge.\n\nEmboldened, the Pelicans stretched their lead to as many as 12 points in the fourth.\n\nA collective effort uplifted New Orleans, who had dropped five of six games.\n\nHarden's streak actually appeared to be in jeopardy, but a late spurt kept it going. He did not hit 30 points until he sank a three-pointer with less than two minutes left, and then he scored seven more points in the final minute, but it was not enough for a victory.\n\nMeanwhile,the visiting Philadelphia 76ers welcomed Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler and Wilson Chandler back into their starting line-up, and the trio helped them run over the short-handed Los Angeles Lakers 121-105 to get back on track after a rough start to a five-game road trip.\n\nEmbiid finished with 28 points and 11 rebounds. Butler scored 20 points, and Chandler finished with nine.\n\nBrandon Ingram scored a career-high 36 points for the Lakers.\n\nLeBron James, who sat out his 17th straight game with a groin injury, is close to returning for the Lakers, who fell to a 6-11 win-loss record in his absence.\n\nHe could be back tomorrow morning when they face the Los Angeles Clippers. - REUTERS\n\nSELECTED RESULTS: Cleveland Cavaliers 116 Washington Wizards 113, Orlando Magic 117 Oklahoma City Thunder 126, San Antonio Spurs 126 Phoenix Suns 124\n\nBasketball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 8, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nLeBron stars as Lakers beat Celtics\n\nDec 1, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSuns beat Warriors for 17th straight win\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nJokic's return sees Nuggets end losing run\n\nNov 29, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nCurry stars ahead of clash with Suns\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

What's the value of Newcastle United's patched-up ragamuffins? Around £40m.\n\nAnd the value of watching a gleaming club with a bottomless well of cash lose to a poverty-stricken outfit?\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nPriceless.\n\nSuch crass gloating after City's astonishing 2-1 defeat at Newcastle yesterday (Singapore time) can seem childish, as if indulging in the politics of envy, punishing the wealthy for the crime of being wealthy.\n\nCity's latest setback feeds our appetite for Schadenfreude, certainly, but they really don't help themselves.\n\nIn a tweet posted a day before the game, City's official Twitter account stated that \"we're 22 games unbeaten against Newcastle, the longest undefeated streak in the top flight! Will it continue tomorrow?\"\n\nThe tweet wasn't factually wrong, but the underlying sense of entitlement was a dropped banana skin just waiting for Pep Guardiola's men to find.\n\nThe club's eagerness to buy a dynasty and confirm their status as a global player, via back-to-back titles, is omnipresent, which makes sympathy almost impossible to come by when they falter.\n\nCity's seemingly limitless spending budget - allegedly circumventing Uefa's Financial Fair Play rules along the way - leaves them in the extraordinary position of literally having no excuses.\n\nThere is no reason to lose at St James' Park, under any reasonable circumstances.\n\nGuardiola has two international performers in every single position, sometimes more. He can lose one of the finest midfield technicians in Kevin de Bruyne for months and barely miss a trick.\n\nIn stark contrast, Rafa Benitez rested Salomon Rondon for last weekend's FA Cup tie, which Newcastle lost, to ensure the Magpies had at least one passable striker available to face the billion-dollar project from Manchester.\n\nRondon scored against City and Newcastle won, thanks in large part to a tactical masterclass from Benitez, who held two banks of four until early in the second half, when he nudged them forward in incremental steps.\n\nThere is a case to make that Benitez keeping the Magpies in the EPL would represent a greater coaching achievement than Guardiola retaining the title. If City finish second, as looks increasingly likely, then it's not even close. Benitez wins.\n\nGULF IN QUALITY\n\nTo underscore the gulf in quality, Newcastle's holding midfield of Isaac Hayden and Sean Longstaff were thrown together for a combined fee of £1.5m.\n\nCity's trio of David Silva, Fernandinho and de Bruyne cost £115m.\n\nHad their battle been a financial boxing bout, then the mismatch would've been called off to avoid a bloodbath.\n\nAnd yet, they prevailed at St James' Park, against literally every available odd, which can happen.\n\nUnderdogs do win. Upsets occur. Giants tumble. The EPL's competitive unpredictability is trumpeted for a reason.\n\nThe bigger issue is why should we care about City's latest setback?\n\nThey are a side with no handicaps, which means no compassion when they squander their in-built privileges.\n\nManchester United are still struggling with the end of Sir Alex Ferguson's empire, just as they laboured for decades to shake off the ghost of Sir Matt Busby.\n\nArsenal and Chelsea must deal with absentee owners who can't entirely decide on their long-term plans. Tottenham Hotspur don't spend anything and Liverpool have only recently brought a bigger piggy bank to the table.\n\nTo varying degrees, excuses can be found for all of them for their occasional setbacks, but City are in a league of their own when it comes to spending budgets. It was their choice.\n\nThey wanted to be held to a higher standard and should be judged accordingly.\n\nWhen the deepest, richest squad cannot defeat Crystal Palace, Leicester City and Newcastle and fail to overcome the disciplined tactics of those sides, then tougher questions must be asked.\n\nWhy are they so listless against limited opponents?\n\nWhy is so much of their possession largely pointless?\n\nHow can such an embarrassment of riches embarrassingly throw away the lead in three different games?\n\nHow have they dropped more points already (16) than the whole of last season?\n\nThese are not unfair questions, not when they are posed to a club with such unfair financial advantages.\n\nCity do not owe us scintillating football and rugby scores every week, obviously, but they do owe us a title race. That's a bare minimum.\n\nAnd if they don't muster one in the final 14 games of the season, then they'll get the kind of sympathy they deserve. None.\n\nStill time for City to play catch up: Guardiola\n\nPep Guardiola's 100th English Premier League game in charge of Manchester City had looked all set within the first half-minute at Newcastle United to be just the latest record-breaking milestone in his triumphant reign in England.\n\nInstead, it turned into the mystifying ordeal of a wholly unexpected 2-1 defeat at St James' Park that leaves the Spaniard facing the toughest challenge of his City stewardship as he sees their title slipping away, reported Reuters.\n\nSergio Aguero's goal after 24 seconds was quickest in any EPL match this season but was only the prelude to one of City's most sluggish displays as Newcastle fought back to win with second-half goals from Salomon Rondon and Matt Ritchie yesterday morning (Singapore time).\n\nCity could find themselves seven points behind league leaders Liverpool, should they beat Leicester City this morning.\n\nGuardiola, however, insists that there are enough games remaining to claw back the deficit.\n\nHe said: \"It's a lot of points if they go on to win, but we are in January, it's not April or May.\n\n\"There are still many games and anything can happen.\n\n\"A lot of teams are playing (for) many reasons, teams to stay in the Premier League, others to go to the Europa League, for the Champions League...\n\n\"I know the challenge is big, being in all competitions is what it is. If you want to go up as a club, you have to accept that challenge.\"\n\nThe defeat meant Guardiola missed out on an outright record of achieving the most wins in the EPL era by any manager in their first 100 games.\n\nIt would have been his 74th win - but instead he will now share that landmark with his old rival, Jose Mourinho, who won 73 of his first 100 with Chelsea.\n\nFormer Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jermaine Jenas accused City of \"arrogance\" against the Magpies.\n\nHe said on BT Sport: \"I've never seen them (City) look so poor in possession.\n\n\"They were off the pace at times, almost a slight air of arrogance, I felt - turning up and believing they are going to walk this one and go home.\"\n\nFormer England forward Trevor Francis agreed, saying on beIN Sport: \"I don't like the attitude of one or two Manchester City players today.\n\n\"I don't think they played with enough enthusiasm, enough energy, Saturday was too easy. They strolled (to a 5-0 win) against Burnley and they took to the field tonight expecting probably a similar kind of performance.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there was more good news for Newcastle yesterday, with British media reporting that they broke their transfer record to sign Paraguayan midfielder Miguel Almiron for £20 million (S$35.5m) from Atlanta United.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

His quality is this.\"\n\nBut Emery's move raised the ire of former Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman, who believes they should have reinforced their backline instead.\n\nLIMITED OPTIONS\n\nDefenders Rob Holding, Hector Bellerin, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Laurent Koscielny have been hit by injuries, giving Emery limited options at the back.\n\nSpeaking on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast Show, Seaman said: \"We don't need midfielders, we need defenders.\n\n\"We've got big injuries to quite a few of them already, we need good defenders coming in.\n\n\"We're great going forward, but what's happening with the defence? It's just not got any better all season.\"\n\nSuarez, however, has been backed to succeed at Arsenal by his former Manchester City teammate Joan Roman.\n\nThe duo were together in City's reserves team eight years ago, but both found playing time difficult and left the Etihad.\n\nRoman, who is now with Polish side Miedzi Legnica, told Sky Sports: \"When we were playing in the reserves... he struggled in the first few games... but, after these few games, he adapted as he is a strong guy.\"\n\nSuarez could make his Arsenal debut against City on Monday morning (Singapore time).\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7aeb8694090d5253c81db46b96b0c1326a14a510045e6fe384fcbb3a388f46b1/np_20190131_ars31u9ho_4591762.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Yannick Carrasco (left) is in talks with Arsenal over a proposed move, while Denis Suarez (right) arrived in London yesterday for a medical ahead of his loan move to the Emirates.

I just don't know.\n\n\"We all know about Fergie time and all that, and everyone here is used to it, so I'm more talking about the mentality of those five minutes and the lift it gives them.\n\n\"If it's three, then it's different, the fans are thinking it may not be enough time. But five gives them the lift they need.\n\n\"There were no physios on at all, just five subs so 2½-3 minutes tops, but they got five.\"\n\nSolskjaer, meanwhile, said the fightback was testament to the mentality of the club and his players.\n\nHe said: \"The way we came back was fantastic. We are happy with a point and we could have got three by the end.\n\n\"We just ran out of time and we started too late, with the urgency that we needed...\n\n\"But now you have your answer - can they come back if they go one down, or two down, even? So I am very happy with the response.\n\n\"That's Man United. We know we could have performed better in the first 60-70 minutes but, then again, the reaction was brilliant and, to get two goals after 87 minutes, that's fantastic and that's a testament to the character of everyone.\n\n\"Never give up. Never give up at this club.\"\n\nThe draw ends Solskjaer's 100 per cent record as United manager and midfielder Nemanja Matic was blunt in his assessment that \"today was not good enough\".\n\nSaid the Serb: \"I think it is two points lost, we expect more from this game. We wanted to win, but after 2-0 down, we have to be happy with one point.\n\n\"We have to do much better, the mentality needs to be much better than the first 75 minutes.\n\n\"So, we have (to) look into the mirror to see where we made mistakes, to improve as a team.\n\n\"Then we will be happy again.\n\n\"But I have to repeat - today was not good enough.\"\n\nPogba agreed, suggesting his team had been complacent.\n\nHe said: \"I think we played like we were winning maybe 1-0 or 2-0 and that's why the result was like that...\n\n\"Next time I think we need to start the game differently. That's it...\n\n\"It's not that we didn't (stay humble) but you have to start strong, you have to be aggressive because they were in the first half.\"\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Reservist (duty) and national service is something so many have to go through, and while it is necessary and unavoidable, as parents of course we are all worried.\"\n\nMr Chew said that while he and his wife did not particularly follow Mr Pang's work, they had watched a lot of shows that he was in and thought he was \"a very talented actor and a nice boy who respected his elders\".\n\nSiblings Benjamin and Narelle Kheng, of local English pop band The Sam Willows, were also at the wake to pay their respects. They had both worked with Pang.\n\nBenjamin, 28, said: \"(He) knew that I was a musician, and wanted to connect, so he asked if I knew this band called Kodaline and then he started singing softly, waiting for me to join in and sing along. I still remember the song, it was All I Want.\n\n\"He was truly welcoming. It's so unfair, he was the nicest guy ever.\"\n\nNarelle, 25, added: \"It still feels unbelievable and kind of strange that he is not around.\n\n\"He was an angel.\"\n\nJayley Woo mourns quietly in public over loss of boyfriend\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nMs Jayley Woo was at the wake yesterday, head hung in sorrow when she appeared around 11.30am flanked by Mr Kenny Pang, older brother of her late boyfriend Aloysius Pang.\n\nThe 27-year-old has not uttered a word in public since the death of Aloysius, but has taken to social media to express her love for the 28-year-old actor and pay tribute to him.\n\nIn an Instagram story on Saturday, she said: \"I wish that I will be able to do something for him to remember him as he is, so I will take on interviews but just not in this period of time, give me a few weeks.\n\n\"Everything is very overwhelming right now. I am very thankful for all the attention, love and everything... let's just focus on sending him off right.\"\n\nIn a series of Instagram posts, the actress said she had felt his presence twice since he died on Wednesday.\n\n\"But I have not gotten to meet him in my dreams yet because I have not been sleeping well,\" she said.\n\nMs Woo also hit out at those whom she seemed to suggest had been using Mr Pang's photographs for personal gain, without pointing out a specific incident.\n\nOne post which went viral has an alleged insurance agent using his death as an example of why one should buy insurance.\n\nShe also added that she was happy to have found a family in his parents, brothers and sisters-in-law.\n\nShe said: \"Baby, don't worry, I will take good care of your family on your behalf.

You have to start properly in each game and today we didn't start off well enough to cause Burnley enough problems.\" United, who have slipped two points behind fifth-placed Arsenal, piled plenty of pressure on Burnley's defence but caused too few problems with their crosses from wide. \"We know they (Burnley) are well-organised and happy if we cross the ball, we needed more tempo and more urgency in the play, play our way into the box more,\" said Solskjaer. The ex-United striker, who took over from the sacked Jose Mourinho in December, was happy however with the late rally. \"I was stopped so many times (after the game) by the staff, so many people saying great spirit fighting spirit, and the way they came back was fantastic and so of course (I'm) happy with a point, but we could have got three even at the end but we just ran out of time. \"We started too late with the urgency, that's a learning curve but now you've got your answer, can they come back if they go one down or two down, even so I'm very happy with the response,\" he said. United's Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic conceded the performance had not been up to scratch. \"I think it is two points lost, we expected more from this game. We wanted to win, but after 2-0 down we have to be happy with one point. \"But we should play better, we have to play better, see where we made mistakes, to improve and play like we have in the last seven or eight games,\" said the former Chelsea player. \"But this is the Premier League, every team has quality and will punish you if you miss chances, exactly what Burnley did today. \"We have to do much better, the mentality needs to be much better than the first 75 minutes. \"So we have look into the mirror to see where we made mistakes, to improve as a team then we will be happy again. But I have to repeat - today was not good enough.\" -\n\nREUTERS\n\nManchester United\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer\n\nBURNLEY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 17, 2024, 03:31am\n\nTen Hag confirms Man Utd looked for other managers\n\nMay 26, 2024, 02:25pm\n\n'I'll win trophies elsewhere,' says Erik ten Hag as Manchester United sack talk lingers\n\nMay 24, 2024, 03:27pm\n\nMan City eye double double but Cup final is enough motivation\n\nMay 20, 2024, 02:54am\n\nGuardiola's demand for perfection fuels Man City hunger\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0a5b4ac630da4051f4aaae99601aa1cf457c7293def192750544ea366723d8c7/lind.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Victor Lindelof (centre) equalising for Manchester United in the dying minutes.", "caption": "Victor Lindelof (centre) equalising for Manchester United in the dying minutes.

Sergio Aguero's goal in 24 seconds was quickest in any EPL match this season but was only the prelude to one of City's most sluggish displays as Newcastle fought back to win with second-half goals from Salomon Rondon and a Matt Ritchie penalty. It left City still four points behind Liverpool at the top of the table, with Juergen Klopp's pacesetters now having the chance to stretch the lead to an intimidating seven when they host Leicester City on Thursday morning (Singapore time). It left Guardiola sounding just a little resigned as he pondered how his men can possibly claw back that deficit against a Liverpool side that has lost just once in the league this season - against City at the start of the month. \"We had a chance today to reduce the lead. Tomorrow is a game for our opponent (Liverpool). When you are behind, you have to win games and we couldn't do that,\" he said. City have been touted as the potential winners of four trophies this season - not by Guardiola himself, it should be said - but this loss made any such talk seem fanciful. \"I know the challenge is big, being in all competitions is what it is,\" shrugged Guardiola. \"If you want to go up as a club, you have to accept that challenge. I prefer to be in that position.\"\n\nThe real shock for him, though, must have come in seeing a side that had stormed their way through January - Aguero's was their 30th unanswered goal in their New Year rampage - suddenly look flat and, frankly, quite careless. \"It was not our best night, we didn't make a good performance,\" he shrugged. \"We didn't take the rhythm of the game, it was slow and we weren't aggressive enough... The game was not good. We did not defend the second ball well, we have to improve.\"\n\nFor once, City's unremitting pressing and cutting interplay was curiously absent and it meant Guardiola missed out on an outright record of achieving most wins in the EPL era by any manager in their first 100 games. It would have been his 74th win - but instead he will now share that landmark with his old rival, Jose Mourinho, who won 73 of his first 100 with Chelsea while winning the title in successive years. That's a feat that, for the moment, looks increasingly out of reach for the man who has long since usurped Mourinho as the EPL's \"Special One\". -\n\nREUTERS\n\nOther results:\n\nArsenal 2 Cardiff City 1, Fulham 4 Brighton 2, Huddersfield 0 Everton 1, Wolves 3 West Ham 0, Manchester United 2 Burnley 2\n\nmanchester city\n\nnewcastle united\n\npep guardiola\n\nliverpool\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 24, 2024, 03:27pm\n\nMan City eye double double but Cup final is enough motivation\n\nMay 20, 2024, 02:54am\n\nGuardiola's demand for perfection fuels Man City hunger\n\nApr 29, 2024, 06:20am\n\nMan City still have a mountain to climb in title race\n\nApr 25, 2024, 01:38am\n\nKlopp apologises to Liverpool supporters after huge blow to title hopes\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/366dc5e2ce0628fade382b5888a5fe4f3630aa011cdde620b708f6b31abca80e/pep.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Pep Guardiola said they weren't aggressive enough against Newcastle United.", "caption": "Pep Guardiola said they weren't aggressive enough against Newcastle United.

He tested positive.\n\nThe couple knew Singapore would not grant him an employment pass if that surfaced.\n\nSo Brochez needed a clean blood test to get an employment pass, and that started a chain of deception.\n\nAt that time, Ler was working as a locum at My Family Clinic in Commonwealth Drive. On March 13, 2008, before leaving for work, he drew blood from his left arm and stored it in a test tube, which he took to the clinic.\n\nBrochez went to the clinic the same evening for a blood test required by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for his application to work here. Ler took the tube of his blood and labelled it with Brochez's details.\n\nThe blood test came up clean and Brochez got his employment pass later that month.\n\nUsing faked certificates, he landed a job at Temasek Polytechnic, teaching students early childhood studies and psychology.\n\nMeanwhile, Ler joined the MOH and was head of its National Public Health Unit from March 2012 till May 2013.\n\nThat gave him access to details of everyone who had tested positive in Singapore for HIV since 1985.\n\nLer downloaded the confidential information onto a thumb drive and it somehow ended up in Brochez's hands.\n\nIronically, at one point when they had relationship problems, Brochez complained to MOH that Ler was taking screenshots of the HIV Registry.\n\nAn investigation was launched and Ler was transferred to the TB control unit.\n\nMeanwhile, on Oct 3, 2013, having confirmed the HIV-positive test done at a Sata clinic in March 2008 belonged to Brochez, MOH informed the MOM he had faked his blood test.\n\nCONFRONT\n\nA few days later, MOM confronted Brochez. He denied the charge and the whole rigmarole of faking the blood test was repeated in November when he went to Twin City Medical Centre at Great World City, where Ler was working as a locum.\n\nAgain, it was Ler's blood that was tested. Again the test came out clean.\n\nBut suspicions had been aroused and a police report was lodged against Brochez on Dec 11, 2013, for cheating over the second blood test.\n\nThe following month, in January 2014, Ler resigned from his position at the MOH, though it is not known why.\n\nShortly after this, the two men went to the US where they got married in New York City on April 24, 2014.\n\nThey returned to Singapore and in May that year, Brochez lied to a police inspector that it was his own blood that had been tested.\n\nTwo years later, another tip-off was to expose his web of lies.\n\nIn May 2016, the MOH was told that Brochez possessed confidential information that had come from the HIV Registry. It lodged a police report.\n\nOn May 24, 2016, both men were arrested as their old lies about the faked blood tests came back to haunt them.\n\nAt around 10pm, the police searched the men's home at Lorong N Telok Kurau and found drugs and the \"stolen information\" from the HIV Register, which was \"seized and secured\". The police also found Brochez's fake bachelor's degree, master's degree and doctorate.\n\nOn March 28, 2017, Brochez was sentenced to 28 months in jail.\n\nSince he had already spent time in custody before that, he was released from prison in April last year.\n\nHe was then deported.\n\nAfter he left Singapore, the MOH got yet another tip-off in May last year that Brochez still had the information stolen from the HIV Register.\n\nThe ministry lodged another police report and tried to contact and tell affected people of this breach.\n\nThen, on Jan 22, the police told the ministry that Brochez may have made the confidential information public.\n\nIn a couple of days, the MOH was able to ascertain that the data was from the HIV Registry.\n\nDetails of thousands of people with HIV had been put online, and Brochez could make the information public again - even though the current links have been blocked.\n\nLer, meanwhile, had been sentenced to 24 months' jail in September last year for abetting Brochez's cheating offence.\n\nHe has appealed against the sentence and also faces another charge of mishandling confidential information under the OSA.\n\nWhile he remains a doctor for now, his certificate to practise medicine here expired at the end of last year and has not been renewed.\n\nSALMA KHALIK, SENIOR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e2f502c5f54eb2d14244751c9dfe2be40921cdab5df54aae334ecd9d3033c1e5/np_20190130_skstory301zax_45889581.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mikhy Farrera Brochez (left) and Ler Teck Siang.

Huawei has said the companies settled their dispute in 2017.\n\nCFO Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Vancouver on Dec 1, in a move that was followed by China arresting two Canadians on national security grounds. She has denied wrongdoing.\n\nLate on Monday, public broadcaster CBC said the US had formally requested her extradition, citing Canada's Justice Department.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S. Korea protest against vaccine pass rule for kids\n\nMore related stories\n\nHuawei said it was \"disappointed\" to learn of the charges. It said it had sought to discuss them with the US authorities \"but the request was rejected without explanation\".\n\n\"The company denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate has committed any of the asserted violations... is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng and believes the US courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion.\"\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry expressed \"grave concern\", urging the US to drop the arrest warrant and end \"unreasonable suppression\" of Chinese companies.\n\nThe development is likely to upset talks between Beijing and Washington this week as part of negotiations intended to walk back trade tensions.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said last month he could intervene in Ms Meng's case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the charges are \"wholly separate\" from the trade negotiations.\n\nCanada's Justice Minister will have 30 days from receipt of the extradition request to decide whether to grant authority to proceed. If granted, Ms Meng's case would be sent to the British Columbia Supreme Court for an extradition hearing, which could take weeks or months.\n\nHuawei makes equipment including base stations, switches and routers, as well as consumer products such as smartphones. It derives nearly half of its total revenue outside China.\n\nIts global reach has come under attack from the US, which is trying to prevent US companies from buying Huawei equipment and is pressing allies to do the same. US security experts are concerned the gear could be used by China's government for espionage - a concern Huawei calls unfounded.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand followed the US lead in restricting market access over the past year.

Two Malaysian men - private tour guide Tan Kim Ho, 42, and freelance driver Khoo Kea Leng, 45 - were each sentenced to six months in jail.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1815f6806d2d4bcb10d40c961c6f882f08b0ccd66200cb48f040ea1a59b7dc48/NP_20190130_SQCHEW30_4588695.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chew Eng Han.

Thirty other charges for similar offences were considered during sentencing. The court heard that he targeted 33 people in all, including his former clients and their neighbours.\n\nHe sent them threatening letters and e-mails in August and September 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, he used his wife's laptop and went on a portal called Protonmail to create e-mail accounts under the names \"Lord Voldemort\" - boy wizard Harry Potter's nemesis - and \"Dr Bruce Banner\" who is the Hulk's alter ego.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran said that with Protonmail, netizens do not need to key in their personal information to create e-mail accounts.\n\nHe added that Protonmail also does not keep any IP logs, which can be linked to the e-mail accounts.\n\nThese measures allowed Ye Lin Myint to remain anonymous when he sent the e-mails, the court heard.\n\nHe also created a bitcoin wallet, which he linked to the Lord Voldemort account to receive and transfer the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe DPP said: \"After he created the Protonmail accounts, the accused also created letters and e-mails that were addressed to his clients, which threatened that harm would befall his clients and their families if one bitcoin was not transferred to the accused's bitcoin wallet. He signed off the letters and e-mails with the pseudonym Lord Voldemort.\"\n\nAt the time of the offences, one bitcoin was equivalent to about $6,600. He later decided to harass his victims' neighbours to exert additional pressure on them.\n\nHis victims alerted the police, and officers arrested him after they conducted an extensive investigation.\n\nThe Straits Times understands that none of his victims transferred bitcoins to him. He is out on a bail of $15,000 and was ordered to surrender himself at the State Courts on Feb 15 to begin serving his sentence.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

And, it is also not the responsibility of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) or certain agencies, to shoulder the responsibility of (ensuring corruption-free) governance and integrity.\n\n\"It is the responsibility of all quarters… to inculcate good values and to (instil) hatred towards corruption among our children.\"\n\nHe said it would be \"more meaningful\" when leaders can achieve integrity and do not abuse their powers, the New Straits Times reported.\n\nIn a related development, Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index 2018 showed that Malaysia has gone up one place to 61 out of 180 countries.\n\nMalaysia's rank was 62 out of 180 countries in 2017 and 55 among 176 countries in 2016. Denmark was seen as the least corrupt, followed by New Zealand, with third place shared by Singapore, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.\n\nTransparency International-Malaysia president Akhbar Satar said the country could improve its rankings if the government provided leadership and a strong will to drive the message of zero tolerance for graft through solid action.\n\n\"We will be able to see significant changes if the government keeps implementing anti-corruption measures and walks the talk, making sure there is no direct negotiations in the awarding of contracts,\" he said.\n\n\"For this year, it is still too early because the government took over about seven months ago.\" - THE STAR\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4671fb886d76a4e66f9736e5989acc0253b71d3e26b66eeb35b67887c4578522/np_20190130_graft30_4588754.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

A two-year trial by Singapore's national water agency PUB and the National Environment Agency (NEA) has found a way to ensure people's body waste is not wasted.\n\nMix what is flushed down the loo (water sludge) with table scraps, and the stomach-churning recipe becomes a potent one for energy.\n\nIf scaled up, the biogas produced in the process can power a large portion of Singapore's water treatment plants.\n\nThis is a prime example of how Singapore is turning trash to treasure, particularly in view of this year being designated as Singapore's Year of Zero Waste.\n\nThe trial, which started in December 2016, involved 40 tonnes of used water sludge (from toilets) and food waste treated at the PUB's facility in Old Toh Tuck Road.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 2, 2025, 02:22am\n\nWarm, humid nights and rainy mornings expected in first half of July\n\nMore related stories\n\nTwo truckloads arrive daily from 23 premises across Singapore, including Maju Camp, University Town at the National University of Singapore and food distributor Tian Sheng Fresh Produce.\n\nThe sludge and food waste are combined, and will go through what the agencies call \"anaerobic digestion\", also known as a biological process that breaks down organic materials to produce biogas - a natural fuel that is produced when organic matter reacts with bacteria.\n\nThe sludge and food waste were previously digested separately to produce biogas. But when combined, the PUB and NEA found the biogas yield tripled, compared to when used water sludge was digested alone.\n\nAlso, the biogas yield from combined digestion was about 40 per cent more than when food waste and water sludge were digested separately at the facility.\n\nThe agencies are aiming for this co-digestion process to provide the large amounts of energy required daily to treat used water. They hope it will maximise the recovery of resources from food waste, while letting Singapore take a step towards energy self-sufficiency in the used water treatment process.\n\nBut only 16 per cent of food waste, a major waste stream here, is recycled, said Mr Tan Meng Dui, NEA's chief executive. He added the rate is low against Singapore's overall recycling rate of about 60 per cent.\n\n\"Positive results from the trial show it is possible to make the used water treatment process in water reclamation plants more energy self-sufficient,\" said Mr Harry Seah, PUB Assistant Chief Executive, Future Systems and Technology.\n\nMr Seah added that as a result of the technology's success, the process is likely to be scaled up, in the form of co-locating the facilities of water sludge and food waste treatment at the new Tuas Nexus, which is scheduled to be completed in 2025.\n\nCHERYL TEH\n\nEnvironment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 1, 2025, 11:46pm\n\n'Pig-faced' rare bat sighting at Lower Peirce sparks buzz among nature fans\n\nDec 10, 2024, 03:22am\n\nEven corals grow up in HDB-style homes in Singapore\n\nNov 8, 2024, 03:55am\n\nEverything you wanted to know about water heaters but never asked\n\nMay 22, 2024, 04:27pm\n\nCetta expands into new sectors by acquiring stake in EAS.ai\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b74331f94e5dc63975ae6e193a6e0e2387228541b5164adf09fafabae2f8368f/NP_20190130_CTWASTE30_4588956.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Unwanted parts of the food waste such as plastics are filtered out.

Leader Denmark scored 88, and New Zealand 87.\n\nNorway was in seventh place with a score of 84.\n\nCorrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) director Denis Tan said Singapore's public service \"continues to be recognised as one of the most efficient and cleanest in the world\".\n\nSingapore's good standing is also attested to by other indicators, the CPIB noted.\n\nIn the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy's 2018 Report on Corruption in Asia, Singapore is the least corrupt country in the region, a position it has held since 1995, the CPIB said.\n\nADRIAN LIM, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

After the July 2018 residential property tightening measures, the mortgage business has slowed.\n\nNonetheless, with 9M 2018 year-to-date loan growth of 8 per cent, we believe a 10 per cent loan growth for 2018 is likely.\n\nLending yields will also likely be muted, but funding costs are expected to rise at a slower pace.\n\nThe three-month Singapore interbank offered rate (Sibor) averaged 1.73 per cent in Q4 2018, up from Q3 2018's 1.63 per cent. It is currently at 1.89 per cent - there is some lag effect for the Sibor's rise to filter through to net interest margin (NIM) widening.\n\nAs loan drawdown was muted due to the property cooling measures, UOB deployed its excess funds to lower yielding and lower risk assets - we believe this is likely to have led to lending yields not gaining much despite the Q4 2018 rise in Sibor.\n\nOn a positive note, UOB increased its fixed deposits more aggressively in Q3 2018, and therefore did not need to compete to secure funding in Q4 2018.\n\nFinally, UOB's management has indicated its intention to lower common equity tier 1 capital adequacy ratio (from Q3 2018's 14.1 per cent).\n\nWe believe the expectation of higher dividends could propel its share price higher.\n\nDBS Equity Research, Jan 29\n\nThe Reit offers one of the strongest earnings visibility profiles among Singapore Reits, with a weighted average lease expiry of seven years.\n\nThe Reit acquired an asset in Feb 18. Its asset recycling initiatives are still ongoing. However, the timing is uncertain.\n\nWe continue to believe that the Reit will be able to deliver steady distribution per unit growth through its three-pronged growth plans: asset recycling strategies; venturing into a new market (third pillar); and acquisition pipeline from its sponsor while maintaining its defensive stance in expansion.\n\nPotential catalysts include potential acquisitions/asset recycling and asset enhancement initiatives to boost rental income.\n\nFinally, there is debt headroom for accretive acquisitions.\n\nParkway Life Reit has a gearing of 36 per cent with debt headroom of $305 million assuming 45 per cent gearing.\n\nIn addition, the Reit has benefited from lower interest rates in Japan following the renewal of its interest rate hedge, with cost of debt now below 1 per cent.\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

She picked up time management tips and was able to balance studies with her love for sports.\n\nShe tried out for the national women's rugby team after recovering from the injury in 2017 and has been on it since.\n\n\"Usually, students get a scholarship based on their academic excellence, instead of their sporting endeavours so I feel very proud and satisfied,\" she said.\n\nBy\n\nNur Syahindah Ishak\n\nRead articles by Nur Syahindah Ishak\n\nEducation\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 18, 2024, 06:58am\n\n'Never too late,' says N-level candidate serving 11th jail term\n\nOct 17, 2024, 01:31am\n\nLow-income parents want to give kids head start but lack the means\n\nAug 23, 2024, 01:07am\n\n'Retired' at 32, ex-scholar refuses to be 'a slave to the grind'\n\nAug 19, 2024, 08:33am\n\nTeatime: Your kids are not gifted if they struggle for GEP\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

As of yesterday, owners representing more than 60 per cent have approved the lower reserve price, JLL said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 7, 2024, 05:10am\n\nHow a woman holds on to her promise - and a $70m plot of land\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe tender for Gilstead Court closes at 2.30pm on Feb 27.\n\nMeanwhile, the 99-year leasehold Lakeside Apartments in Yuan Ching Road relaunches for collective sale by public tender today, with its reserve price possibly lowering to $205 million from $240 million.\n\nThe effort to garner a fresh 80 per cent support from owners is still ongoing, with the current support level at 70 per cent, said marketing agent SLP International.\n\nThe land size is 12,465 sq m and there are 120 units with the same built-in size.

It shed 0.37 per cent or 11.81 points to 3,187.69 at the closing bell.\n\nLosers outnumbered gainers 241 to 135 after 1.72 billion shares worth $1.15 billion changed hands. Financials, the bourse's heavyweights, contributed to losses.\n\nUnited Overseas bank shed 1.16 per cent to $25.53 while OCBC Bank declined 1.04 per cent to $11.40. Great Eastern slipped 1.05 per cent to $26.42.\n\nMost local technology stocks, hit by lacklustre earnings from US counterparts, also headed lower.\n\nIntel test-handling machine supplier AEM Holdings lost 0.55 per cent to 90.5 cents.\n\nCreative Technology, buoyed earlier in January by the hype over the Las Vegas launch of its Super X-Fi headphones, gave up gains too.\n\nThe counter declined 0.92 per cent to $5.38.\n\nMeanwhile, Venture Corp slipped as much as 1.3 per cent during the day, but regained its footing later on.\n\nIt ended trading up 0.25 per cent at $15.93 yesterday.\n\nEarlier this month, Maybank Kim Eng had proclaimed Venture the safest bet amid volatility in the tech sector.\n\nAnalyst Lai Gene Lih said fundamentals remain intact for Venture, with the company being a potential beneficiary of the US-China trade war, considering its sizeable production out of Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nElsewhere, Caterpillar and Nvidia issued bleak earnings guidance on Monday.\n\nBoth companies blamed deteriorating demand from China as the main reason behind earnings downgrades.\n\nBELLWETHER\n\nCaterpillar, considered by market watchers to be a bellwether for global trade given its exposure to overseas markets, cited lower demand in China for its decline in sales in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe construction equipment manufacturer's earnings per share largely underwhelmed consensus forecast, while its 2019 profit forecast also came below market estimates.\n\nLikewise, chipmaker Nvidia said \"deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China\", impacted demand for its graphics processing units.\n\nThe company slashed its Q4 revenue guidance down from US$2.7 billion (S$3.65 billion) to US$2.2 billion.\n\n\"When you see the big cyclical companies missing earnings or missing forecasts, it worries the market because it confirms what they have already been hearing from the macro side,\" said Mr Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.\n\n\"Everyone knows the world is decelerating, they are just waiting to see if the corporate earnings confirm that.\"\n\nMr Eli Lee, head of investment strategy at Bank of Singapore, said he is also seeing downgrades to consensus earnings growth expectations pick up speed across major regions, as trade uncertainties and tighter financial conditions continue to drag on economic growth.\n\nHe cautioned that investors need to be on \"high alert\" for fluid conditions ahead, as \"fundamentals are becoming more transitory as we enter the late stages of the economic cycle\".\n\nBank of Singapore has an overweight position in cash. Mr Lee also said their key priorities are diversifying portfolio risk and managing downside.\n\nFinally, investors will also see a resurgence of geopolitical uncertainties this week.\n\nAdding to headwinds are the British Parliament voting on amendments to Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal with the European Union and the EU Parliament debate on Brexit.\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nLYNETTE TAN\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It isn't unusual because the overall market conditions are not as favourable due to the loan restrictions, cooling measures and weak rentals,\" said International Property Advisor chief executive Ku Swee Yong.\n\n\"Deleveraging is good especially in light of growing uncertainty and risks in the face of the upcoming Indonesian and Thai elections, Brexit and the ongoing trade war.\"\n\nMs Ong Choon Fah of Edmund Tie & Company said: \"After the Chinese New Year holidays, there will be more launches and there should be a pick-up in buying.\"\n\nThe CBS study also showed that 60,746 buyers held more than one mortgage loan in November last year.\n\nThis represents a 4.5 per cent drop from 63,585 buyers in July 2018 and a 6.1 per cent decrease from 64,680 buyers holding more than one mortgage loan in November 2017.\n\nGRACE LEONG, BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I think she is a maverick and that is always exciting to play.\"\n\nKnightley, who has a three-year-old daughter with English musician-husband James Righton, made headlines last year after she penned an essay for the book Feminists Don't Wear Pink (And Other Lies) talking about childbirth.\n\nSome outlets accused her of criticising the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton's polished looks coming out of hospital soon after labour.\n\n\"It is interesting that certain parts of the media have misrepresented my meaning and exactly what I said,\" Knightley said.\n\n\"The comments that I made are completely about our culture that silences women's truths and forces us all to hide.\n\n\"I absolutely didn't shame anybody in any way, in fact quite the opposite.\" - REUTERS\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\n4\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\n1\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\n4\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\n1\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

What does that feel like? How about fire? How are we going to do that? Fog? How are we going to do clouds? And fur. What about the hair? What is that going to look like and feel like?\"\n\nComputers can do scientific simulations fairly well, but we make art, so there are a lot of conversations about how we turn that into art. And they are incredibly computationally difficult.\n\nThe great news is we now have a render that can handle complexity like we never had before.\n\nDean's creative aspiration can be as high as it needs to be. It means when Dean throws out an idea or when our creative team has a creative idea, we have a one-word answer to it; we say yes.\n\nBecause the capacity of our artists is phenomenal and because of the capacity of technology, more often than not the answer to yes or no is the story. We put it up, and we look at it.\n\nIt is not that we can't make a 15-minute action scene. It is more a case that such a scene is probably not going to work for the story because people will get tired of it.\n\nThe story tells us what we can and cannot do.\n\nWhat is the most challenging shot you've asked for on this film? In The Hidden World, you have a long shot at the feast with hundreds of Vikings.\n\nDean DeBlois:\n\nWe were all inspired by some of these tour de force shots that we saw in (2015's) The Revenant from cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.\n\nThey are sort of gutsy and interesting and impossible with animation because they are lengthy shots and involve lots of characters and complex choreography in the way that they hand off from one another.\n\nFor our opening sequence on this movie, there is a dragon for every character, so it seemed daunting to even consider a scene like that.\n\nIn the end, eight editors spent two months working on that scene, just to get through the blocking of the animation.\n\nThen, the lighting team had to get into it, as well as our effects team. It was truly complex, but I think the studio welcomes a challenge.\n\nEveryone is very proud of it. I think they really want to please the fans. They want to live up to the expectation that is out there and we feel that expectation; it's all quite intense.\n\nPeople want us to outdo ourselves and not disappoint, which is often the case with the third part of a trilogy. We definitely want to feel like we are about to deliver the best of the three.\n\nIndeed, the feast sequence is one of the most complicated animated scenes of all time.\n\nDeBlois:\n\nSomebody said if you go all the way back to Shrek (2001), the number of hours that it took to render a single frame, we have increased that by 5,000.\n\nThat is how much computing power we have to put into a single frame. Luckily, we have much more powerful computers and a better rendering system.\n\nAnimators always find a way of testing the technology to its extreme limits even when they are given a new tool to play with.\n\nCan you talk about the inspiration from real animals when designing your dragons?\n\nDeBlois:\n\nThe animators love specificity so we often sit together as a group and watch nature documentaries, looking for cues from animal references and finding specific behaviours we can attribute to our dragons.\n\nWe want to make the dragons feel as though they are part of our animal kingdom.\n\nThey exhibit the same behaviour that you may see if you took a safari through Africa, or if you went studying birds up in the north of Canada.\n\nAlso, it allows the animators to avoid being generic with the animation. It opens up doors to really charming behaviour that sometimes is odd and surprising but is also directly related to a specific dragon breed.\n\nLewis:\n\nOften in animation, you are looking for a tether to reality, so there are a couple of rules to the way in which the animators might work.\n\nIt is not that the cartoonist can do anything at any point in time. In this movie, we have the Light Fury - she is the call of the wild so she is feral and feline.\n\nYou look at the natural behaviours of animals and then apply it to the role she is playing in the story. It starts to layer together, but it does have that tether to a deeper authenticity.\n\nMovies\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

{"article_url": "https://www.tnp.sg/entertainment/movies/director-actress-bringing-camerons-alita-battle-angel-life", "site_title": "Director, actress on bringing Cameron's Alita: Battle Angel to life", "publish_date": "2019-01-29T22:00:00", "content": "(From left) Robert Rodriguez, Rosa Salazar and producer Jon Landau at a press conference for the premiere of Alita: Battle Angel at a hotel in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nPHOTO: EPA\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 29, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nDirector, actress on bringing Cameron's Alita: Battle Angel to life\n\nUS actress Rosa Salazar on her motion capture performance in Alita: Battle Angel\n\nShare this article\n\nBefore Hollywood film-maker James Cameron turned Avatar into the highest-grossing movie in history in 2009, he was working on a new kind of cinematic heroine with the big-screen adaptation of cyberpunk manga series Battle Angel Alita.\n\nHe had a whole franchise planned for Yukito Kishiro's graphic novels about a cyborg discovered on a garbage heap.\n\nHowever, the runaway success of Avatar led to a staggering four sequels being green-lit, so Cameron made the unprecedented decision to let go of his baby, entrusting his 600-page Alita: Battle Angel script to his friend, US film-maker Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Spy Kids).\n\n\"I totally bought into his version of it and I wanted to help him get it to the screen. I wanted, as a fan, to see that movie,\" Rodriguez, 50, told AFP at last year's CinemaCon industry convention in Las Vegas.\n\n\"So that was my approach to it, not to go and take it and turn it into something else, but help Jim finish what he had started out to make.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\nOpening here on Feb 5 with sneaks from Feb 1 to 4, Alita: Battle Angel is an epic adventure set hundreds of years in the future.\n\nThe unconscious titular protagonist (Rosa Salazar) is found in a scrapyard by Ido (Christoph Waltz), a doctor who realises that somewhere in her abandoned cyborg shell is the heart and soul of an extraordinary young woman.\n\nHe tries to shield Alita from her mysterious past as the corrupt forces that run things come after her - and she discovers she has unique fighting abilities.\n\nUS actress Salazar, 33, known for the Divergent and Maze Runner teen franchises, leads an Oscar-winning all-star cast featuring Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali and Waltz.\n\nRodriguez, who befriended Cameron 25 years ago, didn't so much rewrite Cameron's Alita script as edit it down to a manageable length, suggesting some additional photography and dialogue, and moving the action to South America.\n\nAnd he has always believed in Cameron's vision of a CGI cyborg that appears every bit as real - in soul, if not in appearance - as the young women who will see the movie.\n\n\"A lot of the time, manga-type material is unrelatable to an audience because it's just so far out, it's all spectacle and not enough emotion and human relatability,\" he said.\n\n\"And that's the opposite of what Jim does.\"\n\nQ&A WITH ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL'S ROSA SALAZAR\n\nWhat was it about Alita that appealed to you?\n\nWell, a few things, like Robert Rodriguez, who is Latino and who I've wanted to work with for years.\n\nHe's such an iconic film-maker because he can make a film out of nothing. Like with El Mariachi (1992). Desperado (1995) was the first thing I saw of his, with my mum. I was a young girl and I just fell in love with it. It was a strong emotional story, a love story with explosions and guts and guns and bar shootouts.\n\nAnd then of course there's James Cameron. And, like Robert, he creates stories with strong, well-rounded female characters. They've both been doing it for years.\n\nAnother big thing for me is that I had been doing these big movies and this felt like a graduation for me. I've done stunts and wire work. I've fallen down. I've jumped off stuff. In the Maze Runner films, there are some crazy sequences - riding around in a car with a big gun popping through the sun roof. All of that was a great training ground for Alita and I really wanted to test my skills.\n\nI also wanted to do performance capture, because I love acting and finding new ways that I can bend my craft and use it to funnel it towards this goal we're all trying to create. And I really wanted to show that you can be a Latin woman leading a big-budget studio film.\n\nDid you do any prep?\n\nI am such a big fan of (English actor famed for motion capture) Andy Serkis that I watched every single behind-the-scenes featurette a long time ago on DVD. And then I was watching (English actor) Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug (in The Hobbit movies), and a lot of the Planet Of The Apes movies which were done by Weta Digital, who also did Alita.\n\nWhen actors do performance capture, often the character they're playing doesn't look anything like them. But with Alita, there seems to be a reasonable amount of you in the character.\n\nIt's an anime version of myself. It's super cool! And it was always the plan, that whatever actress was going to inhabit the role, it was going to be her performance and her face and her features. More and more as they edit and draw the film, every time I see it, it looks more like me. Which is eerie, and wonderful.\n\nWhen I was playing Alita, we were one and the same. They used a lot of my real face and the real scars, divots, muscle pulls, lines, creases and imperfections to look like me.\n\nAlthough one thing I had to change was my posture, because cyborgs don't hunch. And I have the worst posture. So I had to have my shoulders back constantly and just be standing straight and not lean.\n\nDid you have to learn a lot of fighting skills?\n\nYeah. Training almost killed me. When I walked in there, I was made out of croissants. I was writing my short film, and writers don't eat well. So I was really out of shape. I was thin, I had no endurance, no core.\n\nI trained with (US martial artist) Keith Hirabayashi for months. And I changed to a plant-based diet and it was very hard. Well, now I'm vegan. Because James Cameron convinced me to be vegan and he's right. You feel stronger, more capable.\n\nBut it's not just me. There are nine women that bring Alita to life. Whenever we reach my physical capabilities or abilities, another person takes over who's been doing this for life. So you have many martial artists, contortionists, rollerbladers. And then you have me doing all the acting when they're recording the bodily info.\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\n4\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\n1\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\n4\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\n1\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He should be in front turning for home. It's just a matter of whether he'll be able to hold the late challengers at bay.\n\n6 Raichu\n\nshould enjoy a nice run midfield off a solid speed. He can get home well if the splits open up at the right time.\n\n9 Sunny Orient\n\nis his own worst enemy but his last effort showed that he has a win in him soon. He's worth watching at his second start for Benno Yung.\n\n1 The Show\n\nis racing well enough to get into the finish.\n\nRACE 2 (1,200M)\n\n6 Exceptional Desire\n\nshowed a return to form last time out, finishing fourth over this course and distance behind Super Lucky. He should enjoy a nice run again and can take victory with even luck.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n4 General Iron\n\nreturns to 1,200m. He's looking as though he'd appreciate stepping up in trip again, so he deserves respect.\n\n1 Jolly Bountiful\n\nis racing fairly consistently. He did well to get within a nose last time out and a similar effort will see him go close.\n\n8 Chaparral Star\n\nis interesting dropping in trip. He will be finding the line late.\n\nRACE 3 (1,650M)\n\n8 Winwin Ruby\n\nshowed last time out that he might be able to return to form soon enough. He's a big player.\n\n3 Multigogo\n\nmay get out to lead and he's always dangerous when he can adopt that role. Coming back to Happy Valley might be a shrewd move, too, and he maps well. He can't be overlooked.\n\n4 Charity Wings\n\nis racing well enough and the claim of Victor Wong ensures that he gets in with a nice weight.\n\n1 All You Know\n\nis next best.\n\nRACE 4 (1,200M)\n\n9 Love Chunghwa\n\nhas not won in over a year, but he's at a mark where he should be able to win at any time. He's been racing consistently and needs only luck to be able to break through.\n\n11 Gouten Of Garo\n\nstill remains winless from 15 starts. He has a short sprint, so needs to be produced at the right time but he's not without claims in this event.\n\n1 Super Lucky\n\nwon very easily at his first start for Caspar Fownes last start. He's drawn awkwardly, so will likely go back to last, but he's capable of flying home.\n\n7 Iron Bravo\n\nsteps out for the first time. Trainer Chris So has a good record with debutants and he must be included in all exotics.\n\nRACE 5 (1,650M)\n\n3 Smart Leader\n\nsteps up to the extended mile. He has looked like this trip would suit for quite some time. He deserves plenty of respect.\n\n6 Right Honourable\n\nflew home to just fall short by a head last time out. This rating will always make it tough for him, but he does have a terrific turn of foot on his day and he must be considered.\n\n12 Starlit Knight\n\nwill likely find himself on the speed and he should be somewhere around the finish.\n\n8 Penang Hall\n\ncan add value to the exotics.\n\nRACE 6 (1,800M)\n\n3 Red Warrior\n\nhas placed at his last three starts, having been sent out as favourite each time. Hopefully, the market turns on him, but it's unlikely as he does look logical.\n\n5 Circuit Glory\n\nhas been running well this term and finally looks to have figured out his racing manners. This allows Tony Cruz to step him up to 1,800m again, where he should prove a leading player.\n\n7 Winning Faith\n\nis honest and can't be dismissed.\n\n2 Packing Dragon\n\nis probably not the same horse he once was but he could surprise.\n\nRACE 7 (1,000M)\n\n11 Gentle Breeze\n\nreturns to 1,000m, having once again shown that 1,200m is perhaps a bridge too far at this stage of his career. He should enjoy a nice run just behind the speed and, with luck, can score.\n\n6 Most Beautiful\n\nis having a good season. He is likely to be around the mark yet again.\n\n1 Moment Of Power\n\nreturns to Class 3 for the first time this season. He should get out on the speed and might be able to stay on in this company.\n\n9 Team Spirit\n\nsteps out over this course and distance for the first time. He looks the type who should be suited and must be included.\n\nRACE 8 (1,200M)\n\n1 Super Turbo\n\nwill be winding up late, but there is plenty of speed and, if it melts down, he will be flying home strongly. He has plenty of weight, but he's a capable horse on his day.\n\n3 Country Star\n\nfaces a tough ask as a three-year-old approaching the top of Class 2. He is drawn to have every chance, but it might be worth trying to find one to beat him. That said, he's the one to beat.\n\n7 Super Hoppy\n\nran well fresh last time out. A similar effort will see him going close.\n\n12 Seven Heavens\n\nreturns to Class 2 but he has run well down in grade at his last two starts and he is not without a hope.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Toothless also ended up as the alpha dragon.\n\nIt is often hard to maintain a good story arc in sequels.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\nMore related stories\n\nHowever, this final chapter is one emotional journey. Every character, dragons included, evolves and finally comes of age.\n\nThough Hiccup is still plagued by self-doubt, his compassion for his people and dragons, coupled with strong support from girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera) and long-lost mother Valka (Cate Blanchett), makes him a worthy village chief.\n\nTogether with his friends, they embark on missions to free captured dragons using more of his dragon-based technology, such as wearing fire-proof armour and winged suits.\n\nThey take the rescued dragons back to Berk, which is now overpopulated with winged creatures.\n\nHiccup's nemesis this time is Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham), a notorious dragon slayer who made a career killing Night Furies, putting Toothless in grave danger.\n\nBut Toothless is oblivious to the threat as he is infatuated with a beautiful white Night Fury, aptly called Light Fury.\n\nWho would have thought a dragon mating dance could be one of the sweetest and funniest moments in the film?\n\nYet again, the animation is flawless and the attention to detail is amazing.\n\nThe Hidden World is a wonderful end to this series. The bittersweet coda may draw tears from both young ones and adults who have come to love this Oscar-nominated billion-dollar franchise.\n\nRating: 3.5\n\nMOVIE:\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\n\nSTARRING:\n\nJay Baruchel, America Ferrera, Cate Blanchett, Kit Harington, F.

It captures the highlights of her high-flying yet harrowing career, even as it takes a toll on her mental and physical health.\n\nRosamund Pike's stellar lead performance brings Colvin's story to life as she realistically portrays an uninhibited and conflicted character who constantly plunges into dangerous conflict zones.\n\nRunning the gamut of emotions as both a journalist and a tormented individual battling her own personal demons, Pike has certainly outdone herself. She pulls off Colvin's complex personality so well, drawing us in to admire her tenacity while empathising with her personal struggles.\n\nMuch of the film focuses on Colvin covering the horrors of war, together with her photographer Paul Conroy (Jamie Dornan). It depicts the harsh realities of refugees in war-torn regions. Despite the straightforward plot that manages to tug at heartstrings, A Private War remains a worthy tribute to Colvin.\n\n- CHARMAINE SOH\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\nMore related stories\n\nTHE KNIGHT OF SHADOWS: BETWEEN YIN AND YANG (PG)\n\nRating: 3.5\n\nIt's been years since Jackie Chan last appeared in a period flick, his latest foray being this fantasy martial arts comedy produced by Kiefer Liu, a pioneer of 3D in China.\n\nThe action superstar plays a demon hunter who tracks down evil forces in the human dimension, assisted by a lawman protege and a motley group of friendly monsters.\n\nChan oozes an easy, effortless, impish charm, reminding us why he remains a firm family favourite.\n\nOpening here on Feb 5, just in time for Chinese New Year, Knight Of Shadows offers generous use of eye candy - Elane Zhong and Peng Lin as the beguiling demon 'sisters' and Ethan Juan as the anti-hero who risks it all in his attempt to restore his love's formerly human soul.\n\nThe characters are a zany bunch and the universe created is immense, but it is so well put together that you simply believe it.\n\nWhile the pacing is a tad draggy, it is not intolerably so.\n\nBring some tissues, because the romantic finale where lovers Zhong and Juan finally unite - however cheesy - hits the emotional sweet spots.\n\n- JASMINE LIM\n\nMovies\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Taken out by Vlad Duric, Revolution ran the 600m in 38.2sec - unextended.\n\nJust a three-year-old, he has been running his races like as if he has been doing it for years.\n\nIndeed, it was just 10 days after his third birthday that his connections dropped him off in the deep end. That day, and against a field of other young upstarts, Revolution didn't do too badly, finishing a smack-up second behind Quadcopter over the 1,200m on grass.\n\nHis fan base grew after that eye-catching run and they were in his corner when he next turned up at the races on Aug 24.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nRidden by Alysha Collett and sent off as the $33 third pick, he was settled back near the rear in that 1,200m sprint on the Poly.\n\nHe could see them all when they straightened but Collett wasn't perturbed. She probably knew she was onto a good horse and she stirred him up only 150m from home.\n\nRevolution was game enough for a fight and, racing widest of the lot, Collett timed her run to perfection and, in the shades of the winning post, Revolution had found the lead.\n\nThe youngster would go on to beat Boy Next Door by ¾ lengths.\n\nRevolution would also go on to win two more races over the next four months and, added to the stake money he picked up for finishing second on two other occasions, the youngster has since repaid the $150,000 Falcon Racing Stable spent on him at the sales ring.\n\nWhatever he earns next is going to be a bonus and, from what we have seen of him, Revolution is a long way from being the finished product.\n\nMore wins can be expected from him, so keep him on your shortlist when you're at the track on Sunday. His trainer has him in really fine fettle.\n\nAnother one who is certainly going places is Raheeb.\n\nOwned by Al-Arabiya Stable, he too had a good hit-out on the training track, running the distance in 37.1sec.\n\nTrained by Michael Clements, Raheeb is a big chestnut. Indeed, he opened his Kranji account when tipping the scales at 522kg.\n\nThat was in late November and, since then, Clements has sent him to the trials twice. He did well on both occasions, finishing second while not too far from the winner.\n\nRight now, he looks like he's got a nice future.\n\nCome Sunday, he will having his fourth start and a race-to-race double wouldn't come as a surprise.\n\nAlso on Sunday, take note of Eastiger. Owned by King Power Stable, the four-year-old served notice of his intentions in the Kranji Stakes D sprint with a rousing gallop.\n\nRidden by Duric, he clocked 38.5sec for the 600m. To date, Eastiger has just one win from 16 starts but he is better than that.\n\nHe has been entered in a winnable race and a sprinkling of luck is just what he needs in order to post, what seems like, a long overdue win.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Your role was silence and complicity, nothing more,\" said Queiroz, who confronted his critic after the press conference.\n\nQueiroz's stint has been troubled in many ways, as Iran struggle for funding and equipment under their nuclear sanctions - including at last year's World Cup, when Nike withdrew its supply of boots.\n\nIn-fighting has also been a major problem and Queiroz has been embroiled in a public spat with Branko Ivankovic, his heir apparent. - REUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Cousins, playing just his fifth game for the Warriors after missing almost an entire year after a torn Achilles tendon, went down hard after Indiana's Myles Turner fouled him in transition in the first quarter.\n\n\"I wasn't actually hurt, I was more spooked from the fall,\" said Cousins, who was slow to rise but stayed in the game.\n\nKevin Durant added 16 points for the Warriors, who let \"banged up\" Draymond Green sit out for a bit of rest.\n\nTurner led the Pacers with 16 points, but Indiana dropped their second straight since losing guard Victor Oladipo to a season-ending knee injury.\n\nIn Boston, the absence of Kyrie Irving was no problem for the Celtics as Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart scored 21 points apiece to lead the Celtics to a 112-104 victory over the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nAron Baynes added 16 points, Marcus Morris scored 15 and Al Horford and Terry Rozier chipped in 14 each for the Celtics, whose 16 blocked shots were a franchise record.\n\nIRVING RESTED\n\nIrving sat out with a sore left hip - possibly the result of a fall in Saturday's loss to the Warriors.\n\n\"I don't think it'll be anything long term,\" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said before the game.\n\n\"We'll see after tonight how he feels tomorrow.\"\n\nStevens said it wasn't a tough decision to have Irving sit out a seventh game this season, even with a minor injury, as the team look to preserve the long-term health of the All-Star point guard.\n\n\"Especially with Irving, we were going to sit him eight to 12 games anyway.

Silverstone is one of five circuits out of contract after this season, the others being Germany's Hockenheim, Italy's historic Monza track, Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya and Mexico's Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.\n\nOnly one race, the British Grand Prix, will be broadcast live and free-to-air in Britain this year with the rest on Sky Sports pay television.\n\nREBELLION\n\nWhile there are no new races in 2019, Vietnam is lined up for a race in Hanoi from 2020 while a possible Miami Grand Prix remains on the cards as a second US round with Austin, Texas.\n\nThe Daily Mail suggested Liberty, who took over from CVC in 2017 when they also ousted previous commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone, faced a promoter rebellion.\n\n\"Everyone is disgruntled.

The Reds, meanwhile, are in danger of starting to splutter.\n\nA recent seven-goal thriller with Crystal Palace saw Juergen Klopp's champions-elect produce a performance from yesteryear. That year was 2014, rather than a title-winning vintage.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nScintillating football and slapstick defending left neutrals purring and the natives wincing.\n\nLeicester City could not have asked for a better pathfinder heading into their own trip to Merseyside tomorrow morning.\n\nA struggling Claude Puel may benefit from the most unlikely stroke of fortune since his current employers soared to the title on a 5,000-1 ticket.\n\nUncertainty over Virgil van Dijk's involvement plays into the hands of both the Foxes and City.\n\nThe Holland captain has been both an imposing and imperious presence that allayed any fears as Liverpool's defence succumbed to a catalogue of injuries in recent weeks.\n\nHe has continued to hold together a backline which would have ordinarily wilted under pressure, and often did in previous campaigns.\n\nThat reliability, however, now threatens to expose Klopp's over-reliance on van Dijk to mask the shortcomings of those around him.\n\nThe Kop roars in confidence at the sight of the statuesque centre-back in possession of the ball, while Dejan Lovren and Joel Matip leave them watching through their fingers.\n\nMargins for error in the pair are far greater than van Dijk's record-setting displays have demonstrated.\n\nHis potential absence would see Liverpool's title credentials face its first genuine litmus test. Lose ground against Leicester without him and momentum swings back in City's favour.\n\nWhere they once led from the front, Guardola's side now do the same in efforts to claw back the deficit. Rather than following the leader, they challenge the leader to follow their lead.\n\nPlaying before their current title rivals in each of their next three league games adds a pressure which has the potential to be as much a blessing for them as much as it appears a curse.\n\nA place in the League Cup final saw their clash with Everton brought forward to next week. Win at Goodison Park and a one-point gap becomes sustainable for more than mere days.\n\nShould Liverpool fail to secure maximum points against a resurgent Manchester United on the same day, City's latest Wembley sojourn could become the backdrop for double jubilation.\n\nGuardiola knows that his players cannot afford to slip up between now and the end of the season.\n\nPreventable back-to-back defeats last month surrendered impetus in the title race. Another would afford Liverpool further breathing space in their remaining 15 league games.\n\nPole position, similarly, sits unevenly on Klopp's side since losing at the Etihad Stadium at the turn of the year closed the gap to four points where a double-figure advantage once beckoned.\n\nGuardiola's obsession with his direct challenger has now become two-fold.\n\nWhoever blinks first will decide which direction of the M57 motorway the EPL title will travel.\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8f53fa30bf23605d17ad8212bd2fc96942b9d5f929ca5a1ffc6b0a072491085e/NP_20190130_RBSOC30_4588836.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The uncertainty over defensive linchpin Virgil van Dijk's involvement in tomorrow morning's Liverpool-Leicester City match plays into the hands of both the Foxes and Manchester City.

It depends on the situation,\" the Italian added.\n\nSarri's comments come after one of the players who is keeping the 18-year-old out of the starting line-up at Chelsea said Hudson-Odoi \"can become one of the best players in the world\".\n\nBrazilian winger Willian told Sky Sports yesterday: \"He's going nowhere - he's a special talent, a very good player and is staying with us.\n\n\"Of course, he is only 18, but he can improve a lot and in the future can become one of the best players in the world.\n\n\"It's difficult not to think about Bayern Munich because they are a great team as well but for me, his future is here.\n\n\"He has to stay because he knows the club, and I am sure he will play more.\"\n\nHis teammate Antonio Ruediger added: \"Chelsea need to give him a new contract...\n\n\"He's a quality player. You can see how he dribbles, how he goes one against one, he can be good for us.\"\n\nSarri, meanwhile, offered his backing to new loan signing Gonzalo Higuain, a player who excelled under the 60-year-old when he was in charge of Napoli, but added that the Argentina international had to adapt quickly to the pace of the English game.\n\nHe said: \"In this championship it is difficult. Higuain said 'it was so aggressive', but I told him it was normal.\n\n\"He's a great player and he needs to adapt.\n\n\"He has to do everything in less than one month, otherwise he is late.\"\n\nThe Italian is unsure if Chelsea will bring in the midfielder he wanted as a replacement for Cesc Fabregas, who joined AS Monaco earlier this month, before the transfer window closes on Friday morning.\n\n\"You know my opinion,\" Sarri said.\n\n\"I thought it was important to have two players.\n\n\"One has arrived, I am waiting for another.\n\n\"If he arrives I will be very happy, but I won't be too worried.\n\n\"I am happy to play with these players.\" - AFP, REUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It was a waste of time.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 06:16am\n\nWhen is it acceptable to address a stranger as 'uncle' or 'aunty'?\n\nMore related stories\n\nWith less than a week to CNY, many are still scrambling to get the notes.\n\nA POSB staff member was heard telling customers the money was usually replenished twice daily.\n\nA frustrated customer who wanted to be known only as Mr Foo said: \"I came here thrice and the pop-up ATMs were always out of new notes.\"\n\nThe 48-year-old added: \"It is difficult for old folks to queue for two hours to wait for the cash to be topped up.\"\n\nA DBS spokesman told TNP it introduced special priority queues for new notes for the elderly and those with special needs. This year, DBS increased the number of pop-up ATMs from 36 to 42.\n\nDBS, OCBC and UOB also have online reservation services, where customers can reserve new notes.\n\nA UOB spokesman said the number of online reservations for new notes made this year doubled from last year.\n\nStill, customers at Toa Payoh Hub, where the three banks have branches, told TNP the banks have been running out of new notes just half an hour after opening, daily.\n\nA UOB customer, a 67-year-old retiree who wanted to be known only as Madam Ho, said: \"I queued for an hour from 10.30am but there were only $5 and $50 notes left.\"\n\nRetiree Poh Joo Tuang, 69, went to OCBC just to get the red packets, as he did not have time to queue for new notes.\n\nTNP understands one possible reason for the shortage of new notes this year is that there are three weekends leading up to CNY from the time the new notes were made available. There were typically only two weekends leading up to CNY previously.\n\nOCBC's head of group brand and communications Koh Ching Ching told TNP: \"We have limited stocks of new notes each day, but OCBC has a mobile banking app for customers to see the availability of new notes across the branches and get a queue number before heading there.\"\n\nSome customers felt it was better this year, for instance a housewife who was at the DBS branch at Plaza Singapura.\n\nSaid the 60-year-old who wanted to be known only as Madam Tan: \"I think there's a slight improvement because of the online reservation of notes. But these notes run out so quickly.\"\n\nNanyang Technological University psychology student, Lim Wei Shun, 22, would not mind getting old notes.\n\nHe told TNP: \"It doesn't matter whether I get old or new notes in my red packet. It still serves its function, unless the note is torn.\"\n\nBy\n\nAngelii Trissha Mohan\n\nRead articles by Angelii Trissha Mohan\n\nRuth Phang\n\nRead articles by Ruth Phang\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It will ensure its staff practise good food and personal hygiene and will not work while sick.\n\nAll food handlers have since re-attended and passed the Basic Food Hygiene course.\n\nThe food hygiene officer at the implicated premises in the hotel has undergone retraining and passed the WSQ Conduct Food and Beverage Hygiene Audit course.\n\nThe hotel will remain under close surveillance to ensure that it adheres to its food hygiene plans, added NEA.\n\nBy\n\nNur Syahindah Ishak\n\nRead articles by Nur Syahindah Ishak\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I was wondering if (the leak) was malicious in intent, but they weren't able to give me any information or any kind of comfort or assurance,\" he told The New Paper yesterday.\n\nAs he had already come out as HIV-positive, Mr Khan said he was not too bothered by the leak.\n\nBut for many of the 14,200 HIV-positive individuals who had their confidential information stolen from the HIV registry and leaked online by American Mikhy Farrera Brochez, the news that broke on Monday has caused much consternation.\n\nThe Straits Times reported that victims of the leak were worried it would put their personal and professional reputations at risk, and they feared the judgment and harassment their family and friends could face.\n\n\"I received mixed reactions from my friends who are HIVpositive. Some are laidback about it, some are not, some are angry,\" Mr Khan said.\n\nOne concern is that some of those affected may lose their jobs if employers find out about their HIV status.\n\nReplying to TNP's queries, a Ministry of Manpower spokesman said that unless contractually obligated, employees with HIV generally do not need to inform their employers about their condition.\n\nShe also said that employers should maintain the confidentiality of information regarding their employees' HIV status.\n\nShould a data leak lead to employers discovering an employee's HIV status, they cannot discriminate against the employee.\n\n\"Singapore has employment laws to protect employees from wrongful dismissal, including on grounds of HIV,\" she added.\n\n\"The Employment Act empowers the Minister for Manpower to direct an employer to reinstate an employee who has been wrongfully dismissed in his former job and to pay the employee for the loss of income, or direct the employer to compensate the employee.\n\n\"We also urge employers to educate employees that HIV cannot be acquired through normal workplace settings and casual contact, and to put in place a supportive work environment for employees living with HIV.\"\n\nThe Singapore National Employers Federation's HIV Workplace Guidelines say there are generally no valid grounds for terminating the services of employees living with HIV just because colleagues refuse to work with them, or the employers fear damaging the image of the enterprise or adverse reactions from customers.\n\nWhile these laws might assuage some of the worries, Mr Khan thinks the data leak will have some implications.\n\nForcibly outing those who are HIV-positive can have intangible consequences.\n\nHe said: \"It is a serious issue because HIV status affects many things in people's lives - their jobs, their families, their mental health. All these things can be jeopardised.\"\n\nThere is still a strong stigma against HIV, so it is important that those infected are allowed to come out at their own time, with safety nets and support systems in place, he said.\n\n\"You cannot be sure of what is going to happen, so it is hard to put all the stops in place. So to be forced into an already very volatile situation is just putting more at risk.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post, Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin called for Singaporeans to have empathy for those affected by the leak.\n\n\"It is tremendously challenging for those whose names may be in the lists,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I hope we all realise that this is different because of the potential real impact it can have on people's lives. Let us show that we can be different. Let us be empathetic and not participate in the online hate that may be generated.\"\n\nHe also cautioned against sharing the leaked information and urged the public to \"stay calm and support our fellow Singaporeans\".\n\nAlmost 7 in 10 HIV cases leaked\n\nRecords between 1985 and January 2013 from the HIV registry were stolen and leaked online, exposing the HIV status of some 5,400 Singaporeans and permanent residents, or almost seven in 10 (65.5 per cent) of the reported HIV cases here.\n\nAs of October last year, there were 8,247 reported cases of Singaporeans with HIV and/or Aids.\n\nThere were 265 new cases reported between January and October 2018.\n\nSince 2008, there have been about 450 new HIV cases among Singaporeans per year.\n\nBy\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Still, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the police started investigating the matter.\n\nBrought to trial in 2017, Brochez pleaded guilty to six charges, with 17 others taken into consideration, and was jailed 28 months for offences including cheating, lying to a public servant, possessing drugs and using forged educational certificates.\n\nThe same year, Ler was charged with two counts of abetment of cheating and two counts of giving a false statement to a public servant. A fifth charge under the Official Secrets Act was stood down.\n\nLer was accused of lying to an MOH investigator in 2013 and the police in 2014, but later gave two statements in 2016 confessing to substituting his blood for his partner's.\n\nLer claimed he had given these statements under duress but his allegations were rejected by district judge Luke Tan last year.\n\nLer has appealed against his conviction and sentence of two years in jail, and is currently out on bail.\n\nPast health scandals\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nThe local healthcare sector made the news for the wrong reasons recently:\n\nNovember 2018\n\nA dental clinic at Tan Tock Seng Hospital used eight packs of equipment that had not been completely sterilised on some patients.\n\nAs a result, 18 staff from the dental clinic faced disciplinary action, including financial penalties and warnings.\n\nJune 2017\n\nAt the National Dental Centre Singapore, 72 instrument packs were not completely sterilised and might have been used on 714 patients.\n\nJune 2018\n\nBetween June 27 and July 4, a cyber breach occurred at SingHealth, Singapore's largest group of healthcare institutions with four hospitals, five national speciality centres and eight polyclinics.\n\nHackers stole the personal data of 1.5 million patients.

The company eventually lost 99 per cent of its market value.\n\nSome market observers were critical of Singapore regulators, saying that they did not do enough to protect minority investors as the Noble saga unfolded.\n\nSingapore Exchange Regulation chief executive officer Tan Boon Gin said in a media briefing: \"SGX will be proposing a new power to require the appointment of a second auditor, on top of the existing statutory auditor, but only in exceptional circumstances.\n\n\"This will complement SGX's current power to require the appointment of a special auditor, who will typically only look into a specific area, whereas the second auditor will jointly sign off on the year-end audit together with the first auditor.\"\n\nMr Tan explained the need for a second audit, saying: \"There have been clean audit reports over the years and yet if you still suspect something is amiss, that's when this is most useful to us. Whereas if we knew exactly which area to focus on, we'd just appoint a special auditor to look into that area.\"\n\nHe said SGX has already met the audit committees and auditors of about 15 listed companies to highlight issues it is concerned about based on the regulator's review of the company, and what it expects the audit to cover and to discuss in the key audit matters of the annual report. The latter must include matters the regulator has been constantly querying the firm about.\n\nHe also said auditors need to have the \"gumption\" to flag areas of concern.\n\n\"If they do find something (amiss with the company), they can't hide behind the terms of reference and say, 'This wasn't covered under the terms of reference so I didn't look into it'.\n\n\"And they shouldn't phrase the language of the report in a language that is so vague that, frankly speaking, we as an exchange cannot take action on it.\"\n\n- THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Mr Trump has also said he might declare a national emergency to build his border wall. Democrats would likely challenge that in court.\n\n\"Does anybody really think I won't build the wall? Done more in first two years than any president,\" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday evening.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

Federal workers are owed about US$6 billion in back pay, according to a study released last week.- REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nWhy Companies Are Hiring Women Returning From Career Breaks\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/62a3589f156446e28052382503c1b71f39028d4fb98b1e18d3bf9e1600303e88/NP_20190129_WALL29_4585722.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Trump warned that the US government shutdown could resume on Feb 15 if he does not get what he wants.

Hilton focuses on using data analytics to gain a 360-degree view of each customer, including reservations data, profile data and even details on how they use amenities of the hotel.\n\nGaining these insights enables Hilton to know its customers better and in turn, deliver more value to them. This results in more repeat visits and happier guests.\n\nAlong with optimising revenue per room, innovative hotels constantly strive to maximise revenue per customer.\n\nThat means understanding their behaviour and adjusting amenities.\n\nBy looking at what customers and their demographics do, it is possible to distinguish between customers in different segments.\n\nOne customer may have a high potential spend for a single weekend but is not a frequent visitor. Another may not buy many extras, but is more profitable because of regular visits.\n\nThis customer segmentation may vary by region and affect what hotels spend on services, even across different groups.\n\nFor example, one analytics-driven study of the hospitality industry found that a hotel gets up to US$30 (S$40) of extra revenue for providing a single complimentary bottle of water.\n\nINFLUENCE\n\nIt also found exercise rooms, while generating no additional revenue, heavily influence a customer's decision to return.\n\nSingapore's tourism industry is flourishing, with both arrivals and receipts reaching record highs in 2017, for the second year running.\n\nThe Singapore Tourism Board (STB) recognises the rising need for digital transformation. In 2017, it announced initiatives for 2018 designed to transform Singapore's hotel industry for sustainable growth.\n\nSTB and the Hotel Innovation Committee are developing a road map for the hotel industry to develop \"Smart Hotels\".\n\nThe road map will identify the next-generation system capabilities such as facial recognition at check-in and payment wallets that typically define a digitally-driven smart hotel.\n\nOne of the key challenges faced by the hospitality industry is that in the era of constant connectivity, customers have high expectations and demand a personalised experience.\n\nEvolving technologies have the potential to create \"personalised moments that matter\" and bring joy.\n\nThese are brand interactions that demonstrate the willingness of a business to go above and beyond to provide their customers with experiences and services tailored to individual needs and preferences.\n\nAgain, the single most important aspect for hoteliers is to provide a great experience and ensure their guests are satisfied.\n\nDuring guests' journey or stay, massive amounts of data are generated, which means hoteliers can now improve the quality of their service even more by using big data to cultivate insights.\n\nIf the hospitality industry is able to harness the power of big-data analytics, it will make all the difference in achieving the relationships it seeks to have with their customers.\n\nThe writer is vice-president and general manager for the Asia-Pacific at Hortonworks.

He then punched his eight-year-old stepdaughter when she started crying.\n\nThe 35-year-old man, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his victims' identities, was sentenced yesterday to 15 weeks' jail and a fine of $2,000.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to one count each of assault, harassment and ill-treating a child.\n\nThe man was in a foul mood when he returned to his flat near Chinatown at around 7pm on March 8, 2017. His 30-year-old wife, baby son and stepdaughter were home at that time.\n\nHe noticed his cupboard was missing and asked his wife where it was. He became angry when she said she had thrown it away as it was broken.\n\nHe scolded her and told her to get it back. She said she could not retrieve it as she had thrown it into a bin.\n\nHe then told her he would \"break her face\", before dragging her by her hair to a corner of the flat.\n\nAfter that, he choked her until she had difficulty breathing and punched her face twice.\n\nHis terrified stepdaughter burst into tears but her cries only irritated him.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Joshua Rene Jeyaraj said: \"The accused then approached her and punched her on the left eye. He yelled at the second victim and told her to shut up. He then tried to throw another punch at the second victim but was pushed away by the first victim before he could do so.\"\n\nThe man redirected his attention to his wife and punched her lower back. She told the girl to hide behind her and managed to calm her husband down.\n\nHe gave his victims 30 minutes to get the cupboard back.\n\nHis wife then sent a text message to the police to ask for assistance.\n\nThe court heard he initially refused to allow officers to enter the flat when they arrived at the scene and relented only after \"much persuasion\", said the DPP.\n\nMEDICAL ATTENTION\n\nHe was arrested and his two victims sought medical attention. The woman was found to suffer mild tenderness in her nose area and right cheek while the girl had a bruise over her left eye.\n\nThe woman later obtained a personal protection order against her husband. It was issued on April 10, 2017.\n\nBut on Jan 4 last year at around 8pm, she received a call from him, accusing her of being a sex worker.\n\nHe continued calling her after she hung up.\n\nBy 9pm that day, she had received 88 missed calls and answered another eight, the court heard.\n\nThe couple have since divorced.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Another priority will be to help people face changes in the global economy, he had said.\n\nMr Seah expects further enhancement to schemes such as the Professional Conversion Programme and the Adapt and Grow initiative, which aim to help job-seekers re-skill and acquire the necessary knowledge and competencies to take on new jobs.\n\nThe DBS report suggested that the level of wage support could be increased, while more training grants could be provided to upgrade skills and additional resources directed at job matching. A temporary deferment or extension of income tax payment, or a one-off tax rebate for retrenched professionals, could also help.\n\n- THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It was instead a day of cautious trading.\n\nAsian markets started the week off mixed, with investors bracing themselves for a busy week.\n\nKey events are the US-China trade talks, the Brexit Plan B decision and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. Weak Chinese industrial profit figures released yesterday also weighed on the region's markets.\n\nThe benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) spent much of yesterday in the black but ended the day down 2.75 points or 0.1 per cent to 3,199.50.\n\nCMC market strategist Margaret Yang told The Business Times: \"The resumption of the US federal government on Friday after a one-month shutdown catalysed a mild rebound in Asian equities on Monday morning, but positive sentiment quickly faded, as scepticism surrounding the upcoming trade talks took control over investors' mind.\"\n\nOf the 30 STI constituents, 10 ended the day in the red. Turnover on the bourse stood at roughly 1.32 billion securities worth $822.8 million.\n\nDecliners outnumbered advancers 198 to 163.\n\nOil and gas company Rex International was the most actively traded stock of the day.\n\nIt had requested a trading halt before the market opened yesterday but resumed trading before 2pm, after announcing a deal to divest its interests in two Norwegian assets through its 90 per cent-owned subsidiary, Lime Petroleum.\n\nThe counter added $0.013 or 16.1 per cent to $0.094 with 168.8 million shares changing hands.\n\nOther actives on the Singapore bourse included Imperium Crown and Spackman Entertainment.\n\nMuch attention was on Catalist-listed Y Ventures, as analysts at DBS Equity Research cut their earnings estimates on the firm and suspended coverage on the stock as accounting errors surfaced from its H1 2018 financial statements last week.\n\nThe e-commerce outfit's stock closed $0.019 or 15.8 per cent down at 10.1 cents.\n\nDefensive counters were the best performers on Singapore's blue-chip index.\n\nGaming stalwart Genting Singapore was the biggest gainer on the index in percentage terms, with the counter adding two cents or 1.9 per cent to close at $1.08. With a turnover of 23.9 million shares, it was the most active index stock of the day.\n\nFood and beverage player ThaiBev also fared well, closing one cent or 1.4 per cent higher at 75 cents on a turnover of 17.4 million shares.\n\nIndex-listed Keppel Corporation ended the day six cents or 1 per cent lower at $6.14, as lower crude oil prices led to falls in counters with offshore and marine exposure.\n\nKGI Securities also downgraded its call on Keppel to \"hold\", citing a growth slowdown in its key markets and the brokerage's cautious views on the macroeconomic climate.\n\nPalm oil producer Golden Agri-Resources shares finished flat at 27 cents.\n\nRHB Research Institute analysts downgraded the call on it to \"sell\" and slashed the target price of the stock from 39 cents to 23 cents, citing the firm's weak fiscal 2018 performance.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, markets in Japan, China, South Korea and Malaysia ended the day in the red; Hong Kong markets closed the day with a modest gain.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 made the biggest shift of the day, dropping 124.56 points or 0.6 per cent, to close at 20,649.00.\n\nAustralian markets were closed yesterday for a public holiday.\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Plus, with such nice packaging, touching up will not feel like a chore.\n\nJeffree Star Cosmetics, Velour Liquid Lipstick in WifeyPrice: $32 Available: escentials Paragon, escentials Tangs@Tangs Plaza and escentials.com\n\nIf it is a matte, incredibly long-lasting and transfer-proof lip you are looking for, then this bold choice is it.\n\nHaving gained cult popularity over the years in the US and given its hype , I was pretty excited when the brand was finally launched here earlier this month, and I am not disappointed.\n\nOnce the Velour Liquid Lipstick is on, it stays on.\n\nDownsides? The applicator is not the easiest to use, and I find myself taking awhile to get the shape of my lips right. That, and it is a bit of a pain to remove.\n\nMy trick is to take it off with an oil-based lip balm.\n\nSen Natural, Sensation Red Light Price: $35 Available: www.sen-natural.com\n\nFormulated with ingredients including coconut oil, jojoba oil and shea butter, this line of lipsticks from the local beauty brand boasts moisturising properties, which makes it comfortable to use.\n\nI love that Sen Natural prides itself on being inclusive, offering different shades to complement women of all skin tones.\n\nI just wish the packaging is more inspiring, and the lipstick more transfer-resistant and longer-wearing.\n\nEYESHADOW PENCILS\n\nProviding all the glam from eyeshadow but in a clutch-friendly size and packaging, these portable pencils are a great way to carry around enough make-up, all while leaving lots of space for red packets.\n\nMamonde, Creamy Eye Colour Balm in No. 8 Sweet Cocoa Price: $18 Available: Mamonde boutique at Takashimaya Shopping Centre, all Mamonde counters and Lazada\n\nI was ready to write this off at first as I felt it is rather hard to blend all over my lids, and it sets a little too quickly.\n\nBut as I start to use it just on my lashline and blend it out a touch, it works really well and is quite budge- and smudge-proof.\n\nPlus, it has subtle flecks of glitter, which makes my tired eyes look so much more awake.\n\nNudestix, Magnetic Eye Pencil in Chocolate Price: $37 Available: Sephora\n\nIf you get this pricey pencil as part of a set, it is great value.\n\nThis has become my go-to, on-the-go eyeshadow and lives permanently in my bag.\n\nThe formula is easy to blend all over the lids, even with just my fingers at the back of a cab as I rush to yet another event I am late for. But do blend fast as it sets quite quickly.\n\nClarins, 4-Colour All-in-One Pen Price: $48 Available: All authorised Clarins counters, including the Clarins boutique at Ion Orchard and Westgate, as well as online\n\nRemember those four-colour retractable pens we used as kids? Now, fill it up with eyeshadows and a lipstick, and it becomes just about the most portable and fun invention in theory.\n\nThe eyeshadow shades are a tad too dry to be easily blended and work better as smoked-out coloured eyeliner.\n\nStill, it is a great concept that will definitely spark conversation.\n\nPERFUME\n\nKnowing you are fabulously fragrant is an easy way to boost confidence, considering how sweaty CNY visiting can get.\n\nMaison Margiela, Replica Lazy Sunday Morning EDT Price: $145 for 100ml Available: Sephora\n\nFresh and feminine, this scent has been my favourite for a while because it is not overwhelming but still distinctive.\n\nIt smells just like the name suggests, with notes of lily and white musk, reminding me of freshly laundered linen.\n\nIt also lasts for a decent amount of time and is one that I have received loads of compliments for.\n\nDior, J'adore Absolu EDP Price: $200 for 50ml Available: All Dior counters\n\nFloral, fruity and sweet without compromising on elegance, it screams sophistication with notes of jasmine and orange.\n\nIt is not really a scent I would choose for myself, but I found myself loving it on a friend when we went to brunch.\n\nPerhaps it is not for every occasion but nice enough for a daytime event or picnic.\n\nByredo, Gypsy Water EDP Price: $210 for 50ml Available: escentials Paragon and escentials.com\n\nMy immediate reaction to this is one of confusion.\n\nI am not a huge fan of how earthy and smoky it is, almost like incense. But the longer it lingers on my skin, notes of sweet vanilla combined with sandalwood come through.\n\nIt is rather refreshing and quite unlike most scents I have come across.\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nWELLNESS & BEAUTY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Of course, it motivates me,\" he told reporters after celebrating the demolition of his greatest rival in their 53rd meeting.\n\n\"Playing Grand Slams, biggest ATP events, is my utmost priority.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nSep 23, 2022, 03:22am\n\nFederer bids emotional farewell to tennis at Laver Cup\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt was the manner of victory that had many, including Djokovic, believing he can go on to match or possibly overtake Federer.\n\nAt 31 years old, six years younger than Federer, he has time on his side.\n\n\"I do want to definitely focus myself on continuing to improve my game and maintaining the overall well-being that I have - mental, physical, emotional - so I would be able to compete at such a high level for the years to come, and have a shot at eventually getting closer to Roger's record,\" Djokovic said. \"It's still far.\"\n\nHe has already ripped one record from Federer's grasp - lifting the Norman Brookes trophy for a seventh time put him clear of the Swiss maestro and Roy Emerson, who both won six Australian Open men's singles titles.\n\nThe Serb's victory was simply magnificent as he embarrassed Nadal in 124 minutes of spellbinding dominance.\n\nThe Spaniard had not dropped his remodelled serve since the first round at Melbourne Park 13 days earlier.\n\nBut so dominant was Djokovic that he broke the world No. 2 not once, but twice in each of the three sets, lost only 13 points on his own serve while delivering eight aces and committed just nine unforced errors.\n\nThe numbers were scarcely believable considering the duo had battled for almost six hours in their previous Australian Open final in 2012 - the longest final in Grand Slam history.\n\n\"Under the circumstances, playing against Nadal, such an important match, yeah, I mean, it's amazing,\" said Djokovic.\n\n\"Obviously back-to-back semi-finals and finals, I think I made 15 unforced errors in total in two matches. At this level, as I said, under the circumstances, it was truly a perfect match.\"\n\nDjokovic will go to Paris in May for the French Open seeking to become the only man in the Open Era to win all four Majors twice and, with victory, would hold all four Majors at the same time for the second time in his career.\n\nBut Roland Garros is where the \"King of Clay\" Nadal rules, having won 11 French Opens in 13 years. Djokovic would love to dethrone the Spaniard there after humiliating him in Melbourne.\n\n\"Obviously I have to work on my game, my clay-court game, a bit more, more specifically than I have,\" said Djokovic. - AFP\n\nTennis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 02:25am\n\nChinese tennis player Peng Shuai denies making accusation of sexual assault\n\nFeb 4, 2022, 08:01am\n\nBarca official resigns after calling Spanish tennis star Nadal an 'enemy of the state'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2e8cc19625399fb33d5c7e56187f94cccf193a0b0b230629ce7b2349dc72b8d5/NP_20190129_NOVAK29_4586086.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Djokovic (above) knows that Federer's record is far away.

They are solid in all departments but they have some dangerous individuals too.\n\n\"They've been together for many years,\" noted the former AC Milan and Lazio boss before a game that will be bristling with regional tensions over the long-running Gulf blockade of Qatar.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"That stability is a source of great strength for them.\"\n\nJapan, who beat Iran 3-0 in yesterday's other semi-final, await in Friday's final.\n\nThe Emiratis reached the final the last time they hosted the Asian Cup in 1996 and reached the last four in Australia four years ago.\n\nZaccheroni promised his side had extra incentive to go one better than in 2015, with key players Khalifa Mubarak and Mohamed Ahmed ruled out of the semi-final through injury and set to undergo surgery.\n\n\"The players who are fit are highly motivated and all aware of the importance of this game.

He will relinquish the reins after the April 13-14 HSBC Singapore Rugby Sevens.\n\nBryn Jones, the Hub's chairman, will take over as acting CEO until its \"global search\" for a replacement bears fruit.\n\n\"The board extends its heartfelt appreciation to Jin Teik for his strong leadership, passion and unwavering commitment to the project and wishes him the very best in his future endeavours,\" Jones said in the statement.\n\nNo reason was given for Oon's sudden resignation and he could not be reached for further comment.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 8, 2022, 12:37pm\n\nI took a spinning class and ended up at a hospital's A&E clinic\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn the same statement, he said: \"I have been privileged to be involved with the Singapore Sports Hub for almost 20 years (since its conceptualisation phase)...

Since Jin Teik took the helm at the Singapore Sports Hub, the partnership between us has strengthened with mutual respect and understanding.\n\n\"Activities at the Singapore Sports Hub have also increased significantly.

From our experience with Newcastle, it's always tight and I imagine that will happen tomorrow because they defend really well.\n\n\"But I feel we attack better against these defences. We attack more fluently.\"\n\nIn their next nine EPL match days, City will play eight of their matches before league leaders Liverpool, allowing them to add a layer of pressure on the Reds if they consistently rack up three points before Juergen Klopp's side kick off.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut Guardiola downplayed any notion of an advantage, saying: \"When we play later, when we play early, the only chance we have is to win the games.\n\n\"If we don't, it's almost over.

History proves that he's wrong.\n\nThe Tottenham Hotspur manager has suggested that trophies do not build clubs. They merely build egos.\n\nHe couldn't say much else after steering Spurs through two cup exits in four days, but his polarising opinion gets to the heart of the game's overriding objective.\n\nThose suited shells sitting in the executive boxes still operate under the misguided view that football is all about the money.\n\nBut the Tottenham fans who turned up for the Crystal Palace defeat were there for the memories. Memories build clubs, not bank statements.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nManchester United supporters can't remember every one of Sir Alex Ferguson's title wins in vivid detail. There were too many. But even the most jaundiced Red Devil can remember Leicester City's Cinderella story. Everyone can.\n\nSimilarly, older Tottenham fans won't recall every Champions League qualification, but they'll never forget their 1991 FA Cup triumph.\n\nPaul Gascoigne's injury and redemption were plot points in a gripping narrative, a regular topic of pub conversation for the barren years that followed.\n\nCups need context, a context that Pochettino appears to lack.\n\nThis is the one time when the otherwise irritating nationality card could be played. The Argentinian's foreign status suggests he may or may not understand the sentimentality of the FA Cup, but he doesn't get the sentimentality of Spurs fans.\n\nTottenham needed a cup this season, any cup, any opportunity to visit Wembley for a legitimate reason, rather than as unwanted tenants.\n\nAnd English football needed a club like Tottenham to win the FA Cup to remind jaded cynics that football isn't just a business.\n\nThey were queuing up to share this blindingly obvious fact yesterday morning (Singapore time), defending Pochettino for making seven changes from the League Cup defeat.\n\nDespite having three of his regular front line missing, Pochettino still rested Christian Eriksen.\n\nSpeaking on Talksport, Tottenham legend Clive Allen said that finishing fourth was paramount for Spurs. That was the nature of the business now.\n\nPochettino said the same. So did others. That was the nature of the business now. Losing. Tanking. Playing weaker line-ups in a heroic bid to finish in a position that isn't worthy of a place on the Olympic podium.\n\nPARODY\n\nEnglish football is perilously close to lapsing into parody by advocating the pursuit of failure. Being the fourth-best team in the English Premier League is a more laudable pursuit than being the first-best team in the FA Cup, because of the increased revenue involved.\n\nIs it though? Does a nine-year-old daydreamer score a mythical goal at school and shout: \"And Spurs win 10 million euros (S$15.5m) for reaching the last 16 of the Champions League?\"\n\nMaybe he does. Maybe we all do. We're spoon-fed this cold, financial gruel so often that we can regurgitate the figures without thinking, without questioning, without any room for romance.\n\nTop four good, FA Cup bad. We are practically Orwellian sheep bleating at the altar of greed. Where's the love of sporting victory here?\n\nOf course, the much-parroted retort is Spurs require Champions League qualification so they can compete (actually, they need to pay for the new stadium that'll allow them to add increased matchday revenues to their TV cash, but let's not digress).\n\nBut why must it be one or the other? The top four or a trophy? The two aren't mutually exclusive. Tottenham are not AFC Wimbledon.\n\nEven with their injury crisis, Spurs had enough in reserve to at least present Palace with a greater obstacle than a wet paper bag in a puddle.\n\nAnd, incidentally, a key reason that AFC Wimbledon prevailed against West Ham United was the Hammers' ludicrous devotion to Tottenham's warped ideology.\n\nMid-table sides such as West Ham and Everton prioritised their league positions over a run in the FA Cup, losing to weaker opposition and essentially ending their respective seasons in January. Their approach seems all the more foolish when one considers only seven EPL sides remain in the last 16.\n\nThis is the cup context that continues to be missed.\n\nLiverpool's disregard for the old silver pot was contentious, but more forgivable, considering their chase for a first title in 29 years. But Tottenham are chasing memories, victories to share with future generations. What else have they got?\n\nThe same as now. Nothing. They may still qualify for the Champions League, which works wonders for the club's ego, according to Pochettino.\n\nBut finishing fourth doesn't trigger the kind of rip-roaring euphoria that comes with a cup final win. Not that Pochettino would know. The manager has never won a trophy.\n\nBut he should know that open-top bus parades are never organised for clubs to hold aloft their ego.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f2452735412a24afca6b3f6e201975033af0dbbf60e2bfd71b3a42eafd83e03f/NP_20190129_NEIL29_4585744.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mauricio Pochettino steered Tottenham Hotspur through two cup - the League Cup and FA Cup - exits in four days.", "caption": "Mauricio Pochettino steered Tottenham Hotspur through two cup - the League Cup and FA Cup - exits in four days.

I'll keep working hard and you never know what will happen.\"\n\nHis 64th-minute goal prompted a chorus of \"We want you to stay\" from Chelsea and Zola, the Blues assistant manager said: \"We want him to stay as well, we were singing too.

I can see the improvement, just from Tottenham to Arsenal; the way we improved the structure, the ideas, we've got to know one another more and they've got to know me and what I want from the team.\n\n\"For a few games everyone said it was just about attacking, attacking, but it's the other part I've been happy with. We've not conceded many chances.\"\n\nSolskjaer was appointed till the end of the season after Jose Mourinho's sacking last month to buy the United hierarchy time to find a permanent replacement.\n\nHowever, Solskjaer's case is becoming hard to ignore and he is already looking to the future by hoping to give a number of the club's most promising youngsters games before the end of the campaign.\n\n\"We have quite a few talents in the youth team that you'd like to see,\" he said.\n\n\"And will see at some point before next season, to put the club and team in a good position at the end of the season, how will we look next season.\n\n\"Mason (Greenwood), Jimmy Garner, Ethan (Hamilton) - it's just about the right time.\n\n\"We've got Alexis (Sanchez), Romelu Lukaku and Juan (Mata) who haven't played so much lately. They're three players they have to jump ahead of.\n\nTOUGH FIGHT FOR TOP FOUR\n\n\"What Manchester United are going to look like next season with or without me, it doesn't really matter. I'm here to prepare the team for next season. That means doing well now.\"\n\nSolskjaer's wish to blood youngsters may be tempered by his side's charge towards the top four, with sixth-placed United three points adrift of fourth-placed Chelsea.\n\nIn fact, United goalkeeper David de Gea has said that, while Solskjaer has brought renewed hope to the club, qualifying for the Champions League will still be difficult.\n\n\"We're happy with the wins but we aren't satisfied with the overall situation. This is a club that should be fighting for the title,\" de Gea told Sky Sports.\n\n\"We want to get back into the Champions League places, which will be a difficult objective, but we have managed to reduce the points deficit quite a bit.\"\n\nDe Gea is also wary of their next opponents, who have won 10 points from their last four games.\n\n\"Burnley on a good run of results, but we're playing at home and we're also on a good run of form, so we're fully confident of winning all three points,\" the Spaniard said.\n\n\"They are dangerous and we know the kind of style they will use against us. They like to put you under pressure with long balls and they're very dangerous at set-pieces.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Burnley manager Sean Dyche praised Solskjaer's impact at United and expects a stern test tomorrow from a resurgent side playing with freedom and confidence.\n\n\"From the outside looking in, it seems like he has just tried to loosen it a little bit and put more freedom on it,\" Dyche said.\n\n\"A bit more energy seems to have come back to the players. That's a skill in itself. Possibly that is what he has done; he has just given a different feel to the group in his own way.\n\n\"They have responded and are delivering good performances. It seems a little bit more spark, not massive tactical changes.\"\n\nYet Dyche believes his own side can put a dent in Solskjaer's perfect record, given Burnley's improvement in their league form - the Clarets are unbeaten in their past four league games.\n\n\"We have to have a clear mentality,\" Dyche said.\n\n\"The players know United are in good form, they know the bounce from the change of manager and the different feel there.\n\n\"But, equally, we have been doing well ourselves ... So we have to look on that as well as keep an eye on the fact they are in form and are a good side.\"\n\n- AFP, REUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ca95884d7773648b4fdff0a8a26dedda1f0c0ced9401cddb97a0e6834800a81b/NP_20190129_OLE29_4586341.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the first manager to begin his Manchester United career with eight straight victories.", "caption": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the first manager to begin his Manchester United career with eight straight victories.

I don't agree with that. That only builds your ego.\n\n\"In reality, the most important thing is being consistently in the top four and playing in the Champions League. That is going to help the club to achieve the last step.\"\n\nWith injuries and fatigue taking their toll, it was an unfamiliar starting XI that took the field at Palace yesterday.\n\nThe Eagles went ahead through Connor Wickham before a penalty by Andros Townsend doubled the lead against his old club.\n\nPochettino, 46, said the season had been \"tough\".\n\n\"Now the targets are trying to be in the top four, to try and be close to Manchester City and Liverpool and reduce the gap. Another is to try to beat Dortmund and be in the next round.\n\n\"That will be tough. Dortmund are top of the Bundesliga and have come back from their winter holidays.

However, Mr Chan Heng Kee, Permanent Secretary, MOH, said the information remains in the hands of Brochez, an American who was deported after he was released from prison in April last year for separate crimes, including drug offences and lying about his own HIV status in order to obtain an Employment Pass.\n\nBrochez is currently under police investigation and Singapore police are seeking assistance from their foreign counterparts, said MOH.\n\nLer has been charged under the Official Secrets Act for failing to take reasonable care of confidential information regarding HIV-positive patients, and is out on bail.\n\nLer, who was also charged with the falsification of Brochez' HIV status, was sentenced to 24 months imprisonment. His appeal is scheduled to be heard in March.\n\nThe ministry said it was notified by the police last Tuesday that confidential information of HIV patients had been leaked, and made a police report the following day.\n\nMr Chan said that those affected had understandably expressed distress and anxiety, and stressed that MOH has set up a hotline, and has prepped counsellors to offer support.\n\nThe ministry revealed that in May 2016, it was made aware of Brochez' possession of confidential information that appeared to be from the HIV Registry, and upon making a police report, both Ler and Brochez' property was searched by the police, and all relevant material found was seized and secured.\n\nIn May 2018, it was found that Brochez still had part of the records that he had in 2016, but the information did not appear to have been disclosed in any public manner.\n\nThe ministry said that since 2016, a data security review of NPHU has been conducted and additional safeguards against mishandling of information by staff have been put in place.\n\nThese included a two-person approval process to download and decrypt information as well as the disabling of the use of unauthorised portable storage devices on official computers as part of a government-wide policy.\n\nMinister for Health Gan Kim Yong apologised to the public yesterday and said: \"We take a serious view of this matter. Our former staff has been charged in court and the case is pending, and we will not hesitate to take stern action against staff who violate security guidelines, abuse their authority or abuse their access to information.\"\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Confidentiality of client information - including identity and any data - is a key ethical principle for many of our care-giving professions.\"\n\nProfessor Roy Chan, president of Action for Aids, said the leak could damage the lives of those with HIV and even that of their loved ones.\n\nHe added: \"We stand with all whose private information may have been accessed and violated.\n\n\"This is a criminal act that should be condemned and answered in the most severe terms possible.\"\n\nThe police said that it is an offence under the OSA to be in possession of, communicate or use any of the confidential data that may have been disclosed.\n\nIt is also an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act to disclose any information that might identify a person with HIV or Aids, unless consent is given or except in certain circumstances, such as a court order.\n\nLawyer Fadli Fawzi of IRB Law said those who share the leaked data may also open themselves up to civil lawsuits.\n\nBoth Prof Chan and Mr Leow urged those affected by the leak to first seek help from their doctors, medical workers and counsellors.\n\nMr Leow said Oogachaga will offer support and its counselling services, which are confidential, anonymous and accessible via hotline, e-mail and WhatsApp, to all who need it.\n\nProf Chan also encouraged those with information or with any concerns to contact the MOH hotline at 6325-9220.\n\nBy\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nGet Support From The SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support Scheme\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cf276571c1e8ddfc79f9bc8213f3d44d07ec518b37dcfcb4aa55ef92580f35ea/2018-12-11t171032z_642677920_rc18c292cec0_rtrmadp_3_chile-health.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The system detects hand gestures and movements.\n\nThe hardware cost about $15,000 for each set-up, according to an HTA spokesman.\n\nVR training allowed for a realistic but safe and controlled learning environment for trainees to hone decision-making skills without fear of making mistakes, said the spokesman.\n\nThey would learn about gathering facts from first responders and witnesses and survey, collect and process evidence at the crime scene.\n\nThe HTA spokesman said this training approach suits the new-generation learners who grew up as \"digital kids\", with a preference for \"self-directed and self-paced learning\".\n\n\"The project also aims to bring about savings in physical space requirements, procurement of props as well as storage space for the props,\" the spokesman added.\n\nThe Home Team's adoption of VR is part of moves to prepare its officers. In September 2017, HTA started a trial for a mobile classroom (MobiC), to train front-line officers using VR at any neighbourhood police centre.\n\nMobiC resembles a regular lorry but at the push of a button, opens up to occupy three carpark spaces and can train 16 officers in 40 minutes.\n\nThe trial is ongoing with the project team studying the feedback and assessing the continued use of this system to augment training for frontline officers, said the HTA spokesman.\n\nFABIAN KOH\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Police said they believe the explosives were detonated remotely but did not elaborate.\n\nDespite the contradictions, the authorities have not ruled out ISIS involvement.\n\nFactions aligned with the group - including the notorious Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom group - which were not part of the peace process, are prime suspects in the bombing.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

Both pilots were among those killed.\n\nCiting the voice recorder and the accounts of passengers, the report said the captain was smoking in the cockpit during the flight and \"engaged in unnecessary, unprofessional and lengthy conversation even in the critical phase\", violating the norm of maintaining a sterile cockpit.- REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2483d7acca2c963171b3516bf0c10580864d59ad049551c8feac4b4b879927be/NP_20211210_PROTEST10_7055858.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Parents' groups in S.

More than 350 passengers were affected and had to spend the New Year in Taiwan.\n\nEarlier in the month, a Scoot flight bound for Singapore from Greece was delayed at least three times.\n\nPassengers were made to board and disembark at Athens airport on three separate occasions over two days.\n\nThat flight eventually arrived in Singapore about 56 hours later than scheduled.\n\n- THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nCONSUMER ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 28, 2022, 02:23pm\n\nUse taxi apps, not platform like Gojek, says passenger who was charged $10 booking fee\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTNP goes fully digital\n\nNov 25, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nVegetable prices here rise due to wet weather in M'sia\n\nNov 25, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nDBS restores digital banking services, rules out cyber attack\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

This will minimise inconvenience to residents.\n\n\"...Residents will be notified in advance of the shutdown,\" he said.\n\nThe PAP town councils managed some 24,000 lifts as of last month, and the WP's AHTC more than 1,700.\n\nThe HDB programme will equip lifts with recommended components by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).\n\nThe PAP town councils have also adopted new working protocols to manage tenders and contractors, and is testing a new system to help town councils manage their lifts.\n\nA lift surveillance system giving round-the-clock information on lift breakdowns is on schedule to be implemented, said Dr Teo.\n\nThe HDB programme extends to lifts less than 18 years old at the start of the LEP.\n\nOlder lifts may be considered for replacement under a different scheme, said Dr Teo.\n\nVeteran lift engineer Kok Peng Koon, 80, agreed lifts more than three decades old would have suffered so much corrosion and wear that it would be more feasible to replace them entirely than to upgrade them.\n\nWith most lifts slated for upgrading, experts said this would serve as an incentive for private and commercial lift owners to follow suit and adopt BCA's list of recommended components.\n\nMr Chee Yan Pong, 73, who owns consulting engineering firm YP Chee and Associates, said commercial parties will have to do so on their own dime.\n\n\"Rather than through mandate, this is a softer, more progressive way to teach private lift owners to upgrade their lifts,\" said Mr Chee.\n\nThe eight safety components were recommended by the BCA in 2016, following a number of HDB lift incidents that caused death or injury.\n\nThey include sensors, a battery-powered automatic rescue device that can release trapped users safely during lift breakdowns and power failures.\n\nOne of the features to be installed is overspeed protection, which can detect whether an ascending lift has accelerated beyond its design limit, braking the lift car before it hits the top of the lift shaft.\n\nBy\n\nNg Jun Sen\n\nRead articles by Ng Jun Sen\n\nProperty\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 30, 2023, 08:51am\n\nProperty taxes for most homes to rise in 2024; Govt to give one-off rebate to cushion impact\n\nAug 24, 2023, 12:19pm\n\nSengkang condo resident's doormat removed for 'encroachment'\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\n29 HDB resale flats sold for at least $1 million last month\n\nNov 21, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHDB to ramp up supply of BTO flats, with demand up by 70%\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

That was back in the 14th century.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Europeans who came to South-east Asia knew about the island.\n\nWhen Raffles arrived in 1819, his establishment of Singapore as a free port was a \"crucial turning point in our history\", the PM said, as \"it set this island on a trajectory leading to where we are today\".\n\nHe noted that when the communists won the civil war in China, many Chinese stayed on in Singapore and they fought to shake off the British colonial yoke.\n\nPM Lee credited the Pioneer Generation as having the grit and resolve to show they could be masters of their own fate when Singapore separated from Malaysia.\n\nBut Singapore also recognises the British left an indelible imprint on Singapore, said PM Lee, citing the rule of law and the parliamentary system of Government.\n\nMELODY ZACCHEUS, HERITAGE AND COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5d87946b13a8e9c8214805bc7f7c4a183b8402ac097d1f4b9e2f6e16011161ce/NP_20190129_LAUNCH29_4586538.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong with 11-year-old Kayla Choy, launching the Singapore Bicentennial.

For example, Singapore played an active role in the negotiations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nSingapore must also continue to uphold international law and the rules-based international order, Dr Balakrishnan noted.\n\nThird, Singapore must diversify partnerships, as technological disruption will erode borders, revolutionise business models and shift production bases, he said.\n\nSingapore must go beyond conventional markets and break \"safe models\" to capitalise on opportunities, he noted.\n\nIn a speech at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Dr Balakrishnan traced how the world economy has been shaped over the decades by the industrial revolution, Fordism and post-war globalisation.\n\nThe world is now in a new \"digital gilded age\", with the rise of smart technologies. This has created winners, such as supranational tech companies such as Google and Facebook, which are growing in economic and political clout, and losers, such as workers who have lost their jobs due to disruptive changes.\n\nThere is a fractured world order, due to fractious domestic politics caused by digital disruption, Dr Balakrishnan said.\n\n\"There will be countries that are afraid of change and fearing competition, (and) will question the value of the current liberal world order.\n\n\"On the other hand, nations like Singapore believe we need to master the new technologies, face competition head on, double down on interdependence, integration, openness and to seek win-win cooperation,\" he said.\n\nADRIAN LIM, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

These businessmen, they only think about themselves.\"\n\nChief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said facilities were built to code and equipment had shown the dam was stable two weeks earlier.\n\n\"I'm not a mining technician. I followed the technicians' advice and you see what happened. It didn't work,\" Mr Schvartsman said. \"We are 100 per cent within all the standards, and that didn't do it.\"\n\nBlowback from the disaster could threaten the plans of President Jair Bolsonaro to relax restrictions on mining.- REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Dark Dream, the 2.8 favourite endured a difficult run to finish fourth, 23/4 lengths behind his stablemate.\n\n\"Furore's form has improved each race,\" Lor continued. \"I thought he'd run well but winning came as a little bit of a surprise because I thought Dark Dream was a little bit better.\"\n\nBowman backed that assessment. The Australian ace was on the ground a week ago, riding Furore for the first time in a morning gallop.\n\n\"I sat on him last week and certainly wouldn't have expected him to show that sort of turn of foot over this distance against this opposition,\" said Bowman.\n\n\"He worked like he'd run well at a mile but I had my doubts that he could win at this class at the mile.\n\n\"I thought, that being the case, I wanted to ride him a bit more conservatively than he was last start, just to get him a confidence-boosting run heading towards the Derby.\n\n\"But judging from how he performed, he's now a good bet for the 2,000m event.\"\n\nBowman's best previous finish in the race was a frustrating second aboard Werther three years ago.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7fd13b118e083df59496b51f5246cae75e291518092c5334cb91404ef5e03d84/np_20190129_hk29_4584446.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Australian jockey Hugh Bowman driving the Frankie Lor-trained Furore (No.3) home to take the Hong Kong Classic Mile, the first leg of the Four-Year-Old Classic Series, at Sha Tin on Sunday.", "caption": "Australian jockey Hugh Bowman driving the Frankie Lor-trained Furore (No.3) home to take the Hong Kong Classic Mile, the first leg of the Four-Year-Old Classic Series, at Sha Tin on Sunday.

But he was more enthused with Exultant who, he said, will be lining up for the Hong Kong Gold Cup next month.\n\n\"Exultant is also entered for Dubai,\" he added. \"Whether or not he goes there is up to the owner, but to win the Centenary Vase like he did and at a distance short of his best only gives me more confidence in the horse.\"\n\nIt was up to Zac Purton to fill in the blanks - and the champion jockey was more than impressed with Exultant's victory.\n\n\"He's more than just a stayer,\" said Purton. \"He's a stayer with class - and he's continued to get better.\n\n\"Through the mid-section, they rolled along and the pace stayed on. From where I was, it was just a matter of keeping him rolling and he kept coming into it.\"\n\nExultant followed recent past winners Akeed Mofeed and Designs On Rome in rolling into a Centenary Vase victory off successes at Hong Kong's December showcase fixture.\n\nBoth of their Group 1 scores came in the Hong Kong Cup, though, and the past two winners of that 2,000m feature were unable to match Exultant's drive - Glorious Forever finished eighth and Time Warp last of nine.\n\n\"It was pretty soft the last furlong,\" said Purton.\n\nHowever, it was anything but soft at the start.\n\n\"They smashed him coming out of the gates, they really jammed him and put him out the back, so I wasn't too impressed with that,\" said the Australian.\n\nExultant's bruising initial squeeze between Glorious Forever and Horse Of Fortune left the five-year-old racing at the back.\n\nUp front, Pingwu Spark was set a stern task, out-racing an old Purton ally, Time Warp, to take the lead.\n\nPurton shifted Exultant wide off the home turn and got to work with 400m to go.\n\nThe Teofilo gelding wound up into a relentless drive and secured the lead with 200m to race, his momentum carrying him clear of last year's winner Dinozzo.\n\nThe Da Cruz-trained Romantic Touch kept on for third.\n\nTrainer Frankie Lor was not too sad about Glorious Forever's failure to follow-up his Hong Kong Cup success.\n\n\"The pace was too fast,\" he said. \"We'll go on to the Hong Kong Gold Cup now.\"\n\nLor gained rich compensation one race later when Furore took the day's lead feature, the Hong Kong Classic Mile, under Hugh Bowman.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/40314a0e0367a74a43f89d54df48e675b47d16526828dec67494ccba41cfd1b3/np_20190129_hk29xmy8_4584447.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Tony Da Cruz-trained Exultant (above) racing away to win the Group 3 Centenary Vase Handicap over 1,800m with champion jockeyZac Purton astride at Sha Tin on Sunday.", "caption": "The Tony Da Cruz-trained Exultant (above) racing away to win the Group 3 Centenary Vase Handicap over 1,800m with champion jockeyZac Purton astride at Sha Tin on Sunday.

This will likely be after the company revamps its landbank via aggressive replanting and cost management.\n\nCore earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 reversed into the red with US$18.5 million of losses, from a profit of US$101 million in the corresponding period in fiscal 2017.\n\nThis was due mainly to lower crude palm oil (CPO) prices, weaker refining margins and losses incurred at its oilseeds division in China due to the effects of US-China trade tensions.\n\nFor Q4 , we expect a turnaround to profitability, assuming effective tax rates return to normal on continued year-on-year growth in fresh fruit bunches (FFB) output and lower unit costs.\n\nRefining margins should also improve slightly quarter-on-quarter, on lower CPO prices, while the oilseed division had already turned around in Q3.\n\nFor 2019 and 2020, we project FFB growth to normalise to 3 per cent YOY.\n\nWe believe a more significant impact from aggressive replanting activities will only be seen three to four years later.\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

The data included names, identification numbers and HIV status.\n\nThe Ministry of Health was notified of the leak on Jan 22 and a police report was made on Jan 23.\n\nThe information was in the illegal possession of Mikhy K Farrera Brochez, a US citizen who came to Singapore in 2008 and was later jailed in 2017 for several fraud and drug-related offences and lying to the Ministry of Manpower about his own HIV status.\n\nBrochez allegedly obtained the information through the mishandling of information by Singaporean doctor and NPHU's former head, Ler Teck Siang. The two men were partners.\n\nLer has been charged under the Official Secrets Act for failing to take reasonable care of confidential information regarding HIV-positive patients. This charge is pending.\n\nThe data is still in the hands of Brochez, who was deported after he had served his jail term and remains outside Singapore.\n\nMr Gan said: \"We take a serious view of this matter. Our former staff has been charged in court and the case is pending, and we will not hesitate to take stern action against staff who violate security guidelines, abuse their authority or abuse their access to information.\"\n\nMr Gan said the ministry had put in place a hotline for those affected to call in as well as counselors should those affected require support.\n\nThe police warned that it is an offence to share any of leaked information.\n\n\"The police would like to remind the public that it is an offence under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) for any person to be in possession of, communicate or use any of the confidential data that may have been disclosed.

She shared the incident on Facebook and told TNP that her daughter had bought a ticket from online marketplace Carousell.\n\nThe 45-year-old sales planner said her daughter found a person who was selling a single ticket for $480, up from the original price of $280.\n\nTickets for the concert were priced between $88 and $348.\n\nMadam Poon's daughter made a $200 deposit through bank transfer. But a week later, the seller stood the teen up three times, claiming each time that he was busy when she tried to arrange to meet him. The teen asked for a refund but he became uncontactable.\n\n\"My daughter was depressed because she could not see her favourite band. She felt hurt that she had been cheated,\" she said.\n\nCarousell told TNP it had received reports from other BTS concertgoers claiming to be scammed and were in touch with them.\n\nIt has suspended a user account that did not deliver tickets of the BTS Singapore concert, the spokesman added. Investigations are ongoing.\n\nSaid the spokesman: \"If any account is found to have engaged in fraudulent activity, we will not hesitate to suspend and ban the user.\"\n\nAccording to the National Crime Prevention Council, $930,000 have been lost in 1,277 reported online purchase scams in Singapore.\n\nBy\n\nNur Syahindah Ishak\n\nRead articles by Nur Syahindah Ishak\n\nAngelii Trissha Mohan\n\nRead articles by Angelii Trissha Mohan\n\nCONSUMER ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 28, 2022, 02:23pm\n\nUse taxi apps, not platform like Gojek, says passenger who was charged $10 booking fee\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTNP goes fully digital\n\nNov 25, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nVegetable prices here rise due to wet weather in M'sia\n\nNov 25, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nDBS restores digital banking services, rules out cyber attack\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It came amid hope and excitement about the ratification of a devolution plan that aims to bring development, jobs and peace to one of Asia's poorest and most volatile places.\n\nThe first explosion went off inside the cathedral on Jolo island, in Sulu province, and was followed by a second blast outside, which was detonated as security forces raced to the scene, officials said.\n\n\"The enemies of the state have boldly challenged the capability of the government to secure the safety of the citizenry in that region,\" said Mr Salvador Panelo, spokesman for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

Police lowered the death toll from 27 to 20 after discovering duplications in initial records. - REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0b62143a47a325cda47ffe02f1b88918bd5fccb0ebf0ac459d398b0d35e6ba8f/NP_20190128_BOMB28_4583223.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Members of the Philippine Red Cross attending to a casualty inside the church after the bombing attack in Jolo.

As part of this programme, drivers are given 80 hours to get a sense of what it is like to drive an electric car.\n\nPotential hires are paid on an hourly basis at a rate of about $7.50 an hour.

It was actually going to cost significantly more than if we replaced them early,\" he added.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 06:16am\n\nWhen is it acceptable to address a stranger as 'uncle' or 'aunty'?\n\nMore related stories\n\nA Sembawang Town Council spokesman said lifts were previously replaced based on their age. She added that other town councils have also called for tenders or started works to replace lifts ahead of schedule, if doing so is more cost-effective than maintaining them.\n\nThe event was also attended by the other Sembawang GRC MPs - Mr Ong Ye Kung, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Amrin Amin.\n\nMr Lee Weng Khor, 45, waited three months to have a new lift at Block 769 Woodlands Drive 60.\n\nThe engineer lives on the top floor of the 14-storey Housing Board block with his wife and daughter.\n\nHe said the three lifts at the block \"sank a bit\" when residents stepped into them, and their doors did not always close fully.\n\n\"Sometimes, we had to close the doors manually (to get the lift moving),\" added Mr Lee, who has lived there for 12 years.\n\nHe said problems started surfacing last year, but last August the town council announced the lift replacement programme.\n\nMr Nair said the town council had \"very healthy lift replacement funds which it could tap\" to replace the lifts. Residents will not have to pay for it.\n\n\"The new lifts are significantly faster, about 50 per cent faster than the old lifts,\" he said.\n\nThe new lifts move 90m a minute compared with the old lifts, which moved at 60m a minute.\n\nMr Nair added that the new lifts can also carry up to 10 people, up from eight, and come with energy-efficient and safety features.\n\nEM Services, the company putting in the first 280 new lifts, had to consider the maintenance needed for the first 10 years of the lifts' working lives as part of the conditions of the tender.\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\n\nMr Nair said this means that the company with the winning bid has to take \"long-term responsibility\" for the new lifts.\n\nIt will have to be \"more careful with the installation\" because it is responsible for all replacements, he added.\n\nThe remaining 56 new lifts have not been tendered yet.\n\nAt Mr Lee's block, a new lift started operating last month, with a second one now undergoing replacement works.\n\n\"The new lift is brighter and buttons are more robust. The lift feels more reliable,\" he said.\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The IPC said a new venue would be sought for the same dates.\n\n\"All World Championships must be open to all eligible athletes and nations to compete safely and free from discrimination,\" said IPC president Andrew Parsons after a meeting of the IPC governing board in London. \"When a host country excludes athletes from a particular nation, for political reasons, then we have absolutely no alternative but to look for a new Championships host.\"\n\nMalaysia, which does not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, announced this month that it would bar Israelis from any event held in the Southeast Asia nation.\n\nIsrael had condemned the ban as \"shameful\" and said the decision was inspired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's \"rabid anti-Semitism\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

Facebook post sparks anger", "publish_date": "2019-01-27T22:00:00", "content": "PHOTO ILLUSTRATION\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 27, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nWho should teach kids to read? Parents or teachers? Facebook post sparks anger\n\nTeacher's comments anger some parents who say it's not their 'job'\n\nShare this article\n\nEarlier this month, Ms Lenny Rahman, a physical education teacher, was carrying out a classroom exercise for Primary 1 pupils that required them to label different body parts.\n\nA student asked her for help, and she told him to read out the instructions from his textbook.\n\nBut the 34-year-old realised that he could not even recognise simple words such as \"is\", \"the\" and \"her\".\n\nWho reads to him, she asked. \"My teacher,\" he replied.\n\nWhat about people at home? His parents are usually at work on shift jobs, or asleep when they are home, he said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 11, 2025, 01:01am\n\nBreaking free through education behind bars\n\nMore related stories\n\nHaving seen many other such cases where parents' lack of involvement in a child's education contributed to him feeling demoralised and lagging behind his peers, she took to Facebook to air her frustrations.\n\n\"It baffles me that in this day and age there are kids in Primary 1 who do not know how to read... Busy working but you cannot spend time with your kid? Then why have kids in the first place?!\" she wrote in a public post.\n\n\"Please, if you think you don't have the means, there are these things called condoms and birth control. They're cheaper than raising a child.\"\n\nThe strongly worded post, which was partially written in Malay, quickly went viral. It racked up more than 1,000 shares in a week, with many weighing in on the question of who should be responsible for teaching children to read.\n\nThis comes even as the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study of Primary 4 pupils here last year found that children in Singapore rank second out of 58 territories in terms of how well pupils read, coming in after Russia.\n\nThe post sparked vociferous opposition from parents like housewife Nafisah Mohamad, 32, a mother of a two-year-old boy, who said: \"Some people are just slow. Not everybody has the same capacity in their brains.\n\n\"Parents pay the school fees, which also indirectly pay for the teacher's salary. Why should the teacher talk bad about her 'client'?\"\n\nTHREAT\n\nAngered, some members of the public have stalked Ms Lenny's Facebook profile to identify the school where she had been working as an adjunct teacher, and threatened to make her life a \"living hell\".\n\nConcerned about her own safety and with the school's reputation in mind, Ms Lenny volunteered to leave last Tuesday.\n\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) did not respond to media queries by press time.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, she told The Straits Times that she had been deliberately harsh in her remarks as a wake-up call to parents who \"don't even want to try to get involved in their kids' education\".\n\nHer comments, she clarified, are not directed at parents who have already been trying to help their children at home.\n\nAssociate Professor Dora Chen, the head of early childhood education at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said: \"If the process of acquiring the knowledge and skills leads us to the conclusion of 'I am not good at reading' or 'I am stupid, I am incapable', then what is the use of the drills?\n\n\"The motivation to learn is destroyed.\"\n\nMs Lenny said she does not regret making the Facebook post - in fact, some good has come out of it, as a few parents who initially chafed at her remarks have started reading with their children or bringing them to the library, she said.\n\nReading tips for parents\n\n• Use the Internet to look up YouTube videos that teach reading and phonics\n\n• If parents are unfamiliar with a language (for example, English), they can use Google to sound out any words that children don't know when they read simple picture books together\n\n• If you don't have 30 minutes a day to spare for reading with your child, start with 10 minutes a day, or make it a thrice-a-week habit\n\n• Use common items, such as signboards, to help children recognise words\n\n• Go for free storytelling programmes at public libraries, museums and cultural events\n\n• Parents can set a good example for their children by reading articles, books and the newspapers regularly, as children learn from their parents' behaviour\n\nSource: Ms Lenny Rahman, Ms Bernice Lee, director at literacy programme ReadAble\n\nYUEN SIN\n\nEducation\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 18, 2024, 06:58am\n\n'Never too late,' says N-level candidate serving 11th jail term\n\nOct 17, 2024, 01:31am\n\nLow-income parents want to give kids head start but lack the means\n\nAug 23, 2024, 01:07am\n\n'Retired' at 32, ex-scholar refuses to be 'a slave to the grind'\n\nAug 19, 2024, 08:33am\n\nTeatime: Your kids are not gifted if they struggle for GEP\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8a84b36cba1111edf855c31471d543c7f73eec21e6e9148876f5fd4b442be18d/reading_generic.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO ILLUSTRATION"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0e8ae8f889cb891a8c1a8ce4fcd755fc22b52c788b8506a692d6714644cc4b54/2.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Breaking free through education behind bars", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a991861771b0e28c87fa1bea7e906ef925c197cde7685e457853441eb4f99e42/inmates_waiting_for_their_results.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "'Never too late,' says N-level candidate serving 11th jail term", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

compared with checking against paper lists and dense spreadsheets.\n\nThis new way of processing data can free up precious time for the staff, allowing them to concentrate on higher value activities.\n\nMarrying voice-driven innovations with modern ERP solutions will be key to manufacturers reaping the benefits offered by this digital transformation trend.\n\nUltimately, when connected devices can communicate with each other and share data, users stand an increased chance of benefiting from them.\n\nThis is the next step in digital transformation, and will help businesses remain competitive and realise their growth ambitions.\n\nThe writer is vice president, global product marketing for manufacturing, Epicor Software.\n\nTERRI HISKEY\n\nTechnology\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 22, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSafeTravel website crashes due to surge in travel pass applications\n\nNov 15, 2021, 10:00pm\n\n5.9 million customers hit by RedDoorz data breach\n\nOct 28, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAll government agencies to accept digital ICs from next week\n\nOct 5, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew cyber-security tool to protect Singaporeans' phones\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

A Chinese court later retried a Canadian man who had been jailed for drugs smuggling and sentenced him to death.\"Last night, I asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation as Canada's ambassador to China,\" Mr Trudeau said in a statement that did not explain his reasons.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

It could get some key reports next week as the government reopens.\n\nWhile December saw blockbuster job creation and tame inflation, it had a batch of very gloomy numbers too.\n\nAmid President Donald Trump's trade war with China, the US manufacturing sector could be starting to crumble, with the sector seeing its biggest one month drop in December since the global financial crisis. Consumer sentiment, which can help predict spending, also hit a two year low\n\nMs Kathy Bostjancic, chief US financial market economist at Oxford Economics, expects the Fed to raise rates twice this year, with the first in May at the bank's third policy meeting of 2019. Mr Shepherdson agreed, warning against counting on no Fed moves this year.\n\n\"Pricing in zero is very dangerous,\" he said. - AFP\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

And it is getting healthier, with stalls offering reduced-calorie options and better grains and oils.\n\nBut there are still diehard habits that may be derailing your weight loss and wellness goals.\n\nMs Chan Ya Ling, a dietitian at Sengkang General Hospital, points out the best ways to change these.\n\nEating too many carbs in one meal\n\nOne serving of carbohydrates is roughly half a bowl of rice, half a bowl of noodles, two slices of bread, a large potato, or two pieces of small chapatis.\n\nThe Health Promotion Board (HPB) recommends five to seven servings of carbs for healthy adults a day - this should be spread out evenly, and not consumed in one sitting, ensuring that your carb intake is adequately distributed across the day.\n\nInstead of fearing carbs or avoiding them completely, opt for healthier options like brown rice, bee hoon and whole grains.\n\nUsing too much chilli\n\nYou might be shocked to hear that your heaping tablespoon of chilli contains a whole lot of sodium - one serving of sambal belacan has 227mg, while a serving of chicken rice chilli contains 280mg.\n\nWhen chicken rice already contains about 1,200mg of sodium, that is a lot of salt.\n\nHPB recommends no more than 2,000mg of sodium a day. This means that for a meal, you should not have more than six teaspoons (13g) of chicken rice chilli or sambal chilli, which is 25 per cent and 33 per cent of your daily sodium recommendation respectively.\n\nYes, chilli has been said to contain many health benefits including an increased metabolism, as capsaicin has been found to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation under tightly controlled clinical trials.\n\nUnfortunately, research does not support a role for capsaicin in weight management as its long-term effectiveness is unclear. Consuming high dosages of capsaicin might also lead to unpleasant side effects such as burning pain in the stomach after ingestion and in the anal cavity when you hit the loo.\n\nThinking that all mixed rice dishes are healthy\n\nYour choices at your favourite mixed rice stall can make or break your diet.\n\nA portion of eggplant with gravy, for example, contains 171 calories and a whopping 16g of fat. Curry chicken is worse at 322 calories and 20g fat, and fried fish comes in at 392 calories and 22g total fat.\n\nAim to select mixed rice dishes cooked using healthier methods such as steaming, stir-frying and grilling. Some examples include steamed eggs, stir-fried leafy greens and tofu. Try your best to limit dishes that are fried or deep-fried and dishes laden with curry or gravy.\n\nIt is best to opt for two portions of vegetables and one portion of meat. Choose brown rice if possible and skip the gravy.\n\nIndulging in too many desserts\n\nKaya waffles, chendol and a can of soft drink all contain seven teaspoons of sugar.\n\nA small bowl of chendol can set you back anywhere between 300 and 600 calories.\n\nIce kacang falls in a slightly lower window of 200 to 500 calories but is still sugar-rich.\n\nAs the recommended calorie intake for the average Asian woman is between 1,800 and 2,000, a 500 calorie dessert is a big chunk of it.\n\nThe goal here is to limit your total intake of added sugars not just from desserts, but from your entire diet.\n\nHPB recommends no more than eight to 11 teaspoons of added sugars a day.\n\nAdded sugars can be found in a variety of food and beverages such as sugary drinks, fruit juice, spreads and processed foods. They can be easily consumed in large amounts in short periods of time, so be mindful of how much you take in per day.\n\nInstead of blowing all your sugar on an unhealthy treat, go for slightly healthier options like unsweetened beancurd pudding or a low-fat yogurt which has two teaspoons of sugar.\n\nFor drinks, just stick to water or unsweetened versions of coffee, soya bean milk or barley.\n\nThis article first appeared in Shape (www.shape.com.sg)\n\nCARISSA WONG\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Korea protest against vaccine pass rule for kids\n\nMore related stories\n\nSince last year, the world's two largest economies have exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs on more than US$360 billion in two-way trade, with the largest amount, more than US$250 billion, imposed by Washington.\n\nMr Trump's protectionist moves have begun to weigh on the Chinese economy, which last year posted its slowest economic growth in nearly three decades, causing Mr Trump to claim he has the upper hand.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday last week that Washington and Beijing remained \"miles and miles\" from the finishing line in their talks, cautioning against putting too much hope for a final resolution at this week's talks.\n\n\"I think next week's negotiations will be critical in determining whether the Chinese are willing to talk about any of the structural issues the United States is concerned about,\" Mr Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations said.\n\nEarly this month, Chinese officials signalled they were open to reducing the trade imbalance but there has been scant sign of movement on Washington's tougher demands. A deal could be hard to reach should Beijing prove unwilling to cede any ground on the state subsidies at the heart of Mr Xi's vision for industrial pre-eminence.\n\n\"It will be very difficult to reach an agreement unless the Chinese are willing to address some of those issues,\" said Mr Alden. The Chinese are likely to reject any US demand seen as an obstacle to the Made in China 2025 strategic plan, according to Mr Alden.\n\nLaunched in 2015, the plan aimed to achieve Chinese dominance in cutting-edge technologies likely critical to the future success of developed economies, including robotics, artificial intelligence, aerospace and electric autos.\n\nMs Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ Banking Group, said Beijing was likely to hold steadfast to its industrial planning.\n\n\"Made in China 2025 is a necessary strategy for China to achieve sustainable development,\" she said, adding that the consensus is China could not continue being the world's factory floor in order to grow.\n\n\"China's transformation to high-end manufacturing and high value-added services is also a step China must go through for its domestic sustainable development,\" she said. - AFP\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2483d7acca2c963171b3516bf0c10580864d59ad049551c8feac4b4b879927be/NP_20211210_PROTEST10_7055858.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Parents' groups in S.

It also captures Colvin losing the sight of one eye - leading to her wearing a signature eyepatch - while covering Sri Lanka's civil war, and interviewing former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi shortly before his death in 2011.\n\nThe film also shows her retreating into heavy drinking and battling likely post-traumatic stress disorder in between assignments.\n\nOscar-nominated Pike said she was attracted to the part by Colvin's complexity.\n\n\"I wanted to put a woman out there on the screen who is admirable, but not every quality she has is admirable.\n\n\"There was something about... the fierceness of passion in what she did that I related to,\" she said.\n\nHeineman said he spent months researching the story, including watching practically every war film ever made. He also enlisted locals rather than actors to play the parts of extras in the war zones portrayed.\n\n\"Those are real Syrian women shedding real tears and telling real stories,\" he explained of scenes showing Colvin interviewing civilians in Syria.\n\n\"That was really important to me to try to bring an authenticity to this experience.\"\n\nThe director said making City Of Ghosts, a 2017 documentary about a Syrian media activist group in Raqqa and other conflict-driven documentaries helped him empathise with Colvin.\n\n\"I just felt enormous kinship with her and also her desire to put a human face to poor innocent civilians who are caught in the crossfire of these geopolitical conflicts,\" he added. - AFP\n\nMovies\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ff730a0b65f444d07a80491fe5c4b387b844d4e0038a9b618056cc35c787acf4/NP_20190128_WAR28_4582570.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(Above, second from right) English actress Rosamund Pike as Marie Colvin.", "caption": "(Above, second from right) English actress Rosamund Pike as Marie Colvin.

Fabricating carbon fibre panels and parts that are worthy of being works of art, strong and light for use in the aviation, military or motorsport industries.\n\nMr Ashok, 40, production operations manager of Trigen Automotive, a special application vehicle business arm of Hope, said making components out of carbon fibre is \"exactly the same\" as cooking.\n\nBoth bikers are used to working with composites such as glass fibres and ABS plastics, including black gold, a term reserved for carbon fibre.\n\nThe processes vary from compression moulding, injection moulding and oven-cooking to dealing with pre-impregnated fibres and light resin transfer molding.\n\n\"As with everything, carbon comes in different qualities and properties,\" said Mr Wilkinson, 45, head of composite at Hope.\n\n\"People want carbon fibre as long as it is black, has the herringbone design, and they are happy. Whether it is strong and lightweight, they don't care.\"\n\nBut for discerning motorcycle race teams with deep pockets, looks matter less than strength.\n\nThey look for attention to detail and the engineering behind bikes like the BMW HP 4 Race, which is not street legal and has a limited production run of 750.\n\nBoth the effort and equipment used to build a HP 4 Race's carbon fibre chassis, fairing and wheels are long and complex.\n\nThe process is also expensive due to the patented and proprietary technologies used, which ultimately drives up the HP 4's estimated price to about $160,000.\n\nIn return, you get a 215bhp, 146kg (dry weight) cruise missile.\n\nBut how strong are components made out of carbon fibre?\n\nMr Ashok, who has flown in a full-carbon Red Bull Air Race airplane, said: \"The wing span of a Red Bull Air Race plane can take a 20g loading and can flex about 1.5m.\"\n\nYet, there are drawbacks, said Mr Wilkinson, who rides a BMW F850GS.\n\nIf left under the sun and without a UV-filter clear coat, carbon fibre components will turn dark yellow.\n\nUnlike metals, which may show signs of stress or bending when under heavy loads, flaws in carbon fibre panels are harder to detect.\n\nMr Wilkinson said: \"There is no way to tell when it (the carbon fibre part) is going to break. There are no warning signs. With carbon, when it goes beyond its limits, it snaps.\"\n\nThis is why there are stringent checks and high standards for carbon fibre parts used in the aviation industry, where everything has to be exact, said Mr Wilkinson, who used to work in aviation.\n\nFOLLOW\n\n@BIKERBOY_TNP\n\nON INSTAGRAM FOR MORE ADVENTURES\n\nBy\n\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Zaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nMOTORSPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew-look Ducati Monster still as playful like before\n\nNov 21, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nQatar GP winner Hamilton reduces Verstappen's lead\n\nNov 16, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAlfa Romeo's Zhou becomes China's first F1 driver\n\nNov 15, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHamilton hails best weekend as he keeps title hopes alive\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

If it is dirty and contaminated, you most likely won't die from consuming it, but you want to consume the cleanest form.\n\n\"If you are dealing with poor quality or a product that has less concentration of a specific nutrient, then you won't reach a therapeutic dosage.\"\n\nShe added: \"My biggest concern is supplement companies taking advantage of the consumer.\n\n\"I see this happening more in South-east Asia than Canada, with more multi-level marketing companies pushing their products upon the public.\"\n\nDr Bean advises consumers to take note of where the supplement is manufactured, proof of product and ingredient certification supplied by the company and the type of human trials the product was used in.\n\nShe said: \"It is best to buy a supplement that has gone over and above the guidelines of the country it is sold in to achieve international certification.\n\n\"Or you can speak to a licensed healthcare practitioner such as a naturopathic doctor, integrative medical doctor, chiropractor or holistic nutritionist who utilises supplements in their practice.\"\n\nIf consumers choose not to consult professional help, Dr Bean suggests simply reflecting on how they feel before starting any supplements and after four to six weeks of doing so.\n\nPROBIOTICS\n\nAs there is a lower availability of organic food in Singapore compared with countries such as Canada, she recommends taking probiotics due to the herbicide glyphosate that can cause damage to our microbiome, along with minerals such as magnesium because of the decline in mineral-rich soil.\n\nShe added: \"Fish oils are still one of my top suggested supplements for both children and adults. There is evidence of them lowering inflammation and blood pressure, preserving cellular function, supporting brain function, reducing risk of depression and more.\"\n\nDr Bean is \"highly against\" products that contain deer placenta and alkaline water filtration systems.\n\nShe said: \"Most ethical doctors including myself would not recommend ingesting animal placenta, as this would not provide any benefits in terms of beauty and well-being.\n\n\"And when we consume alkaline water, our stomachs, which work to stay at a pH of 2.2, have to buffer the alkaline water. I recommend drinking half your body weight of filtered water in ounces.\"\n\nIn her practice, Dr Bean works to get patients off supplements after they have achieved their goal.\n\n\"In this day and age, with poor soil and air quality, stress and medication use, a good broad-spectrum multivitamin plus minerals, probiotics, along with fish oils, can be beneficial.\n\n\"But I do not believe you should be on a range of daily supplements forever. With more mindful dietary changes, increasing filtered water, exercise and addressing any environmental toxicities, you may not need to be on many, if any supplements at all,\" she said.\n\nBy\n\nAngelii Trissha Mohan\n\nRead articles by Angelii Trissha Mohan\n\nWELLNESS & BEAUTY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Do not accept any product that only gives a general listing of the ingredients without the amount or volume of every single active ingredient. This is to ensure you are getting the right dose of what you need to prevent over- or under-dosing or even potential allergic reactions.\"\n\nGetting the right dosage is very important\n\nMany people who buy online think more is better, according to Ms Chng, but therein lies the danger of overdosing.\n\nShe said: \"For example, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) stipulates that capsules containing vitamin D3 should be 1,000iu a capsule and the dose for the average person is one capsule daily. But most sold online is 4,000 to 5,000iu. So if you are taking this, you could be setting yourself up for liver poisoning in the long run.\"\n\nIt is better not to take any supplements than bad supplements\n\nA good health supplement will boost our immune system, but taking the wrong type is worse then not taking any. The latter includes synthetic vitamins, oxidized or poor quality fish oils, and too much vitamin D3 and calcium.\n\nMs Chng said: \"Synthetic and natural vitamins can be worlds apart, especially for members in the B vitamins family.

While a slight increase in cortisol could be beneficial to spur you on when you are trying to meet deadlines, overly-elevated amounts of it could potentially slow down your metabolism.\n\nThis is because cortisol reduces protein uptake, which, in the long run, could lead to the reduction of lean muscle mass.\n\nHigh cortisol levels also encourage your body to store fat in your belly area in response to stressful situations.\n\nYou don't drink enough water\n\nAccording to a study by the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, drinking enough water increases the metabolic rate of men and women by about 30 per cent.\n\nThe same study also suggests that mild dehydration could slow the body's metabolism by as much as 3 per cent.\n\nYou're not eating enough calories\n\nEating less is often associated with losing weight, but not eating enough calories could also mean the loss of muscle mass and a decrease in metabolic rate.\n\nWhen you don't eat enough, your body responds to the lack of energy given to it by going into \"starvation mode\", when your body works to store fat to protect itself.\n\nIn a study by the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, not eating enough calories over a period of 12 weeks could cause your metabolism to slow down by as much as 24 per cent.\n\nYou are lacking iron\n\nThis is especially important for women on their periods.\n\nIron is a critical nutrient that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Without oxygen, your body works harder to function, resulting in you feeling lethargic and fatigued.\n\nWhen this happens, your body enters fight mode and again, stores fat to protect itself.\n\nYou skip strength training\n\nThe creation of lean muscles through strength training helps to boost metabolism.\n\nSo pencil in weight training at the gym or kick-start a body-weight workout right in the comfort of your own home.\n\nThis article first appeared in Shape (www.shape.com.sg)\n\nATIKA LIM\n\nWELLNESS & BEAUTY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Mohamed Salah, Fernando Torres  -72 games\n\nSource:\n\nwww.premierleague.com\n\n\"I think he's just become a better all-round player,\" he told The New Paper in an exclusive interview.\n\n\"Torres' first year was fantastic, Suarez was (too), but hopefully, Salah's here for a lot more time than they were.\n\n\"If he's there for the next few years, doing what he is, he can emulate the greatest.\n\n\"There're some great players (in Liverpool's history) and he knows that. Torres and Suarez, yes, great players, but for me, they weren't at the club long enough to be superstars.\n\n\"With Salah, if he stays around and does what he's doing, he's a better all-round player, he's also a great goal scorer. He can become a true legend.\"\n\nRush's standing in Liverpool history remains untouched, both as the club's all-time record scorer and the only player to set an unparalleled 47-goal haul in a single campaign (1983/84).\n\nSalah fell just three goals shy of eclipsing that long-standing tally last term, but the ex-Wales international believes the forward's progress cannot be measured on goals alone.\n\n\"Last year, I thought he was fantastic. He'll do well to get anywhere near that goal record he had last year. He was on fire. For me, he was the best player in the world,\" added Rush.\n\n\"I think this year, people have sussed him out and he's had two people marking him (in games).\n\n\"But he's overcome that and that's what's made him a better player, a better all-round player - and that's what he is.\n\n\"Maybe switching him to the middle has helped because the central defenders haven't noticed that.\n\n\"He's still the league's top scorer with 16 goals. He might not get 40 but, if he got 30 this campaign, I think he's had an excellent season, in one way even better than last season.\"\n\nUnlike previous title challenges, a quiet confidence runs through Juergen Klopp's side as their quest to end a near three-decade wait for domestic success enters its pivotal final stages.\n\nThe English Premier League leaders head into Thursday morning's (Singapore time) encounter with 2015/16 champions Leicester City knowing that becoming swept up in the euphoria could see them sleepwalk into a repeat of their shortfalls in 2009 and 2014.\n\nBut Rush, a member of the last Liverpool side to win the title in 1990, sees Manchester City's preoccupation with success in the Champions League, coupled with the four-point gap between the sides, as perfect motivations for his former club to ultimately take the crown.\n\nHe said: \"I think, at the end of the day, it's Liverpool's title to lose. They're top of the league, four points clear, so it would be the icing on the cake if they could win it.\n\n\"If we were in Spain or Italy, I'd say yeah, we'd win the league, but as it's the English Premier League, you can't say that because anyone can beat anyone.\n\n\"This is the hardest league in the world to win, where a bottom team can beat the top team.\n\n\"But it would be a major boost if they do win the league.\n\n\"I think similarly, if you look at Manchester City, they want to win the league but their main target would be the Champions League.\"\n\n* Ian Rush was speaking ahead of the LFC Foundation's Legends Charity Match between Liverpool and AC Milan at Anfield on March 23.\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f0b04d3c32c9426668a01c736e21032b53953168cca3cdd2899476fb7a2d6332/NP_20190128_RBSOC28_4583611.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Liverpool attacker Mohamed Salah leads the English Premier League's scoring charts with 16 goals.", "caption": "Liverpool attacker Mohamed Salah leads the English Premier League's scoring charts with 16 goals.

In 1988, the then-second tier Dons caused one of the great upsets in FA Cup final history, beating Liverpool 1-0.\n\nAFC Wimbledon were formed by fans of Wimbledon who controversially uprooted from London to Milton Keynes in 2002 and became MK Dons.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nThere is a link to the club's history in manager Wally Downes, who as a player helped Wimbledon climb from English football's fourth tier all the way to the old First Division.\n\nHe said after the match: \"I don't know if it was a plan, winning was the plan, not the 4-2...\n\n\"Football is random.\n\n\"There is a load of analysis we do, me included, but on any given day, any team can beat any other team and we have done it tonight.\"\n\nSibbick, 19, wasn't born when Wimbledon won their only FA Cup but he remembers losing to the Hammers in the League Cup last August.\n\nHe said: \"We thought we were unlucky in the League Cup (West Ham scored two late goals to beat Wimbledon 3-1 last August) and got our revenge tonight.\"\n\nTwo-goal hero Wagstaff added: \"I thought the boys were excellent. It's a great win - look at the fans. This is what it is all about.\"\n\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini, predictably, wasn't in such a good mood.\n\nHe said: \"Was I angry at half-time? Yes of course.\n\n\"I was ashamed of them.\n\n\"I didn't expect it, the attitude, playing against a team that sits two divisions below us, but in football, you can lose in two or three balls...\n\n\"I changed three players because I could only make three changes. I could have changed all the players.\"\n\nThe Hammers weren't the only top-flight side to be dumped out of the FA Cup by lower-league opposition with Everton suffering a 3-2 loss at the hands of second-tier Millwall after an injury-time winner by Murray Wallace.\n\nThat result enhanced Millwall's giant-killing pedigree as they became the first team outside the top division to win five straight FA Cup home games against top-flight sides since West Ham between 1958 and 1991, according to Opta.\n\nSELECTED RESULTS\n\nShrewsbury 2 Wolves 2\n\nNewcastle 0 Watford 2\n\nBrighton 0 West Brom 0\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He told the club website: \"That doesn't mean much to me. That's only a statistic.\n\n\"We'll enjoy the win today and then we coaches will be focused on the next game starting from tomorrow... We're taking it game by game.\"\n\nIn a tight first half, Dortmund captain Marco Reus hit the post and Raphael Guerreiro also went close before Achraf Hakimi thundered in to give the hosts the lead in the 24th minute.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut Hannover made it tough for the hosts and even had more shots in the first half (10-8), before Dortmund turned on the afterburners in the second half.\n\nHakimi set up Reus' 12th league goal of the season in the 60th minute and Dortmund made it 4-0 through Mario Goetze two minutes later and Guerreiro in the 67th.\n\nCONSOLATION\n\nMidfielder Marvin Bakalorz snatched a consolation goal for the visitors in the 86th minute after a superb solo run and a deflected effort before Axel Witsel completed Dortmund's win in the 90th.\n\nFavre added: \" Hannover performed well and showed great courage by pressing us very high up the pitch.\n\n\"It took us time to find the gaps. At the break, we said that we needed to get the second (goal) as quickly as possible. It was easier for us after that.\"\n\nDespite the win, Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki felt they had eased off nearing the end, allowing Hannover to pull a goal back.\n\n\"I had the feeling that we were arrogant towards the end,\" he told sport.de.\n\n\"Then we conceded a goal which was a pity. It wasn't such a good performance today.\"\n\nSuch an attitude would serve the Ruhr valley club well, as they look to increase the gap on defending champions Bayern Munich.\n\nDortmund hold a nine-point lead ahead of Bayern's match against VfB Stuttgart last night.\n\nHannover are stuck in 17th place, with coach Andre Breitenreiter on the brink of departure, reported Reuters.\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b71048eb27f7823c771821e12159aacb370d24e64fd13171b96205de36a4b59c/NP_20190128_GER28_4583380.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Achraf Hakimi (left) celebrating his goal, Dortmund's opener against Hannover on Saturday, with Marco Reus.", "caption": "Achraf Hakimi (left) celebrating his goal, Dortmund's opener against Hannover on Saturday, with Marco Reus.

I think I help the team on the pitch, I work hard and I think I play well.\n\n\"When we score the first goal, we want to score more and more.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Guardiola commented on missing out on Frenkie de Jong after the Ajax Amsterdam star inked a £65 million (S$116m), £300,000-a-week deal with Barcelona.\n\nExplaining that City didn't want to break their wage structure for the Dutchman, he said: \"We try to keep the harmony in the locker room with the wages.\n\n\"When you have no balance with that, then there is always a problem with the mood in the locker room.\"\n\nHowever, Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde accused Guardiola of acting inappropriately after de Jong admitted he spoke to the City boss about a move to England.\n\nSaid Valverde: \"You can't call a player who already has a contract.\n\n\"It isn't my code of conduct to call a player who is under contract with another club.\"\n\nThis despite de Jong's father admitting that Barca star Lionel Messi had called his son to convince him to move to Spain.\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7890053cc97720a697702a0330f6af1266e4f03611bbe16e9ab079fe4d2f1d4d/NP_20190128_CITY28_4583519.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Pep Guardiola.", "caption": "Pep Guardiola.

Kvitova saved four match-points, showing the same resilience she needed to return to the top level of tennis after a knife attack and lengthy surgery in 2016, but her fightback fell just short. Osaka shed tears after losing the first set from a 5-3 lead but returned to court after a washroom break calmer and more composed. She broke Kvitova in the third game of the final set and converted her fifth match-point to end a superb final in two hours and 27 minutes. The 21-year-old Osaka became the youngest women's world No. 1 since Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki, who was 20 when she topped the rankings in 2010. The fourth seed, one of the cleanest strikers of the ball in women's tennis, also became the first player since Jennifer Capriati in 2001 to win the next Grand Slam after her maiden Major title. Osaka took the first set on a tiebreak after both players had exhibited their entire array of shots in a high-quality opening to the match. Kvitova's serve, which looked impregnable during the early games of the opening set, suffered a dip as Osaka took up unconventional receiving positions, forcing the Czech to make adjustments. Osaka had won 59 straight matches after taking the first set before Saturday's final and showed why as her serves grew bigger and the winners flowed from her racket in the second. Kvitova broke early in the second set to go up 2-0 but a double-fault from the Czech gave Osaka a second break-point opportunity, which she converted to get back on serve. The Czech's confidence appeared shaken and she was broken to love before another Osaka hold gave the Japanese her fourth straight game in the second set. But the 28-year-old Czech, who had lost just seven out of 33 career finals before Saturday, fought back with booming serves to save three match-points and hold for 4-5, before breaking Osaka to draw level. A teary-eyed Osaka could not stop Kvitova's fightback as the Czech won four straight games to win the set and level the match at 1-1, after the Japanese served her fourth double-fault. A break in the third game of the decider, however, proved enough for Osaka, who fell to her knees as Kvitova's forehand went wide to hand her the title. -\n\nREUTERS\n\nNaomi Osaka\n\naustralian open\n\npetra kvitova\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 16, 2024, 01:52am\n\nNaomi Osaka's Qatar title bid ended by Karolina Pliskova\n\nFeb 13, 2024, 01:40am\n\nNaomi Osaka beats Caroline Garcia in Qatar\n\nFeb 6, 2024, 01:26am\n\nOsaka aims to return to top spots, inspired by daughter Shai\n\nJan 16, 2024, 01:12am\n\nNaomi Osaka loses at Australian Open on Grand Slam comeback\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8ba25f9d27afdc02e8a32a078082f5b66d6d9a10a8fa52273fadbff1f99ce159/osaka.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Naomi Osaka has become the first Asian world No. 1 following her Australian Open triumph.", "caption": "Naomi Osaka has become the first Asian world No. 1 following her Australian Open triumph.

The Australians complained Degenek had been fouled prior to giving away possession by Mohammed Abdulrahman, but Japanese referee Ryuji Sato waved away the protests and the goal stood. \"Milos didn't get a minute at the World Cup, but he has stepped up at this tournament and done fantastically well,\" said Australia coach Graham Arnold. \"Obviously he's hurting at the moment but I'll make sure he's OK. \"He's a fantastic kid, a fantastic professional and he's got a long future with the Australian national team.\"\n\nVictory means Alberto Zaccheroni's UAE side will move on to a potentially politically sensitive semi-final against Arabian Gulf neighbours Qatar, who earlier stunned South Korea 1-0. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt launched a diplomatic and trade boycott of Qatar in June 2017. The countries accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism, which it denies. The UAE's progress was vindication of Zaccheroni's decision to make five changes from the side that edged Kyrgyzstan in the previous round, with veteran striker Ismaeil Mattar making his first start of the tournament. The home team looked comfortable despite the changes and within a minute of kickoff almost took the lead. Ismail Al Hammadi flew through the Australia defence but Ryan was equal to his goal-bound effort. Al Hammadi threatened again 19 minutes later, with Ryan called into action once more after the winger had stepped inside Australia's backline. The Socceroos threatened, too, in an open and entertaining first half. Trent Sainsbury looped an early header over the bar and Apostolos Giannou forced a save from Khalid Essa five minutes before the break. Mabkhout, though, should have scored in the dying seconds of the half, only for his close-range header to fizz over the crossbar. He made amends after halftime when he capitalised on Degenek's poor pass to give his side the lead. Australia coach Arnold threw on strikers Awer Mabil and Andrew Nabbout in a last-ditch attempt to take the game to extra time.

But Unai Emery's side were rocked in the 31st minute when Lukaku's superb reverse pass put Sanchez in and he calmly rounded Petr Cech before clipping in from a tight angle. Two minutes later, after an Arsenal attack broke down, Luke Shaw set Lukaku away down the right and the Belgian rolled the ball across for the unmarked Lingard to sidefoot past Cech. Arsenal got a lifeline just before the break when the excellent Aaron Ramsey's cut-back saw Alexandre Lacazette make a hash of his attempt but the ball arrived at the feet of Aubameyang who could not miss. A hectic finish to an absorbing first half ended with Shkodran Mustafi heading just wide and straight after the interval Romero's reflex save stopped a Laurent Koscielny header. Koscielny's involvement came to an abrupt end when the Arsenal skipper was accidentally caught in the face by Lukaku's trailing leg - the Frenchman receiving lengthy treatment before groggily going off to be replaced by Matteo Guendouzi. Out-of-favour Mesut Oezil also came off the bench, replacing Alex Iwobi, but Arsenal's hopes of rescuing the tie were over when Paul Pogba surged clear and his shot was parried by Cech into the path of Martial who sent the United fans wild.\n\nEIGHT IN A ROW\n\nSolskjaer has now won eight matches in a row since stepping in as interim manager following the sacking of Jose Mourinho - a record that eclipses even the great Sir Matt Busby. And while the statistics make that the best start by a United manager, the vibrant manner in which it has been achieved is perhaps even more impressive. United have scored 22 goals under Solskjaer and have rediscovered the kind of attacking verve associated with the trophy-winning sides Solskjaer played in under Sir Alex Ferguson. What is more, on evidence from this match, he seems to have the handy managerial knack of knowing exactly when to shuffle his plethora of attacking options. Martial and Marcus Rashford have been livewires under Solskjaer, but he left them on the bench against Arsenal and started with former Gunners forward Sanchez and Belgian powerhouse Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku, in particular, was superb, producing an unstoppable display to run Arsenal's defence ragged at times, while Sanchez silenced the boo boys with a sublime opener from Lukaku's pass. \"I've had a (selection) headache since I came because the squad is full of good players,\" Solskjaer said. \"Today, we looked more like a proper team. We looked more structured. We'd worked hard at defending and counter-attacking. Counter-attacking is classic Manchester United - Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ji-Sung Park - we've scored so many at Arsenal over the years. \"It was a massive step forward today for us. At Tottenham a couple of weeks ago, we hung in and (goalkeeper) David de Gea saved us, but today our structure was miles better.\"\n\nLukaku summed up the mood under Solskjaer, agreeing that it feels like fun again playing for the club after a torrid spell.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 29, 2019, 02:37am\n\nSanchez scores winning penalty as Chile reach Copa America semis\n\nMore related stories\n\nCLEAR DIRECTION\n\n\"It does, it does,\" he said. \"We had clear direction today and I'm really happy with the win and the manner in which we played. Look at the history of the club, we make a statement wherever we go. \"We look to dominate and create as many chances as we can.\"\n\nArsenal boss Emery could only look on with envy at the attacking rescources available to Solskjaer and which were inexplicably so subdued under Mourinho. \"They were clinical today,\" the Spaniard told reporters. \"We played against a United side in their best moment of the season and they have a lot of players to make a difference.\"\n\nEmery faces an injury crisis after a suspected broken jaw for captain Laurent Koscielny and ankle problem for Sokratis leaving him with only one fit recognised central defender. -\n\nREUTERS\n\nalexis sanchez\n\nManchester United\n\narsenal\n\nFA Cup\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 1, 2018, 02:04am\n\nMourinho praises United's perfect first-half showing\n\nJan 27, 2018, 02:13am\n\nSanchez stars on Man United debut\n\nJan 26, 2018, 11:02am\n\nMourinho accuses Man City of sour grapes\n\nJan 22, 2018, 11:33pm\n\nSanchez, Mkhitaryan complete swop deal\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The aim is that by 2023, these academies will be responsible for talent in the national development squad, while the SBF focuses on the national training squad, preparing elite-level bowlers for international competitions.\n\nTo that end, it announced a comprehensive plan on Friday to increase coaching expertise among its COE coaches, equipping them with not only bowling skills, but also other aspects of sport such as psychology and nutrition.\n\nSpeaking at SBF's 10th COE Day at SingaporeBowling @ Rifle Range bowling centre, where the national association paid tribute to the 11 academies under its COE scheme, SBF president Jessie Phua said: \"Continuous professional development is important if we want to continue to stay at the top of our game.\n\n\"Last year, the SBF council, together with our stakeholders, committed to providing better support for the COEs. Currently, most COEs are able to conduct elementary, intermediate and advance-level programmes.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 21, 2019, 03:51pm\n\nSBF's night of 'Rock and Bowl'\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I am happy to announce that the SBF will be launching an elite-level training programme. It will first start at the Singapore Sports School, before rolling it out at the other COE academies.\"\n\nSBF technical director Sid Allen, together with consultants from around the world, will be developing the Level 4 coaching certification programme.\n\n\"This programme will involve the mental, diet, physical aspects of the game. Speakers from all over the world that are experts in their respective fields will be present to upskill the coaches,\" said Allen.\n\n\"The programme hopes to set them on a holistic pathway and equip the coaches with the required skills to then nurture better-rounded student athletes.\"\n\nTRIBUTE\n\nFellow members of the bowling fraternity paid tribute to the significance of the COE.\n\nDon Chan, co-founder of Strike Academy, which has been a part of the COE for seven years, said: \"The COE provides a very clear pathway to follow, the consistency from SBF in enforcing the system allows the COE academies to grow.\n\n\"On top of training champions like Joey Yeo and Cheah Ray Han, our mission is also to impart life skills to the young... those that benefited from the system holistically, that's what we're more proud of.\"\n\nAhmad Safwan Shamsudin, runner-up of last year's Singapore National Men's Open, credited his stint with Agape Academy, which is also part of the COE, for his initiation into bowling and for playing a part in moulding him.\n\nSaid the 22-year-old: \"I joined Agape for a year where I was coached by Alvin Koh. When I was 12, I was in the SBF NYDP-COE programme under coach Jerome Tan. I got scouted by Singapore Sports School (SSP) coaches and managed to get into SSP the following year.\"\n\nThe SBF also launched the Vend Cafe, the very first fully automated cafe in a bowling centre.

Twice former champions South Korea poured forward to try and rescue the match but were unable to produce an equaliser and it will be the Qataris who face holders Australia or hosts the United Arab Emirates for a place in the final next Tuesday. The political rift between Qatar and the UAE meant the Maroons were supported by only a couple of hundred Omanis but they celebrated wildly in front of them at the final whistle. \"We've achieved something special today, this is history for us,\" said coach Felix Sanchez, whose team will go into the semi-final without having conceded a goal. \"We played a great game, the players made a huge effort and we achieved something great for our country. \"I'm the happiest coach in the world.\"\n\nBOW OUT\n\nPre-tournament favourites South Korea, who had been looking to reach the last four for a record-extending 11th time, bowed out before the semi-finals for the first time since 2004. Both teams had played their last-16 matches on Tuesday, which perhaps contributed to a forgettable first half with just one shot on target - Akram Afif's long-range effort after 32 minutes which South Korea goalkeeper Kim safely gathered. The Qataris, who started with five at the back, came out with more attacking intent in the second half but were almost immediately caught on the break with Hwang Ui Jo forcing a save out of Saad Al Sheeb. The game was opening up with chances at both ends and Son, who had looked fatigued since joining the South Korean squad for their third group game, started to impose his influence. The Tottenham Hotspur forward got a low drive on target in the 72nd minute which went straight to Saad and made a decoy run before Kim Jin Su curled the ball onto the outside of the post from a free-kick three minutes later. Just when it looked like the Koreans might be getting on top, though, the ball broke for Hatem in midfield and seconds later it was nestled in the bottom right-hand corner of the South Korean net.

Virtual network operators do not build their own physical mobile networks but lease them wholesale from existing telcos.\n\nThe report, which was released on Tuesday, said: \"We expect industry consolidation to take place in the next two to three years, with competition in a saturated market worsened by the arrival of the four low-cost mobile virtual network operators as well as TPG Telecom's commercial launch this year.\"\n\nThe rapid increase in telcos means industry turnover will keep sliding, said Moody's.\n\n\"The rapid build-up in competitive pressure in the last two years will lead to continued declines in mobile revenue in Singapore over the next 12 to 24 months, driven by compression in average revenue per user as well as a stagnant subscriber base.\"\n\nMr Sachin Mittal, head of telecommunications, media and technology at DBS Group Research, said: \"We expect mobile revenue to continue to decline (around) 5 per cent annually due to the rising adoption of SIM-only plans and consumers to benefit from lower prices.\"\n\nAnalysts The Straits Times spoke to agreed that the consolidation of telcos is a likely scenario given Singapore's limited consumer base.\n\nAssistant Professor of finance Aurobindo Ghosh from the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University said: \"With as many as seven players as the report suggests, the market size might be too small for all of them to be profitable. This might lead to severe price competition to capture market share.\n\n\"So I think in the medium to long run, for sustainability, existing players will look for strategic partnerships to cater to new demand from fintech services like digital banking services. Data analytics might also play an important role.\"\n\nBy\n\nSue-Ann Tan\n\nRead articles by Sue-Ann Tan\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

We expect negative reversions to persist for at least two more quarters, thus dragging organic growth.\n\nDowngrade to \"neutral\"; unchanged target price of $2.03.\n\nOur rating downgrade is due to the limited upside from the current price to our target price (implied 1.36 times FY19 price/net asset value multiple), and not because of a change in fundamentals.\n\nMAPLETREE COMMERCIAL TRUST I HOLD (DOWNGRADED)\n\nJAN 24 CLOSE:\n\n$1.77\n\nTARGET PRICE:\n\n$1.79\n\nOCBC Investment Research, Jan 24\n\nMapletree Commercial Trust (MCT) reported its Q3 FY19 results, which came in within our expectations.

The next general election is due by May.\n\nTo achieve such a wipeout in Uttar Pradesh, the opposition parties would have to agree to field a single candidate in each constituency, according to the poll. Congress has so far ruled that out, although even without Congress the other opposition parties would still inflict a sizeable defeat on the BJP.\n\nAn alliance of three Uttar Pradesh parties - Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Rashtriya Lok Dal - could win 58 seats without Congress, the poll showed.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

Opinion polls have a mixed record in the country, where regional issues often overshadow national concerns.\n\n\"It's a poll even before the election has been announced and before parties are actually involved in electioneering,\" BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli said. \"In any case, it is painting a rather pessimistic figure for the BJP, which we believe will not be the situation in any circumstance.\"\n\nPolitical analysts, however, say the coming together of the SP and BSP could pose a formidable challenge. - REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The buildings of the future are \"self-conscious\".\n\nSingapore's digital economy provides some of the most fertile grounds for Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to develop.\n\nFor instance, there are plans to deploy a Smart Nation Sensor Platform, which will leverage connected sensors and IoT devices to improve security and urban living.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 27, 2022, 10:46am\n\nThis is no smiley faced robot, but it should make you smile\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe network uses artificial intelligence technologies to analyse and monitor noise, water and sewage levels for better management of housing estates.\n\nHowever, reimagining how to better utilise buildings and improve occupant experience presents a variety of challenges.\n\nThese include issues such as interoperability between systems and devices, network design and communication architecture, and semantic interpretation of data.\n\nMore organisations are gravitating towards system integration as they grow more interested in energy savings and efficiency.\n\nGlobally, the top three drivers for energy investment decisions are energy cost savings, greenhouse gas footprint reduction and increasing energy security.\n\nSystems integration can improve building owners' visibility into the building performance. Indicators of ambient environment such as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), chiller systems and electrical systems, can be monitored in real-time and optimised in a timely fashion.\n\nFor instance, technology such as the intelligent building management system (BMS) \"listens\" to what a building is saying about its condition - by collecting and analysing data - and provides insights on how to improve energy efficiency.\n\nOther technology such as a building automation system connects commercial HVAC and lighting and offers extra security and protection systems for occupant safety.\n\nEvolving cyber security risks can put smart buildings at risks.\n\nAbout 75 per cent of businesses in Asia Pacific might be victims of undetected breaches and cyberthreats may have also caused local organisations to incur losses to the tune of US$17.7 billion (S$24 billion).\n\nIn addition, complex threats can compromise smart city initiatives.\n\nThe lack of qualified talent in cyber security and energy efficiency projects are obstacles.\n\nFurthermore, cyber security is not a core competency for many organisations, and it can be costly and inefficient to set up dedicated teams.\n\nJohnson Controls' surveys also showed that the lack of technical expertise to evaluate or execute projects is one of the top barriers to pursuing energy efficiency initiatives.\n\nHence, it is important that building owners consider these issues when developing next-generation smart buildings.\n\nThe writer is general manager and managing director of Building Technologies & Solutions Singapore at Johnson Controls, a provider of integrated smart green building systems, services and solutions.\n\nKEN LIM\n\nTechnology\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 22, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSafeTravel website crashes due to surge in travel pass applications\n\nNov 15, 2021, 10:00pm\n\n5.9 million customers hit by RedDoorz data breach\n\nOct 28, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAll government agencies to accept digital ICs from next week\n\nOct 5, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew cyber-security tool to protect Singaporeans' phones\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7a645f2829b916c6a295e33d01f38d86a3f65b05e6fe230684198fc6780aa248/brain_size2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "TNP ILLUSTRATION"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7ce9525ef83c2fe4e755d60c97da85a83211542e57ae32422e9cc259721a52f4/remote2707.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "This is no smiley faced robot, but it should make you smile", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But, when he slipped into gear late, he really chomped at the leaders.\n\nHis effort came a bit too late but it got him to only ½ length and a head behind the winner Black Jade and runner-up Sun Marshal. Given another 50m or so, he would have made it back-to-back at Kranji.\n\nHeliosphere has picked up tremendously from that outing and the extra 200m in tonight's Kranji Stakes C affair will suit him.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nWhen he won his debut on Dec 2, he also showed he needed more ground to be fully effective.\n\nIn that Polytrack 1,200m event, the Australian-bred hung around midfeld and then wound up steadily in the straight. He produced a nice turn of foot to get up to beat Copacabana by ¾ lengths.\n\nFor the record, Heliosphere's victory in Australia was over tonight's 1,600m journey on a heavy track. He was just as consistent back home. From four other starts, he was second once and third twice from 1,200m to 1,400m on good and wet tracks.\n\nTonight, Heliosphere is drawn well in gate 5 and jockey Daniel Moor should be able to snatch a good position and sit on the speed. The long course is an added advantage.\n\nInterestingly, Freedman, as the reigning champion trainer, has yet to saddle a winner this year. But he has fielded a strong team tonight and should break the duck, likely not only with Heliosphere but a couple others.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I'm happy to see it,\" said Lui.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nGolden Cannon sealed his third win - at start No. 34 - with a determined drive that held off Dashing Dart by a neck.\n\n\"This horse has a good fighting heart and, this season, he's taken time to get his condition but the last two runs you could see he was getting there,\" said Lui.\n\nThe night's feature, the Class 4 Hong Kong Football Club Centenary Cup Handicap over 1,200m, went to the David Ferraris-trained London Master.\n\nNeil Callan got to work on the seven-year-old with 550m to race, and, routed wide down the home straight, the Hong Kong International Sale graduate edged Travel Datuk by a head at odds of 19-1.\n\n\"He hasn't been running too badly, I was surprised he was an outsider,\" said said. \"His form has been mixed but his last run was quite good. You have to get him into his stride and then the tempo of the race determines how and where he's going to finish.\"\n\nAnother International Sale graduate hit the mark in the Class 4 Siu Sai Wan Handicap over 1,650m. The Danny Shum-trained Charity Grand landed a breakthrough win by a head under jockey Karis Teetan.\n\nMichael Chang has battled near the foot of the trainers' table in recent seasons but the handler notched his third win this month - at a strike rate of 16.6 per cent - when jockey Joao Moreira rode a calm race to make it two wins on the bounce for The Joy Of Giving. The five-year-old took the 2,200m Class 5 opener by a length from Sweet Bean.\n\nThe Brazilian bookended the card, riding a canny-stalking race on Bank On Red and then driving strongly to the wire, adjusting to keep his mount straight late in the run. The John Size-trained favourite survived an objection from Grant van Niekerk on runner-up Arcada.\n\nMusic Addition left his mark on the night with a powerful display to win the Class 3 So Kon Po Handicap over 1,200m. The Me Tsui-trained four-year-old raced close to the pace-setting Blocker Dee and when that rival felt the pressure early in the home straight, the Australian import exploded away to a three-length victory. - HKJC\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nTransform your home affordably with IKEA Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9f83f8cadd4ac14e2e090555bf624606b6a13a3f0738f7c855c3498255b42a2a/np_20190125_lui25_4576420.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Trainer Francis Lui enjoys the moment with jockey Vincent Ho.", "caption": "Trainer Francis Lui enjoys the moment with jockey Vincent Ho."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1e42f2ebaf825e27fbdd96b8eb09029f407904f0079182b89b5cf6da850cce04/IMG_0407.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "Group 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He then cruised up smoothly along the rails to be third behind two good horses, Alibi and Mister Yeoh, at the 600m mark.\n\nA big gap presented itself on straightening as the two leaders took the outer path. See took a curious peek beside and Lim's Magic took off under his own steam on seeing daylight.\n\nShaken up lightly from the 200m mark, the Lim's Stable horse lifted and lengthened nicely to win by two lengths from Mister Yeoh, the last-start Group 2 EW Barker Trophy winner. His winning time - 60.62sec for the Polytrack 1,000m, was good, considering that the other six winners clocked 61.26sec and above.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe horse showed promise early, winning two races in a row after his debut third. He progressed to the feature races and finished third in the Group 2 Stewards Cup over 1,400m and the Group 1 Emirates Singapore Derby over 1,800m.

He's the pride of Hong Kong and he's the pride of our stable.\n\n\"Anything near Winx is something special because she is the greatest mare racing on the planet, and to be ranked around her rating is remarkable.\"\n\nMoore thinks it is fair that Beauty Generation is rated the same as Able Friend because he too was very good and it's great for Hong Kong racing and the fans here that we have another horse of that stature.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Able Friend had a terrific turn-of-foot, whereas this fellow comes off a high speed and grinds the opposition,\" he said.\n\n\"If he was racing anywhere in the world, he'd be a force to be reckoned with in the top races.\"\n\nHong Kong's champion, fresh from an imperious win in the Stewards' Cup over 1,600m at Sha Tin on Sunday, earned his peak rating for an outstanding display in the December 2018 Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Mile at his home track.\n\nBeauty Generation's figure matches the rating of Able Friend, who achieved his standout mark for a brilliant win in the 2014 Longines Hong Kong Mile.\n\nHong Kong Jockey Club chief executive officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges said Beauty Generation has further improved and has established himself firmly as the joint global Champion Miler and ranks in the world's top five with his outstanding performances in 2018.\n\n\"It is especially pleasing, though, to see that this year's World's Best Racehorse Rankings list includes 25 Hong Kong-trained horses.\" he added.\n\n\"That figure is three more than we achieved in 2017, which, as we highlighted at the time, was a transitional year due to the retirements of some of our mature stars.\n\n\"It is remarkable to think that Hong Kong has a racehorse population of fewer than 1,300, and yet the best 25 account for 7.5 per centof the world's horses rated 115 and above.\n\n\"It is also pleasing that last year we saw the depth return to our elite level. The future looks bright, with Hong Kong owners choosing to invest in high quality young horses, encouraged by rewarding prize money levels.\"\n\nWinx and British hero Cracksman top the world's rankings, each having earned a rating of 130.

It was the last time he was in tune for the club.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nIf Marouane Fellaini came to represent the demise of David Moyes, then Sanchez became a symbol of Jose Mourinho's confusion and dogma.\n\nHe never utilised Sanchez properly. He never trusted him in a particular position and eventually, predictably, he gave up.\n\nThe man who came in from Chile was left out in the cold.\n\nBut Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has promised to bring Sanchez back, for one night only, in a performance that could resurrect - or pretty much end - his United career.\n\nThe opponents, inevitably, are Arsenal, where Sanchez scored 80 goals in 166 games, where he felt nothing but love until he signed for United in a swop deal with Henrikh Mkhitaryan and made that daft piano clip.\n\nThe tournament, inevitably, is the FA Cup, where Sanchez enjoyed his greatest success, scoring in the 2017 final and waltzing away with Man-of-the-Match honours.\n\nFate is a cruel mistress and Sanchez can expect boos from the hosts at the Emirates tomorrow morning (Singapore time).\n\nBut he'll be jeered from all sides if he fails for United.\n\nNo one expected his fall to be so steep in just 12 months.\n\nIn fact, the smart money was on the other guy. Mkhitaryan left Old Trafford desperately hoping to save his faltering career at Arsenal.\n\nAs expected, the Armenian joined Arsenal's long line of effete, slight and sensitive artists and has struggled ever since.\n\nBut Sanchez was going to be the sure-fire success. He was a brutish presence, the kind that Mourinho typically favoured.\n\nBut it didn't happen. The debilitating cult of Mourinho's moaning also dragged down the teak-tough character expected to lift dressing room spirits.\n\nThe smiley Sanchez at Arsenal pretty much stayed there, leaving his impressive stats behind.\n\nMOROSE AND MALIGNED\n\nThe morose, maligned 30-year-old at United has managed only 32 games, four goals and nine assists in a year, unable to earn the trust of his erratic manager.\n\nMourinho's incorrigible ego, along with his stubborn refusal to loosen United's tactical straitjacket, played a part in Sanchez's decline, but the Chilean wasn't entirely blameless either.\n\nLike Paul Pogba, he went missing in key games.\n\nMourinho often played Sanchez out of his position, denying his forward a chance to cut inside from his favoured left side, but Sanchez didn't take enough responsibility on the pitch.\n\nAt Arsenal, he delighted with his bull in a china shop antics. At United, the bull vanished.\n\nHe turned into the china, becoming fragile and static, like he was afraid he was going to break. He didn't demand possession or dominate opponents.\n\nHe didn't really do anything, leaving Mourinho with little choice but to drop a player earning a reported £505,000 (S$893,000) a week.\n\nBut Solskjaer will pander to his forward, a little, giving Sanchez his preferred role on the left, with Anthony Martial and/or Marcus Rashford expected to take a breather.\n\nUnited are involved in three cup competitions and a top-four finish now looks a distinct possibility. Rotation will be necessary in the coming weeks and Solskjaer has a degree of empathy for Sanchez.\n\nDespite his terrific scoring record, Solskjaer was often the odd man out under Sir Alex Ferguson, the third-choice striker when United played two up front.\n\nHe's not merely paying lip service to his disillusioned striker. Sanchez should get decent game time against Arsenal and beyond, as long as he delivers.\n\nThat's the obvious caveat and the fundamental difference between Sanchez and Solskjaer. Whether he was a sub or a starter, Solskjaer kept scoring. Sanchez hasn't.\n\nAnd Solskjaer was probably paid less than a tenth of Sanchez's ludicrous salary.\n\nEven if the interim coach tolerates Sanchez's mercurial form, the boardroom won't, not in a week when United were unseated as world football's biggest earners, falling behind Real Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nThe Glazers already have 505,000 reasons to offload Sanchez at the end of the season, but Solskjaer may need just one.\n\nThe FA Cup fourth round looks like a final audition for the Chilean.\n\nHit a bum note against Arsenal and it's all over for United's piano man.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/12ae3e410f903dc394dd036f12e424447ec52e4a2b6c547390e437bebe456f6e/NP_20190125_NEIL25_4577584.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Alexis Sanchez has scored just once in 14 appearances for Manchester United this season.

He knows the players, he knows the club, he knows how the club is working - which means that he's in pole position.\"\n\nFormer United caretaker boss Ryan Giggs, meanwhile, believes Solskjaer needs Champions League football and a cup run to earn the United hot seat on a permanent basis.\n\nThe Wales manager told ESPN FC: \"I think he does need a longer run, but he's making a brilliant case for it...\n\n\"He will probably have to finish in the top four and do well in the FA Cup or the Champions League.

But that's always involved in any injury,\" Leckie told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n\"I said 'I'm ready to take the risk', any chance to play in the Asian Cup I want to, and obviously then (coach Graham Arnold) had to make a decision as well whether he wanted to take the risk with the spot on a player who isn't going to play in the group stage.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Socceroos sure looked like they needed him in their opening game, a shocking 1-0 loss to Jordan.\n\nBut they followed up with victories over Palestine (3-0) and Syria (3-2) to make it to the Round of 16, where they faced Uzbekistan.\n\nWith the Uzbeks putting up a disciplined showing in defence, the Socceroos found it tough to break the deadlock. The stage was set for Leckie to make his first appearance in this year's tournament.\n\nHe came on in the 68th minute, and nearly made an immediate impact, almost scoring from distance. He also made a solo run into the box for another chance.\n\nThe plan was for Leckie to play just 30 minutes, but he managed about an hour as the match remained goalless all the way till extra time.\n\nLeckie then helped seal Australia's passage to the quarter-finals by scoring their fifth penalty to secure a 4-2 shoot-out win.\n\n\"I think I brought a bit of energy when I first came on, and on another day would have had a bit of luck and that chance I shot might have gone in,\" he told The Australian.\n\n\"Hamstring was good, I didn't feel it at any point so that was a good sign. I ended up playing 60 (minutes) which wasn't really planned.\"\n\nFIRST START\n\nLeckie is in line to make his first start in this tournament when they face hosts United Arab Emirates in the quarter-finals tonight.\n\nArnold is reportedly considering a reshuffle as he will be without midfielder Tom Rogic, who is suspended after picking up his second yellow card of the tournament against Uzbekistan.\n\nApart from Rogic, Arnold has a full squad to choose from as right-back Josh Risdon and winger Andrew Nabbout have also recovered from their injuries, just in time for the Socceroos to settle an old score.\n\nUAE coach Alberto Zaccheroni masterminded Japan's victory over Australia in the 2011 final and the Socceroos would relish putting one over the Italian tactician.\n\nUAE have not exactly lit up the tournament.\n\nThey needed an extra-time winner to see off Kyrgyzstan in the Round of 16.\n\nTonight's other quarter-final: South Korea v Qatar (8.50pm)\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

There is also the issue with injured players and their recovery, which may not align with regular training.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 8, 2022, 12:37pm\n\nI took a spinning class and ended up at a hospital's A&E clinic\n\nMore related stories\n\n\" So, it becomes tough to manage a team when players are late or they cannot attend training.\n\n\"I know that, when we are in Bangkok, some of the players will be working or studying, which is not an ideal situation as you need to focus on the games when you go for tournaments, but I guess we are used to it.\n\n\"Some things are beyond their control, like last-minute deadlines, meetings. So I have to be understanding, after all, it is their rice bowl.\n\n\"Floorball is just a passion and, at this level, it is a passion that has gone beyond its limits for these players.\"\n\nKhng, a lecturer at the Nanyang Polytechnic's School of Business Management, added that she has to balance work and coaching, and it hasn't been plain sailing for her as well.\n\nWhile her colleagues have shown support, with her superiors endorsing her leave during school term and fellow lecturers filling in for her, Khng does her part to ensure her students are not shortchanged.\n\n\"Before I go away, I ensure I do all that I can to alleviate the load on others and also prepare extra lessons for my students when I return,\" she said.\n\nFacing a similar situation is goalkeeper Fariza Begum, a physical education teacher at Yuying Secondary School.\n\nThe 29-year-old reaches school by 7am on weekdays. When there's training, she will be out till late at night as the sessions end at 10pm.\n\nShe said: \"It is challenging to stay up late and to wake up early the next day, and to be able to concentrate the whole day.\n\nPUNISHING SCHEDULE\n\n\"However, the punishing schedule has helped me prioritise my tasks and be more disciplined.\"\n\nIt isn't much easier for Siti Nurhaliza, a third-year sport and exercise science student at Republic Polytechnic.\n\n\"The final-year project (FYP) submission date is Feb 1 but, because of the qualifiers, I had to submit mine on Jan 23, the day before I flew off to Bangkok,\" said the 20-year-old.\n\n\"I want to be fully focused on the tournament when I'm there, so it meant that I had to work even harder to balance lessons with training and squeezing in time for my FYP so that I can finish by the 23rd.\"\n\nDespite the manic timetable, Khng's side were named Team of the Year (Team Sports) last year at the Singapore Sports Awards, following their exploits at the qualifiers for the 2017 WFC and their triumphant Asia-Oceania Floorball Cup campaign in June.\n\nHowever, several players have since left the national fold and Khng has had to blood in seven debutantes in a refurbished squad, but the former national captain said that there is no pressure on her and her charges.\n\n\"I've had players retire, while some have opted to discontinue competing at the highest level,\" Khng said.\n\n\"Some left due to work commitments as they feel they can no longer dedicate the extra hours while, in some cases, injuries have also played a part.\n\n\"As such, my team have evolved... I had to ensure that, while a new batch of players comes in, I still maintain the high standard that we have.\n\n\"There is a lot of synergy that needs to be built up again, but I wouldn't say there's pressure.\n\nFUN\n\n\"For me, one of the key things in playing this sport is to have fun.\n\n\"If the players don't have fun, they won't enjoy their game and could therefore feel a lot of pressure to perform which, in turn, could lead them to underperform.\"\n\nAdded Fariza: \"Blooding in younger or newer players is a normal process ...\n\n\"But we are progressing well, we have a good crop of younger talent coming through... It's going be a close fight at the qualifiers.\"\n\nEight nations will be competing in the Asia-Oceania qualifiers, with world No. 15 Singapore in Group B alongside Japan (14th), South Korea (24th) and Malaysia (26th).\n\nThe top teams from Groups A and B, as well as the two winners in the play-offs between the two groups' runners-up and third-placed teams, will qualify for the Finals.\n\nBy\n\nNarendaren Karnageran\n\nRead articles by Narendaren Karnageran\n\nOTHER SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 8, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHill wary of past final race controversies\n\nDec 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nThird time's the charm for world No. 2 paddler Sun Yingsha\n\nDec 1, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nKey figure skating event hit by Covid fears\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nEx-pro footballer among 8 teacher-coaches given awards\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

And we want to do it right, we want to do it safe for every activity, we want to do it right every time.\"\n\nAn independent Committee of Inquiry will also be convened to investigate the incident.\n\nLt-Gen Ong added that he held a safety call yesterday morning with 1,200 army commanders as well as trainers.\n\n\"I've told all my commanders that this cannot be business as usual,\" he said.\n\n\"Every serviceman is a son, is a brother, a husband or a father, and we owe it to them and their loved ones that they return home safe.\"\n\nLt-Gen Ong said a reduced tempo would not affect SAF's operational readiness because those on operations and deployments would not be involved.\n\nPang's death is the fifth reported training-related fatality in the SAF since Sept 2017, after four years of no deaths.\n\nTouching on the initial findings of the circumstances leading to Pang's death, Chief of Army Major-General Goh Si Hou explained that as the gun barrel is being lowered, its breech, or its rear, would rise inside the cabin.\n\nIf the barrel is fully upright, the lowering process usually takes about 10 seconds .\n\nIt was during this time that the rising breech trapped Pang and crushed him against the cabin wall.\n\nMaj-Gen Goh said that based on initial findings, Pang was \"unable to get out of the way\".\n\nHe added that while the space in the cabin is reduced when the gun barrel is lowered, it was \"typically sufficient\" for personnel to still be able to operate inside.\n\n\"We're very sorry at the loss of a fellow soldier, a precious son,\" he said.\n\n\"I extend again our heartfelt condolences to Aloysius' family and loved ones. We are all saddened by this incident.\"\n\nAnother technician and a gun detachment commander who were inside the cabin with Pang were not injured.\n\nCommander Combat Service and Support Command (CSSCOM) Colonel Terry Tan said there are standard operating procedures when the gun barrel is to be lowered.\n\nThe operator and technician must link up and discuss the plan, he said, before a command is given to lower the barrel.\n\nA verbal warning is then given, and the commander will visually check that the area is clear before the button to lower the barrel is pressed.\n\nCol Tan said Pang was given a refresher course before the start of Exercise Thunder Warrior, and he had been through in-camp training, five times high-key and twice low-key, and was \"qualified and competent\" to do his job.\n\nMaj-Gen Goh said investigations have not found anything that could have impeded Pang's movement during the incident.\n\nNews of Pang's injury broke on Sunday after he was admitted to Waikato Hospital in Hamilton, New Zealand.\n\nOn Monday, Mindef said he was in stable condition after two successful operations.\n\nBut he needed a third surgery on Wednesday to repair his damaged lungs, heart and kidneys, and was put on life support.\n\nHe died at 8.45pm (Singapore time) later that day.\n\nDefence Minister Ng Eng Hen posted on Facebook yesterday that a Republic of Singapore Air Force plane was on its way to New Zealand to repatriate Pang's body.\n\nEmphasising the need for safety, he said: \"We can only train when it is safe. If any SAF soldier detects an unsafe practice, he should inform his commander or stop training to protect himself or his buddies.\n\n\"No one needs to fear any disciplinary action for doing right to protect lives during training.\"\n\nBy\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\naloysius pang\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 20, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nCast honours Aloysius Pang as show goes on\n\nFeb 11, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nNg Eng Hen: No malfunction with howitzer gun-lowering mechanism\n\nJan 30, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nState Court-nominated judge to chair COI probing Pang's death\n\nJan 30, 2019, 02:43am\n\nFamily, friends, colleagues and fans bid goodbye to Aloysius Pang\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Others connected to the syndicate took the remaining amount.\n\nLooi, 21, pleaded guilty in court yesterday to one count of dealing with the benefits of criminal activities totalling more than $655,000.\n\nA second similar charge involving $500,000 will be taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nThe court was told that on Nov 7, 2017, the woman received a phone call from someone from \"Chinatown police station\" who introduced herself as Yang Hai Ping. Yang told the retiree that she was a suspect in a \"criminal case\". The victim was given a so-called case number.\n\nThe call was then transferred to a man, Lei Ping, who directed the retiree to a fake Singapore police website which the syndicate had created. Deputy Public Prosecutor Suhas Malhotra said that when the woman keyed in her \"case number\" on the fake website, she saw a \"warrant\" for her arrest on suspicion of money laundering.\n\nLei Ping then told the retiree that her case would be handled by a \"chief police officer\" known as Chen Kan.\n\nShe later received a phone call from Chen Kan, who told her that the investigation would last seven days and that she would eventually be given documents to sign stating that she was \"not guilty\".

I agreed.\"\n\n\"She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date.

More than 30 go-karts will zip along a 270m route - or more than one-third of the procession route - at 100km per hour.\n\nThe contingent is made up of riders from 15 countries such as Singapore, Thailand and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe karts will accompany a 24m-long float - the longest float at this year's parade - that will house a life-size replica of a Formula car and 16 national athletes.\n\nSHABANA BEGUM\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3cad8ecf76fdb30eb1d5ad9d6bf2c547104d1f9a0c3a3f4f417c93e771f8281c/NP_20190125_SBCHINGAY25_4577444.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "One of the Chingay parade's highlights is the karting contingent from KFI Karting Circuit.

It will \"allow LTA to prohibit all operators from having driver exclusivity arrangements\".\n\nThe Straits Times understands the Public Transport Council will eventually see that both taxi and private-hire companies adhere to the new regulations.\n\nThe LTA is seeking public feedback on the proposed changes. Those who wish to have their say can do so via http://bit.ly/PCDP2P, or they can send an e-mail top2p_consultation@lta.gov.sg by Feb 21.\n\nIndustry players have long highlighted the stark differences between taxis and private-hire operators such as Grab and Gojek.\n\nThese include differences pertaining to the driver's age, controlled fleet sizes, a passenger's legal recourse in the case of accidents, prescribed service standards and fares.\n\nSingapore University of Social Sciences transport economist Walter Theseira said to ensure new rules are adhered to, the authorities need \"a much tighter hand... on data and operations from the market players\".\n\nFor instance, no one except Grab knows how many rides the company caters to a day.\n\nCHRISTOPHER TAN, SENIOR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT\n\nTransport\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 8, 2024, 11:30pm\n\nSBS Transit equips 53 buses with AEDs to boost community first response\n\nMay 31, 2024, 06:11am\n\nSMRT to extend selected train and bus services on eve of Hari Raya Haji\n\nDec 10, 2023, 04:25am\n\nCab operator Strides Premier launches spruced-up fleet, some taxis offer free Wi-Fi\n\nOct 10, 2023, 06:54am\n\nWork starts on Cross Island MRT Line Punggol extension\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Even the wines come from grapes grown in black or white soil.\n\nYou don't even get much of a choice too, because Preludio only serves set menus.\n\nFor lunch, it is $55 for four courses and you choose a main, or you can leave your meal to the kitchen for $98 (seven courses). Dinner is either six ($168) or eight ($218) courses.\n\nFor both lunch and dinner, you can opt for wine pairing too.\n\nBut whatever colours that may be lacking on the plate, it is there in the food. Executive chef Fernando Arevalo seems to favour acidity, and flavours are bold and buoyant because of that.\n\nThe prime example is Peek A Boo.\n\nThe food is hidden under a cap of deep fried dehydrated rice. But once you crack open that shell, the colours emerge.\n\nThe medley of ingredients include smoked eel, roasted girolle mushrooms and French root vegetables, with the winning touch of an egg yolk emulsion made with mustard and yuzu.\n\nThe mix of textures and flavours is stunning.\n\nEqually impressive is the Pata Negra, a dish made out of Iberico pork shoulder with a white carrot and apple puree, and charred grape tomato.\n\nThe darkness in its appearance hints at the smouldering taste. The pork is spiced with cumin, cayenne and paprika, and induces a comforting warmth as it goes down the throat.\n\nIt is probably the sexiest dish from Preludio.\n\nWhile La Cortina feels more homely than sexy, the agnolotti (similar to small ravioli) is by no means a wallflower.\n\nPart of the appeal is the precious 25-year-old balsamic vinegar lovingly drizzled over the dish. The filling of butternut squash and the parmesan sauce help too.\n\nThe acidity of the White Opal hit me hard on first bite.\n\nThe Patagonian toothfish is vacuumed in a brine of clear tom yum broth and briefly sous vide, after which it is coated with a layer of dehydrated kalamata olives.\n\nThen there is a small pile of almonds pickled with white wine vinegar and Champagne vinegar.\n\nAll that contributes to that shockingly pleasant first bite. The brightness can draw a mixed reaction, but I'm all for it.\n\nNow, a grey dessert is not appealing. And when the Irezumi came by, I felt it was more artistic than palatable.\n\nBut the black sesame and sea salt ice cream is smooth, dense yet not cloying, balanced by the lime zest that also contains sesame and marinated strawberries. It is such a nice way to end the meal.\n\nPreludio\n\nFrasers Tower #03-01/02 Tel: 6904-5686 Weekdays 11.30am to 2.30pm, 6pm to 10.30pm; Saturdays 6pm to 10.30pm\n\nBy\n\nYeoh Wee Teck\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Yeoh Wee Teck\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The best part is that it comes in a four-tier tingkat adorned with the restaurant's signature lantern motifs.\n\nIt makes for a lovely gift, and you can reuse the tingkat after the festivities.\n\nHead for any Blue Lotus restaurant (Quayside Isle, Tanjong Pagar Centre, Novotel Singapore on Stevens and 991B Alexandra Road) to order.\n\nBy\n\nYeoh Wee Teck\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Yeoh Wee Teck\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1e2bfa503cb0f56ed7f761163c3191943979c5b9c21e345c9fabf2afddf84866/NP_20190124_CNYOLDCHAMGKEE_4573134.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Old Chang Kee", "caption": "Old Chang Kee"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/92ab37692518737f26ffb6fe2c2e0dcbf9e826cb66385c4c7539f739caf65be5/NP_20190124_CNYLADYIRON_4573132.jpg?w=524", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6ab2562ab7655a4b859926f39bff44add851b9f3693adff50cb3e0431a9999e8/NP_20190124_CNYPERANAKAN_4573135.jpg?w=523", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3d54ec20c4686af25c8973ec29154b26530cf3f7ec2658087b1f2a4589e4ebc6/NP_20190124_CNYSPRMRKT_4573138.jpg?w=1180", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fd2c92f1e2d575ad85263839e00df0981a14d9818a4842bed3a47db0554c70d1/NP_20190124_CNYWHISK_4573140.jpg?w=639", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e9308cd4ebf453fd6004797a6ed7963b0faafde57d598954697880bb3d7a4452/NP_20190124_CNYSWEET_4573143.jpg?w=1107", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/43f87e24ca0b448a0ded9b10ec1e17e331c99ce88472f3e8c1a5cb861243c1e0/NP_20190124_CNYVIOLET_4573153.jpg?w=1244", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a51280f9fb13902deaafbc7c65e6e80e9e4058376e3cbe61289cc645ac4bb4a7/NP_20190124_CNYDELI_4573144.jpg?w=590", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5f70e541855900460ad05de4e9efb999b2c7932e6a7c6a8771cf772652c18360/NP_20190124_CNYCOLD_4573142.jpg?w=1178", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5753c6ba5889b241db82cfb756aa093d0525f562095faf897a6f0be97262a3f2/NP_20190124_CNYBLUELOTUS_4573151.jpg?w=922", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It rose to 1.9 per cent year-on-year, up from 1.7 per cent in November last year, mainly owing to bigger increases in costs of services and retail items.\n\nBoth figures are slightly higher than expected, with a Bloomberg poll of analysts tipping overall inflation to be 0.3 per cent and core inflation at 1.8 per cent.\n\nBut for the whole of last year, overall consumer prices rose 0.4 per cent - lower than the 0.6 per cent rise in 2017.\n\nCore inflation for the year went up to 1.7 per cent, from 1.5 per cent in the previous year.\n\nFor this year, MAS and MTI expect core inflation to be in the forecast range of 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent.\n\nAs for headline inflation, they expect it to pick up to 1 per cent to 2 per cent, as the overall drag from accommodation and private road transport costs lessens.\n\nLast month, costs in most sectors rose except for private road transport, which fell 3.7 per cent, and accommodation costs, which slipped 1.9 per cent - moderating from a 2.1 per cent decline in November, owing to a more gradual decline in home rentals.\n\nServices inflation went up to 1.5 per cent, up from 1.2 per cent in November owing to a stronger pick-up in holiday expenses and airfares.\n\nAnother contributing factor was a smaller decline in telecommunication services fees.\n\nThe overall cost of retail items rose 1.7 per cent last month as well, mainly because of bigger increases in the prices of clothing and footwear, as well as household durables.\n\nThe cost of electricity and gas rose by 14.6 per cent year on year, lower than the 15.4 per cent rise in November, owing to the phased launch of the Open Electricity Market.\n\nMeanwhile, food inflation remained at 1.4 per cent last month, unchanged from the previous two months. The reason - price rises for non-cooked food items and prepared meals stayed broadly the same.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank economist Barnabas Gan called the components contributing to the stronger inflation climate last month \"expectedly familiar\", with housing and utilities costs steepening for the eighth consecutive month and education seeing its fastest growth figure since June 2017.\n\nSEOW BEI YI, BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f40446be49913585b1c113f35f1ed6e5ef5647f55acf54e4d205c198da01487a/NP_20190124_BYCPI24_4574183.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "There was higher inflation for retail items last month.

This is not just a transfer of two people.\n\n\"When HQs move, so does the intellectual property. Betrayal of the public who put their faith in him as a British business advocating a No Deal Brexit.\"\n\nWhile some urged Britain to boycott the company's products, others said that Mr Dyson should give back his knighthood or it should be rescinded.\n\n\"Does anyone else feel like they've been mugged off, or is it just me? There was #Dyson making out that #Brexit would be great, next thing we know he mumbles about 'future-proofing' his business, & scuttles off. Let's hope #British consumers have long memories, Mr Dyson,\" wrote @riceytravels.\n\nDespite the majority of voices on social media attacking the decision to relocate, there was some support for the company.\n\n\"Dyson hasn't 'deserted' Britain... two senior executives are moving to Singapore and there's no impact on UK production or research and development,\" wrote Twitter user @darrengrimes_.\n\nMr Dyson recently became Britain's richest person, with a worth of $13.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world's 500 richest people.

In 2017, Japan's big three shipping lines announced that their new joint venture, Ocean Network Express, would house its global headquarters in Singapore.\n\nMr David Leong, managing director of human resource firm PeopleWorldwide Consulting, hopes an \"indirect employment effect\" will ripple through supporting industries for Dyson's manufacturing and operations here - such as that of its upcoming electric car plant.\n\nIt plans to set up the plant by next year and launch its first model by 2021.\n\nMaybank Kim Eng senior economist Chua Hak Bin, however, said Dyson's move alone is unlikely to have a significant impact on Singapore's economy, although it is \"symbolic\" as it shows the Republic remains attractive to global brands despite competition from others like Hong Kong.\n\nCIMB economist Song Seng Wun pointed to Singapore's free trade agreements with countries such as the US as a reason why companies set up base here.\n\nThe Republic's FTA with the European Union is pending approval, he added.\n\n\"Even though it may not be the cheapest place to do business, its infrastructure, political stability... is important in a world of rising protectionism and policy flip-flops,\" he said.\n\nFOR MORE, READ THE STRAITS TIMES TODAY\n\nSEOW BEI YI\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/828858a1784f65c3d9b2ab8960e0fb673dfd9bfb4a247f69524ee134e99f5113/np_20190124_dyson24evfw_4574334.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Dyson is known for its bladeless fans and bagless vacuum cleaners.

Korea protest against vaccine pass rule for kids\n\nMore related stories\n\nIf the wall were ever to begin to get built, it would create problems beyond pushing away the swing voters he needs to be competitive when he runs for reelection in 2020.\n\nFirst, most experts on immigration agree that the wall will not solve any of the problems cited by Mr Trump.\n\nThe number of undocumented workers has been declining in recent years; most narcotics are brought into the US either at existing checkpoints or through other ports of entry; very few terrorists have come across the border illegally since the September 11 attacks, and, contrary to Mr Trump's assertions, people making illegal crossings are not disproportionally criminal elements.\n\nSecond, the wall will be extremely expensive.\n\nMr Trump is currently asking for about US$5.7 billion (S$7.7b) to begin construction on the wall, but if the wall were ever to be completed the final price would likely be much higher.\n\nFive, 10 or even US$20 billion for a government expenditure that helped address a real problem, like climate change, the opioid crisis or health care would be a much wiser use of resources.\n\nA third point is that the wall will probably never be finished.\n\nIf Mr Trump is not re-elected, stopping construction on the wall will be one of the first actions by any Democratic president.\n\nEven if he wins a second term, Democrats will have future opportunities to cut the funding because public support for the wall has never been strong.\n\nThe fourth problem is: Who will build the wall?\n\nDefence contractors will bid for it. The firms that will be interested in this unusual, but extremely lucrative project will have to do whatever they can to keep bidding costs low.\n\nWhoever gets the project will have to hire not only skilled and well-compensated workers, but also lower-paid and less-skilled workers.\n\nAnybody who has studied the data or spent time on building sites in the US over the last few decades knows that the construction industry relies heavily on undocumented immigrant workers - many from Mexico.\n\nIf the winning bidder goes down this route, the political fallout is not likely to drive up the president's poll numbers.\n\nThe Democrats have provided little indication that they will give Mr Trump his wall, but they could score a strategic win if they wrestle generous policy concessions from him in exchange for a compromise.\n\nGetting, for example, a real path to citizenship for Dreamers - not the temporary protections he offered - in exchange for a wall that seems impossible to build and will ultimately be an embarrassment for Mr Trump, would not be a bad outcome for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIronically, congressional Democrats' unwillingness to give in to the president may be what spares him this humiliation. - REUTERS\n\nThe writer is a scholar based in New York and San Francisco.\n\nLINCOLN MITCHELL\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2483d7acca2c963171b3516bf0c10580864d59ad049551c8feac4b4b879927be/NP_20211210_PROTEST10_7055858.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Parents' groups in S.

It lost radar contact at 701m, Guernsey police said.\n\nTwo planes scoured an area north-west of the Channel Island of Alderney where unidentified debris was earlier spotted, but rescuers said chances of finding Cardiff City-bound Sala or the pilot alive were fading fast.\n\n\"We're up there looking for stuff that we don't expect to find,\" John Fitzgerald, chief officer of the Channel Islands Air Search, told Reuters.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"If there was anything on the surface, I think we would have found it on the first night because the weather conditions were really good...\n\n\"There's no chance. You'd have to be really, really fit to survive even four or five hours in the (barely 10 deg C) water.\"\n\nGuernsey Police, meanwhile, said they are basing their search on four possibilities: \"They have landed elsewhere but not made contact; they landed on water, have been picked up by a passing ship but not made contact; they landed on water and made it into the life raft we know was on board; or the aircraft broke up on contact with the water, leaving them in the sea.\"\n\nThey added that the \"search area is prioritised on the life raft option\".\n\nIn a chilling voice message sent to friends, which Argentina's Clarin newspaper said was authenticated by Sala's father, Horacio, the player expressed concerns about the single-engine Piper Malibu aircraft he was flying in.\n\nIn audio messages, he is reported to have said: \"I'm here on a plane that looks like it's about to fall apart, and I'm going to Cardiff, crazy...\n\n\"If you do not have any more news from in an hour and a half, I don't know if they need to send someone to find me... I am getting scared!\"\n\nBritish media reported that Cardiff City chairman Mehmet Dalman said that Sala rejected the offer of a commercial flight from the club, instead choosing to travel on a private plane chartered by the family of a high-profile football agent.\n\nSaid Dalman: \"I can say to you categorically that the plane had nothing to do with Cardiff City.\n\n\"We were not involved in booking the plane. In fact, we are trying to ascertain ourselves exactly what did happen.\"\n\nBLACK BOX\n\nWhat happened might remain a mystery, with The Independent reporting that the plane is \"unlikely\" to have been fitted with a black box, as it was not mandatory for light aircraft such as the one carrying Sala.\n\nBlack boxes record flight data and cockpit audio and are usually key for crash investigators.\n\nThe newspaper quoted a spokesman from the United Kingdom's aviation regulator.\n\nCardiff City supporters laid tributes outside their Cardiff City Stadium to a player they barely knew but had built high hopes around.\n\nIn Nantes, fans laid rows of yellow flowers and held club scarves aloft in the city centre.\n\nSaid former Nantes manager Claudio Ranieri, on his current club Fulham's website: \"Emiliano is a wonderful character.\n\n\"He's a fantastic footballer who always gave his best when we worked together in France.\n\n\"Knowing him as a person, he's a fighter.\"\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b6a694725fdd5b89b91d744c0153576676532a1751f68848207879787566632a/NP_20190124_SOC24C_4574319.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Cardiff fans lay tributes for missing striker Emiliano Sala outside the Cardiff City Stadium.

These can be exchanged for food and shopping vouchers.\n\nFive months in, the study has thrown up some intriguing preliminary findings.\n\nFor example, researchers found that of the least active participants who averaged a daily step count of 6,100, more of them were underweight (15 per cent) than overweight (12 per cent) or obese (7 per cent).\n\nMeanwhile, the exercise enthusiasts who averaged 13,500 steps a day had the biggest proportion of overweight (26 per cent) and obese (14 per cent) participants.\n\nThe HPB said that reasons for overweight participants exercising a lot could be that they are simply more muscular or are trying to lose weight.\n\nResearchers are hoping to gather more data and broaden it to topics like mental health.\n\nFELICIA CHOO\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The court heard that Mr Ng cannot read, write or understand English.\n\nYap, a married man, also duped a woman from Hong Kong into thinking he was single and she became his girlfriend.\n\nThe court heard the Singaporean father of three later cheated Hong Konger Betty Pui Tai, 38, of more than HK$100,000 (S$17,000).\n\nYesterday, Yap, 38, pleaded guilty to four cheating charges and one count of forgery.\n\nMr Ng told Yap in 2011 he wanted to invest his savings. Yap, facing financial difficulties, hatched a plan to misappropriate Mr Ng's money.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Kenneth Chin said Yap asked Mr Ng to sign application forms for a UOB current account and a Visa debit card and did not tell Mr Ng what the forms were for.\n\nSaid the DPP: \"Although Ng did not understand the forms, he signed as he was asked to.\"\n\nThe court heard Yap wrote his own address on the forms.\n\nMonies linked to Mr Ng's investment were later credited to the current account. Between Oct 3 that year and March 20, 2012, Yap misappropriated more than $200,000 from the account by using the debit card.\n\nMr Ng lodged a police report in 2016. UOB paid him more than $200,000 as a settlement.\n\nYap eventually repaid the bank. DPP Chin said Yap got the money from Ms Pui. Their relationship ended after she discovered his true marital status.\n\nYap is expected to be sentenced on March 14.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/38e028e09a8c33c5d5e95205d20c966eb957e1daab8f1fe9853c6790eef31ffa/np_20190124_sqyap24_4574064.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Yap Bin Chun.

Visitors can scan their faces using smartphones to check in ahead of time. Lifts scan guests' faces again to verify which floor they can access and room doors are opened with another face scan.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 13, 2025, 05:01am\n\nLocksmith under fire for charging elderly woman $80 despite cancelled service\n\n62\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn the rooms, Alibaba's voice command technology is used to change temperature, draw curtains, adjust lighting and order room service.\n\nAt the hotel's restaurant, capsule-shaped robots deliver food ordered via the FlyZoo app, while at the bar, a large robotic arm mixes more than 20 different types of cocktails.\n\nFacial recognition cameras add additional charges to the room automatically. To check out, guests press a button on the app, after which the room locks and they are automatically charged through Alibaba's online wallet.\n\nOnce done, guests' facial scan data is erased from Alibaba's systems, said Mr Wang. Room fees start from 1,390 yuan (S$278) a night.\n\nThe hotel employs humans, though Alibaba declined to specify how many.

He was 28.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said in a press statement last night that the operationally-ready national serviceman died at 8.45pm (Singapore time) in Waikato Hospital in Hamilton, about 125km south of Auckland.\n\nCorporal First Class (NS) Pang was carrying out repair works inside a Singapore Self-Propelled Howitzer with two other Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel when he was injured when the gun barrel was lowered, Mindef added.\n\nIn the statement issued at about 11.30pm, Mindef said: \"Despite surgical attempts to repair damaged organs and putting him on artificial life support, CFC (NS) Pang succumbed to the injuries and passed away.\"\n\nAn independent Committee of Inquiry will be convened to investigate the circumstances leading to the incident, Mindef said. Chief of Defence Force, Lieutenant-General Melvyn Ong, will chair a press conference today to present the preliminary findings.\n\nThe SAF will be making arrangements to bring Pang's body back to Singapore.\n\n\"The Ministry of Defence and the SAF extend their deepest condolences to the family of CFC (NS) Pang and will continue to render assistance and support in their time of loss,\" said Mindef.\n\nPang, an armament technician from the 268th Battalion Singapore Artillery, was taking part in an annual live-firing exercise called Thunder Warrior at Waiouru Training Area, New Zealand.\n\nHe was on reservist duty.\n\nIn a Facebook post around 3pm yesterday, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said Pang's condition was \"very serious\" and he had been put on artificial life support.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday morning, Mindef said that Pang was in critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital.\n\nHe had undergone abdominal surgery on Saturday evening, followed by a planned follow-up operation on Monday, after which his condition was reported as stable.\n\nBut Pang required a third surgery, which was completed on Tuesday just before midnight, after his condition worsened, Mindef said yesterday.\n\nAfter Pang's death, his brother posted on Pang's Instagram account that the past few days had been a difficult time for the family.\n\nHe said: \"Every news that were brought upon us since his last operation was devastating with little signs of hope on his recovery.\n\n\"We all broke down when the medical team spoke to us that his condition is worsening and we should be prepared for the worst.\"\n\n\"We're going to lose a brother. And my parents are going to lose their precious son who is only 28. Thus I seek everybody's kind understanding that we are unable to comment further.\"\n\nActress Jayley Woo posted in Chinese on her Instagram yesterday: \"In this life, I did not have the fortune to be your wife. In our next life, we will definitely be husband and wife.\n\n\"I really love you very much. Thank you for taking care of me for these past few years.\n\n\"I will always love you, rest in peace. Also, I will never forgive you for the rest of my life.\"\n\nActress Jayley Woo posted an emotional farewell on Instagram (above).

Please cherish all that we have, every breath should not be taken for granted.\"\n\nAnother actress, Kimberly Chia, said in an Instagram post: \"I don't believe this, why do you have to go? You are like my big brother, always there when I need you...I'm going to miss you so much.\"\n\nDescribing Pang's death as a devastating loss, Mediacorp said in a statement that he was loved by the people who worked with him and was extremely popular with his fans.\n\n\"He was a highly capable actor who had grown in skill and versatility but remained humble, diligent and ever willing to help others.\n\n\"He will always be remembered for his good-heartedness, his sincere, unaffected earnestness and his professionalism.

Iswaran.\n\nTNP FILE PHOTO\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 23, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nSingapore releases framework on ethical use of AI\n\nFramework released by Minister S. Iswaran at World Economic Forum is first in Asia to provide guidance on using AI\n\nShare this article\n\nSingapore has released a framework on how artificial intelligence (AI) can be ethically and responsibly used, which businesses in the Republic and elsewhere can adopt as they grapple with issues that have emerged with new technology.\n\nThis model framework for AI governance is a \"living document\" intended to evolve along with the fast-paced changes in a digital economy.\n\nIt takes in feedback from the industry, and will be tweaked when it gets more views.\n\nThe framework was released by Mr S. Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information, at a World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting.\n\nIt is the first in Asia to provide detailed and readily implementable guidance to private-sector organisations using AI, said the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 27, 2022, 10:46am\n\nThis is no smiley faced robot, but it should make you smile\n\nMore related stories\n\nAI is, in essence, computer programs or machines that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. They include technology such as speech recognition and decision making.\n\nBut questions have been raised about the rapid rise of AI, including what if control and data fall into the wrong hands.\n\nIMDA said two principles underpin Singapore's framework.\n\nOne is that decisions made by or with the help of AI are explainable, transparent and fair to consumers. The second is that AI solutions are human-centric.\n\nMr Iswaran, who spoke to reporters on Tuesday on the sidelines of the WEF, described AI as frontier technology that has the potential to affect many sectors in very profound ways.\n\nSingapore, he said, wants to be prepared in terms of its capabilities, technology investments and regulations.\n\nOn this front, the Republic has been working on several AI initiatives, including an Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data chaired by former attorney-general V. K. Rajah.\n\nMr Iswaran said the framework was being released at the WEF because it is a forum of global industry and government leaders, and a place where Singapore has always had \"a certain mindshare\" in terms of contributing to cutting-edge development and governance of policies.\n\nIt also allows Singapore to invite global feedback on the framework.\n\nAs for whether an AI governance model would deter companies from setting up shop in Singapore, Mr Iswaran stressed that it is not a set of prescriptive rules but a framework for companies to use.\n\nHe did not think the industry would be deterred.\n\n\"On the contrary, we might even be able to come out as one of the jurisdictions with sound approaches to data management and the governance of AI and other frontier technologies. In this case, more companies would want to be associated with us.\"\n\nFOR MORE, READ THE STRAITS TIMES TODAY\n\nSUMIKO TAN, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, IN DAVOS\n\nTechnology\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 22, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSafeTravel website crashes due to surge in travel pass applications\n\nNov 15, 2021, 10:00pm\n\n5.9 million customers hit by RedDoorz data breach\n\nOct 28, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAll government agencies to accept digital ICs from next week\n\nOct 5, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew cyber-security tool to protect Singaporeans' phones\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5ecbfb348331783245cc36d3fd95e12311089e76024685f4f17c02f684d9ed10/NP_20190124_STAI24_4574038.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Minister for Communications and Information S.

Especially now that I won a Grand Slam, I feel like I want to win another one.

She is the first Japanese woman in the final four at Melbourne Park since Kimiko Date in 1994.\n\nSvitolina received treatment for a neck and shoulder injury in the second set and looked a shadow of the player that won the WTA Finals in Singapore last October.\n\nMeanwhile, Williams denied choking after falling victim to one of the greatest comebacks yesterday, saying she was powerless as Czech foe Karolina Pliskova \"just went crazy\" to storm into the semi-finals.\n\nWilliams, 37, had Pliskova on the rack serving at 5-1 in the third set, but the seventh seed fended off four match-points to bounce back and end the American's latest bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam.\n\n\"I can't say that I choked on those match-points,\" said Williams. \"She literally played her best tennis ever on those shots.\"\n\nAn exhausted Pliskova said after the 2hr 10min epic: \"My mind was in the locker room. I wasn't playing very well in the third set but I thought let's try, this game (will make it) 5-2. She got a little bit shaky in the end so I took my chances and I won.\"\n\nOn meeting Osaka next, Pliskova said: \"She's dangerous but nobody is more dangerous than Serena.\" - AFP\n\nTennis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 02:25am\n\nChinese tennis player Peng Shuai denies making accusation of sexual assault\n\nFeb 4, 2022, 08:01am\n\nBarca official resigns after calling Spanish tennis star Nadal an 'enemy of the state'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

There were some classy numbers in the line-up. Mr Clint who, just on Monday night took the honours for Best Three-Year-old of 2018 was there. Also in the line-up was multiple winner Countofmontecristo, and we all know just how good he is.\n\nStanding with them was Blizzard, a seven-year-old former Hong Kong-based star galloper - but certainly one to watch. And tossed into that mix was that fleet-footed mare from Lee Freedman's yard, Turf Princess.\n\nElite Invincible, ridden by Benny Woodworth, had drawn gate 2 and, while he jumped with the rest, he was quickly snared back and kept out of the speed battle up front.\n\nBlizzard, ridden by Daniel Moor, and Turf Princess, the mount of Ben Thompson, set a fast tempo at the head of the pack. Then came Glen Boss on Countofmontecristo and the ever-reliable Mr Clint.\n\nThat was the order when they negotiated the 600m mark. Where was the Horse Of The Year?\n\nWell, he was content to stay fifth of seven.\n\nInto the stretch and Boss took \"The Count\" to the front. Blizzard stuck with him like a good horse while Turf Princess began to give ground. As for Elite Invincible, Woodworth had peeled him to the outside where he seemed ready to fashion a run.\n\nFor a while, it brought him close to the lead - but he never looked like he was hungry for a win.\n\nThe momentum was with \"The Count\", who went on to beat Blizzard by a length and a quarter.

Like the Joker, he wants to watch the world burn.\n\nThat's Maurizio Sarri and Mauricio Pochettino's world, the world that Mourinho is no longer a part of.\n\nLEAGUE CUP SEMI-FINAL, 2ND LEG\n\nCHELSEA\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nTOTTENHAM\n\nSpurs lead 1-0 after first leg\n\nIn an interview last week, the sacked manager reminded his former rivals why their League Cup semi-final has become so critical.\n\nSarri has just savaged his Chelsea players, questioning their temperament and their commitment to the club.\n\nMourinho did something similar at Chelsea. Twice.\n\nSo he was fired. Twice.\n\nAnd he had trophies in the Chelsea cabinet. Sarri has nothing.\n\nMeanwhile, Pochettino has challenged his Tottenham boardroom, pointing out his squad deficiencies and an injury list stretched to breaking point.\n\nHe has called for greater financial backing.\n\nMourinho did something at Manchester United. And he was fired, despite having trophies in the Old Trafford cabinet.\n\nPochettino has nothing, a statistical itch that Mourinho was only too happy to scratch last weekend.\n\nWhatever the financial limitations, there really is only so long a \"big club\" coach can stay without winning silverware.\n\nPochettino may say otherwise, but he knows that finishing in the top four doesn't get the monkey off his back.\n\nBeating Chelsea in the semi-final and winning the League Cup quietens dissenting voices.\n\nA cup win proves that the Argentinian really might be the Second Coming of Old Trafford.\n\nIf he can collect silverware with an attractive playing style, a small squad and a limited budget, imagine what he'd do with the Manchester United piggybank. A League Cup victory makes a fitting swansong.\n\nBut a League Cup defeat also makes for a convenient exit strategy.\n\nPochettino may insist he can take cash-strapped Tottenham no further. The aesthete will seek a bigger canvas elsewhere.\n\nMEAGRE RESOURCES\n\nHe only needs to look to his forward line to be reminded of his meagre resources.\n\nWith Dele Alli and Harry Kane injured and Son Heung Min on international duty, Tottenham resemble a pub team in the penalty box.\n\nPochettino has a one-goal advantage from the first leg. But he also has Fernando Llorente. One almost cancels the other out.\n\nThe Spanish striker, who had a futile outing against Fulham, is the physical embodiment of Pochettino's cyclical problems at Tottenham.\n\nHe'll never have enough players to genuinely compete.\n\nFor entirely different reasons, Jorginho has come to represent Sarri's current problems.\n\nThe midfielder is a measure of his manager's stubbornness.\n\nSarri won't drop his old boy from Napoli, which is not surprising considering the coach wouldn't join Chelsea without assurances that the club would sign Jorginho and allow Sarri-ball to take shape.\n\nBut it's not really happening.\n\nJorginho has made more than 2,000 passes without creating a single assist, but he hasn't been dropped, nor the system changed.\n\nIn fact, Chelsea's most reliable footballers have been shunted into less popular positions to accommodate Jorginho's pivotal role in central midfield.\n\nN'Golo Kante has been pulled out to the right and Eden Hazard has been pulled in from the left to play as a false No.9.\n\nJorginho isn't entirely at fault. He has created chances, but the Blues lack a reliable centre forward.\n\nAnd yet, the Chelsea manager has persevered with Jorginho in a deeper role, serving the possession-based Sarri-ball that worked well in Serie A, but looks pedestrian in the frenetic EPL.\n\nIn response to their defeat by Arsenal, Sarri blamed his timid performers rather than his tactics. It was certainly a defiant display. Neither Mourinho nor Antonio Conte survived at Chelsea with such a confrontational approach.\n\nFour EPL defeats already leave the Blues looking jittery in fourth place. The sluggish Sarri-ball and the tactical side-lining of the popular Kante haven't gone down with the restless natives either.\n\nA League Cup exit at the Bridge will almost certainly trigger the first boos of the Sarri era.\n\nHe needs time to build. Pochettino needs to boost a flagging brand. And nothing buys time and preserves reputations like a day trip to a cup final.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Previously, a team of 12 would contest five-a-side games on a full court in four 10-minute periods.\n\nAll three teams earn points for the school, towards a final ranking in the group stages or a result in the knockout stages.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 8, 2022, 12:37pm\n\nI took a spinning class and ended up at a hospital's A&E clinic\n\nMore related stories\n\nSaid 10-year-old Krupa, a Primary 5 pupil, of these changes: \"It's better because you have more opportunities and more space, so you can play better. Everyone has a chance to play and they won't think they are bad just because they don't get chosen to play.\"\n\nAlso, in track and field, athletes will no longer compete in specialised events such as the 100m.\n\nThey will instead take part in a multi-event competition, where they each have to run, hurdle and throw in the same race.\n\nParticipants get achievement pins based on how far they throw and how fast they run, for example, instead of their final race positions.\n\nFormer Singapore sprinter and two-time Olympian C. Kunalan lauded this change, saying: \"It makes sense; at that age, running 100m or 200m or 300m is crazy. If you are training for these events at such a young age, I feel that after some time you'll get fed up.\n\n\"Of course there will be a couple of young ones who won't mind doing this forever because they're just born like this. But how many 'born-like-this' kids do we have?\n\n\"We don't want to lose any of the kids too early. This kind of thing will keep the fun element there and they won't get too injured too early or (suffer) psychological burnout.\"\n\nAll 21 sports in the junior division would have underwent the changes by 2021. The process started last year in three sports - golf, rugby and sailing.\n\nThis follows the review, which started in 2015 and was completed last year, of the NSG competitions.\n\nSaid Tan Chen Kee, MOE's divisional director of its student development curriculum division: \"The review was started because first we wanted to look at our students' initial encounter with sports and how we can strengthen that - how we can make it a lot more enjoyable, less competitive and how can we adopt a long-term athlete-development view of things and... help the children slowly ease into the competition and the sports.\"\n\nSenior Minister of State for Education Chee Hong Tat added: \"These enhancements will enable our young athletes to enjoy their sporting experiences, have more opportunities to participate in competitions, and develop character and value through sports.\"\n\nSTRUCTURAL CHANGES\n\nAWARD AND RECOGNITION SYSTEMS (INDIVIDUAL EVENTS)\n\nTop eight performers, instead of the four best, in individual events will be recognised where applicable.\n\nCriterion-based recognition, such as timings for track and field and the number of pinfalls in tenpin bowling, will be introduced in relevant sports.\n\nCOMPETITION FORMATS (MATCH-BASED SPORTS)\n\nTeams will play a classification round followed by a tiered round, where they will compete against teams of similar abilities. This allows weaker teams to double the number of matches they play under the current format.\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES\n\nGAME FORMATS\n\nSports like basketball and floorball will become smaller-sided games played on a smaller court. This allows players to have more touches of the ball.\n\nSPORTING EQUIPMENT\n\nAge-appropriate equipment will be used in sports such as tennis so that student-athletes can grasp the proper playing techniques\n\nSUBSTITUTION RULES (MATCH-BASED SPORTS)\n\nTo create more opportunities for more players in match-based sports, most, if not all, substitutes must play at some point in the match.\n\nBy\n\nNicole Chia\n\nRead articles by Nicole Chia\n\nOTHER SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 8, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHill wary of past final race controversies\n\nDec 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nThird time's the charm for world No. 2 paddler Sun Yingsha\n\nDec 1, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nKey figure skating event hit by Covid fears\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nEx-pro footballer among 8 teacher-coaches given awards\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

After the game, I feel tired of course, but still I try to recover as quickly as possible and play again. In three days, I can recover.\n\n\"It's the same when I'm playing with Tottenham as well. I have to recover as quick as possible and look forward to play.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nSouth Korea coach Paulo Bento has voiced concerns over the condition of his captain, who is leading South Korea's charge for a first Asian Cup title in 59 years.\n\nBefore arriving in the United Arab Emirates, Son, 26, played in 12 matches in a little over a month for Spurs, who have lost both Harry Kane and Dele Alli to injury in recent days.\n\nInjuries have also become an increasing problem for the Taeguk Warriors, whose Cup hopes took a knock when they lost Newcastle United midfielder Ki Sung Yeung to a hamstring injury.\n\n\"He's a big loss,\" Son said of Ki, whose No. 16 shirt was brandished by his teammates after Kim Jin Su's extra-time winner in Dubai.\n\n\"He's one of the best players in the squad of course. He's a big loss and someone else will have to be ready to step up and show what he can do.\"\n\nBento admitted injury absences had robbed South Korea of some ideas in attack, and they looked flat and vulnerable at times against a Bahrain team who packed the defence.\n\n\"In the positions where we can refresh the team a little bit in terms of attack, we have difficulties,\" Bento said after the laboured win over Bahrain's part-timers.\n\n\"But now we need to find solutions because on the 25th, we will play again. It's not an excuse, it's what we have in this moment.\"\n\nLast year, Son starred - and scored - as South Korea knocked defending champions Germany out of the World Cup, and he also led his country to victory at the Asian Games, a title which earned him an exemption from military service.\n\nAfter playing 209 minutes in two games since arriving for South Korea's final group fixture, Son will now need to lift himself again for tomorrow's quarter-final against Qatar, who pipped Iraq 1-0 in their last-16 encounter yesterday morning (Singapore time).\n\nBut despite being on the receiving end of some rough challenges, including a boot to the head, he said he didn't feel he was being singled out by opposition teams.\n\n\"Everyone can be a target,\" he said. \"I don't worry about this. I have to learn from this. We should play better than this game.\" - AFP\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

You can imagine this with sips of whiskey.\n\nThen he went off and opened a \"retirement pub\" in Bangkok at the ripe young age of 75.\n\nThankfully, his niece Wendy Koh and her makan buddy Edward Chan decided to get that vadai recipe from him and set up Eatz Vadai at Jalan Benaan Kapal Food Centre, a charming little place not far from Stadium MRT station.\n\nGordon Koh (with Eatz Vadai owners Edward Chan and Wendy Koh)\n\nThe pair now helm this one-snack stall, which suddenly lends more colour and flavour to this favourite taxi driver kopi haunt (where you can still get a cuppa at 50 cents).\n\nOnions and curry leaves are blended into the dough and the aroma and subtle taste comes through.\n\nGordon was also there \"training and fine-tuning the recipe\" with the brand new equipment.\n\nWhile people in Sri Lanka eat their vadai with a sourish yoghurt sambal sauce, the version here is loved with raw green chilli. The correct way to eat it is to bite into the hot prawn vadai and chomp on that crunchy green chilli at the same time.\n\nThe result? Utter bliss.\n\nSaid Edward: \"I felt this dish should not fade into the sunset. It is so easy to like, yet not many (places) are offering this.\"\n\nSo he gave up his former day job as a corporate travel agent and set up Eatz Vadai earlier this month with Wendy.\n\nYou can count on one hand just how many hawkers offer prawn vadai in Singapore - or Malaysia for that matter (perhaps two hands and a foot).\n\nIf you are comparing, this is a very different version from the other famous Gina's Vadai at Dunman Food Centre, which comes flatter and thinner, with a lighter batter.\n\nEdward's ($1 each) is bold and yet fluffy with more bite, like a good fluffy doughnut.\n\nThree of these will fill you up whereas Gina's will take up to five before your tummy feels the love.\n\nThe prawns I like to see used is the swa lor or little soft shelled shrimps, which cost more than Gina's garden variety ones.\n\nBut for now, Edward uses baby grey prawns that yield a soft yet crunchy bite.\n\nSwa lor prawns are difficult to obtain and stocks from Malaysia are thinning out this festive season.\n\nTo me, the perfect prawn vadai is a mash-up of both versions - something bold yet light and airy, with a clever blend of onions and curry leaves and perhaps a puff of curry powder in the dough using swa lor prawns.\n\nBut I am still waiting. Come on folks, it's not rocket science to set up a shop with such a recipe. Folks of all creeds, colours and statuses will love this as a snack.\n\nBy\n\nKF Seetoh\n\nFood columnist\n\nRead articles by KF Seetoh\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d7bedfd98a43d37ee149313f0cf27d69c0fba92b8e18e3b42841f72c7440f48a/NP_20190124_MAKAN2416VQ_4573072.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The prawn vadai (above) made from the recipe of Gordon Koh.", "caption": "The prawn vadai (above) made from the recipe of Gordon Koh.

I was not expecting this news when I woke up so early today,\" Aparicio wrote. \"From the very first casting call to this morning, my Roma journey has been extraordinary.

I congratulate him and all the actors and production team... We should all see the film,\" said Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, admitting that he himself had not watched it yet.\n\nMexican film-makers have racked up an impressive string of successes at the Academy Awards in recent years.\n\nThe trio known as the Three Amigos - Cuaron, Guillermo del Toro and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu - have won the best director award four of the past five years.

With so much to do over the festive season, you will appreciate the little shortcuts that give you more time and energy to entertain your guests.\n\nINGREDIENTS (Serves six)\n\n1 green papaya (640g), peeled\n\n2 garlic cloves\n\n6 red chilli padis (15g)\n\n4g dried shrimp\n\n4 stalks of long beans (80g), cut into 5cm lengths\n\n2 tsp Thai palm sugar\n\n3 limes (150g), cut into quarters\n\n1 small carrot (50g), shredded\n\n2 tomatoes (110g), quartered\n\n50g peanuts\n\n40ml (about 8 tsp) of fish sauce\n\n2 tsp of freshly squeezed lime juice\n\n1 cooked salted egg (cut into six segments)\n\n150g roast pork, cut into 2cm by 3cm pieces\n\nMETHOD (MAKES 2 BATCHES)\n\n1. Shred the papaya using a vegetable shredder or knife. When using a knife, hold the papaya firmly in one hand. Use the knife to make multiple cuts of about 2cm deep, lengthwise. Then slice lengthwise to get strips that are around 5cm to 7cm long. Repeat until you get to the papaya core, which can be discarded.\n\n2. Smash one garlic clove and three chilli padis in the mortar.\n\n3. Add half of the dried shrimp, half of the long beans, a teaspoon of palm sugar and six wedges of lime. Pound to squeeze out the lime juice.\n\n4. Add half of the shredded green papaya. Pound and use a spoon to toss the mixture.\n\n5. Add four teaspoons of fish sauce. Toss and pound.\n\n6. Add half of the shredded carrot, toss and pound.\n\n7. Add one tomato, then lightly toss and pound.\n\n8. Add half the peanuts, then lightly toss and pound.\n\n9. Add a teaspoon of fresh lime juice, then toss and pound.\n\n10. Transfer green papaya salad into serving dish. Place half of the salted egg on top. Arrange half of the roast pork on top of the salad. Serve immediately.\n\n11. Repeat steps two to 10 using the remaining ingredients for second batch.\n\nFOLLOW HEDY KHOO (@HEDCHEFHEDYKHOO) ON INSTAGRAM FOR MORE CULINARY ADVENTURES\n\nBy\n\nHedy Khoo\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Hedy Khoo\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/319a6c4497ba30b34e1d0ebfcaa9de5567f2b98d9434b91fc60632a92cba7a64/NP_20190124_HKCHEF24_4573091.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "TNP PHOTO: HEDY KHOO"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Ellis, for sound mixing.\n\nMs Lee was also nominated in the same categories in 2017 for the musical La La Land, which was also helmed by First Man director Damien Chazelle.\n\nIn an e-mail interview with The Straits Times, Ms Lee said that \"it is an honour to be nominated by my peers in the Academy for First Man and to be in such good company with the other nominees\".\n\nShe added: \"I owe my nominations to our exceptional sound team and to Damien Chazelle, whose brilliant film provided the opportunity for sound to help create the immersive and perilous world of Neil Armstrong's journey to the moon and back.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\n3\n\n0\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe drama stars Canadian actor Ryan Gosling as Armstrong and British actress Claire Foy as his wife.\n\nIn contrast to La La Land's 14 nominations and subsequent six wins, First Man received only four nods - in the technical areas of visual effects, sound editing, sound mixing and production design.\n\nBut Lee said this was nothing to be upset about.\n\n\"Chazelle made a very immersive and intimate story about Armstrong,\" said Lee, who moved to Los Angeles at age 19 and knocked on doors to land a job in sound production. \"We are very proud of the film...\"\n\nThe 91st Academy Awards ceremony will be held in Los Angeles on Feb 24.\n\nMovies\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\n2\n\n0\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\n4\n\n0\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/15710bc6930b6be08872052a25ebc625fa40d5d37cf30020f27b8f1e140f97b5/NP_20190124_SHOW24B_4573749.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Singaporean sound editor Ai-Ling Lee.

He's so important in his dominance.\n\n\"With him and Alisson (Becker) in goal, I just feel that the team are complete and it's hard to beat that.\n\n\"When we were playing, we were not strong enough to be as consistent as these guys now.\n\n\"To be honest, from them I feel now a real power that they can win the league. When we played, we were always missing something. We were not strong enough or good enough to win the league.\"\n\nA dismal end to last season's Champions League final saw Klopp rejuvenate his squad with an outlay of over £175 million (S$307m) on strengthening Liverpool in key departments.\n\nFormer Czech Republic midfielder Smicer, 45, believes that increased depth, coupled with retaining key assets, has paved the way for Liverpool's current domestic ascendancy.\n\nHe added: \"Last season they played some fantastic football, they made the Champions League final; they had so many great games. Even the final, when (Gareth) Bale scored his overhead kick, it was unlucky for us because he can score so many goals like this.\n\n\"But I knew that the team are already good and I think Liverpool had a really good summer when they bought Alisson, (Naby) Keita, Fabinho, (Xherdan) Shaqiri.\n\n\"That was really important, what they did, because they kept all the best players and they've shown quality.\n\n\"Now Juergen Klopp has got the depth in the squad and that's why I think we're playing so well. There's more pressure on playing well because there are many players that can play, even on the bench.\n\n\"The squad are really strong so, even if somebody is a little bit tired or injured, he can replace him straight away and doesn't affect the game or the performance of the team. They are really consistent - that's important.\n\n\"If you want to win the Premier League, you need to be consistent and not only playing in the big games.\n\n\"Sometimes the smaller games, you need to win them.\n\n\"So far they're doing well and it's really a pleasure to watch them.\"\n\nVladimir Smicer was speaking ahead of the LFC Foundation's Legends Charity Match between Liverpool and AC Milan at Anfield on March 23.\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

And they could be investigated for money laundering offences.\n\nThe police and DBS warned the public that such phishing scams could be targeted at any bank customers.\n\nThe police advised the public to always verify the details in messages from banks, and to refrain from disclosing Internet banking details such as account username, personal identification number or one-time password to anyone.\n\nMore than $28,000 lost to 'tech support' scams last year\n\nBy\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\nMore than $28,000 was lost to \"tech support\" scammers last year.\n\nPolice said in an advisory yesterday that they have received at least four reports of such scams in the year thus far and warned the public against falling prey to them. There have been two different variants of the scam.\n\nThe first involves victims seeing a pop-up message indicating their computers have been infected with a virus, or that their passwords and personal information have been leaked.\n\nA toll-free telephone number will be provided, and when victims call it to resolve the purported issue, they are connected to operators claiming to be employees from tech firms.\n\nThe operators then advise them to download an application or enter commands into the computers, which allows the scammers to gain remote access to the victims' computers.\n\nIn the second variant, victims get unsolicited calls from individuals informing them their bank account details have been compromised. The victims are asked to download software so they can get help, which gives the scammer control of the victims' computer.\n\nIn most cases, victims are told to purchase \"anti-virus software\" to fix their computers. They will then be asked to transfer money or provide personal particulars and credit or debit card details for the purchase.\n\nIn other cases, the victims allowed the scammers to access their e-mail accounts by giving up their passwords, which in turn allowed the scammers to misuse these e-mail accounts to commit other scams.\n\nThe police have advised the public to be wary of unsolicited calls, to ignore the pop-up messages and close them and call a trusted person before acting on the instructions. They should not give out personal details.\n\nThose who wish to provide information on such scams should call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit it online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness. The public can call the anti-scam helpline on 1800-722-6688 or visit www.scamalert.sg for scam-related advice.\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/107ec2b114968d61fa2cd00e3817fd45655acfe2e3fa6ca59973a20e10db2026/np_20190123_scbank23_4571173.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Phishing SMSes targeting bank customers.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, said the survey results are \"not that surprising\", owing to Singapore not having a terrorist incident since the 1970s.\n\n\"At an intuitive, psychological level, Singaporeans may feel that the Government has been doing such a great job of protecting the country that it will always be able to do so,\" he said.\n\n\"This is the paradoxical, unintended consequence of our successful counter-terrorism policies and strategies.\"\n\nHe said the possible issue with such perceptions is that Singaporeans may be \"unconsciously unprepared\" for a terror attack here.\n\n\"It has always been a challenge for the authorities to persuade the public not just at an abstract, intellectual level but also at a deeper, intuitive level, that one must be alert to the threat at all times, but of course not to the extent of being overly alarmed,\" he said.\n\n\"In countries that have experienced such attacks, the public arguably needs less persuasion as they have had first-hand experience and fully acknowledge the reality of the threat.\"\n\nThe MHA report acknowledged that the Government's measures are not foolproof.\n\n\"Even as the Government has put in place measures to enhance our counter-terrorism ability, the authorities will not be able to uncover and prevent every threat,\" it said.\n\nSingapore Red Cross secretary-general and chief executive Benjamin William said: \"It is important that Singaporeans pick up emergency preparedness skills... (but) it is still a challenge to get the public to see matters like first-aid training and blood donation as a personal and national priority.\n\n\"Singaporeans may have grown accustomed to living in a safe country, and so they take security for granted.\"\n\nBy\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He's having his 29th local start in this spot and a win is going to come at some point. Don't be surprised if it happens.\n\n12 ROYAL CHOCOLATE\n\nsteps back up into Class 4. His last couple of runs in Class 5 have been good enough to suggest he can strike with no weight.\n\nRACE 5 (1,650M)\n\n7 HAPPY WARRIOR\n\nhas run well in his last two course-and-distance starts, being beaten by a neck and a short head when striking trouble on both occasions. He is likely to go off at a very short price again, but he looks the winner in this spot.\n\n4 GENERAL DINO\n\nperformed poorly last time out but had run well twice at Happy Valley before that. He's drawn awkwardly again but, if he gets speed on, he's likely to finish off strongly.\n\n1 MERRYGOWIN\n\nhadn't shown a lot before improving for fifth last time out. The drop in grade should help him, too.\n\n5 GREAT JOY\n\nneeds luck but he's one who can get into the finish at odds.\n\nRACE 6 (1,200M)\n\n4 MUSIC ADDITION\n\narrived with big wraps and his first effort over the Sha Tin 1,200m suggested he'd quickly find the winner's circle. He's drawn a good gate at his Happy Valley debut and gets his real chance to show his ability.\n\n11 MR PICASSO\n\nis as quirky as they come but he's always capable of getting into the finish.\n\n8 ROMAN IMPERO\n\nis back since April. His form has been better over further but, fresh, he merits respect.\n\n7 BLOCKER DEE\n\nis going to be in the right spot and is not without claims.\n\nRACE 7 (1,800M)\n\n1 BIGWOOD\n\nis racing well. He has to overcome an awkward draw but he shapes as the one to beat again.\n\n4 HELENE CHARISMA\n\nremains winless through 26 Hong Kong starts. However, his Class 3 efforts have, on the whole, been good. He's worth including.\n\n3 ROCKETEER\n\nreturns to Class 3 for just the second time. He should enjoy a nice run just behind the speed and can get into the finish.\n\n6 RICKFIELD\n\nis a two-time course-and-distance winner who finally strikes a suitable race. He's a place chance.\n\nRACE 8 (1,650M)\n\n5 FEARLESS FIRE\n\nfinally steps up beyond 1,200m again, having found form over shorter trips this season. He's the type who should be suited at the extended mile at Happy Valley.\n\n7 SLEEP EDUCATION\n\nhas another awkward draw. If Neil Callan can get him into fourth or fifth, then he's in with a chance.\n\n4 BANK ON RED\n\ncan capitalise on the inside gate to enjoy a nice run in transit and, perhaps, to get into the finish again.\n\n10 ARCADA\n\nis steadily improving and shapes as a place chance.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I can't understand it at all. I will stay combative and stand by the team,\" Veyrat said, blasting the decision as \"unfair\".\n\nThe guide's new international director Gwendal Poullennec had promised to breathe new life into its pages this year.\n\nA record 75 restaurants have earned new spots in the one-, two- or three-star rankings.\n\nA large number of international chefs are also honoured.Argentine Mauro Colagreco, whose Mirazur restaurant on the glitzy Cote d'Azur ranked fourth last year on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list, became the only foreigner to hold three stars in France.\n\nChef Laurent Petit meanwhile praised the feared Michelin reviewers for having \"the sense\" to award him a third star for Le Clos des Sens restaurant in Annecy.\n\n\"I'm delighted to have won a third star with endive roots and a cabbage tart. Simple, simple, simple,\" he said. - AFP\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/153bd823fd18e7d6dda84174fae8c8df75b54ec32424fba26adc046e6f1c5d9e/NP_20190123_SHOW23A_4570079.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "French chef Sebastien Bras.

Night Shyamalan behind the scenes of Glass, with James McAvoy and Bruce Willis.\n\nPHOTO: THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 22, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nWhy Glass director Shyamalan took 18 years to complete film trilogy\n\nFilm-maker describes finishing 18-year journey with Glass\n\nShare this article\n\nEighteen years. That is how long it took M. Night Shyamalan to finish the trilogy he had in his mind starting with Unbreakable in 2000.\n\nThe second instalment, Split, was released in 2016, and the final one, Glass, currently showing here, has the protagonists of each film woven into the storyline.\n\nIt topped the North American box office with US$47 million (S$64 million), with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson returning as David Dunn and Elijah Price/Mr Glass respectively from Unbreakable.\n\nAnd from Split, James McAvoy reprises his role as Kevin Wendell Crumb alongside the Horde of multiple personalities that live inside him, including the serial killer supervillain Beast.\n\nThe invulnerable superhero Dunn pursues the Beast, and brittle-boned evil genius Price orchestrates the action.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\nThough Unbreakable got positive reviews upon its release and won a cult following over time, Shyamalan admitted the initial naysayers did get to him.\n\nThe 48-year-US film-maker said at our interview at the Crosby Street Hotel in New York City: \"For about 14 years, I wasn't planning on making (the trilogy) and finishing it.\n\n\"There was such a weird reception to Unbreakable. I think it was hurtful.\n\nWEIRD REACTION\n\n\"It was a weird reaction even with audiences, this sense of not knowing what I was trying to do. 'You were trying to do a serious comic book movie?'\n\n\"I just wasn't emotionally willing to go there again.\"\n\nUnbreakable came out before the popularity of Marvel-DC comic book superhero blockbusters over the last decade, and Shyamalan had moved on to other films, but the question he heard over and over was when he was making the sequel.\n\nHe said: \"In my head, I was searching for those ideas that had lent themselves to a sequel, and Split was the classic example of that.\n\n\"So I kind of tricked my way back into the trilogy by making the second one without really telling anybody it was a sequel.\"\n\nThen he looked at all the outlines he had from 1999 and planned Glass.\n\n\"Unbreakable was supposed to feel like David, and Split was supposed to feel like Kevin Wendell Crumb - violent, weird and inappropriately funny. Then Glass is supposed to feel like Elijah, like a majestic chess match going on in the movie, so I kind of always had that in my head.\"\n\nWhere Shyamalan breaks from the norm is presenting his superpowered heroes like real human beings.\n\nHe explained: \"What are the things in the real world that we don't know about that are naturally extraordinary?\n\n\"Like, there is a bone disorder that makes you so fragile your bones break, so wouldn't that mean the opposite of that exists somewhere? Someone whose bones are really dense?\"\n\nDissociative identity disorder, the condition that Kevin has, was another subject that interested him.\n\nHe continued: \"How extraordinary, as a natural phenomenon that happens in the psychological world from this intense trauma children go through, that their brains learn to do this extraordinary thing we can't do in a normal upbringing.\"\n\nWhen asked about his own superpower, he said: \"I genuinely believe in other people's superpowers, whether that is an actor or a child or anybody that I meet in my philanthropy.\n\n\"I genuinely get pissed when someone is taught that they don't have agency, that they are not extraordinary. I believe that about all of us, and I want that for all of us.\"\n\nMEETING MCAVOY\n\nShyamalan then related the story of how he met the \"miracle\" McAvoy in San Diego at a comic convention and knew he was the one for Split.\n\nHe recalled: \"I wrote a part that I am not sure anybody could have played.\n\n\"Who could play a child, could play the physicality of the Beast, could crawl on a wall, could play a woman?\n\n\"Then I had the one guy who could play this walk up to me at Comic-Con. He started talking to me and I was like, as he was talking to me, 'This is the guy!'\n\n\"What I was seeing in him was gentleness, the everyman, empathy. I was like, 'Wow, what if a really sweet regular guy played this role? What would that be like?' He would bring an accessibility to it.\n\n\"What I didn't know from his body of work prior to that is he is an amazing entertainer. He thinks the thought and his body responds. What a perfect role for someone who is kind of an intuitive physical genius.\n\n\"And also, how many people can do that many accents? I didn't even know he was Scottish for the longest time. I thought he was British,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nShyamalan believes the Unbreakable-Split-Glass story could have more sequels, but he is not going to do it.\n\nHe said: \"That is not the way I am built. The idea of returning to an emotion that existed for the last two years feels weird for me.\n\n\"No one asks me to tell these stories. I am not hired to tell these stories. I tell these stories and say, 'Hey, will you pay for it, will you distribute it?'\"\n\nThe writer is the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a non-profit organisation of entertainment journalists that also organises the annual Golden Globe Awards.\n\nBy\n\nMeher Tatna\n\nEntertainment Columnist\n\nRead articles by Meher Tatna\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d504852b3d080e46ab3625135d0de86a4603bdcb5b8e14e9f7b02499d7bc1396/np_20190123_night23n7rj_4570027.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(From left) M.

Next year, the global economy will grow at 3.6 per cent, instead of 3.7 per cent, according to the IMF.\n\nIn a morning note, OCBC Treasury Research said the latest cut from the IMF \"is just a confirmation of existing concerns of a slower 2019\".\n\nOn the sidelines of Davos, Singapore's Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat also cautioned that a \"very negative\" outcome for the global economy could be likely if the US and China fail to come to an agreement on trade.\n\nThe news weighed on investor sentiment, clipping gains in most Asian markets.\n\nKey indices in China and Hong Kong posted some of the biggest losses.\n\nSingapore stocks fared no better. The Straits Times Index began the day underwater and sank further in afternoon trade, before declining 0.86 per cent or 27.85 points to 3,192.71 at the closing bell.\n\nLosers outnumbered gainers 225 to 148 after 1.57 billion shares worth $786.6 million changed hands.\n\n\"The Singapore market has already enjoyed an almost 5 per cent rise in three weeks. Some sideways movement is expected, especially with US equity futures pointing to some downside when it reopens,\" said Mr Paul Chew, head of research at Phillip Securities.\n\nDrags on the index came from manufacturing, transport, storage and communications sectors.\n\nM1 shares closed 0.97 per cent lower at $2.05 yesterday, after Keppel Corp and Singapore Press Holdings' joint venture company, Konnectivity, announced that there will be no increase in its offer price of $2.06 per M1 share they do not already own.\n\nThe closing date of their offer was also extended by at least two weeks.\n\nSingtel's counter slid 0.66 per cent to $3.02, while fellow telco Starhub slumped by 1.11 per cent to $1.78. In contrast, Netlink NBN Trust ended the day on higher ground, up 0.65 per cent to 77.5 cents.\n\nAnother exception was ComfortDelGro, which put on 0.46 per cent to $2.19.\n\nIn a note, KGI Securities noted that institutional investors have been accumulating the stock at $2.10-$2.30 levels, with JP Morgan's Asean Equity fund the latest to add a significant stake to its portfolio.\n\nThe fund added 2.37 million shares valued at $3.7 million last December. Other funds which have bought into ComfortDelGro include Capital Research Management Company, a unit of Capital Group, which bought 44 million shares last quarter, observed KGI.\n\nThe index was also hurt by declines in financial counters.\n\nDBS Bank pared 1.84 per cent to $24.55, while United Overseas Bank gave up 1.55 per cent to $26.02. OCBC Bank posted the steepest decline, down 1.96 per cent to $11.50.\n\nReal estate investment trusts, which analysts have looked to as defensive plays in recent, volatile times, were a mixed bag. Soilbuild Reit gained 2.48 per cent after posting higher fourth quarter earnings on Monday.\n\nHowever, Mapletree Logistics Trust, which also posted higher earnings, closed flat. OCBC analysts foresee more upside to come for the trust.\n\nWith a number of Singapore Reits expected to release results this week, this may be the time to see if they can be expected to withstand this year's headwinds.

He was unsure if he could portray the character convincingly.\n\nThe 59-year-old, best known for portraying heroic warrior Aragorn in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, also had to gain around 20kg for the role of Tony Lip, who is hired to drive world-class black jazz-classical pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a concert tour of the segregated US Deep South in the early 1960s, as well as be the latter's bodyguard.\n\nThe film is named after The Negro Motorist Green Book, a mid-20th century guidebook for African-American travellers written by Victor Hugo Green, to help them find motels and restaurants that would accept them.\n\nOpening here tomorrow, Green Book - inspired by a true story - has won best film prizes from the National Board of Review, Golden Globes and Producers Guild of America.\n\n\"I was a little nervous about taking the role,\" Mortensen said at the opening of the Zurich Film Festival last September.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"For one thing, I'm not Italian-American. And there's a lot of good Italian-American actors,\" he said.\n\n\"I asked (director) Pete (Farrelly) whether he was sure and he said yes and I said, 'Well, let me think about it'. So it took me a little bit to commit, but I'm glad I did. It's a beautiful movie.\"\n\nWhile Tony and Don appear to have little in common at first, friendship blossoms as they encounter prejudice as well as threats on their journey.\n\nMortensen said: \"The movie says to me we all have similar needs. We all have a desire, a need to be respected for who we are, wherever we're from, whatever we look like, whatever our education level is. Everybody deserves a hearing.\"\n\nWhen asked if he thought it was important film-makers of today return to these 1960s cinematic themes, Mortensen said in a separate interview at the Marrakech International Film Festival last month: \"I think it's sometimes easier to see the present when you tell a story from the past.\n\n\" I think the problem of discrimination will remain a current issue for generations - we're like that, us humans!\n\n\"We're like children, we need experiences. We always need stories like Green Book that make us think and see society differently.\"\n\nAnd on Green Book's chances of snagging the big prize at this year's Academy Awards on Feb 24, he said: \"I don't know if (it) will win an Oscar or not. It's a mystery. If we win, it's good. If we don't win, it doesn't change a thing. I know it's a very good film, which could become a classic that we'll watch in five or 10 years. Many movies are popular right now but may be forgotten in a year. This is not the case with Green Book.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the man himself is ready to make his directorial debut, with plans to go behind the camera for the upcoming father-son drama Falling.\n\nMortensen wrote the screenplay and will take one of the leading roles in the film, an intimate look at a gay man's (Mortensen) complicated relationship with his ageing father (Lance Henriksen).\n\nHe said: \"We are in the pre-production phase, and filming will start (next month) in Canada. I was inspired by memories surrounding my father and mother, but it's not a true story. It's made up.\"\n\nSo who's his dream director?\n\nHe said: \"I don't know if she will continue, but (Belgian-born French film-maker) Agnes Varda... or (US film-maker) Martin Scorsese. I'd like to film with him. But for me, the most important thing is the story, then the role and then the director.\" - REUTERS/AFP\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nTransform your home affordably with IKEA Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/905d5dc6be345b99cbea30a520f42f575b9a1ef56422087c007303e9cce1bef4/np_20190123_viggo23yvy9_4570440.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in Green Book.

Only technique and daring matter.\"\n\nIt was this that inspired the collection's necklaces and bracelets of interlocking gold hands. An acrobat \"puts her life in the hands of another, you have to really trust each other\", she said.\n\nFeminism was the big theme of the day on the Paris catwalks, with Italian actress and #MeToo campaigner Asia Argento taking a starring role in her Roman neighbour Antonio Grimaldi's spring/summer collection.\n\nWhile Grimaldi praised her courage and \"unconventional spirit\", Argento said she \"loved his sculptural couture\". - AFP\n\nFashion\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 3, 2025, 02:46pm\n\n'I want my sister to live': Local fashion label The Closet Lover to shut amid co-founder's health scare\n\nAug 29, 2024, 09:01am\n\nWould you spend $820 on a lollipop holder?\n\nAug 8, 2024, 09:00am\n\nAfter Hong Kong to Orchard Road, next stop: Milan and Paris\n\nApr 21, 2024, 02:21pm\n\nStar Awards 2024 Walk of Fame: Best and worst dressed\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nTransform your home affordably with IKEA Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8aaf3128cb05d0aada684eac681c2a4b6e57addf4be39f2a35931e51a759061d/NP_20190123_SHOW23N8JK_4570156.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A model presenting one of Chuiri's creations.

Its portfolio occupancy held firm at 97.7 per cent (+0.1 percentage point), with only China recording a dip in occupancy rates from 98.3 per cent to 95.8 per cent.\n\nMLT has also continued to diversify its portfolio, with logistics property acquisitions in Brisbane and South Korea.\n\nIn addition, MLT entered a conditional asset transfer agreement with Unilever International to acquire a warehouse in Vietnam.\n\nThe property is expected to generate an initial NPI yield of 8.3 per cent. Factoring these in, we raise our FY2019 and FY2020 DPU forecasts by 0.2 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively.\n\nMaybank Kim Eng, Jan 22\n\nFrasers Centrepoint Trust's (FCT) Q1 2019 DPU of 3.02 cents, up 0.7 per cent y-o-y, was led by improved occupancies across all assets and a 6.9 per cent higher rental reversion, driven by strong leasing momentum at Causeway Point and further entrenchment of Changi City Point as an outlet mall.\n\nExcluding Northpoint City, overall shopper traffic was up 3.5 per cent y-o-y, while tenants' sales dipped slightly by 0.9 per cent y-o-y between September and November 2018.\n\nLooking ahead, we see strong leasing momentum supporting renewal efforts into the rest of FY2019 (46 per cent of expiries are at Causeway Point).\n\nFCT's 5.7 per cent DPU yield is compelling and it remains our preferred retail Reit given its strengthening suburban mall footprint, visible growth drivers, strong balance sheet and potential acquisition catalysts.\n\nAt its AGM, CEO Chew Tuan Chiong announced his intention to retire at 62 years of age after leading FCT since 2010.\n\nA succession plan is in place and the growth strategy will remain unchanged in our view.\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

How far we go depends on the quality of the people we have,\" said Mr Wong, who was speaking at an iBuildSG scholarship ceremony at the National University of Singapore.\n\nThe $72 million fund will support an enhanced iBuildSG Scholarship and Sponsorship programme for those seeking academic qualifications on a full-time undergraduate, diploma or Institute of Technical Education (ITE) track.\n\nThere were 448 scholarships and sponsorships awarded to polytechnic and ITE students, university graduates and postgraduates yesterday.\n\nThe programme partners these students with industry firms so they will have a job in the sponsoring company on graduation.\n\nThe firm will also provide on-the-job training programmes and part-time upgrading courses. Previously, this sponsorship programme was open only to polytechnic and ITE graduates.\n\nAll those awarded scholarships and sponsorships will receive a $3,000 training grant to boost their skills and competencies through courses. They will also be encouraged to stay on in the industry with a $7,000 retention incentive one year after their bond with their sponsoring firm ends.\n\nThe existing Building Specialist Sponsorship programme, which supports the training of technical personnel, will also be extended from two to three years. This allows students to attend longer courses, such as part-time Nitec, higher Nitec and post-ITE development courses, said Mr Wong.\n\nBy\n\nNg Jun Sen\n\nRead articles by Ng Jun Sen\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

As a result, a company that dropped off the list was not necessarily performing worse, he added.\n\nCDP asks companies to disclose their performance on climate change and separately surveys their efforts to limit water use and to protect forests in its study, which is backed by more than 650 investors with assets of US$87 trillion (S$118 trillion) and is meant to spur efforts to protect the planet. - REUTERS\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nNetClass Technology Inc (NTCL) : News and History Unveiled", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Major theatre chains refuse to show Netflix films, and some top directors have balked at making films that will be seen primarily on the small screen.\n\nA portion of Oscar voters may be reluctant to honour Netflix, said Hollywood Reporter awards columnist Scott Feinberg, but he believes that group is shrinking.\n\nMany actors, writers, producers and others have now worked on Netflix TV shows or movies, and they are happy that the Silicon Valley company has deep pockets and a willingness to fund arthouse fare, he said.\n\n\"At this point they are accepting that they are here and are not going away, and they are not the big, bad wolf they were made out to be,\" Mr Feinberg said.\n\nRoma also faces an uphill climb because no foreign-language film has ever won the best picture prize.\n\nNetflix has lobbied heavily to win over Academy members.\n\nThe company hired a top awards strategist who worked previously for The Weinstein Company, which was known for its masterful Oscar campaigns.\n\nActress Angelina Jolie and other A-list fans of Roma have attended screenings, part of an effort to lure voters to see the film on a big screen.\n\nNetflix also showcased the movie on the home screen of its streaming service, something its rivals from traditional studios could not do.\n\n\"There has never been a foreign-language Oscar hopeful that has had the support that this one has,\" Mr Feinberg said.\n\n\"They have left no stone unturned.\"\n\nMr Cuaron said he was thrilled with Netflix's backing of an unusual movie with no recognisable stars.\n\n\"They are giving a huge, huge, huge international push for this film, really in both streaming but also theatrical,\" he said in a recent interview.\n\n\"Not any company does that.\"\n\nThe nomination alone should help Netflix achieve its ultimate goal of adding to its global membership of 139 million streaming customers, particularly overseas where the company is looking for growth, Mr Feinberg said.\n\n\"I would imagine in Spanish-speaking countries around the world, it's been a big point of curiosity to see what this is about,\" Mr Feinberg said. \"That will only increase.\"\n\nMany of the films nominated this year for the top prize - best picture - proved big box office hits, including Marvel's superhero movie Black Panther, which got seven nods yesterday and became the first superhero movie to win a best picture nomination. - REUTERS\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\nBlack Panther\n\nBlacKkKlansman\n\nBohemian Rhapsody\n\nThe Favourite\n\nGreen Book\n\nRoma\n\nA Star Is Born\n\nVice\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nSpike Lee (BlacKkKlansman)\n\nPawel Pawlikowski (Cold War)\n\nYorgos Lanthimos (The Favourite)\n\nAlfonso Cuaron (Roma)\n\nAdam McKay (Vice)\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nChristian Bale (Vice)\n\nBradley Cooper (A Star Is Born)\n\nWillem Dafoe (At Eternity's Gate)\n\nRami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody)\n\nViggo Mortensen (Green Book)\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nYalitza Aparicio (Roma)\n\nGlenn Close (The Wife)\n\nOlivia Colman (The Favourite)\n\nLady Gaga (A Star Is Born)\n\nMelissa McCarthy (Can You Ever Forgive Me?)\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nMahershala Ali (Green Book)\n\nAdam Driver (BlacKkKlansman)\n\nSam Elliott (A Star Is Born)\n\nRichard E.

The 25-year-old did not land the job.\n\nWhen Ms Jaya Anil Kumar applied a second time more than three years later, she doctored her National University of Singapore (NUS) law degree certificate.\n\nYesterday, Ms Jaya, now 30, was struck off the rolls.\n\nCalled to the Bar in July 2012, she had not applied for a practising certificate since August 2014.\n\nThe Law Society referred her case to the Court of Three Judges, which can suspend or disbar lawyers, after she was fined $10,000 in January last year for using forged documents.\n\nHanding down the court's decision to strike her off, Judge of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang said her conduct showed \"a consistent trend of resorting to dishonest means\" to get the job she wanted.\n\n\"We do not see how being consumed about wanting a particular career mitigates the offences of forgery of one's academic credentials,\" he added.\n\nThe court, which also comprised Justices Belinda Ang and Quentin Loh, said the criminal acts were \"grave and indefensible\" but noted that Ms Jaya was capable of change.\n\n\"During the coming years, she will have to reorder her young life, refocus on what is truly important, show the fruits of repentance and make a good case for the court to reinstate her as an advocate and solicitor some time in the future.\"\n\nMs Jaya graduated from NUS in 2011 with a second class (lower) law degree. After she was called to the Bar, she was retained at a large law firm.\n\nIn January 2013, she applied to the Legal Service Commission (LSC), submitting a doctored transcript that reflected better grades for 21 out of 27 subjects.\n\nALTERATION\n\nIn October 2016, she altered her degree to state that she had a second class (upper) degree as well as her transcript to reflect better grades for 18 out of 27 subjects.\n\nWhen the LSC secretariat contacted her to seek her consent to ask NUS for her class and percentile rankings, she declined.\n\nAsked about the differences in the documents for both applications, she claimed she had \"mis-scanned\" them and might have mixed up the documents with a friend's.\n\nThat evening, she e-mailed her genuine documents to the secretariat, which made a police report.\n\nSELINA LUM, LAW CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

That is one of the very basic conditions,\" he said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S. Korea protest against vaccine pass rule for kids\n\nMore related stories\n\nConvicts eligible for early release are required to pledge loyalty to the state and its secular ideology, known as Pancasila, and not to repeat their crimes. But Bashir's lawyers say he has refused to do that.\n\nBashir was the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, an Islamist group linked to Al-Qaeda blamed for the 2002 bombings of nightclubs on Bali island that killed more than 200 people, most of them tourists, including 88 Australians.\n\nHe was convicted in 2010 under anti-terrorism laws for links to militant training camps in Aceh province and jailed for 15 years. Although linked to the Bali attacks and a bombing at Jakarta's Marriott Hotel in 2003, Bashir was never convicted for them and denied those ties.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, speaking before Mr Widodo set out conditions for the release, urged Indonesia not to show him leniency.\n\n\"We have been clear about the need to ensure that as part of our joint counter-terrorism efforts … that Abu Bakar Bashir would not be in any position or in any way able to influence or incite anything,\" Mr Morrison told reporters on Monday.\n\nMr Widodo has also come under fire at home over the possible release. Critics have accused him of trying to win over religious conservatives ahead of a presidential election set for April 17 in the world's largest Muslim-majority country.\n\nSome members of the ruling coalition, including officials in Mr Widodo's party, fear Bashir's release could alienate moderate Muslim and non-Muslim voters.\n\n\"Everyone is asking, 'How can we possibly allow this?'\"said an official from Mr Widodo's Democratic Party of Struggle.\n\n\"Now it is about how many votes we will lose, not gain.\"\n\nMost opinion polls have given Mr Widodo a double-digit lead over rival Prabowo Subianto, a retired general who had also contested the presidency in 2014.\n\nOpponents and hardline Islamists have repeatedly attacked Mr Widodo's Islamic credentials. During the 2014 campaign for the presidency, he had to battle false rumours that he was a communist.\n\nStill, some analysts doubted whether releasing Bashir early would win Widodo many conservative voters.\n\nSecurity and government officials, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue, said they backed the plan to release Bashir to avoid the risk of him dying as a martyr in jail but felt doing so without conditions was risky. - REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Chew was handed nine cheating charges.\n\nA search on the General Insurance Association Of Singapore's website reveals that Chew is still a general and life insurance agent, currently linked to Liberty Insurance.\n\nInformation on Tien was not found on the portal.\n\nThe trio allegedly committed the offences between June 2017 and April last year.\n\nManulife Singapore is said to have been duped into delivering the monies to the 12 insurance policyholders.\n\nThey allegedly received between $200 and $1,200 each.\n\nTien's cases allegedly involved nine policyholders who received more than $8,000 in all.\n\nFive policyholders linked to Chew are said to have received about $7,000 in total. It was not mentioned in court yesterday if action will be taken against the 12 policyholders.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the police said the trio allegedly cheated the insurance firm through false personal accident claims for treatments at Loo's clinics in Tampines and Tanjong Pagar.\n\nThey said investigations showed \"the trio were believed to have conspired with one another to instigate patients receiving treatment for pre-existing medical conditions at the chiropractor's clinics to purchase personal accident insurance policies\".\n\n\"The patients could then make false personal accident claims against the insurance policies, for injuries purportedly sustained after they bought the policies, in order to receive payout from the insurance company for their chiropractic treatment,\" the police said.\n\nYesterday, the trio were each offered bail of $15,000 and they will be back in court on Feb 19.\n\nFor each count of cheating, offenders can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/28bcc845e2b5de790839b938a23721db41ae1324a40e6a8dd7bb4678367be4f5/np_20190123_sqcheat2394yr_45711461.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(From left) Charles Loo Boon Ann, Priscilla Tien Ling and Mike Chew Jun Yong.

Tech adoption in places such as India and South-east Asia is expected to accelerate in the coming years as well.\n\nThis is among reasons that Dyson's chief financial officer and chief legal officer will relocate to Singapore \"very shortly\" and its team built up here.\n\nMr Rowan said the decision did not have anything to do with Brexit or tax benefits, adding it is for the company to be in the best position to \"secure opportunities\". Mr Rowan is based in Singapore as well.\n\nHe said Brexit is unlikely to impact Dyson given that its supply chain is based in South-east Asia. He also said Singapore's corporate tax rate of 17 per cent - lower than Britain's - would mean only a \"negligible\" difference in what would be paid.\n\nMr Rowan stressed that the move to relocate to Singapore was an \"evolutionary decision\" due to the changing landscape.\n\nDyson's \"centre of gravity\" has been shifting towards Asia, which in 2017 generated almost 75 per cent of its revenue growth.\n\nIt already employs 1,100 people here and plans to double the size of its research and operations. Its Singapore Technology Centre at Science Park One will double in size as well.\n\nThe company has about 430 people working on the electric car and expects this to grow.\n\nIts Singapore manufacturing facility is part of Dyson's £2 billion (S$3.5 billion) move into automobiles. Singapore's expertise in advanced manufacturing was among the factors that made it an \"ideal location\" to build the Dyson car, said the company.\n\nSEOW BEI YI , BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer are defined by their United No. 9s.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that on the night that Marcus Rashford celebrated his 150th United appearance with a delightful finish, Mourinho was in a TV studio, sounding like the boorish uncle in an all-night coffee shop.\n\nHe reminded the world that he found Didier Drogba. He shaped his beloved forward into the definitive battering ram.\n\nThe trouble is he spent the next decade trying to turn every other No. 9 into Drogba, including Lukaku and Rashford.\n\nLukaku is similar to Drogba, except he can't shoot, head, pass or hold up possession as well as Drogba.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nAnd, despite his size, Lukaku goes over like a condemned building. But Rashford glides. He's quick and resourceful.\n\nHe takes gambles, too many for Mourinho's tastes, but never enough for Solskjaer. Trust breeds confidence. Solskjaer always picks Rashford, as if underlining the new emphasis on speed, invention and adventure.\n\nRashford has played in different positions for different managers, but has only one under Solskjaer. He knows a fellow striker when he sees one. Rashford has one objective: attack at every opportunity.\n\nWith Tottenham's Harry Kane injured, the 21-year-old is the best No. 9 on show. And his enthusiasm is infectious.\n\nUNITED'S NEED FOR SPEED IS BACK\n\nJust before Paul Pogba's penalty against Brighton & Hove Albion, Nemanja Matic swept a glorious, 30-metre diagonal pass to Pogba, the kind Matic stopped making under Mourinho.\n\nPogba dashed into the box, pursuing the kind of run he'd stopped making under Mourinho. Foul. Penalty. Goal. United were well and truly back.\n\nPogba, Rashford and Anthony Martial all attempted mazy dribbles, the kind of stirring charges that had vanished under Mourinho.\n\nSolskjaer has encouraged a sense of mischief, a real playfulness among the Red Devils.\n\nIt's hard to know what they'll do next or where they'll do it. It's football permanently on the front foot and the most entertaining on offer in the English Premier League.\n\nCITY SLUGGISH, LIVERPOOL DISTRACTED\n\nAt half-time between Huddersfield and Manchester City, an unexpected thought leapt to mind.\n\nCity were no longer the most exciting side in Manchester. Had United been playing at the same time, then the remote control would've been called upon.\n\nPep Guardiola has certainly noticed the lethargy, which makes his omission of Riyad Mahrez so surprising.\n\nMahrez lacks consistency, but his greatest asset remains unpredictability - an asset in short supply against Huddersfield. Perhaps the limited opposition played a part, but City were, for the most part, dull.\n\nThat's a criticism that can never be levelled at Liverpool. The 4-3 win over Crystal Palace was a thriller of sorts, but one in the B-movie category, a scruffy example of quantity over quality.\n\nThe Reds won't care about the aesthetics of course. It's the Premier League trophy or eternal ignominy. Squeaky bums, chewed fingernails and three points will do from now until the dream becomes mathematical reality.\n\nBut Liverpool didn't perform like title favourites and Juergen Klopp knew it. James Milner's suspension and a mini-defensive crisis means victory by any means necessary from now on.\n\nIt won't be as pretty as United but, then, there's nothing prettier than an open-top bus parade. Liverpool have different priorities now.\n\nIT'S A MESS IN LONDON\n\nTottenham Hotspur were lucky to beat Fulham, Chelsea were utterly hopeless against Arsenal and the Gunners can't decide whether they're improving or in perpetual crisis.\n\nMauricio Pochettino has lost Dele Alli, Harry Kane and Son Heung Min just to remind the Spurs manager that Fernando Llorente can't be trusted in a forward line.\n\nChelsea also lack a decent No. 9 and anything resembling a backbone, such was their feeble showing at Arsenal.\n\nWith a midfield diamond, the Gunners were resolute, compact and tough to break down. They were decisive, certainly, but didn't delight with the same joie de vivre as Solskjaer's Red Devils. Who'd have thought it?\n\nTo sustain interest, the EPL needs a compelling title race and a United side that leave us captivated rather than comatose. Right now, we are blessed to have both.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/207d061a5da35f35e9088fb7976900b19d98e7d7c7cfcb1f1107ebf587d2f79f/np_20190122_neil22a_4568433.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Forward Marcus Rashford after scoring a goal against Brighton and Hove Albion on his 150th appearance for Manchester United.

I would ask two questions.\n\n\"Firstly, who are they going to bring in who is better than Son or Kane, who have scored almost half of their league goals?\n\n\"And, following that, will he be happy sitting on the bench when they return?\"\n\nRISKING EVERYTHING\n\nHowever, former Liverpool player and manager Graeme Souness believes Tottenham are \"risking everything\" with their lack of transfer business. Spurs are the only team in EPL history to not sign anyone during pre-season.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: \"I think Mauricio has towed the party line beyond the call of duty. They're risking everything...\n\n\"They haven't got a big enough squad... When the Tottenham subs came to warm up by us, they all looked like kids that should still be in school.\"\n\nFormer Spurs midfielder Jamie Redknapp seemed to agree, taking aim at his former team for selling Dembele.\n\nAsked about Spurs' threadbare squad, he told Sky Sports: \"I have no sympathy for Spurs because you've just sold one of the best midfield players in the league.

Usually, if you are knocked over, you put your hands straight out to break your fall.\"\n\nFormer Chelsea and Marseille striker Tony Cascarino, meanwhile, believes Salah has taken a leaf out of Cristiano Ronaldo's book when it comes to theatrics.\n\nHe wrote in his The Times column: \"He has crossed the line when it comes to his diving...\n\n\"It seems as though there is an added ruthlessness in his game, which is why he is crossing into doing whatever it takes to win games...\n\n\"Salah certainly won't be the first star name willing to cheat to gain an advantage.

He was detained when he came back here on July 15 last year.\n\nGanesan, now 61, was sentenced to four months' jail yesterday after pleading guilty to an offence under the Telecommunications Act.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Benjamin Samynathan told the court that Ganesan went to an Orchard Towers pub around midnight on Nov 13, 2004, and drank whisky until about 4am. He then went to a nearby convenience store to buy more drinks.\n\nAt around 5am, a policeman attached to the Combined Operations Room of the Singapore Police Force received a call from Ganesan, who made references to a bomb at Mr Lee's house.\n\nThe DPP added: \"The call was made by the accused from a public phone located next to the Thai Embassy. The call's message was clearly false, and the accused knew that the text of the call was false.\n\n\"A patrol car was sent to Orchard Towers to interview and arrest the accused. The accused was coherent during his interactions with the officers at the scene. Meanwhile, the officers who were already stationed at Oxley Road were told to step up patrols and be alert and vigilant.\"\n\nGanesan was charged on Nov 16, 2004, but while out on bail, he fled Singapore about two months later and came back only last year.\n\nDefence lawyers Ravinderpal Singh and James Ow Yong stated in their mitigation plea that their client was drunk when he committed the offence.\n\nThe plea also stated: \"The accused realises how alcohol has utterly destroyed his life and family, leading to his wife to divorce him, leaving him with nothing and his children to give up on him. The accused's family no longer wants anything to do with him. The offence has taken a terrible toll on the accused.\"\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The dog subsequently passed away\".\n\nAfter the initial vet visit in September 2017, the vet recommended that the dog either be treated, albeit without guarantee of recovery, or euthanised, the agency said.\n\nThe family requested for time to decide.\n\nThey opted to take the dog home with temporary pain relief medication despite the vet advising against it given the severity of the dog's condition.\n\nAfter the course of painkillers had been completed, the clinic called the family several times to convince them to bring the dog back for a review.\n\nBut they did not take the dog back, nor did they seek a second opinion, the AVA said.\n\nThe agency said: \"On top of the health issues already identified by the vet, the dog had severe bladder stones that would have caused significant pain and suffering.\n\n\"We thus found this case warranted enforcement action as the accused failed to follow up to provide adequate pain relief to the dog, leading to its unnecessary suffering.\"\n\nSPCA's executive director Jaipal Singh Gill said it was right that the dog owner was fined for his actions.\n\nHe added: \"Pet owners should be fully responsible for the well-being of their pet.\n\n\"If a person commits an act of animal cruelty or neglect, it is the duty of the authorities to step in to ensure that the individual is held responsible for his or her actions.\"\n\nOn Sunday, The Straits Times reported that one out of three pet owners who plans to give up or has given up his pet does so for reasons linked to cost.\n\nAnd these are usually medical-related, Dr Jaipal said.\n\nAccording to the AVA, 141 pets were abandoned here last year, up from 92 in 2017 and 58 in 2016.\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Korea protest against vaccine pass rule for kids\n\nMore related stories\n\nLike any such civic disruption, the Brexit vote exacts the price of economic instability.\n\nFear of this prompted me to vote to remain in the EU. That fear has spread: a poll this week showed that Remainers could outvote Brexiteers by as much as 10 per cent: a poll last month showed the gap at 18 per cent.\n\nIndications like these encourage Remainers to call for a second referendum, a proposal which could cleave British politics into two warring camps.\n\nUncertainty attends every move: Such is the nature of a popular surge seeking - peacefully - a different relationship with political power.\n\nDemocratic turmoil has also come to Europe - but not to the European Union.\n\nThe two leaders most committed to reviving a movement to greater EU integration - French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel - are themselves both much weakened at home.\n\nThe Brussels leadership of the EU - Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk - seem not to have grasped that Brexit, and the surge of France's \"gilets jaunes\" protesters, are consequential movements not just for Britain and France, but for the EU as well.\n\nHerein lies the central problem of the EU now.\n\nIt has chosen to present itself as an unbroken front of 27 states wholly united against the renegade 28th, the UK.\n\nThey have entrusted the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Mr Michel Barnier, to set out the hard facts of a deal which lays down a two-year withdrawal period in which most EU rules would continue to apply, with a severance payment of £39 billion (S$68.2 billion).\n\nYet the hard front is an illusion.\n\nThe Central European states - Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - want continued EU subsidies but recoil from its policies, especially taking a share of the immigrants within Europe.\n\nThe EU has to recognise the truth of its present condition and to work out how best to decouple from its counterproductive mission to federalise.\n\nThere should instead arise an EU of differing speeds, where neither a desire to form a federal state, nor one to retain sovereignty within nations, should be penalised, but accommodated.\n\nAn EU straitjacket now aggravates rather than solves problems, defeating its initial vision of the creation of a new world power dedicated to freedom.\n\nThe continent's rulers need to grasp what the British government has been forced to understand: that politics and economic decisions can no longer be located at a distance in institutions citizens do not understand, commanded by figures they do not know.\n\nBritain can take real pride that a messy, fraught, passionate struggle over a fundamental principle of democratic and civic life is taking place within it. It should spread across the continent.\n\nThe writer co-founded the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford.\n\nJOHN LLOYD\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He told his mother he wants to recover quickly so he can come back and shoot.\"\n\nMr Koh thanked Mindef for its quick reaction and for the assistance it has given Pang's family after the incident.\n\nMindef arranged for Pang's mother to fly to New Zealand on Sunday morning and she spoke to him in the hospital that night.\n\nPang's father and second oldest brother joined her yesterday evening. His oldest brother will fly over today. Mr Koh flew to New Zealand last night.\n\nMs Ivy Low, head of Mediacorp's The Celebrity Agency, who was at yesterday's press conference, said Pang would have many future opportunities after he recovers fully.\n\n\"He is still young,\" she said.\n\n\"Whenever he is ready, we will be ready for him.\"\n\nBy\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\naloysius pang\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 20, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nCast honours Aloysius Pang as show goes on\n\nFeb 11, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nNg Eng Hen: No malfunction with howitzer gun-lowering mechanism\n\nJan 30, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nState Court-nominated judge to chair COI probing Pang's death\n\nJan 30, 2019, 02:43am\n\nFamily, friends, colleagues and fans bid goodbye to Aloysius Pang\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It's not easy carrying a kavadi for 3km but the upbeat devotional songs boosted my energy and spirit, helped to take my mind off the fatigue and stay focused on completing my vows.\"\n\nHe was carrying a decorated steel and wood kavadi pinned to his torso with hooks and piercings, while a dozen hooks pierced into each thigh had tiny containers filled with red sugar offerings.\n\nMr Murali was one of more than 250 kavadi-bearers and 8,600 devotees carrying pots as offerings in the celebration to honour Lord Murugan, who represents virtue, youth and power, and is the destroyer of evil.\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nThe kavadi-bearers were accompanied by musicians playing traditional Indian percussion instruments, including the ganjira drum and one of either a thavil, dhol or khol.\n\nMore than 20,000 people, including devotees, took part in the procession that attracted crowds of Singaporeans and tourists.\n\nIn 1973, the playing of all music at the festival was banned after fights among competing groups.\n\nBut over the years, steps have been taken to allow music, noted Home Affairs and Law Minister K . Shanmugam.\n\nMr Shanmugam, who joined in the celebrations, told reporters that feedback from people about the new music rules has been \"very positive\".\n\nThaipusam, which typically takes place in a 24-hour period, came to an end at 11.30pm.\n\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu was the guest of honour at the celebrations yesterday morning, where she visited both temples: Sri Srinivasa Perumal and Sri Thendayuthapani.\n\nSHABANA BEGUM\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He's the ice-breaker for us to get into the turf club,\" said Elite Performance Stable's Aloysius Chew.\n\n\"Moving forward, we have already acquired supposedly good horses and this year we are going to compete at a higher level, so we hope to be able to win again this year.\"\n\nElite Invincible, however, failed to win the other category he was nominated for - the Champion Miler Award, which went to the deserving Cliff Brown-trained Debt Collector, the 2016 Horse of the Year.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nBarree Stable's Debt Collector received more votes, principally for his victory in a race for three-year-olds and upwards - the $1 million Group 1 Raffles Cup over 1,600m - while Elite Invincible's mile success - the $1 million Group 1 Giovanni Racing Charity Bowl - was restricted to four-year-olds.\n\nThe Charity Bowl was the middle leg of the Singapore Four-Year-Old Challenge. Elite Invincible also captured the first leg - the $500,000 Group 2 Stewards' Cup over 1,400m - but was beaten by the Hideyuki Takaoka-trained Jupiter Gold in the final leg - the $1.15 million Group 1 Emirates Singapore Derby over 1,800m.\n\nIt was no-brainer that the Champion Four-Year-Old Award was his for the taking on his superb run in the series.\n\nElite Invincible capped his great season by lifting the blue riband of Singapore racing - the $1.35 million Group 1 Dester Singapore Gold Cup over 2,000m - on Nov 11 and that certainly put the 2018 Horse of the Year crown on the bay gelding's head.\n\nDebt Collector also ended the year on a high, with a superb come-from-behind victory in the $1 million Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Cup over 1,800m, also an open race for three-year-olds and upwards.\n\nThe Raffles Cup and Queen Elizabeth II Cup were the first two legs of the Singapore Triple Crown Series. Debt Collector stood to win a $300,000 bonus if he were to win the Dester Singapore Gold Cup, but his connections did not want to risk their champion in the gruelling race with a crippling weight in the handicap affair.\n\nBut Debt Collector, now six years of age, was duly rewarded by racing away with his second title of the night - the Champion Older Horse Award.\n\nIf he had taken part in the Gold Cup and won with the grandstand on his back, the script would have been different. He would certainly have joined horses like Rocket Man and Super Easy in achieving two Horse of the Year titles.\n\nIB Racing Stable's Maximus was the other with a grand double, taking the Champion Polytrack Horse and Most Improved Horse awards.\n\nThe alternate track specialist's crowning glory came on the last day of the 2018 season on Dec 9, when he captured the $175,000 Group 3 Colonial Chief Stakes over 1,600m.\n\nThe Champion Two-Year-Old, Champion Three-Year-Old and Champion Sprinter Awards went to Group 2 Aushorse Golden Horseshoe winner Lim's Lightning, Group 1 Singapore Guineas winner Mr Clint and dual Lion City Cup winner Lim's Cruiser respectively. It was Lim's Cruiser's second Champion Sprinter title.\n\nThe awards were decided by a panel comprising the Singapore Turf Club handicapping panel, its TV broadcasting team and members of the media.\n\nNominees for the various awards were shortlisted primarily on the basis of their performances in Group and feature races.\n\nThe two Racing Media Awards (English and Chinese) were selected by the Association of Racehorse Trainers Singapore.\n\nFormerly known as the Singapore Racing Awards, about 330 people from the local and foreign racing fraternity attended last night's gala event, which was hosted and coordinated by the Customer Care Department of the Singapore Turf Club.

But,with Placais' departure from Kranji, Takaoka seems to have now hit it off with Lerner in 2019.\n\nBefore Across The Sea, the new partnership scored with Carnelian and In Bocca Al Lupo.\n\nThe early signs of a link-up actually surfaced last year when Lerner, who moved from Germany to Kranji in September, had In Bocca Al Lupo among his two 2018 winners.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nRaced by In Bocca Al Lupo's Big Valley Stable as well, Across The Sea was given a peach of a ride from Lerner in the $70,000 RDA Cup 2019, a Kranji Stakes C race over 1,600m which had garnered only eight runners.\n\nAfter a decent start, the Japanese-bred seven-year-old looked well within himself as he took up a one-out one-back position, about three lengths off the leader Panache.\n\nHe did seem to be plodding on the one spot going around the second turn, but hard ridden by Lerner, he eventually let down with a sizzling turn of foot inside the last 300m to beat Mighty Emperor by 1-1/2 lengths.\n\nTakaoka was obviously glad he had found an able pair of hands for his yard, even if Lerner has taken a while to get \"acclimatised\" to Singapore racing.\n\n\"Marc's improving. He needed the experience with Singapore racing,\" he said.\n\n\"He's getting better and I'm very happy for him. I'm also very happy with the good start I've made in 2019.\"\n\nLerner said he actually thought he was not travelling well enough coming off the back to finish the race, but Across The Sea luckily got back on the bit when it mattered.\n\n\"The plan was to follow Panache as he's got pace and he had an apprentice jockey on his back. I felt he would take me far into the race,\" said Lerner.\n\n\"But, round the bend, I thought my horse was flat and not moving as well as I would have liked. I had to do some hard pushing to get him going again.\n\n\"I kept the stick in the left hand and he finally showed a good turn of foot in the last 300m. He's not very honest, as he can switch off when he is all by himself up front, you've got to time his run so he is in front only once.\"\n\nThe modest rider was again playing down his input when asked about his healthier start to 2019 compared to his laboured start last year. To him, he just needs to get his bum on more quick ones than slow ones.\n\n\"I have the chance to get on some good chances,\" said the Frenchman, who also won aboard the Daniel Meagher-trained Invincible Ryker in the Class 3 dash over the Polytrack 1,000m. \"I'm just lucky to get on good horses. I don't have much to do.\"\n\nLerner is tied with reigning champion jockey Vlad Duric and Michael Rodd on five winners, two behind leader Noh Senari, who scored his seventh win aboard Wonderful Paint.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/47c8c036058c78e6f1298b6855141a30cc62a284c01f0fe6477ec0d008df0522/np_20190122_lerner22_4567130.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "French jockey Marc Lerner giving the thumbs-up sign aboard the Hideyuki Takaoka-trained $41 winner Across The Sea in Race 5 at Kranji on Sunday.

There was a bit more there,\" said jockey Zac Purton, after the six-year-old had made all the running and kicked away for an easy three-length success.\n\nClosest behind was the talented rising star Conte, who snatched second from the Dubai World Cup Carnival-bound Southern Legend by a short head.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I thought Beauty Generation's performance last time was better than today,\" said Purton. \"But he had a bit of a let-up after the Hong Kong Mile and John had him on the way back up today. He's not far off his top and he's just shown that.\n\n\"He doesn't need to get any better, he just needs to keep doing what he's doing and that's enough.\"\n\nBeauty Generation recorded a winning time of 1min 33.51sec, winding up through two concluding 400m sectionals clocked at 22.92sec and 22.69sec.\n\n\"He's actually better on a fast speed than on a moderate speed like today because that gives the other horses a chance to sprint with him. That's why the manner perhaps wasn't as impressive today but he can only do what he's doing and he was enjoying himself in the straight.\"\n\nHong Kong's Horse of the Year is now unbeaten in his last six starts, going back to last season's impressive Champions Mile success. That April Group 1 is now the big late-season target, but the Road To Rock gelding will first aim to repeat back-to-back wins in next month's Group 1 Queen's Silver Jubilee Cup over 1,400m.\n\nMoore said he would recommend to the owner, Patrick Kwok, to go to the 1,400m Group 1 like last year.\n\nHe noted the owner's ambition is to top Viva Pataca's HK$83,197,500 (S$14.4 million) in stakes accrued. After Sunday's win, Beauty Generation has banked HK$66,387,500.\n\n\"I'd love to travel him,\" admitted Moore. \"But it's important that I fit into the route that the Kwok family wants to take. I know their Grand Final is the Champions Mile, so that's our number one focus now. My job is to get him ready for that.\n\n\"If he wins the Champions Mile, it'll be down to the family as to whether we go to Japan for the Yasuda Kinen or we put him away for next season. It's always up to the owner.\"\n\nThe Stewards' Cup is the first leg of the Hong Kong Triple Crown and Moore ruled out stepping up to 2,000m in next month's second leg, the Group 1 Citi Hong Kong Gold Cup. The final leg is the Group 1 Standard Chartered Champions & Chater Cup over 2,400m in May. - HKJC\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/11928c79d14edd94c081acabd5945d60ab1f1043956da4e2d1f6b00ad1437654/np_20190122_hk22_4565776.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Beauty Generation making all the running in Sunday’s Group 1 Stewards’ Cup, the first leg of the Hong Kong Triple Crown.

The last 100 metres he started to pull up and wait for the others but he was too good. He had that burst of speed and good horses do that.\"\n\nSize, who was saddling his first Group 1 winner since Ivictory won the Chairman's Sprint Prize last April, said: \"Beat The Clock has taken his time to break through to Group 1 level, but he always promised to do that and today the race was suitable for him and he managed to salute.\" - HKJC\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He has a great backhand and doesn't make any unforced errors on that side. It was hard to find another way to get through him.

The Japanese No. 1 endured a third five-setter in four matches to get past Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta.\n\n\"Since I guess my next opponent is watching, I'm feeling fantastic. I have never felt fresher in my life,\" Djokovic joked on court.\n\nNEVER-SAY-DIE ATTITUDE\n\nWhen told it was eighth seed Nishikori he, added: \"Thanks for the great news. I was hoping you were going to say the other guy won but well done Kei, amazing.\n\n\"I look forward to it. He's one of the quickest players on tour.\"\n\nIt was Nishikori's never-say-die attitude that saw him through a draining 5hr 5min contest, in which the opening set alone lasted 76 minutes, and emerge victorious following the 6-7 (8/10), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-4, 7-6 (10/8) win over CarrenoBusta.\n\nThe match ended on a sour note when Carreno Busta lost his head after a disputed call when leading the final tie-break 8-5. He failed to win another point and was booed from the Margaret Court Arena as he stormed off the court and angrily threw his kit bag towards the exit.\n\n\"I don't know what to say now. Very tough match. Very great match today,\" Nishikori said.\n\nEarlier, big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic defeated German prospect Alexander Zverev in a surprisingly one-sided 6-1, 6-1, 7-6(7/5) fourth-round triumph. The 16th seeded Raonic will take on Frenchman Lucas Pouille, who rallied from a set down to overcome Borna Coric 6-7(4/7), 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(7/2). - AFP, REUTERS\n\nMen's singles, quarter-finals\n\n* All ties in Singapore time\n\nToday, from 9.30am:\n\nR.

However, the Brazil international defender said the players were all behind Sarri.\n\n\"Everybody is trusting his job and everybody is with him,\" said the 31-year-old Luiz.\n\nHowever, he said pointedly there was nothing wrong with the strategy and that they just need to be sharper in front of goal.\n\n\"It is our style, it is our philosophy,\" said Luiz.\n\n\"If you asked at the beginning of the season, 'can Chelsea keep the ball?' - you would have said no. And now we are able to do that, like the best teams in the world, but then we have (to) improve our last 25 metres.\"\n\nSarri has changed things around from Conte's time at the club. Italy international Jorginho - whom he signed from Napoli - has been deployed in the central midfield role which has resulted in N'Golo Kante being moved to an unfamiliar wider role.\n\nHowever, the biggest bone of contention has been the Italian's decision to use Belgian playmaker Eden Hazard as a \"false nine\" which has apparently not been to the player's liking. Luiz, though, is full of praise for Sarri.\n\n\"What Sarri has done until now is unbelievable, amazing, because normally (for) a team to understand this philosophy you need one or two years, like Manchester City and Liverpool, who are playing very well with the ball now,\" said Luiz.\n\n\"What he has done has been amazing, so we have to try to improve the details now.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sarri feels that it wasn't a risk to have publicly bashed his players, labelling them mentally weak and difficult to motivate after the defeat by Arsenal.\n\nIn fact, he says he will always speak his mind and hopes it brings the right response from his troops, ahead of their League Cup second-leg clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Friday morning (Singapore time).\n\n\"I don't think it's risky because these guys have got a sensible head on their shoulders,\" Sarri was quoted as saying on the club's website.\n\n\"First of all, I said the players are difficult to motivate but, by the same token, there are players who are sensible, who will listen and who won't take it the wrong way... I don't really think there is a risk.\n\n\"This is my character. I'm a straight talker and this is how I speak. Sometimes when you speak in this way, it might cause a bit of upset, but it doesn't cause any lingering bitterness or anything like that.\"\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

And on Sunday, Soh Rui Yong produced further evidence that he is a man in form.\n\nFresh from being the Singaporean winner of last December's Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon, the 27-year-old broke the half-marathon national mark when he clocked 1hr 06min 46sec at the Houston Marathon in his first race of the year.\n\nThe previous national mark was held by Mok Ying Ren, who clocked 1:07:08 at the 2016 Arizona Rock & Roll Half Marathon. Soh also holds the record for the 10,000m event for which he clocked 31:15.95 at the 2014 Portland Track Festival in Oregon, United States.\n\n\"I always knew I could (break the national half-marathon record) as I know my ability,\" Soh told The Straits Times. \"The Houston course is generally very flat with very few inclines. Many Americans were there because they know this is a course where they can get fast times. Shortly after the start, packs formed.\n\n\"After 15km, I started to run my own race and those last five kilometres were probably among my fastest.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 3, 2025, 12:38am\n\n100 days to go: S'pore's swimmers gear up for World Aquatics Championships\n\nMore related stories\n\nBefore his race in Houston, he suffered from appendicitis. He has also been nursing plantar fasciitis, the swelling of tissue in his right heel, for the past two years.\n\nTo Soh, who is the 2015 and 2017 SEA Games marathon champion, his achievement at Houston had some overdue good fortune attached to it.\n\nRecalling his previous half-marathon attempts, he said: \"There was an incredible storm at the Cardiff Half Marathon in 2016. A year later, at the Marugame Half Marathon (in Japan), it was rainy and windy. Similarly at Hamburg in 2017, it was rainy and windy.\n\n\"Last year at Marugame, the race was affected by a blizzard. Even in Valencia, where it is usually sunny, the winds were so strong the palm trees were swaying. My luck at half-marathons is usually horrible.\"\n\nSoh also paid tribute to his coaches, Singaporean ActiveSG Athletics Club's distance running coach Steven Quek, and American Ben Rosario.\n\n\"Steven is a track guy while Ben is a marathon guy. Together, they helped me to produce this good performance in Houston.\"\n\nSoh will remain in Flagstaff, Arizona, until Feb 24 to continue training. He will return to Singapore for a week before going for the Tokyo Marathon on March 3.\n\nHe said: \"It's not very ideal as I would like to arrive in Japan early to get used to the time difference and conditions, but this is the best arrangement I have.\n\n\"I ran the StanChart Singapore Marathon at 80 per cent (he was recovering from posterior tibial tendinosis in his left foot); that showed that I am in good shape.\"\n\nWANG MENG MENG\n\nTeam Singapore\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 31, 2024, 11:50pm\n\nWe must carry the Team Singapore spirit forward\n\nNov 21, 2024, 10:28pm\n\nYeo Jia Min beats former world champ to reach China Masters q-finals\n\nOct 23, 2024, 11:05pm\n\nMaeder to save, invest $250,000 earned for Paris 2024 bronze\n\nOct 21, 2024, 01:17am\n\nJason Teh suffers heartbreak in Malaysia\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to cool to 6.6 per cent from a revised 6.8 per cent in 2017.\n\nWeakening activity and signs of rising unemployment underline a need for more economic support measures as Beijing wrestles with the US over trade.\n\nChinese policymakers have pledged more support this year to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown, but they have ruled out a \"flood\" of stimulus like Beijing has unleashed in the past, which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt.\n\nFURTHER SLOWDOWN\n\nWith support measures expected to take some time to kick in, most analysts believe conditions in China are likely to get worse before they get better, and see a further slowdown to 6.3 per cent this year.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, growth eased to 1.5 per cent in October-December from 1.6 per cent in the preceding period. Analysts had expected 1.5 per cent. Some analysts believe China's actual growth levels are much weaker than official data suggest.\n\nDecember data released along with GDP painted a mixed picture of the economy at the end of the year, with factory output picking up unexpectedly while investment and retail sales continued to languish.\n\nIndustrial output grew 5.7 per cent last month from a year earlier, beating expectations of 5.3 per cent and accelerating from 5.4 per cent in November despite weaker exports.\n\nFixed-asset investment rose 5.9 per cent last year, missing expectations of a 6 per cent increase and the slowest annual growth since at least 1996.\n\nRetail sales rose 8.2 per cent last month on-year, in line with forecasts. But the pace was only slightly better than November's 8.1 per cent, and it is still hovering near 151/2 year lows.\n\nA surprising contraction in December trade data last week and weak factory activity surveys have suggested the economy cooled more quickly than expected at the end of last year, leaving it on shakier footing.\n\nSources have said Beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent this year from around 6.5 per cent last year. Even if the two sides agree on a trade deal, analysts said it would be no panacea for China's economy unless it can turn around weak investment and credit growth and keep a wobbly property market on its feet. - REUTERS\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Iswaran, who is also Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, are attending the annual meeting, which starts today.\n\nAt the four-day event, the ministers will speak on various topics including the digital economy and artificial intelligence, said the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in a statement yesterday.\n\nThey will also meet government and business leaders from around the world. They will be accompanied by officials from the PMO, Finance Ministry and Ministry of Communications and Information.\n\nThe theme for this year's meeting is Globalisation 4.0: Shaping A New Architecture In The Age Of The Fourth Industrial Revolution. Delegates will have more than 300 sessions to choose from, with issues on the agenda including climate change, mental health and the rise of populism.\n\nThe event will also give business leaders the opportunity to network and strike deals with their counterparts from other countries on the sidelines of the main conference.\n\nAhead of the Davos meeting, sociologist Martin Albrow told Chinese news agency Xinhua that the new era of Globalisation 4.0 is a \"clash between an older global age and a coming, already come, digital age\".\n\n\"Globalisation itself is not something that any one person has invented or designed. It is the aggregate effect of human actions and policies,\" he said, stressing the importance of collaboration among world leaders.\n\nThe British expert also called on the international community to strengthen the rules-based world order, which he said is \"fundamental\" for cooperation to tackle challenges.\n\nThere is a huge responsibility on world leaders to address global problems together, such as the rising threat of protectionism and climate change, he added.\n\nProfessional services company PwC released a survey of more than 1,300 chief executives from around the world at the Davos meeting.\n\nIt found that nearly 30 per cent of the business leaders believe global economic growth will decline in the coming year.\n\nChief executives in Asean were even more pessimistic, with 46 per cent holding this belief.\n\nAccording to the PwC survey, Asean business leaders see trade conflicts and geopolitical and policy uncertainties as the biggest threats, and are taking a \"strong reactive approach\".\n\nMajor leaders will be missing from the Davos meeting, including US President Donald Trump, who cancelled his delegation's trip to tackle the ongoing US government shutdown, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is sending Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron will also be absent.\n\nLINETTE LAI, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Tokyo and Hong Kong was ranked 19th and 27th, respectively.\n\nWhile the US and other large nations had traditionally benefited from global talent, the report cited Singapore's \"clear focus on becoming a talent hub\" as a reason for its competitiveness.\n\nGLOBAL KNOWLEDGE SKILLS\n\nThe index showed that Singapore outdid all countries in its ability to enable and attract talent.\n\nWorkers here also topped the charts in global knowledge skills, for instance in professional, managerial, or leadership roles that require creativity and problem solving.\n\nBut it did worse than other countries in talent retention, and has room to improve sustainability and lifestyle factors for talented workers.\n\nJob agency Randstad Singapore said firms here should start offering their staff exposure to global opportunities, and be more progressive in developing and improving workplace policies to accommodate and attract talent, such as flexible work arrangements.\n\nREAD THE STRAITS TIMES TODAY\n\nNG JUN SEN, BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It has left about 800,000 federal workers unpaid - among them airport security officers, FBI agents, museum workers, and Coast Guard members.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally & has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat,\" the president tweeted.\n\n\"She is so petrified of the 'lefties' in her party that she has lost control.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S. Korea protest against vaccine pass rule for kids\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt was Mr Trump's most direct attack on Mr Pelosi since the partial government shutdown began.\n\nPointedly ignoring his personal comments, Ms Pelosi on Twitter emphasised the need to end the impasse, which has inflicted increasing pain after one month, with some government employees having to turn to food banks or local charities to get by.\n\n\"Reopen the government, let workers get their paychecks and then we can discuss how we can come together to protect the border. #EndTheShutdown,\" she tweeted.\n\nWhile Ms Pelosi and other Democrats dismissed Mr Trump's offer, Republicans insisted that it represented actual movement by the president.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who has been leading the administration's contacts with Congress, said the Senate would put the proposal to a vote as early as today.\n\nThe planned vote also reflects a shift by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. He insisted previously that he would not take up any shutdown bill unless both Mr Trump and Democratic leaders backed it.\n\nThe Trump administration - increasingly blamed by Americans for the shutdown - is trying to balance demands of those Republican hard-liners and Democrats who adamantly oppose spending the money Mr Trump wants for a wall.\n\nDemocrats have assailed Mr Trump's new offer as cynical, noting that it was he who - by ending the programme protecting 700,000 young immigrants and to expel about 300,000 others in a separate programme - had placed in jeopardy many of those for whom he now offers temporary protection.\n\nBut anti-immigrant voices also attacked Mr Trump's offer as tantamount to amnesty for the undocumented - a toxic concept for many conservatives.\n\n- AFP\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Subordinated creditors such as perpetual and preference shareholders will get nothing.\n\nHyflux chief Olivia Lum opened two town hall sessions at Hyflux Innovation Centre last Friday by addressing why she was not using her own cash to recapitalise Hyflux, despite repeated calls for her to do so.\n\nShe told shareholders: \"With SM Investments coming into the company, this is effectively a takeover and I no longer will own much shares, in fact almost no shares. So I will no longer be in the driving seat.\"\n\nLast October, SM Investments, a consortium comprising Salim Group and Medco Group, tabled a deal to invest and lend $560 million to Hyflux in exchange for a 60 per cent stake in the company once it has settled all its debts.\n\nSources told The Business Times that Ms Lum added to light applause: \"I know many people do not like to see my face any more. I'm okay, I'm prepared to step down, I just want to make sure I hand over the company properly to the new investor.\"\n\nSM Investments has left a 40 per cent equity stake on the table for Hyflux's various stakeholders to share in a rescue plan, she said, adding: \"I'm only worried for the papas and mamas, that in the case of liquidation, they will really get zero value... Without support for the rescue plan, the alternative for Hyflux will likely be liquidation.\"\n\nHyflux intends to finalise the terms of a restructuring deal by mid-February, including exactly how much in cash or equity each creditor group will be allocated.\n\nA third round of town hall meetings will be on March 13.\n\nNext month, Hyflux will go to the court to ask for approval to call a scheme meeting and all creditors will vote on the scheme of arrangement by the end of March.\n\n- THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The footage sparked outrage and led the school to issue a statement condemning the students' actions.\n\nBut Nick insisted the video was misinterpreted, leading to \"outright lies being spread about my family and me\".

I did not make any hand gestures or aggressive moves,\" Nick wrote.\n\nNick reasoned that by remaining \"motionless and calm\", he could defuse the situation.

China registered full-year growth at 6.6 per cent, down from 6.8 per cent in 2017.\n\nMr Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: \"The slowdown in China's economy will not impact this sentiment much unless a negative update on US-China trade negotiations is received. The release of Chinese GDP (gross domestic product) figures... was not a surprise, and this has been factored into asset prices.\"\n\nHe said US President Donald Trump had said over the weekend that there has been progress towards a deal with China, and markets are trending towards believing that negotiations are moving in the right direction.\n\nCMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang also thought the STI is challenging a resistance level at around 3,225, following its longest bull strike in more than a year. Early yesterday, she commented that the index shows signs of being overbought, and that there could be some profit-taking at current levels. This comes as the releases of fourth-quarter corporate earnings are picking up momentum and gradually painting a clearer picture of the economic outlook.\n\nIG Asia market strategist Pan Jingyi agreed she would be cautious in trading the short-term uptrend - not just for the STI, but also the Hang Seng index - from a technical perspective as prices approach resistance.\n\nOn the Singapore bourse, about 1.79 billion shares worth $916.71 million in total changed hands. Gainers outnumbered losers 207 to 183.\n\nDuring the day, the STI traded above its last closing for most of the session before tanking abruptly an hour before the closing bell to 3,220.56. Sectors that traded lower included construction, commerce, properties and mining/quarrying.\n\nPenny stocks dominated volume trading. Among the most active counters were JCG Investment, which finished flat at $0.003; Rex International, down 0.1 cent to eight cents; and Ezion Holdings, flat at $0.053.\n\nOther actives include Genting Singapore, up two cents to $1.10, and LionGold, flat at $0.001.\n\nJardine-related companies, property developers and financial institutions featured among the steepest decliners. Shares of Jardine Cycle & Carriage fell 1.6 per cent to $36.46; Jardine Matheson fell 0.4 per cent to US$66.58 (S$90).\n\nDBS Bank retreated 0.5 per cent to $25.01, while United Overseas Bank lost 0.4 per cent to $26.43.\n\nCity Developments fell 1.6 per cent to $8.84, while UOL lost 1.2 per cent to $6.61.\n\nThis followed news over the weekend that three condominium projects - the first launches this year - saw over one-third of their released units sold.\n\nObservations from analysts were mixed, ranging from describing the results as \"very, very cautious\" sentiment, to optimism that there is still demand after cooling measures.\n\nSingapore banks are expected to serve up lukewarm results in the coming earnings season, as higher net interest margins offset a slowdown in yield expansion and loan growth.\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nLEE MEIXIAN\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

We're looking basically at an average of almost US$70 a barrel for Brent in 2019,\" ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson said.\n\n\"I am getting increasingly concerned about how tight the market will be going into 2020.\"\n\n- REUTERS\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

How can we bring it into the future?'\"\n\nThat includes the biggest streetwear guru of them all, Louis Vuitton's Virgil Abloh, fashion's hottest property at the moment.\n\nThe first African-American to lead a major French luxury brand, he sent rappers out in suits and ties in the star-studded show for his Off-White label.\n\n\"I am always the streetwear guy,\" Abloh told reporters, lamenting being stereotyped.\n\n\"But in culture, you are supposed to lead.\"\n\nAnd that is what top designers like Kim Jones at Dior Homme, Dries Van Noten, Junya Watanabe and Sean Suen have been trying to do with the suit and jacket in Paris.\n\nIt is all about making 21st-century tailoring \"more now\", Jones said.\n\nA master of giving luxury clothes a streetwise edge, the Briton said he wanted to make \"Dior's classic black suit a bit cooler and a bit more fashion\".\n\nPop star-oriented Balmain also blinged up the dinner jacket and the classic two-piece, while Givenchy too is dipping a toe into top-end male tailoring.\n\nEven the avant-garde American Rick Owens, the granddaddy of the oversized trend, which has seen men swaddled in vast duvet coats in recent seasons, returned to the fitted jacket fold.\n\nHis glam rock collection about the \"glory of lust and vice\" was sleek, sexy and highly masculine.\n\nParis men's fashion week finished on Sunday with superstar designer Hedi Slimane - the \"sultan of slim\" - presenting the first menswear collection for Celine, which has up to now dressed only women.\n\nTIGHT, ULTRA TAILORED\n\nHe stayed true to his tight ultra-tailored style, with rake-like male models wearing a panoply of Slimane staples such as 1960s-style English suits with pencil-thin ties, although the show saw him lowering the suit hem, a move away from the pinched jackets now a la mode.\n\nSlimane has always been a true believer in tailoring, as has Kris Van Assche, who showed his first collection for luxury men's outfitters Berluti on Friday after more than a decade at Dior.\n\nHe said: \"Rather than accepting that all people want to wear is sweatshirts and jeans, I want to claim back the idea of tailoring, a new tailoring, one that talks to young people.\"\n\nLike Van Assche, Japanese veteran Watanabe used older models for his joyous \"Silver Swagger\" show, taking inspiration from how middle-aged hipsters can make a suit sing by mixing tightly cut blazers and tweed jackets with turned-up jeans.\n\nYet, Vogue's Leitch wondered if the trend would change much in the real world. Designers have a \"romantic attachment to tailoring\", he said.\n\n\"It has its own language, and it is a great pleasure to go back and play with the codes.\"\n\nIn a time when a \"kid from Albuquerque can get as many likes on Instagram as Dior\", Leitch said the street sets the tone for what most of us wear.\n\nEven so, he said Ermenegildo Zegna, \"reputedly the world's biggest suit company, turning over billions every year\", recently bought Thom Browne, the highly tailored and brilliantly far-out American brand which showed in Paris on Saturday.\n\n\"Whatever about who is setting the zeitgeist, the market is there,\" Leitch said. - AFP\n\nFrench labels say 'lingerie rocks' in age of #MeToo\n\nFourteen top French lingerie labels staged a huge rock concert-cum-fashion show on Sunday in the city that invented sexy underwear.\n\nLingerie Rocks, the musical extravaganza in Paris that came right in the middle of the first Paris fashion fortnight of the year, set out to show that in the era of #MeToo, lingerie \"was about making women feel good about themselves\".\n\nCreations by five rising young designers were also featured in the song-and-dance spectacular, which aimed to showcase what is an almost completely female-dominated industry.\n\nMs Karine Sfar of the French lingerie federation said women wanted comfort more than anything - whether they wore lingerie for seduction or support.\n\nSales of push-up bras and G-strings have been on the slide as women go for a more natural feel and look, according to the industry, which has a turnover of nearly €2 billion (S$3 billion) in France.\n\n\"All women regardless of their body shape have the right to feel beautiful and feel good about themselves. Lingerie helps you feel at ease,\" Ms Sfar said.\n\nSales of French lingerie are growing.\n\nNew fabrics, 3D design and rigorous testing on \"real women\" mean that most garments now \"felt like a second skin\", Ms Sfar said.\n\n\"The aim is that a woman might even forget what she is wearing,\" she added. - AFP\n\nFashion\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 3, 2025, 02:46pm\n\n'I want my sister to live': Local fashion label The Closet Lover to shut amid co-founder's health scare\n\nAug 29, 2024, 09:01am\n\nWould you spend $820 on a lollipop holder?\n\nAug 8, 2024, 09:00am\n\nAfter Hong Kong to Orchard Road, next stop: Milan and Paris\n\nApr 21, 2024, 02:21pm\n\nStar Awards 2024 Walk of Fame: Best and worst dressed\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c1cdcfb9ffcb5168ce7a8ffb0fe006d331ef4a7b0ee51ae9b48de72118f5e7d1/np_20190122_2suits225p06_4567555.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Creations from (from left) Kris Van Assche, Hedi Slimane, Kim Jones and Balmain Homme.

Here are painless ways to break into them\n\nTry these simple hacks for comfortable shoes this Chinese New Year\n\nShare this article\n\nWe all love buying new shoes, and Chinese New Year gives us the perfect excuse - until we put them on and remember what a pain it is to break them in.\n\nHere are three problems you will face with any new pair of footwear, and three easy hacks to help you find some relief.\n\nSLIPPERY SOLES\n\nNew soles tend to be more slippery because they are so smooth. This is problematic because you have to spend more effort gripping with your toes, which places a lot of strain on your feet.\n\nSolution: Use sandpaper\n\nThis technique is easy and inexpensive, but it will break your heart if you had splashed out on that pair of designer shoes.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 1, 2025, 07:57am\n\nCustomer's dispute with Singapore fashion brand over wardrobe malfunction goes viral\n\nMore related stories\n\nFiling the soles with sandpaper will soften them and create marks and nooks that are necessary for a better grip, which in turn gives you more traction and reduces the likelihood of sending you tumbling to the ground.\n\nSolution: Spray on a layer of anti-slip coating\n\nIf your shoes sport coloured soles (think Christian Louboutin) and you baulk at scuffing that beautiful surface with sandpaper, coat the soles with an invisible adhesive spray. It is not cheap, but it is a great option that does not leave any noticeable trace.\n\nSolution: Hairspray\n\nA cheaper alternative to an adhesive spray will be hairspray. It works the same way when you spritz it on your soles. But there is a caveat - it will wear off once there is direct contact with water, so you will have to reapply it.\n\nA SIZE TOO SMALL\n\nWe have all done this before - we went ahead with a purchase even though the shoes are not our size, just because we have been wanting them for too long.\n\nSolution: Hairdryer\n\nThis is a method most people swear by. Put on some chunky socks and grab your hairdryer.\n\nSlip into your new shoes and aim the hairdryer (set to warm) at areas that feel particularly tight for about 30 seconds.\n\nWhile your shoes are still hot and malleable, walk around the room briskly for a minute to loosen them. Continue blowing and walking until you feel they are comfortable enough for an afternoon out.\n\nThe heat will loosen the fabric of the shoes, while the socks will stretch it out.\n\nSolution: Freeze overnight\n\nFill two plastic bags with water and squeeze them inside your shoes until they reach the toe areas but be gentle. You do not want to cause the bags to tear. Stick your shoes in the freezer overnight. The water will freeze and expand, stretching the toe areas in a fuss-free manner.\n\nRemember to fill the bags with water only up to the midway point to give them space for expansion. Fill too much and they might burst. Start small with this method in case you overstretch your shoes.\n\nSolution: Get a shoe stretcher\n\nIf you have a new pair of leather shoes (like lambskin, cowhide and suede) and you are afraid of trying out the above two methods for fear of ruining them, seek the right tools.\n\nBuy two shoe stretchers and leave them in your shoes overnight.\n\nYou might also need to coat your shoes with a stretching spray, which will penetrate the material and allow the stretchers to work better. Leather is supple, so the stretchers will help expand the material and give more room for your feet.\n\nThis works only if you wish to expand your shoes by half a size. Any larger and you will probably need a new pair of kicks.\n\nBLISTERS AND CRAMPS\n\nSometimes even when a pair is in the perfect size, chafing still occurs because of friction between your feet and the shoes, causing painful blisters or abrasions that make walking an excruciating task.\n\nSolution: Applying petroleum jelly\n\nBefore you put on your new pair of shoes, apply some petroleum jelly like Vaseline on potential problem areas (both on your feet and in your shoes), such as your heels, little toes and the edge of the balls of your feet.\n\nThe jelly acts as a protective barrier against any potential friction, ensuring your strolls are pain-free. Grab it in a pocket size so that you can keep it handy at all times, in case you need to reapply throughout the day.\n\nSolution : Dip it in a bucket of water\n\nThis method works better for dark hues so do not try this with your light-coloured shoes.\n\nDunk your new shoes into a bucket of water for five minutes before immediately towelling them dry to prevent any chance of discolouration.\n\nWear them out after that, preferably for at least an hour.\n\nWith this method, the water molecules absorbed by your leather footwear would aid in the moulding of the shoes, allowing them to expand faster.\n\nBut before attempting this method, give it a test run by dropping a bit of water on a small area to see if the colour runs. Try this on the insides of your shoes so if it happens to stain, it will not be visible.\n\nSolution: Tape your third and fourth toes together\n\nThese two toes have more sensitive nerve endings, so taping them together with paper tape will redistribute the pressure.\n\nShoes that have closed and pointed tips naturally cause the most pain as they squeeze your toes tightly together.\n\nTaping will reduce the stress and at the same time, reduce friction caused by your toes rubbing against each other.

We see synergies that the manager can extract post-consolidation, which will be the focus this year.\n\nWe see low-hanging fruit coming from cost synergies from an enlarged platform that can be tapped, and stronger access to capital markets backed by a strong sponsor in ESR.\n\nOur estimates are lower than consensus on the back of more conservative reversion assumptions. Despite the current market uncertainty, we find comfort in ESR-Reit's ability to deliver higher earnings organically on the back of expected positive rental reversions this year.\n\nWe understand that passing rents across its portfolio (except the light industrial space) are generally at or below market levels, ensuring that earnings downside risk is minimised.\n\nThere is also untapped potential for ESR and Viva Industrial Trust's respective asset portfolios - including at least two assets with unutilised gross floor area and several others with potential for conversion into higher-spec facilities.\n\nOne of the immediate benefits arising from the merger would be the enlarged Reit's ability to be more active on this front, which can boost shareholder value.\n\nTHAI BEVERAGE | BUY (MAINTAINED)\n\nJAN 21 CLOSE: S$0.735\n\nTARGET PRICE: S$0.80\n\nUOB Kay Hian Research, Jan 21\n\nThis year looks set to be a big year for ThaiBev, with expectations of a domestic consumption recovery along with the Thai elections.\n\nInitial signs from various internal and external factors bode well in lifting ThaiBev's prospects as seen in the recent price rally.\n\nThe counter remains attractive with value to be unlocked from Sabeco, as well as a decent yield of 3.3 per cent.\n\nBeer volume in Thailand rose in the last quarter to 169 million litres (+15 per cent y-o-y) and 227 million litres (+16.1 per cent y-o-y) in October and November 2018 respectively, said the Office of Industrial Economics. Towards the year-end, volumes are usually seasonally stronger, and due to a low-base effect, there looks to be some festive cheer in domestic consumption.\n\nAccording to Bangkok Post, the Commerce Ministry is pledging to shore up key farm products this year if their prices fall below the targets set by the ministry.\n\nThese include introducing measures such as linking with fresh markets to assist in product distribution. While only certain farm produce is affected, the measures may alleviate farmers' fears of depressed prices, and in turn, slow the slide in rural consumption.\n\nMeanwhile, the Thai elections have been earmarked for Feb 19.\n\nHowever, recent developments indicate that a delay can be expected with the 150-day deadline set on May 5. The elections have been a key event in spurring consumption, as in the case for beer.\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

Three of them tell CHEOW SUE-ANN why they made the switch\n\nShare this article\n\nMr Dave Hio, 46, was a sales and operations manager in the marine and offshore sector, managing a team of over 100 people.\n\nBut in 2017, he felt he was ready for a different type of challenge.\n\nThe mechanical engineering graduate holds a degree from Glasgow University and a master's from the National University of Singapore.\n\nAfter working for 22 years - 10 in the defence industry and 12 in the marine and offshore industry - he wanted a job where he could help others.\n\nHe felt like he was not getting satisfaction from work, and he said: \"It was just all about selling people something, sometimes not even things they need or want, and it was all about meeting targets.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 10, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nHaikini founder: Big part of business is being vulnerable\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe father of twoknew he needed a job switch to be happy, si he turned to the healthcare sector.\n\nMr Hio is currently undergoing training at the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.\n\nHe is part of the inaugural batch of 34 trainees, and they will graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing upon completion of the two-year accelerated programme next year.\n\nMr Hio said: \"You might start at the bottom, but as you learn and are able to gain expertise, the respect will be earned.\"\n\nHe said the career switch was not as shocking as many might expect.\n\nThere were transferable skills he could bring over from his previous job.\n\nMr Hio said: \"Like in sales, there is a need to target the approach towards different clients. In the same way, I am able to adjust the way I approach each patient, deciding what would work best for each person.\"\n\nCOMPASSION\n\nHe said that since starting his nursing course about half a year ago, he has found himself learning to be more compassionate and sympathetic.\n\nHe added: \"In engineering, you don't need to think about how machines feel or understand them. But I have since learnt to understand people and their circumstances better.\"\n\nHe said the biggest difference was having to give up his previous pay package.\n\nWhile his wife was initially hesitant about the switch, she supported him after understanding that his new career would help him feel more fulfilled and happy.\n\nHe said: \"It is never too late to do what you like, and sometimes you just have to take that leap of faith.\n\n\"Even at training, every day I feel appreciated.\n\n\"And having the immediate feedback from patients helps me feel like I am learning every day and gives me that sense of accomplishment.\"\n\nHe saw 'textbook come to life' when son had jaundice\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nHe had wanted to be a nurse after completing his A-level examinations.\n\nBut Mr Muhammad Rusydi, 31, was not accepted into the course, so he studied economics and management at the Singapore Institute of Management.\n\nHe then worked in sales.\n\nLast year, just as he was about to welcome his child, Mr Rusydi was given a second chance to pursue his dream.\n\nHe said: \"Seeing my mother, who was a dedicated nurse for over 30 years, and all the cards and appreciation she got from her patients, inspired me.\"\n\nWhen the option to re-enter university to study to be a nurse opened up, he jumped at the chance, despite knowing that he was in for a big lifestyle change.\n\nMr Rusydi says his training as a nurse has also helped him be a better father. For example, he now knows how to bathe his three-month-old son.\n\nHe said: \"My child was hospitalised for severe jaundice, and we happened to be studying that topic at the time.\n\n\"It was like seeing everything from my textbook come to life.\"\n\nBut making the switch has not been easy, he said.\n\nHe recounted a comment that stuck with him: \"Why do you study so hard at NUS (National University of Singapore) just to be a nurse?\"\n\nHe added: \"This perception of nurses not needing a degree, or of nursing as something anybody can do, is still out there.\n\n\"All we can do is to learn and show (the naysayers) that the knowledge and experience counts towards something.\"\n\n- CHEOW SUE-ANN\n\nBiomedical sciences graduate makes switch to become nurse\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nShe always wanted to be a nurse but the thought of gruesome injuries put her off, initially.\n\nBut after hearing the happy stories from her younger sister, a nurse, of patients who had recovered from illness, Joan Lim, 30, eventally made the jump.\n\nThe biomedical sciences graduate saw an opening for the degree programme and decided to make the switch.\n\nShe said: \"I have always wanted to work with patients in a ward setting, to be able to follow them through their treatment.\n\n\"To know they trust me to help them in their most private moments, to me, that is really humbling.\n\n\"That they trust me, a stranger, to take care of them.\"\n\nMs Lim came from a healthcare background, working as an embryologist where she mostly worked with patients who had reproductive health issues.\n\nShe was aware nursing was not easy, especially with difficult patients and family members to deal with.\n\nShe said: \"When people are worried or in pain, they won't stop to think whether the nurse has a degree.\n\n\"They might think they are paying (for our service) so they can say anything.\n\n\"But when things are tense, I want to be able to convey to families that their relatives are in good hands and give them a sense that we have the knowledge to help.\"\n\n- CHEOW SUE-ANN\n\nMid-career job opportunities in growth sectors\n\nBy\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nRead articles by Cheow Sue-Ann\n\nThe Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for nursing was launched in February last year under the Adapt and Grow initiative.\n\nIt aims to provide mid-career Singaporeans with a pathway to enter the healthcare sector as a registered nurse.\n\nAfter completing the two-year accelerated course, the 34 trainees will receive a bachelor's degree in nursing and a placement in the healthcare sector.\n\nThis PCP is one of the mid-career conversion programmes under the Healthcare PCP umbrella offered by Workforce Singapore (WSG), with the Ministry of Health.\n\nApplications for the August 2019 intake is open until Jan 31.\n\nAt the launch last February, WSG chief executive Tan Choon Shian said: \"(The programme) is especially important as we strive to meet growing manpower needs in the growth sectors such as healthcare and help mid-career Singaporeans take on new job opportunities in these growth sectors.\"\n\nOther than nursing, WSG also offers mid-career professional conversion programmes in a variety of sectors, including aerospace, accountancy and precision engineering.\n\nWSG offers professional conversion programmes both for current degree holders as well as mid-career Singaporeans with A-level and diploma qualifications.\n\nMore information can be found on the PCP website.\n\n-

We'll continue to do that - the needs in those areas are growing.\n\n\"At the same time, the needs for better security, and better ability to defend ourselves, are also growing.\"\n\nThe Budget will focus on these key areas as well as in transforming Singapore's economy, he said.\n\nWhile Budget 2019 is Mr Heng's fourth as finance minister, it will be his first since he was named as the ruling People's Action Party's first assistant secretary-general - setting the stage for his anticipated succession as Singapore's next prime minister.\n\nYesterday, Mr Heng gave a quick overview of some key challenges that Singapore faces.\n\nThe Budget's \"one simple aim\" is to improve the lives of Singaporeans, and \"the needs are very large, whether it is building big-scale infrastructure projects, like our MRT lines or the airport, or especially our Housing Board flats, or whether it is taking care of our seniors, and in fact all Singaporeans\".\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of keeping Singapore's economy vibrant amid global uncertainties and rapid technological changes.\n\nMr Heng added that Singapore has to be \"very watchful about global developments\", when asked how the recent rejection of the Brexit deal could affect Singapore.\n\nLast Tuesday, British MPs threw out Prime Minister Theresa May's deal for Britain's departure from the European Union, which is scheduled to take place on March 29.\n\nMr Heng cited developments such as the new risks building up in the global economy, be it Brexit or the protectionist movement growing around the world.\n\nHe added: \"People's support for globalisation is weakening because there is a sense that globalisation has left some people behind. And unfortunately, some of the developments are negative, even for their own country, even for people who advocated a particular course of action, they are now regretting it.\n\n\"It just shows that when we make economic policies, we have to be very very thoughtful of the long-term implications, and that we cannot avoid doing the difficult things.\"\n\nSingapore is on the right track by starting the process of restructuring its economy, Mr Heng added.\n\n\"It is not easy, a lot of hard work goes into companies transforming themselves, a lot of hard work by workers to learn new skills.

By injecting a fresh digital element into the traditionally cash-and-carry environment of a street bazaar, we hope to introduce technology to digitalise and elevate the classic bazaar experience.\"\n\nMr Bryan Goh, 28, co-founder of Native, said its app has already seen hundreds of downloads.\n\n\"We're getting huge exposure. I believe that in the coming days, there will be an uptake in bookings through our app,\" he said.\n\nThe bazaar will be on until Feb 4, while the street light-up will last until March 6.\n\nBENSON ANG, LIFESTYLE CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage-taking.\"\n\nEven before Mr Trump spoke, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said his offer as reported in advance was \"unacceptable\", did not \"represent a good-faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives\", and was unlikely to gain the votes needed to pass the House or the Senate.\n\nAbout a quarter of the US government has been partially shut down since Dec 22 as funding has expired for reasons mostly unrelated to the border or immigration.

That's the best way to serve our people.\"\n\nDr Ng said the most important takeaway is that \"we have avoided coming to blows\".\n\nHe added: \"It's always better to settle disagreements through peaceful talks, negotiations and discussions.\"\n\nSingapore disputes Malaysia's claim that the new Instrument Landing System (ILS) and ILS Approach Procedures for Singapore's Seletar Airport will affect the development of Pasir Gudang town in Johor.\n\nBoth countries are also entangled in a maritime dispute following Malaysia's decision to expand Johor Bahru's port limits. The issue was escalated when Malaysian government vessels moved into Singapore waters.\n\nOfficials from the two countries will meet in the coming weeks to discuss the ongoing disputes.\n\nMELODY ZACCHEUS\n\nSingapore Politics\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 5, 2025, 12:36am\n\nPAP scouting early for next GE to give candidates more time on ground: PM Wong\n\nMay 21, 2025, 10:39pm\n\n5 key takeaways from PM Lawrence Wong's Cabinet reshuffle\n\nMay 13, 2025, 02:43am\n\nPAP to set up new branches in at least 6 locations, including Punggol, Tampines and Tengah\n\nMay 4, 2025, 11:49pm\n\nPAP leaders pledge to draw lessons from GE2025, focus on unity and global risks\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/792d5e6dd2a1b9dabce7889ae279cc1f911a1d588b10c773728273395ec95ad1/NP_20190121_MZNG21_4565824.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen.

ADELINE TAN and DAVID SUN speak to two offenders getting treatment now\n\nShare this article\n\nHe was at his void deck taking cannabis when a police officer arrested him.\n\nRecalling the incident, which happened in January last year, Farhan (not his real name) said he kept silent because he knew what he had done.\n\nHe said: \"I just asked him if he could bring me home. I wanted to see my family... before they took me away.\"\n\nFarhan, 30, started with cough syrup and sleeping pills, before trying heavier substances.\n\nFarhan had served another stint at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) when he was arrested in 2011, but relapsed 15 months after his release.\n\nAt the DRC, inmates like Farhan go through rehabilitation programmes like psychology-based correctional programmes and skills training.\n\nHe said: \"My family, not the friends I did drugs with, visit me. They come whenever they can, even if they are unwell.\n\n\"My mother has a heart problem. But I can tell she's trying to pretend she's well enough to come and see me. I want to change for them.\"\n\nFollowing the changes in the Misuse of Drugs Act passed in Parliament last Tuesday, those who have committed only drug offences will be eligible for the DRC.\n\nPreviously, those who had offended more than two times were jailed under long-term (LT) imprisonment, which means a minimum term of at least five years with three strokes of the cane.\n\nThis will see one in two liable for LT imprisonment eligible to be sent to the DRC instead.\n\nAs of 2018, the LT inmate population was 4,145, while the DRC population was 1,461.\n\nIn 2017, about 45 per cent of DRC inmates were repeat offenders, with this number expected to rise in the short term with the implementation of the changes.\n\nBut hardened addicts will see longer, more intensive rehabilitation programmes, said Ms Lau Kuan Mei, assistant director of the correctional rehabilitation services.\n\nShe said: \"We want to increase the chances for them to practise the skills taught... but we will review these programmes based on the needs of the drug offenders here.\"\n\nSuperintendent Soh Yen Li of Institution B5, a DRC within the Changi Prison Complex, said: \"One of the critical factors that we should have is also to build on their motivation to change, and at the end of the day they must adopt that pro-active approach to want to change.\"\n\nAnother DRC inmate who spoke to the media was Alan (not his real name). Previously a cook, Alan, 27, had his first stay in DRC in 2013 after he was caught consuming methamphetamine.\n\n\"It was my father who reported me, and I really hated him for that,\" he said.\"When he finally came to see me after a few months, I cried and thanked him for reporting me.\"\n\nHe stayed clean for five years after his release, working hard and opening his own chicken rice stall in Yishun.\n\nBut he also suffered a relapse when he hung out with old friends. It started with cough syrup, then he was back on Ice.\n\nAlan is expected to complete his second stint in the DRC in about a month. He said: \"The sessions and classes they give in DRC are very useful. But ultimately, I have to be the one to decide to be a better person.\"\n\nBy\n\nAdeline Tan\n\nRead articles by Adeline Tan\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nAchieve Meaningful Career Growth With These Realistic Goals\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f55cfacaca1feac3a7877d3144bd273829e851dbd1d59da121fedb771a6accb3/NP_20190121_ATDRUGS21Y58M_4565668.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Superintendent Soh Yen Li of a DRC within the Changi Prison Complex.

Focus on Pep Guardiola's body language.\n\nFor much of Manchester City's 3-0 win against Huddersfield last night, the Spaniard was often more animated than his strangely lethargic players.\n\nGuardiola rubbed his forehead. He glared at the ground and cursed his shoes. He pulled his scarf high over his neck, perhaps hiding the throbbing veins.\n\nHe knew what others were presumably thinking. City won't close the gap on Liverpool playing like this. If anything, the Reds are likely to increase their advantage and disappear over the silvery horizon line.\n\nAll title challengers are allowed the occasional off-day.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nLiverpool were rather fortunate to pinch the points against Crystal Palace a day earlier, forcing Juergen Klopp to admit that his overwhelming emotion was relief.\n\nGuardiola's emotion was presumably somewhat different, particularly in his half-time team-talk. Anger, frustration and confusion all leap to mind.\n\nNeither City nor Liverpool reached anything resembling a peak over the weekend and the gap remains four points, but only one side appeared genuinely jaded and pedestrian.\n\nIn the case of City, context is more important than the scoreline. Before kick-off, the chances of a Huddersfield victory was considered less likely than Brexit being reversed and the American President's border wall being built on the same day.\n\nPoor Huddersfield were without a manager, bottom of the table with only 13 goals in 22 games and given the longest odds of a home win in English Premier League history.\n\nBookies have made them 1/33 to be relegated. They were never going to beat City.\n\nAnd yet, inexplicably, the hosts were still in the game until the 54th minute, when Raheem Sterling nodded in City's decisive second goal.\n\nDanilo had struck the first in the 18th minute, via a wicked Christopher Schindler deflection, but the champions were rarely comfortable.\n\nIndeed, Sterling's header was harsh on Huddersfield, considering he was in an offside position, marginally, but he'll argue that justice was done for the clear penalty he wasn't given in the first half.\n\nBut they were minor details, along with Leroy Sane's tap-in for City's third in the 56th minute. The bigger picture is a patchier one.\n\nBANANA SKINS\n\nCity and Liverpool both prevailed against minor opposition, but the Reds might be allowing themselves a sly grin.\n\nThe gap hasn't changed and City enjoyed the greater margin of victory, improving their goal difference, but another game has gone and the Reds appear less weary.\n\nSuddenly, the banana skins shift to Manchester. Suddenly, City's next match away to an improved Newcastle United has a degree of uncertainty, a dash of apprehension.\n\nHonestly, a repeat performance at St James' Park won't be rewarded with another victory.\n\nGuardiola's loose 4-3-3, which was mostly a 2-3-2-3 as Huddersfield retreated and hoped for the best, lacked the speed, cohesion and dynamism that defined City's games before Christmas.\n\nKevin de Bruyne, often isolated on the right wing, was rarely involved, drifting into the middle in a bid to conduct proceedings, but his baton has mostly eluded him since his return from injury.\n\nSane and Sterling both scored, which improved their stats, but their struggles to get behind fullbacks didn't improve Guardiola's mood.\n\nSane was the superior performer, earning a goal and an assist, but he was a rare beacon of creativity.\n\nSergio Aguero mostly fed off scraps, despite playing against the worst EPL side by some distance.\n\nWhen these two sides met in August, Aguero left with the matchball after a sumptuous exhibition of attacking football. The final score was 6-1.

He has the world ahead of him and can be one of the best in the world.\"\n\nThe praise for Rashford was not just coming from within Old Trafford.\n\nFormer Chelsea and Marseille striker Tony Cascarino said the youngster could be United's chief striker for the next decade.\n\nHe said on talkSPORT: \"If he gets clinical, you've got one of the best strikers in the world. That's how highly I rate Rashford.\n\n\"He's 20, 21? You can improve your finishing. You work hard on it, you do training sessions, you're with a guy (Solskjaer) that was a finisher.\n\n\"If he wins anything and works with Marcus, Marcus becomes a better player then you've got a player worth a lot of money and he can easily be the No.1 striker at United for the next decade.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy, meanwhile, said Rashford is going to be an \"absolute superstar\".\n\nHe told the BBC: \"His talent is unquestionable.

As a result, some may stop taking their medication without informing their doctor.\n\nFor such cases, there is a need for consistent home blood glucose monitoring and support from a care team in real time.\n\nFor example, home blood glucose monitoring helps to track and provide patients and caregivers with visible information on blood sugar control.\n\nThey then can see the importance of taking medication regularly and the need for other lifestyle modifications such as dietary intake and physical activity.\n\nWe need a cohesive platform where patients can easily monitor and share their readings in real time to their care provider.\n\nThe team can then advise patients on how to recognise and manage low blood sugar symptoms, and how to regulate their medication in relation to their eating habits in real time, without the need for patients to wait for their next doctor's appointment.\n\nThis can help care providers to increase patient understanding on the multi-factorial management level of diabetes and improve adherence to medication intake.\n\nWhy do patients find it difficult to change their eating behaviour ?\n\nChanging someone's dietary intake can be an uphill task, mostly because people are already accustomed to a set array of tastes and food preferences for many years before being diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nThere are other areas of concern to work around - cultural background, food dislikes, allergies, intolerances, cooking ability, family and peer support as well as work arrangement.\n\nIn my latest review of working with a group of patients with diabetes, it is not only their food intake but also their drink consumption that affected their blood glucose level - which most of them were not aware of.\n\nThere can be countless educational materials available, but patients may not be able to use them in their busy everyday lives. They face difficulties in changing their food habits overnight or after just one or two consultations with a dietitian.\n\nThey need ongoing support on a real-time platform, which helps them evaluate their actual dietary intake daily with reference to other clinical parameters such as blood sugar level.\n\nThere needs to be a level of trust and rapport built between the health providers and the patients even before enlisting them on a journey of long-term behaviour modifications.\n\nHow necessary is it to focus on promoting medication reminders and providing emotional support?\n\nWhen patient compliance to taking medication is poor, having a constant reminder or even highlighting the need for their medication intake by their care team in real time is vital, especially when it is integrated into a mobile app-friendly version.\n\nIt is also necessary for the healthcare team to take the role of coaching as well.\n\nThey should assess the level of motivation and readiness to change in every patient, and coach them based on that, providing moral support and a conducive environment for learning and behaviour change.\n\nA mobile app that links patients to their care team and doctor in real time can help achieve this.\n\nThe writer is a senior clinical dietitian at iHealth (Singapore) Labs, a digital health technology company offering mobile health devices and comprehensive chronic disease management solutions.\n\nRddhi Naidu\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3a97bc065be981c2837401068a29c21eb186ccce356df98831dba2f4ed734216/obesity_young.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "TNP PHOTO ILLUSTRATION"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The other sister, who used to struggle to move about, is also having mobility problems as her muscles have weakened and she cannot move around. They stay in a flat above the complex.\n\n\"Chinatown complex will close for 3 months from March 2019 for repair works, and it will be tough for this family of 3 without any income.\n\n\"CNY is around the corner, so if you'd like to get some new towels, do head down to the shop to get some reasonably priced cloths!\"\n\nThis pack of six hand towels is $3.50.TNP PHOTO: S M ONG\n\nCROWD\n\nDid the story about Mr Yoong and his sisters bring a tear to your eye?\n\nBecause I know a place where you can get a towel to dry it.\n\nAs an unrepentant bandwagon jumper, I decided to check out the Chinatown Complex stall myself on Saturday afternoon and possibly buy a towel or two to help the guy.\n\nBut it seemed the guy didn't need my help as a crowd had already gathered around Mr Yoong's stall when I got there.\n\nWas he selling towels or BTS merchandise?\n\nThe man had practically become an idol himself because of the viral post. That's the power of social media for ya.\n\nLooking a little overwhelmed but still in good humour, the spindly 55-year-old was telling people that all the big bath towels were sold out, but everyone made it a point to buy something else before leaving.\n\nMr Yoong has told Lianhe Zaobao he didn't want donations - just buy his towels.\n\nThe crowd at stall 183 in Chinatown Complex where Mr Yoong (above) sells his towels after a post about him went viral last week.TNP PHOTO: S M ONG\n\nWhich was what I was trying to do as I finally squeezed my way to the front of the crowd.\n\nI spotted a pack of hand towels marked $3.50 and indicated to Mr Yoong that I wanted to buy one. I thought it was $3.50 for one towel, but he handed me the whole pack of six.\n\nThat's like 58 cents a towel. I haven't bought many hand towels in my life, but I suspect that's a pretty good deal.\n\nExcept I'm not sure what I'm going to do with six hand towels.\n\nWell, I am planning to use GrabHitch for a trip to Alpha Centauri next week.\n\nAnyone wanna come along?\n\nI have spare towels.\n\nBy\n\nS M Ong\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by S M Ong\n\nHumour\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 6, 2022, 01:00am\n\nCute dog 'defends' elderly woman after man teases her with fruit\n\nDec 5, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nKhan-spiracy theories: If she is a spy, I am the next James Bond\n\nNov 21, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTraceTogether app oughta have Merli instead of otter\n\nNov 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nIs the Eternals movie racist?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cafac7fbac9a1dc0d07209cf5706404fe8ec959e02ca794d6632ee02c31dc999/NP_20190121_OSCOL21HQHA_4565112.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(Above) The crowd at stall 183 in Chinatown Complex where Mr Yoong sells his towels after a post about him went viral last week.", "caption": "(Above) The crowd at stall 183 in Chinatown Complex where Mr Yoong sells his towels after a post about him went viral last week.

Your pout can sometimes feel dry to the point that it is getting itchy, sore or swollen. If that happens, it could be a sign that something is not right.\n\nDEHYDRATION\n\nCracked lips, dry eyes, headaches and dizziness are all signs of dehydration. Make sure you are drinking at least eight glasses of water per day.\n\nBREATHING THROUGH YOUR MOUTH\n\nThe constant inhaling and exhaling of air dries out your mouth, throat and the delicate skin on your lips. Mouth breathing can also lead to other conditions like bad breath or dry cough.\n\nALLERGIC REACTION\n\nIf your lips are starting to itch and swell, it could be a sign that you are allergic to an ingredient in your lip care or cosmetic products. Certain ingredients that are added to lip balms and lipsticks to nourish and hydrate - like beeswax or vitamin E - may end up causing irritation.\n\nLICKING YOUR LIPS\n\nYour saliva contains a digestive enzyme called amylase that helps to break down food, but it can start to dry out and irritate the delicate skin on your lips if you are constantly licking them.\n\nMEDICATION\n\nCertain medications have a dehydrating effect that can cause dry lips as a side effect. Oftentimes, applying lip balm a little more frequently can remedy this. If you experience more discomfort, check with your doctor for alternative medication.\n\nSTRONG TOOTHPASTE\n\nIf your lips feel like they're burning when you brush your teeth, certain ingredients in your toothpaste may be causing some sort of irritation. Switch to a milder toothpaste.\n\nVITAMIN B DEFICIENCY\n\nBesides helping to regulate your metabolism and provide energy, vitamin B is also essential for maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. Try incorporating more vitamin B-rich foods like eggs, red meat, whole grains and green leafy vegetables in your diet.\n\nThis article first appeared in Shape (www.shape.com.sg)\n\nDAWN CHEN\n\nWELLNESS & BEAUTY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nHe Chose To Embark On A Career Switch In His 60s!\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3d61822a92381c90b36f31a112a800ccd2ab9233a3bac745715dab260fe30852/NP_20190121_LIPS21_4565275.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO: AFP"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I think that is the scariest moment.\"\n\nDespite the toiling hours on set, he described director Kim Seong-hun as a \"perfectionist\" and someone who is \"quiet yet has a charismatic presence\".\n\nJu added: \"I admire his commitment in delivering a quality, well-written story.

Although it is a little scary, the audience will really be able to immerse themselves in the story, (which is about) human greed and desire.\"\n\nBy\n\nTatiana Mohamad Rosli\n\nRead articles by Tatiana Mohamad Rosli\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nUncover the top-paying industries in 2025\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a68882f8cb62cb7bed48d1b62d92e63571f88e4a369829ecb696c22d0ed0c0a4/NP_20190121_TRJU21_4565047.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(From left) Ju Ji-hoon and Ryu Seung-ryong.", "caption": "(From left) Ju Ji-hoon and Ryu Seung-ryong.

It's been an incredible experience.

I'm really just grateful to be out here doing what I love and playing in front of a good crowd.\"\n\nCurrently ranked 35th in the world, Collins had never won a match at a Grand Slam in five previous attempts before arriving in Melbourne.\n\nBut she has now dispatched three seeded players on her way to the last eight, the other two being Caroline Garcia (19th) and Julia Goerges (14th).\n\nKerber, the 2016 Australian champion and a semi-finalist last year, is undoubtedly the biggest scalp of her career.\n\nThe second seed, who turned 31 on Friday, had not dropped a set in her opening three matches and many were tipping her for the title this year.\n\n\"She hit every ball on the line, in the court,\" a dejected Kerber said. \"I was just trying (but) I couldn't find my rhythm. The whole match I was trying everything.\"\n\nBARTY'S PARTY\n\nMeanwhile, Ashleigh Barty, 22, became the first Australian to reach the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park in a decade after her 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 win over Sharapova.\n\nRoared on by the home crowd, 15th seed Barty held her nerve in the face of a late fightback from the Russian five-time Grand Slam champion.\n\nAustralia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison was in the stands cheering for Barty, along with tennis legend Rod Laver in the centre court arena that bears his name.\n\nHer opponent in the last eight will be Petra Kvitova, who cruised past American teenager Amanda Anisimova 6-2, 6-1. - AFP\n\nTennis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 02:25am\n\nChinese tennis player Peng Shuai denies making accusation of sexual assault\n\nFeb 4, 2022, 08:01am\n\nBarca official resigns after calling Spanish tennis star Nadal an 'enemy of the state'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nChatGPT's Take On The Future Of The Job Market\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/920c0751027afe7117e0058c209faaab2a2f08c621e0e7fc00ebac402fd82e32/NP_20190121_WOMTEN21_4565761.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Danielle Collins' (above) victory over world No. 2 Angelique Kerber is one of the biggest upsets of this year's Australian Open.", "caption": "Danielle Collins' (above) victory over world No. 2 Angelique Kerber is one of the biggest upsets of this year's Australian Open.

It will also move gas along your digestive tract so you don't feel so uncomfortable all the time.\n\nSip warm water with cayenne pepper\n\nThis wonder tonic helps to de-bloat fast. Cayenne pepper has a compound called capsaicin that helps to increase the amount of digestive juices in your stomach, quickly reducing bloating caused by overeating. Mix a tiny pinch into your drink for quick relief.\n\nDrink unsweetened green tea\n\nPacked with antioxidants, green tea promotes digestion and releases gas from the digestive tract. The caffeine in green tea will also keep you awake if you are starting to feel sleepy from eating a heavy meal.\n\nSnack on ginger\n\nA potent digestive aid, ginger can alleviate bloating and gas in your belly and relieve your stomach lining of any inflammation too.\n\nIt contains digestive enzymes that boost your body's production of digestive fluids as well.\n\nIn a small study, participants who consumed a small amount of ginger powder before drinking soup cleared their stomachs 50 per cent faster than those who did not.\n\nTry lemon water\n\nSome people have raved about the benefits of drinking lemon water first thing in the morning.\n\nWhile research has not backed these claims up, there certainly is no harm in trying, especially if you are not a fan of plain water.\n\nGetting in more fluids will help flush out excess salt, a cause of bloat, and lemon helps give you a vitamin C boost.\n\nStretch it out\n\nIf you have got some space (or an empty meeting room), consider stretching to reduce the discomfort caused by bloating.\n\nSome experts believe that certain yoga poses, such as happy baby and child's pose, can have a calming effect on different people.\n\nThis article first appeared in Shape (\n\nwww.shape.com.sg\n\n)\n\nAtika Lim\n\nWELLNESS & BEAUTY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nHe Chose To Embark On A Career Switch In His 60s!\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/119d1cc96d684389ea02111661da57e21aae5c741fcc800d9ba990ae9bc0a37d/NP_20190121_BLOAT21_4565222.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "If you have got some space, consider stretching to reduce the discomfort caused by bloating.", "caption": "If you have got some space, consider stretching to reduce the discomfort caused by bloating.

From that standpoint, nothing new there,\" he said.\n\nAnd in a signal that he is hungry for more, the 37-year-old said he planned to play on clay again this year after sitting out the last three Roland Garros campaigns.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nSep 23, 2022, 03:22am\n\nFederer bids emotional farewell to tennis at Laver Cup\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"It's a bit of a desire. I'm in a phase where I want to have fun and I've missed not doing it,\" he said.\n\nHe missed Roland Garros in 2016 with an injury and skipped the clay season the last two years.\n\n\"I don't feel it is necessary to have a big break again,\" he added.\n\nThe long-haired Tsitsipas, seeded 14, has been touted as a future Grand Slam champion and Federer had nothing but praise, saying he saw similarities to himself.\n\n\"He has a one-handed backhand and I used to have long hair, too,\" said the world No. 3.\n\n\"Yeah, so maybe a little bit, sure. He has more of a continental grip than players nowadays. That's a bit more my way than, let's say, Rafa's way.\n\n\"I see him definitely being high up in the game for a long time. That was a good night for him tonight.\"\n\nFederer conceded he had \"massive regrets\" about losing and said he didn't win because he struggled to convert his 12 break-points, making none of them count.\n\n\"I also didn't break him at the Hopman Cup, so clearly something is wrong how I return him, what I'm trying to do,\" he said.\n\nTsitsipas looked surprised after his victory, saying: \"Roger is a legend of our sport. I have so much respect for him. It's a dream come true. I'm the happiest man on earth right now.\"\n\nTsitsipas' quarter-final opponent will be Roberto Bautista Agut, who knocked out 2018 finalist Marin Cilic 6-7 (6/8), 6-3, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4.\n\nEarlier yesterday, there was another upset as an emotional Frances Tiafoe celebrated his 21st birthday in style by beating 20th seed Grigor Dimitrov 7-5, 7-6 (8/6), 6-7 (1/7), 7-5 to reach the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam for the first time.

This defeat was due to our mentality more than anything else, our mental approach. We played against a team more determined than we were and I can't accept that,\" said Sarri, who chose to speak through a translator in his native Italian to clearly explain the scale of his frustration.\n\n\"The fact is it appears this group of players are extremely difficult to motivate.\"\n\nChelsea's fourth defeat in 11 league games started with a 3-1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in November and yesterday's performance was horribly reminiscent of that night at Wembley.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We had a similar issue in the league game at Tottenham,\" Sarri continued.\n\n\"We still seem to lack sufficient motivation, and being mentally solid and our determination.\"\n\nChelsea enjoyed 64 per cent possession, but had just one shot on target to again question Sarri's decision to start without a recognised striker with Eden Hazard's impact limited in a central role. However, Sarri insisted it was his players' attitude and not his system that was the problem.\n\n\"When one team are more determined than the other, you can't really talk about tactics,\" he said.\n\n\"From a technical point of view, both teams are on the same level, but they were more determined. Tactics don't come into it. Their high level of motivation was obvious throughout, particularly in both penalty areas.\"\n\nPundit Rio Ferdinand said that it was unsettling to hear Sarri question his team's motivation, as big teams are expected to be pumped up for the big games.\n\n\"This is a huge cause for concern - to say that your team are lacking in motivation, especially in big games,\" said the former Manchester United defender on BT Sport.\n\n\"For these games, you should wake up, bounce out of bed and fly out on to the pitch ready to go. You don't need a team talk... As soon as they came out, they didn't look up for it. They looked lethargic.\"\n\nFerdinand also added that the Chelsea players would have taken his rant on board, had he shouldered some of the responsibility, after all, Sarri has been playing Hazard and N'Golo Kante out of position.\n\n\"If I were in that dressing room now and he had come out and hammered the players, but said, 'on the other hand, I am getting a few things wrong as well'. Then, I am going to address my mistakes and get them right,\" Ferdinand said.\n\n\"He would have everyone in that dressing room on side, saying you know what, he is right. We didn't play right.\n\n\"Tactically there are a few things not right in this team, two basic things, his two best players playing in the wrong positions. That's down to him.\n\n\"If he took some sort of responsibility, he would have some sort of chance.\"\n\nFellow pundit Jermaine Jenas spoke about the massive risk Sarri has taken in publicly bashing his players.\n\nSaid the former Tottenham midfielder on BT Sport: \"I don't really get doing it in public. It is a massive gamble. He is protecting himself, that's one part of it I don't like. You are saying, you, you, you. Where is the collective team in that?\n\n\"You win together, you lose together. That is his team and whatever they are doing in training is preparing them for that game, so he has to assume some responsibility himself.\n\n\"Whatever he is saying, he has to put on his head as well. I think he is right, by the way, but say it in the dressing room.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Arsenal manager Unai Emery lauded his side's greater desire to bounce back from a 1-0 defeat by West Ham the previous weekend.\n\n\"We needed today to run more than them,\" he said.\n\n\"The first idea today we were speaking (about) was we needed to run to recover the ball quickly...\n\n\"With their structure, it is very clear and we worked to do the pressing.\"\n\nEmery also said that Hector Bellerin could have suffered an \"important\" knee injury, after the 23-year-old was carried off on a stretcher in the 72nd minute and added that \"first impressions are not positive\".\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nChatGPT's Take On The Future Of The Job Market\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7ebf6904ba7e17b0be0d323042f28afcf6c11852e52cc9f3ef3cf400326b3328/NP_20190121_CHEL21X5SL_4565987.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Maurizio Sarri's Chelsea had just one shot on target against Arsenal.", "caption": "Maurizio Sarri's Chelsea had just one shot on target against Arsenal.

I proved it in my last fight against (Lucas) Matthysee,\" Pacquiao said.\n\n\"And now I prove it again at the age of 40.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 8, 2022, 12:37pm\n\nI took a spinning class and ended up at a hospital's A&E clinic\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn his 70th fight as a professional, Pacquiao retains the lesser version of the WBA's two welterweight belts. He is hoping to set up a rematch with Floyd \"Money\" Mayweather, who watched the bout from ringside.\n\nPacquiao improved to 61-7-2 with 39 knockouts, winning on all three judges' scorecards, including by one tally of 117-111. The other two judges also had it one-sided at 116-112.\n\nPacquiao, who has been reunited with long-time trainer Freddie Roach, started the onslaught in the seventh round by hitting the 29-year-old Broner with a left hook then immediately doubling it up.\n\nBroner went into a shell mode, absorbing more blows but managed to hold on to the end of the round.\n\nPacquiao landed his best punch in the ninth with a blistering left on the chin that sent Broner backpeddling towards the ropes.\n\nBut Broner showed he can take a punch as he stayed on his feet and survived another punishing round.\n\nPacquiao is now hoping to avenge his 2015 loss to Mayweather which became the richest one-day sporting event in history.\n\nREMATCH\n\nImmediately after the fight, Pacquiao called out Mayweather.\n\n\"Tell him to come back to the ring and we will fight,\" Pacquiao said. \"I am willing to fight again Floyd Mayweather. If he is willing to come back in boxing.\"\n\nMayweather, who helped promote Pacquiao's match against Broner, was non-committal when asked if he would get back in the ring with Pacquiao.\n\n\"Right now, I am living the happy life,\" he said.\n\nBack in the Philippines, thousands of ecstatic Filipinos, who erupted in celebration after Pacquiao's victory, are hoping that Pacquiao will get his wish.\n\n\"He is a world champion. You really can't beat him,\" said company messenger Boy Maniari, who was one among the thousands who watched the match from a giant screen in a basketball court in Marikina city.\n\n\"This will lead to Pacquiao's rematch with Mayweather. Mayweather will lose,\" Maniari said.\n\nBut some analysts expressed doubt that Pacquiao would secure a rematch with Mayweather, saying he failed to knock Broner down.\n\n\"He won clearly, but I'm not sure Floyd Mayweather lost any sleep after that, or is itching to jump in the gym for another fight,\" Ring Magazine reporter Ryan Songalia told AFP. - AFP, REUTERS\n\nOTHER SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 8, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHill wary of past final race controversies\n\nDec 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nThird time's the charm for world No. 2 paddler Sun Yingsha\n\nDec 1, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nKey figure skating event hit by Covid fears\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nEx-pro footballer among 8 teacher-coaches given awards\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nDiscover Thousands Of Jobs In SG's Healthcare Industry\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/67a4e9d8580d0269891671b2c32b7c4636ee12d91c48d429c052ec68c5ced110/NP_20190121_PAC21_4565732.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Manny Pacquiao (right) on his way to a unanimous decision victory over Adrien Broner.", "caption": "Manny Pacquiao (right) on his way to a unanimous decision victory over Adrien Broner.

But active learning will replace complex problem-solving, and creativity will trump critical thinking as the second and third most important job skills, respectively.\n\nForbes, in its report Ten HR Trends In The Age Of Artificial Intelligence, highlighted these critical human skills from the World Economic Forum's Future Of Jobs Report 2018.\n\nGiven these in-demand capabilities, the smart employee will actively learn (practise) how to analyse situations on macro and micro levels, as well as hone his creative thinking.\n\nLEARN ANALYTICAL THOUGHT\n\nConsider this the strategic part of your plan: The ability to look at the big picture.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:21am\n\n'I still can't get over it': Flight, cabin crew mull over new course after Jetstar Asia closure\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt means while you are attending to daily deadlines, e-mails and meetings, you are also keeping in mind how the small things you do add up to a broader goal.\n\nThat is, how you want your achievement to benefit the company and in turn your career.\n\nFor instance, instead of merely posting social media messages about your company's product or service, think about leveraging industry partners in joint campaigns. The aim is to get those postings to lend to sector-wide recognition in time.\n\nHere is how to have a helicopter vision while keeping tabs on daily must-dos.\n\nElevated view: ask why\n\nIn every challenge or opportunity, first ask why. For example, why is this happening, why now, and why is this important to me and my company's business at this stage?\n\nHaving a bird's-eye view lets you better see what matters and what might be a distraction.\n\nBase-level view: ask how\n\nThis follow-up stage involves questions like how will a plan be organised, how will it impact my daily work, and how can I involve those who need to be part of the implementation?\n\nIt might take several rounds of asking the \"how\" questions to get at the issues and come up with an innovative plan.\n\nPRACTISE CREATIVE THINKING\n\nConsider this the tactical part of your work game plan.\n\nCreativity is tomorrow's skill to own. That is because consumers and clients constantly seek level-ups - faster, more varied and value-added service. So the ability to meet higher standards is crucial.\n\nCreative thinking involves a process:\n\nInformation gathering\n\nEnsure you keep abreast of news and immerse in the world of creative thinkers.

IG market strategist Pan Jingyi said the data will likely meet the current consensus for a 6.4 per cent year-on-year increase, slowing slightly from 6.5 per cent in Q3.\n\nThat is, unless the industrial production and retail sales data - also due today - disappoint, which would add to downside risks, she said.\n\nHong Kong releases its December CPI print tomorrow, followed by Singapore on Wednesday. Japan will also unveil its inflation figures for January at the end of the week.\n\nFXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga said: \"As Asia looks to domestic consumption to offset weaker global demand, inflationary pressures may weaken local consumer sentiment.\"\n\nA few central banks are scheduled to announce monetary policy decisions this week, including the Bank of Japan on Wednesday and the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank Negara Malaysia, both on Thursday.\n\nNone of the monetary policy committees are expected to issue changes, Ms Pan and Mr Otunuga said.\n\nHowever, Mr Otunuga said investors will scrutinise the ECB press conference for \"insight into the health of the EU economy and clues on monetary policy\".\n\nUS stock markets are closed today for Martin Luther King Jr Day. The country's partial government shutdown has extended into a fifth week and remains at an impasse, even as US President Donald Trump presented his latest proposal for ending it in a televised address to the nation on Saturday.\n\nIn exchange for the US$5.7 billion (S$7.7 billion) that he wants for a border wall, Mr Trump offered concessions such as three-year extensions to protections including temporary protected status (TPS) under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) policy for young people brought to the US illegally as children.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would have the Republican-controlled Senate vote on the plan this week, but Democratic leaders indicated that they would reject it.\n\n\"It was the president who single-handedly took away Daca and TPS protections in the first place,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage-taking.\"\n\nDemocratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi plans to have the House vote on its own border security plan instead, which she said will not offer new funding for the border wall but may help reopen negotiations on Mr Trump's demands.\n\nOn the US-China trade war front, it comes as no surprise that news from the ongoing negotiations is expected to continue driving markets for the rest of this month, with the key event being an end-January meeting in Washington.\n\nNews that drove markets last Friday included a Bloomberg report that China had offered to increase goods imports from the US by more than US$1 trillion over the next six years to reduce its trade surplus to zero by 2024. US stocks extended gains and the US dollar rose after the news.\n\nThe report added that US negotiators were sceptical and asked that the imbalance be rectified within two years instead. But economists are doubtful that it is even possible to completely eliminate the trade gap, as it is largely sustained by US demand for Chinese products.\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nLEILA LAI\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

{"article_url": "https://www.tnp.sg/lifestyle/health/beware-these-unhealthy-veggie-dishes", "site_title": "Beware of these unhealthy veggie dishes", "publish_date": "2019-01-20T22:00:00", "content": "Sayur lodeh\n\nTNP FILE PHOTOS\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 20, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nBeware of these unhealthy veggie dishes\n\nNot all dishes are worthy to be part of your diet\n\nShare this article\n\nEat your vegetables. It is a mantra that mothers impress upon children from an early age. And while most of us might have had some trouble following this, greens like kale, broccoli and sprouts have become health trends and should be part of your diet.\n\nBut not all veggie dishes are equally good for you. Indeed, you may want to avoid these common local dishes when you are heading out for a meal.\n\nCOLESLAW\n\nPast the cabbage, carrots and onions, you are looking at a white paste of sour cream, mayonnaise, salt, sugar and vinegar. If you are making it on your own, hold back on the sauce as one tablespoon is already 103 calories and 12g of fat. Or, swop this for a mix of olive oil, lemon juice and honey for a healthier alternative with a similar mouth-feel.\n\nSAYUR LODEH\n\nThis delicious vegetable stew with eggplant, long beans and tofu sure seems healthy, but white or yellow, remember that the broth is made of coconut milk. And at about 40g of saturated fat per serving, it might be a good idea to not ladle in more of the gravy, especially since the ingredients have already soaked up plenty of the flavours.\n\nSAMBAL KANGKONG\n\nAs you bite down on these slender leaves and stalks, you should know vitamins are not going to be high on the list of nutrients you are getting. For every 300g serving, sambal kangkong packs in more than half your day's fat requirements (30.9g), and almost all of your sodium needs (2.184mg). That's because the spinach happens to be great in soaking up all the oil and salt, delivering it straight to your gut. Drain off the excess oil before you have it.\n\nPOPIAH\n\nThe innocent-looking rice roll is typically bursting with ingredients like cooked turnip, sprouts and shredded lettuce.\n\nBut let's not forget the main ingredient of turnip has been simmering in quite a bit of oil.\n\nThere's also the sweet black sauce that delivers 188 calories for each roll, and honestly, nobody stops at just one, right? Vendors have been adding extra crunch, using fried peanuts, dough bits or even lard that mostly add nutritionless fatty calories.\n\nVEGGIE CHIPS\n\nSome vegetable chips use a mix of potato and corn, so they aren't very different from potato chips. Even those made from alternatives like mushroom or kale are often fried in canola oil, and the amount of sodium to make them palatable can rival the regular chip.\n\nROJAK\n\nIt's got cucumber, Mexican turnips, bean sprouts, tofu and occasionally, even pineapple. But binding the ingredients together is a thick black sauce with peanuts that gives the gooey salad its character. Along with the presence of you tiao (dough fritters), this sends the dish up to a whopping 518 calories per serving.\n\nTAHU TELOR\n\nThis omelette with tofu is often covered with shredded vegetables like carrots and bean sprouts. But appearances can be deceptive. Even though it is mostly made up of vegetable products, the starch used to give it the fluff and the accompanying sweet dark sauce and peanut gravy boost the calory count to 628. There is the hidden fat (31g) too.\n\nVEGETABLE TEMPURA\n\nThese vegetable fritters are so deceptive.

In the US, net revenues are nine times higher than debt payments, while in Europe the ratio is 12, she said.\n\nIn recent months, concern in the US has focused around leveraged loans, which former US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen called a systemic risk.\n\nThese loans, estimated by experts to be worth some US$1.3 trillion, are made to companies with high debt loads or with poor credit histories, or both.\n\nThese loans are riskier as there is a greater risk of defaults, but as they carry higher interest rates, they are attractive to investors. Some of these loans have been resold to investors, much as the high-risk sub-prime mortgages that caused the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"In Europe the problem is less acute as investors accept less readily debt levels that are too high and the trauma from the 2008 crisis is more present,\" said Mr Vincent Marioni, head of credit investments in Europe for Allianz Global Investors.\n\nThere are less than 300 billion euros in repackaged leveraged loans, according to Mr Verle.\n\nAnother issue has been the rise in the number of companies that are just holding onto their investment grade credit rating.\n\nA downgrade into what ratings agencies call a speculative debt rating - and investors call junk bonds - means companies will have to pay more interest to borrow. These companies which tumble into junk territory are called \"fallen angels,\" and if there are too many then it could spook investors and cause them to dump the bonds.\n\nThis risk \"hovers like a dark cloud over investors\", said Mr Claudio Borio, head of the monetary and economic department at the Bank of International Settlements.\n\nOthers are less concerned.\n\n\"It is in the best-rated tranches that there were the most excesses these past years,\" said Mr Verle, but if \"in each credit cycle there are excesses, that doesn't mean that the system will collapse.\"\n\nMr Felix Orsini, global co-head for corporate debt markets at French bank Societe Generale, said that he believes the number of fallen angels would be limited.\n\n\"The return of volatility in 2018 was a return to normal after years during which the markets were on central bank life support,\" he said. - AFP\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The 37-year-old Federer, a 20-time Grand Slam champion, will rue his chances, having failed to convert any of the 12 break-points he took from Tsitsipas over the course of a riveting clash laden with sparkling shot-making. Instead, it was Tsitsipas showing a wise head on young shoulders in a final tiebreak of unrelenting tension. When given a match-point after Federer slapped a forehand long, he converted it clinically, forcing a backhand error from the Swiss to announce himself on one of the game's biggest stages. He raised his arms in triumph and roared at the terraces, inducing tears of joy from his brother, who was watching in the players' box. \"There's nothing I can describe, I cannot describe it, I am the happiest man on earth right now,\" Tsitsipas said in his courtside interview. \"Roger is a legend of our sport, he showed such good tennis over the years. I have been idolising him since I was six. \"It's very important to have an aggressive mindset, stay in the moment, press from the beginning. I didn't lose my patience, stayed in those rallies.

Team Melli cruised through their group unbeaten and should make light work of Pim Verbeek's Oman, who progressed as one of the best third-placed teams by virtue of a sole win over Turkmenistan. \"The real Asian Cup starts now,\" coach Carlos Queiroz told a news conference on Saturday. \"It is everything for the winner, nothing for the losers. There is no room for mistakes, no room for regrets, there is no room for sorry, no room for tomorrow. It is just here and now. \"Ninety minutes trying to play the best football you can, and with good inspiration and great character trying to be the best team on the pitch.\"\n\nIran's clash with Oman is the final match on Sunday as the Chinese take on Thailand in Al Ain in the late afternoon after Jordan battle it out with Vietnam in Dubai for the first spot in the quarter-finals.\n\nIN-FORM JORDAN\n\nJordan's victory over Australia in their first match was the biggest shock of the tournament so far and they went through ahead of the reigning champions as the winners of Group B. That has given coach Vital Borkelmans huge belief that they can reach a quarter-final against either four-time champions Japan or three-time winners Saudi Arabia, who meet on Monday. \"These guys, they are so amazing, I learnt a lot of things about these guys,\" the Belgian said of his in-form side. \"I have given them a lot of confidence. They must believe in the skills they have and they must help each other.\"\n\nVietnam squeaked into the knockout stages by virtue of a better disciplinary record than Lebanon but coach Park Hang Seo has developed something of a Midas touch and another night of celebration in Hanoi is not out of the question. Football-inspired celebrations in China have been few and far between since they lost the 2004 Asian Cup final to Japan in Beijing and Marcello Lippi's team stumbled into the last 16 after a 2-0 loss to South Korea. The Italian World Cup winner confirmed on Saturday that prolific striker Wu Lei would be fit to start after missing the Korea match with a shoulder injury but was wary of the Thais. \"They changed the coach after the first match they played and they changed the tactics and basic formation,\" he said. \"But what is important is they have changed their attitude.

Maurizio Sarri's men risk being caught after a fourth defeat in 11 league matches that underlined the need for a striker, as the club close in on signing Gonzalo Higuain on loan from Juventus. Sarri again opted to start without a recognised centre-forward, with a largely anonymous Eden Hazard preferred in middle of a front three against an Arsenal defence that had kept just one EPL clean sheet since September. By contrast, Arsenal boss Unai Emery's selection was vindicated, with Mesut Oezil on the bench for the whole match and a switch to a 4-4-2 that allowed Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to form a potent partnership up front. Aubameyang should have opened the scoring after just five minutes when perfectly picked out by Lacazette's low cross, but he dragged his shot wide. Kepa Arrizabalaga then produced a brilliant save to deny Koscielny from point-blank range, but it counted for little as, from the resulting 14th-minute corner, Arsenal took a deserved lead. Lacazette did well to stay on his feet as he skipped past Marcos Alonso and Pedro Rodriguez before smashing the ball past Kepa at his near post. Aubameyang should have doubled Arsenal's lead moments later but fired too close to Kepa when clean through. Chelsea's start was horribly reminiscent of the 3-1 defeat at Tottenham in November that began their dip in form after a fine start to Sarri's reign at Stamford Bridge. However, Arsenal's defence remained vulnerable when put under pressure and Pedro could have levelled when his lob over Bernd Leno shaved the outside of the post.\n\nCLOSE\n\nAubameyang came close again, this time in spectacular fashion with an overhead kick that flew inches wide with Kepa beaten. Chelsea were repeatedly caught out by Arsenal's well-worked set-pieces and paid for it again, albeit in fortunate fashion for the Gunners, six minutes before the break. Sead Kolasinac headed down Lucas Torreira's free-kick into the path of Sokratis Papastathopoulos and his cross picked out the unmarked Koscielny. The Arsenal captain mistimed his header, but the ball bounced in off his shoulder for his first goal since he ruptured his Achilles' heel in April. Chelsea could have got a foothold in the game before half-time as David Luiz's header came back off the post. But in keeping with so many of their performances of late, Chelsea created little thereafter despite dominating possession. Olivier Giroud was given a warm welcome back to the Emirates when he entered as a substitute, but even with the French international as a focal point, the visitors were toothless. Sarri will hope Higuain, who scored 38 goals when the pair first worked together at Napoli in the 2015/16 season, is the answer. -\n\nAFP\n\narsenal\n\nchelsea\n\nALEXANDRE LACAZETTE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 13, 2024, 03:12am\n\nArsenal grind out Man Utd win to go top of the Premier League\n\nApr 29, 2024, 06:20am\n\nMan City still have a mountain to climb in title race\n\nApr 4, 2024, 01:53am\n\nKlopp plans to tune out Arsenal, City games to reduce stress\n\nApr 1, 2024, 02:59am\n\nPep G says City still the team to beat despite trailing\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6fafdf1235c63e2671b91b7e2d043c244e41384be3e01aab8a6c0d82396a7ba8/ars.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Arsenal's Sead Kolasinac tackling Chelsea forward Willian.", "caption": "Arsenal's Sead Kolasinac tackling Chelsea forward Willian.

The France midfielder followed the goal with a \"cradle rocking\" celebration - an apparent reference to his partner reportedly giving birth to the couple's first child. Yet despite an impressive display by Pogba, who almost added a late third goal with a low shot from just outside the penalty area, it was Marcus Rashford's moment of brilliance, three minutes before half-time, that drew the most attention. The England forward received Diogo Dalot's pass inside the penalty area and, from a tight angle on the left, used quick feet to turn outside Pascal Gross before steering a fine shot into the top corner.\n\nBusby tribute\n\nIt was a fitting way to mark the academy graduate's 150th appearance for United, and a reminder of the club's commitment to their youth policy as the club marked the 25th anniversary of Matt Busby's death. Busby, the manager who did arguably more than any other at United to lay down the tradition of bringing through homegrown young players, was commemorated this week by a mural outside Old Trafford that reads 'Forever Grateful', and there was a minute's applause inside the ground before kick-off. There followed a somewhat nervy victory to ensure a place in the record books for Solskjaer, whose winning streak now includes six successive league victories. He had suggested that overcoming Brighton would be an even bigger challenge than beating Tottenham Hotspur six days earlier as it would be tough to follow up an impressive win at Wembley against a resilient Brighton side. Brighton's flooding of midfield certainly made life difficult for United in the game's opening quarter, before Pogba and Rashford put them 2-0 clear. Both players are thriving under Solskjaer's management, with Pogba in particular looking a much more dynamic player, with the freedom to attack, than he did under Jose Mourinho. Following an outstanding first touch, Pogba cut in from the right to win a penalty when pushed over by Brighton left-back Gaetan Bong. To audible groans from home fans, Pogba stepped up for the penalty with the stuttering run-up he used in a 2-1 win over Everton in October, when his weak kick was saved by Jordan Pickford before he converted the rebound. This time, though, he quickly abandoned that technique, striding up to the ball and striking his penalty into the corner of the net. Rashford had almost given United the lead just before that, his shot from Ashley Young's right-wing cutback headed away by Shane Duffy. He did then score, but only after United had survived a major scare; Glenn Murray, Brighton's leading scorer, got in behind Ander Herrera on to Solly March's through-pass but lashed wide from eight metres. Rashford's superb skill looked to have laid the foundations for a comfortable United win, and early in the second half, his cross was somehow steered wide by Jesse Lingard. Anthony Martial then weaved past two Brighton players to hit a shot that dipped just over, but the Seagulls refused to buckle. Gross gave them hope when he got in front of Dalot, starting after Luke Shaw was taken ill in the warm-up, to score against United for the second time this season. Whereas Gross' penalty helped Brighton to a 3-2 win in August, this time it was only a consolation goal, despite a late flurry of pressure. -\n\nAFP\n\nManchester United\n\npaul pogba\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 17, 2024, 03:31am\n\nTen Hag confirms Man Utd looked for other managers\n\nMay 26, 2024, 02:25pm\n\n'I'll win trophies elsewhere,' says Erik ten Hag as Manchester United sack talk lingers\n\nMay 24, 2024, 03:27pm\n\nMan City eye double double but Cup final is enough motivation\n\nMay 20, 2024, 02:54am\n\nGuardiola's demand for perfection fuels Man City hunger\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Publicly criticising United stars including Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw and feuding with others behind the scenes, Mourinho lost the dressing room and has since blamed the attitude of his squad for the fall-out. On Saturday, Mourinho, speaking on beIN Sport as a pundit for their coverage of Arsenal's clash with Chelsea, revealed he was stunned to be approached by an unnamed United player over his treatment of him.\n\n\"I had recently one of my players, I was just coaching them, and when I coach on the pitch I like to see myself free because I am in family and I want to be able to criticise everyone,\" Mourinho said.\n\n\"I had one player say, he was very polite and not confrontational, 'Please when you criticise me, can you do it in private?'.\n\n\"I said why and he said, 'Because it's my stature in front of the other players, when you criticise me I don't feel comfortable'.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 3, 2025, 10:41pm\n\nIrfan Fandi hopes for career boost after Asean All-Stars call-up to play against Man U\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"He was one of the top players of his generation. Nowadays you have to be very smart in the way you read your players and their personalities.\"\n\nWhile former Chelsea boss Mourinho didn't name the player he was talking about in the incident, he did mention Stamford Bridge legend Didier Drogba as a prime example of a player who responded well to being criticised.\n\n\"Drogba was the kind of player who, with more pressure from the manager there was more quality in his performance,\" Mourinho said. \"He's a proper man, he's a competitive guy, he's a mature man, he's a man that everything in this life he has had to fight a lot for.\n\n\"There are some players that when you try to squeeze them they answer in the best way and then there are some players who have other mentalities and other personalities and, of course, their reaction is not the best.\n\n\"I had players brought in, in a different way who have an easy social life and an easier way of coming to the top of football. Some of them, they don't react in the same way.\"\n\nDefending his United reign, which saw him win the League Cup and Europa League in his first season but go trophyless last term, Mourinho insisted his title rivals were given more backing in the transfer market. Mourinho believes he deserved the same spending power enjoyed by Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola and Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp.\n\n\"You have the case of Manchester City.

Juergen Klopp's side were pushed hard by Palace, but Salah's predatory instincts and a woeful mistake from Eagles goalkeeper Julian Speroni ensured Liverpool improved their unbeaten home league run to 32 games. \"He's world class, simply world class,\" Klopp said of Salah. Liverpool's haul of 60 points from 23 matches tops the Reds' previous best tally of 59, set at the same stage of the 1893-94 and 1987-88 campaigns. \"We had to stay positive, being one down is not a massive blow. We just needed to win the second half,\" Klopp said. \"We have 60 points now. It's crazy.\"\n\nPalace, the last team to beat Liverpool in an EPL game at Anfield, in April 2017, took a shock 34th-minute lead. Wilfried Zaha picked out Andros Townsend, who drilled a crisp finish past Alisson. Salah equalised 60 seconds after the interval, the Egypt forward slotting in his 18th goal of the season after Virgil van Dijk's shot deflected into his path. Liverpool went ahead in the 53rd minute when Brazilian striker Roberto Firmino, surrounded by defenders, still managed to unload a shot that deflected in off Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate. James Tomkins out-jumped Fabinho to head Palace level in the 65th minute, yet Liverpool were gifted the crucial third 10 minutes later, thanks to a howler from Speroni. James Milner's cross prompted a nervous flap from Speroni, who tipped the ball high over his own head and Salah was on hand to convert on the line. Milner was sent off in the 89th minute for a second booking, but Liverpool made it four in stoppage-time through Sadio Mane before Max Meyer capped a frantic finale with Palace's third.\n\nChild's play for Pogba\n\nAt the Emirates Stadium, fifth-placed Arsenal closed the gap on fourth-placed Chelsea to three points in the race to qualify for the Champions League with a 2-0 win. Unai Emery's team had lost three of their last six league games, sparking the first criticism of their Spanish manager. But they tore into London rivals Chelsea, opening the scoring in the 14th minute. Hector Bellerin's cross found Alexandre Lacazette and the French striker took a touch before smashing a sublime strike past Kepa Arrizabalaga from a tight angle. The Gunners increased their lead in the 38th minute when Laurent Koscielny mistimed his attempted header, only to see the ball bounce off his shoulder and loop into the net. Arsenal's Hector Bellerin was stretchered off in the second half, but spluttering Chelsea have now won only two of their last five matches. \"It was a big result. We wanted to do a special moment in this derby. Chelsea were six points ahead, so it helps us. We can be optimistic,\" Emery said. Manchester United beat Brighton 2-1 to make it seven successive wins since interim manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer replaced the sacked Jose Mourinho. Solskjaer's sixth-placed side took the lead in the 27th minute at Old Trafford when Gaetan Bong conceded a penalty with a foul on Paul Pogba and the France midfielder stroked home the spot-kick. Pogba's \"rocking the baby\" celebration was to mark him becoming a father for the first time, with his girlfriend Maria Salaues believed to have given birth this week. United winger Marcus Rashford marked his 150th game for the club with his side's second goal in the 42nd minute, with Pascal Gross reducing the deficit in the 72nd minute. Solskjaer, the first United boss to win his first six league games, said: \"I can't complain can I? I am smiling and this is one of these things I will remember for the rest of my life.\"\n\nNewcastle climbed out of the relegation zone with a 3-0 win over Cardiff at St James' Park that saw their opponents drop into the bottom three. Southampton boosted their bid to avoid relegation with a 2-1 victory against Everton at St Mary's. Diogo Jota's hat-trick piled pressure on Leicester manager Claude Puel as the Wolves midfielder's last-gasp strike secured a 4-3 win. Bournemouth beat West Ham 2-0 with goals from Callum Wilson and Josh King, while Watford drew 0-0 against Burnley. -\n\nAFP\n\nliverpool\n\ncrystal palace\n\nMohamed Salah\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025, 09:17am\n\nLiverpool's Diogo Jota dies in car crash in Spain: reports\n\nMay 21, 2024, 07:18am\n\nSalah hints at staying with Liverpool next season\n\nMay 7, 2024, 08:01am\n\nVan Dijk wants to be part of Liverpool transition post-Klopp\n\nMay 6, 2024, 02:09am\n\nLiverpool get back on track with 4-2 win over Spurs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The 37-year-old, who is in the hunt for her first Grand Slam since having a baby, comforted the 18-year-old at the net, telling her: \"You did amazing, you're gonna make it, don't cry\". But Williams, who is in ominous form and has dropped only nine games in her opening three matches, also had a message for her rivals, saying she was not yet at the top of her game. \"I think I'm getting there. I don't feel like I'm there yet,\" she said. \"I feel like I'm still getting there.\"\n\nIn the next round, Williams will face world No. 1 Simona Halep, who overcame Williams' elder sister Venus 6-2, 6-3 in a later match. Williams won her 23rd Grand Slam Down Under two years ago while two months pregnant and is the bookies' favourite to claim an eighth Australian title, despite being seeded 16th. Another Major would match Margaret Court's tally and Williams is focused as she chases down the Australian great's record. \"I'm here, I'm playing as hard as I can and doing the best I can, which is really all I can do,\" she said.\n\n'Broke my heart'\n\nYastremska was not even born when the American won her first Major at Flushing Meadows in 1999. Williams said she did not like to see an opponent so distressed but she appreciated that Yastremska cared so much about trying to win their match and \"came out swinging\". \"I kind of liked that. It shows she wasn't just there to play a good match, she was there to win,\" the American said. \"She wanted to win. That really broke my heart.\"\n\nHer compassion contrasted with Maria Sharapova's attitude when she left Harriet Dart in tears after serving the Briton a 6-0, 6-0 \"double bagel\" in the first round. \"There's no time for that, I'm sorry to say,\" the Russian responded when asked if she had any sympathy for her opponent. Yastremska's only previous appearance at a Grand Slam was a first-round exit at last year's US Open and she looked like roadkill as soon as Williams raced to a 4-0 lead in the first set. The Ukrainian managed to hold serve twice in the first set, prompting wild applause from the crowd, but was powerless to stop Williams taking the first set 6-2 after 27 minutes. Williams was equally relentless in the second, breaking Yastremska and allowing the teen to score only four points off her serve as she went up 4-1. Yastremska had treatment on her right foot but it was only delaying the inevitable and Williams took just a few minutes to bring up match-point after play resumed. She hit her first chance into the net but completed the win after Yastremska sent a return wide. -\n\nAFP\n\nserena williams\n\nDayana Yastremska\n\naustralian open\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 25, 2022, 04:22am\n\n'I am not retired', Serena Williams says\n\nSep 3, 2022, 03:14am\n\nAfter 6 match points, Serena Williams loses, bows out of US Open\n\nSep 2, 2022, 03:07am\n\nWilliams sisters crash out of US Open doubles competition\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/52e9861a0ea91b597d47250b6f51e9c7cc9319aa73b08d8dd3347ab0b3d56620/daya.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Serena Williams (left) consoling Ukrainian teenager Dayana Yastremska, who was in tears after losing 6-2, 6-1 to the American.

The collective efforts of this community of care, show that by working together, we can uplift our friends and those in need, and that through sports, we can bring out the best in one another to reach even greater heights.\"\n\nThere are three categories in the inaugural edition of the award - Sporting Inspiration Award, Coaching Inspiration Award and Corporate Giving Inspiration Award -  each honouring the voluntary efforts of individuals and organisations who have contributed through various SportCares initiatives.\n\nOne of the award winners for the Sporting Inspiration Award is the NTU Welfare Service Club, which has been a SportCares partner since 2015, and helped raised $50,000 for their NTU SEA Lions Programme.\n\nMs Sarah Quek, a member of the NTU Sea Lions Programme, said: \"I joined the programme as I thought it was meaningful yet different from the other volunteering opportunities available.\n\n\"I had the chance to mentor and befriend many of the participants and I am glad they saw me as a role model too. I feel proud when I see participants overcome their fear of the water or when they are able to make better decisions through our help.\"\n\nThere were also others who devoted their time and even took time off work to help out in sporting causes.\n\nDaniel Lee, a winner of the Coaching Inspiration Award, was one of them. He started out as a volunteer for the Wheelchair Rugby team in 2016 before eventually becoming their volunteer full-time coach.

I can get it to 30, 35 degrees and I can exercise in there on a special bike and a treadmill to try and get used to the heat.\n\n\"So yeah, that's what I'm doing, so hopefully by the time I get to Singapore, I'll be ready for the heat.\"\n\nThe Singapore leg is one of several venues for the Super League Triathlon series, which started its first official season in Jersey in September and has held stops in Malta and Mallorca. It will move on to Bali next month.\n\nIt features five formats (triple mix, eliminator, equaliser, sprint enduro and enduro) in races shorter than the traditional Olympic distance of a 1.5km swim, a 40km bike ride and a 10km run.\n\nThe Singapore stop will see Brownlee and the likes of Commonwealth Games champion Henri Schoeman of South Africa battle it out in the eliminator and enduro formats.\n\nThe eliminator comprises three rounds of swim-bike-run, with a 10-minute break between each round.\n\nThe top 15 will reach the second round, and the top 10 will make the final round.\n\nFORMAT\n\nThe enduro features three continuous rounds of 300m swim, 5km bike ride and 1.6km run. The slowest duo at the end of each discipline will be eliminated.\n\nBrownlee is certainly taking it seriously. He is currently fourth in the overall standings and he's hoping that a win here would take him to a podium spot.\n\nHe said: \"For me, to win the overall series is very, very difficult now. Because I'm sitting in fourth place, so the perfect play for me would be to win in Singapore and get a third place on the overall board and Super League podium.\"\n\nMembers of the public can also join in the fun by signing up for the 2.5km Fun Run, racing on the same course as the professionals.

Sharapova won 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 with the roof closed on Rod Laver Arena and will next play in-form local hope Ashleigh Barty, who bounced Greece's Maria Sakkari, for a berth in the quarter-finals. \"I thought the level was quite high. I knew it would be a tough match,\" said the 2008 champion, who has been in sizzling form at the tournament as she chases her first Slam title since Roland Garros in 2014. \"These types of matches are what I train for and it was really rewarding to win that last point,\" added the 30th seed. Second seed Nadal called young Australian Alex de Minaur \"one of the best in the world\" ahead of their evening clash, then proceeded to hand him a tennis lesson, dismantling the teenager 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. \"I hit a good serve and played a solid game,\" said the 2009 champion who is searching for an 18th Grand Slam title. He paid tribute to de Minaur, who saved six match-points. \"He's a big fighter and super quick. Alex has an amazing future.\"\n\nNadal's reward is a meeting with Tomas Berdych, who rallied to beat Argentine 18th seed Diego Schwartzman 5-7, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4. The Czech veteran reached the semi-finals in 2014 and 2015, but is unseeded this year as he returns from a back injury that almost forced his retirement last year. Swiss great Federer was also on fire in taming big-serving American Taylor Fritz 6-2, 7-5, 6-2 to stay on track for a third successive title at Melbourne Park and a 21st Grand Slam crown. On a rain-affected day that delayed play on outside courts, the 37-year-old showed no mercy to the 21-year-old in his 100th match on the centre court in Melbourne. \"I had a really good feeling out here today against someone who can be dangerous,\" said Federer after reaching the Melbourne fourth round for the 17th time - more than anyone else ever. \"Taylor played really well. He is going to have many more years on tour playing at this level.\"\n\nThe double defending champion is gunning for a record seventh Australian title. If he goes on to win the tournament, he will become the first man ever to claim seven or more crowns at two Slams, having already won eight Wimbledons. Next up for him is fiery Greek 14th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who beat Georgia's 19th seed Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (9/7), 6-4. The man who lost to Federer in the final last year, Marin Cilic, battled back from two sets down, surviving two match-points to beat Spain's Fernando Verdasco in a 4hr 18min epic.\n\n'My brand of tennis'\n\nBarty beat Greece's Sakkari 7-5, 6-1, with the 15th seed yet to drop a set in her best performance at Melbourne Park. She has won seven of eight matches this month to back up a title victory in Zhuhai late last year to shape up as a dangerous opponent for Sharapova. \"It's getting to the point now where I'm feeling more and more comfortable on the court and can play my brand of tennis, which when I execute I know it works against the best in the world,\" said a confident Barty. No Australian woman has won the season-opening Grand Slam at Melbourne Park since Christine O'Neill in 1978. Germany's second seed Angelique Kerber, the 2016 title winner, steamrolled Australian youngster Kimberley Birrell 6-1, 6-0 as the Wimbledon champion continued her under-the-radar progress. Meanwhile, unseeded American Amanda Anisimova continued her dream run, ousting 11th seed Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets. The 17-year-old will play eighth seed Petra Kvitova for a place in the quarter-finals. Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova also advanced, crushing Aliaksandra Sasnovich for a showdown with fifth seed Sloane Stephens. -\n\nAFP\n\nMaria Sharapova\n\nCaroline Wozniacki\n\naustralian open\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 10, 2019, 02:52pm\n\nSharapova set for return after lengthy injury absence\n\nJun 2, 2018, 02:41pm\n\nSharapova crushes Pliskova to set up Williams date\n\nMay 19, 2018, 03:50am\n\nSharapova sinks French Open winner Ostapenko\n\nMar 10, 2018, 03:26am\n\nSharapova splits with Dutch coach\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Arguably the most impressive victory in the sequence came last Sunday, when Tottenham were beaten 1-0 at Wembley thanks to a Marcus Rashford goal and an eye-catching goalkeeping display from David de Gea. \"As I've said before, you go into every single game as a Manchester United coach, as a player or manager, thinking you'll win the next one, that's just the nature of this club,\" said Solskjaer. \"We've had six good games but the next one is the most important one. You cannot be too confident. It's complacency you have to be wary of. It's the other side of it. \"I want players to be confident but not be complacent and take their foot off the pedal because that's a big difference for me. I want them go into games full of confidence, taking people on, getting the crowd with them because that's what it's about.\"\n\nSolskjaer has yet to see the best of forward Alexis Sanchez, who missed last Sunday's win at Tottenham with a minor hamstring problem. \"He's champing at the bit in training,\" he said. \"His attitude has been fantastic in training and I'm looking forward to seeing him.\"\n\nThe interim boss has played down the suggestion that he is responsible for coaxing better performances out of the players since last month's departure of Mourinho, adding that he was confident the former United manager would be back in work soon. He said: \"Yeah, why shouldn't he? He's a fantastic manager and with the results he's had I don't think he'll be struggling for work.\"\n\nFellaini injured\n\nSolskjaer said Marouane Fellaini is facing up to four weeks out of action with a calf injury. The Belgium midfielder has made just two substitute appearances for United since Solskjaer replaced the sacked Jose Mourinho. Newspaper reports this week suggested that Fellaini, who signed a two-year contract in June, would be allowed to leave during the January transfer window. His injury would appear to have ended the prospect of that happening, while Solskjaer has given the midfielder some reassurance by suggesting that he has an \"X-factor\". \"There's an X-factor in different players. We all know Felli's X-factor. He'll be working hard to get back in when all the big games are coming as well.\" With Fellaini injured, Solskjaer has suggested that Scott McTominay's chances of going out on loan may have receded. Celtic have been in negotiations with United about taking the Scotland midfielder on loan, but the caretaker manager appears reluctant to sanction a deal. He said: \"Scott is working hard. He's a young boy I still believe in. We're working on his contract. With the injuries to Felli as well and the squad we have, I'm not sure we're going to see any movement.\" -\n\nAFP\n\nManchester United\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 17, 2024, 03:31am\n\nTen Hag confirms Man Utd looked for other managers\n\nMay 26, 2024, 02:25pm\n\n'I'll win trophies elsewhere,' says Erik ten Hag as Manchester United sack talk lingers\n\nMay 24, 2024, 03:27pm\n\nMan City eye double double but Cup final is enough motivation\n\nMay 20, 2024, 02:54am\n\nGuardiola's demand for perfection fuels Man City hunger\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Appearing as an analyst with BeInSports television, Mourinho repeated that his second-placed finish with United last season was one of the best achievements of his career and went on to outline the challenges he said he faced. \"People might say: 'This guy is crazy, he won 25 titles and now he says that second position with United was one of his best achievements in football',\" Mourinho said. \"I keep saying this because people don't know what is going on behind the scenes.\"\n\nMourinho made his point by talking about the set-up that managers need to have in place in order to be successful. \"We are not any more in a time when the coach by himself is powerful enough to cope,\" he said. \"The coach nowadays needs a structure, he needs a club organised in a certain way. \"The club must have an owner or a president, a CEO or executive director, a football director and then the manager. This is the structure that can cope with all the problems modernity is bringing all of us. \"A club must be very well-organised to cope with all these kind of situations where the manager is only the manager and not the man that is trying to keep the discipline or is trying to educate the players,\" he added. \"(Former United manager) Sir Alex Ferguson used to say the day a player is more important than a club, goodbye,\" said the Portuguese, a former Real Madrid and Inter Milan coach. \"Not any more. The manager ought to be there to coach the players, not to keep the discipline at any cost. You need a structure to protect the manager and keep everything in place, so that the players do not arrive in a situation where they feel more powerful than they used to be.\"\n\nUnited have won all five games in the EPL since former player, Norwegian Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, took charge of the side on an interim basis following Mourinho's departure. Mourinho, who also had two spells in the EPL with Chelsea, said he aims to be back in full-time management and has no intention of retiring yet. \"I want to coach. I belong to top-level football and (that) is where I am going to be. \"I am too young, I am in football for a long, long time but I will be 56 in a couple of weeks and am really too young.\" -\n\nREUTERS\n\nJose Mourinho\n\nManchester United\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 12, 2023, 03:07am\n\nRoma out of Singapore Festival of Football, Tottenham will face Lion City Sailors\n\nMay 30, 2023, 02:55pm\n\nJose Mourinho targets 6th European title as Sevilla seek to stay perfect\n\nMay 18, 2023, 07:38am\n\n'I think more about others now,' says 'different' Mourinho\n\nApr 4, 2023, 01:02pm\n\nLiverpool set to headline European football clubs' pre-season tour to Singapore\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He quickly angled, put in his hooks, and locked his hands over the Japanese man's neck to secure a modified guillotine choke - an innovative submission hold he later named \"The Terminator Guillotine.\"\n\nThe submission hold lived up to its name, as Yokota was finished. He quickly tapped out.\n\nPucci was looking to display his martial arts improvement against \"White Dragon\" Xie Chao when they squared off at\n\nONE: Warrior's Dream\n\nin November.\n\nFans would get a glimpse of his grappling prowess as the two-time Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu No-Gi World Champion quickly exploded from the opening bell towards his opponent.\n\nHis back against the cage, Xie was forced to the floor and tried to keep the Evolve representative at bay with his legs.\n\nWhen the Chinese athlete tried to get back on his feet, \"Puccibull\" jumped and locked in a guillotine choke so tight, it put \"White Dragon\" to sleep.\n\nWhile many had yet to predict Lee would become one of the brightest featherweights in the world, his sensational ONE debut would have been a strong foretelling of things to come.\n\nAt\n\nONE: Spirit Of Champions\n\nin December 2015, \"The Warrior\" tested veteran opponent David Meak with lightning-quick jabs and powerful kicks from the start.\n\nNever giving up separation, Lee continuously threatened while pushing forward.\n\nA quick right kick from the Singaporean sent Meak on the backfoot, exposing his head to several strong punches from the Evolve product.\n\nAs Meak was in retreat mode, Lee dropped him with a left hand. Though \"The Warrior\" followed up with more strikes, the referee intervened and waved off the contest.\n\nIt may have lasted only 29 seconds, but it was a debut to remember.\n\nAaron Oh\n\nMMA (MIXED MARTIAL ARTS)\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Consequently, our fair value moves from $2.01 to $2.04.\n\nOther recent developments for MIT include the signing of a long lease agreement with Equinix at its 7 Tai Seng Drive property, and subsequently upgrading it to a data centre.\n\nLooking ahead, although there are concerns of continued negative rental reversions, we believe management's drive to scale up the high-tech value chain will help to mitigate some of the weakness in the traditional industrial space.\n\nTime is needed to extract more value from this transition, but management is clearly moving in the right direction, in our view.\n\nMaintain \"hold\".\n\nSINGAPORE AIRLINES | HOLD (MAINTAINED)\n\nJAN 17 CLOSE:\n\n$9.67\n\nTARGET PRICE:\n\n$10.20\n\nUOB Kay Hian Research, Jan 17\n\nParent airlines' load factor for last month improved for the ninth consecutive month as traffic outpaced capacity growth.\n\nSingapore Airlines (SIA) noted that Rask (revenue relative to seat capacity) remained resilient throughout the quarter. In Q2 FY19, Rask improved by 3.1 per cent, while yields fell 1 per cent.\n\nFor pax yields to remain at least flat year-on-year, Rask would have to rise by 2.2 per cent in Q3 FY19.\n\nDecember's 3.5 per cent year-on-year decline in cargo traffic does not come as a surprise.\n\nHowever, leading indicators such as weak Purchasing Managers' Index now seem to suggest that the trend of weaker cargo will accelerate into 2020.\n\nThus, we lower our cargo traffic growth assumptions from -2.6 per cent to -3.0 per cent for FY19, and from -1.0 per cent to -4.0 per cent for FY20.\n\nScoot's pax load factor has declined for two consecutive months and the carrier is likely to report a loss.\n\nWe thus lower our traffic growth assumptions from 16 per cent to 14 per cent for FY19, and by 3 percentage points to 12 for FY20.\n\nWe continue to value SIA on a sum-of-the-parts basis, with the airline operations valued at 0.75 times book value and SIA Engineering valued at $2.70.\n\nOur fair value is now lowered to $10.20.\n\nSuggested entry price is $9.\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

Remember to spin the temple's famous copper windmill clockwise to summon good luck in the new year.\n\nGet an adrenaline rush at the city's popular sporting event\n\nFrom Che Kung Temple, take the MTR East Rail line to the Sha Tin Racecourse for the Chinese New Year Race Day from 11am to 6pm. The special races, which are the first in the Year of the Pig, provide the perfect opportunity for visitors to experience horseracing, a popular activity in Hong Kong.\n\nPlace a small bet to get in the mood and cheer on the jockey of your choice by shouting the number of the horse you bet on like the locals.\n\nTOURISM & TRAVEL\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Reports have suggested that indoor air quality may be more polluted than outdoor air.\n\nAiming to offer a natural solution for purer air in homes is BetterAir, the world's first surface and air probiotic purifier.\n\nIts pioneering range of three products was exclusively launched yesterday at all Courts Singapore stores and online, marking the first time shoppers anywhere in the world can get their hands on the products within a retail space.\n\nThe partnership between the local consumer electronics and furniture retailer and the global biotechnology company also brings the latter's revolutionary Enviro-Biotics line of probiotic systems here for the first time.\n\nFounded in Israel in 2011 by mathematician Michael Hoffman, BetterAir is particularly relevant to Singaporeans, where 85 per cent of asthmatic patients are allergic to dust mites.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 7, 2025, 11:33pm\n\nFrom TikTok to trendy sports, Queensway shops find ways to thrive amid retail disruption\n\nMore related stories\n\nIts products have been proven to reduce mould, dust mites and allergens that are triggers for asthma and allergic reactions.\n\nWhile conventional air purifiers kill both harmful and beneficial bacteria in the air, BetterAir products actively release environmental probiotics that improve indoor air quality and prolong the cleanliness of indoor surfaces by landing on hard and soft surfaces and consuming resources available to harmful bacteria including dust mite excrement, pollen, pet dander and shed skin cells.\n\nThe products are 100 per cent chemical-free and organic, safe for humans and animals, and also count odour management among its benefits.\n\nMs Taly Dery, president of BetterAir International, told The New Paper: \"The faster you kill bacteria, the faster they develop resistance.\n\n\"BetterAir products don't kill bacteria but add probiotics - the good bacteria that live in our systems - into the environment, which then minimise the presence of harmful bacteria indoors.\"\n\nAdded Mr Amir Yaar, chief executive of BetterAir South-east Asia: \"The average person spends over 90 per cent of their time indoors, and our body systems aren't ready for the aggressive bacteria in our surroundings. Our aim is to prevent (illnesses and infections), rather than cure.\"\n\nThe BetterAir consumer range includes the signature Biotica800 ($499), a compact plug-and-play portable unit that covers up to 800 sq ft (approximately the size of a four-room Housing Board flat); the BioLogic Purifier ($299), a Universal Serial Bus-powered portable unit suited to smaller personal environments such as cars or work cubicles; and the Travel Spray ($19.90), a handheld 75ml spray bottle perfect for flights and daily commuting.\n\nCountry chief executive officer of Courts Singapore Ben Tan said: \"We are honoured to partner BetterAir to bring the world's first probiotic air and surface purifier to Singapore, especially amid growing awareness of asthma and other illnesses being linked to environmental factors such as indoor pollution and mould.\"\n\nBy\n\nAngelii Trissha Mohan\n\nRead articles by Angelii Trissha Mohan\n\nShopping\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 31, 2025, 01:40am\n\nCai fan merch label PointyRice calls out Uniqlo keychain's 'uncanny' likeness\n\nMay 19, 2025, 05:45am\n\nDon Don Donki brings back plastic bags after 7 months of discontinuance\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:28pm\n\nHow to cut $100 from your monthly bills\n\nMay 4, 2025, 02:08am\n\nWhy was there a jam at Causeway on May 3?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

This may also lead ING to ease its full-year GDP forecast for 2019 from the current 2.5 per cent, Mr Carnell said.\n\n\"A weak end to one year always makes it arithmetically harder for the following year to score well. It also lends weight to our view that the Monetary Authority of Singapore will not be conducting any more tightening of monetary conditions through the nominal effective exchange rate index this year.\"\n\nUnited Overseas Bank economist Barnabas Gan said he expects Singapore's external environment to slow further in 2019 but added that he remained positive, with full-year Nodx growth projected at 1 per cent.\n\n\"Accounting for the ongoing US-China trade tensions and US-centric economic risks surrounding its government shutdown, there remains to be downside risks to our trade outlook into the year ahead,\" he said.\n\nEzion Holdings led active trading for a third straight day, with 77 million shares traded. The liftboat-focused firm gained 0.1 cent or 2 per cent in the session to close at 5.1 cents. Meanwhile, ThaiBev ended its nine-day winning streak, down one cent or 1.38 per cent to 71.5 cents on volume of about 14 million shares.\n\nThe usually thinly-traded QT Vascular saw 17.1 million shares change hands, bumping its share price up 0.1 cent or 14.29 per cent to 0.8 cent.\n\nThe medtech company said on Wednesday that it was expanding an ongoing study for one of its products to include the use of an additional surgical procedure, after receiving approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIncluding the use of atherectomy in the study will expand the potential use of QT Vascular's product in hospitals and outpatient labs, said a co-principal investigator of the study.\n\nThe excitement has begun to wear off for CapitaLand, which made headlines earlier this week with its $11 billion acquisition of Temasek unit Ascendas-Singbridge.\n\nTrading volumes returned to normal, with about 6.2 million shares changing hands. The counter closed at $3.28, down two cents or 0.61 per cent. It had gained 0.92 per cent over the previous two days, on volumes of 20.4 million shares traded the day after the announcement and 9.7 million on Wednesday.\n\nThe Singapore bourse is heading into the corporate earnings season, and about a third of the STI constituents will be reporting quarterly or full-year results over the next four weeks.\n\nSingapore Press Holdings kicked things off last week with its first-quarter results, and will be followed by CapitaLand and CapitaLand Mall Trust next week.\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nLEILA LAI\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

This means it is illegal to bring in bak kwa from Malaysia.\n\nAnyone found guilty of importing meat products from unapproved sources can be fined up to $50,000, jailed up to two years, or both.\n\nA similar incident occurred around the Chinese New Year period in February last year, when two motorists attempted to smuggle bak kwa into Singapore through Woodlands checkpoint.\n\nIn last year's case, the bak kwa was hidden in pastry or cookie packaging.\n\nBy\n\nTimothy Goh\n\nRead articles by Timothy Goh\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

However, it is not clear whether streaming involves making a copy at all times or at all,\" he said.\n\nIn April, the courts will hear a criminal case against trading company An-Nahl for \"wilfully\" infringing copyright, including that of telcos StarHub and Singtel as well as the Premier League, by helping people to access pirated content using streaming boxes it was selling.\n\nA date to hear the case against retail firm Synnex Trading over a similar infringement has yet to be fixed.\n\nIRENE THAM, SENIOR TECH CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/55fce81cdb53170513724d6f9c18c0f22c0ebd4c680559eaeb92710d74a7738c/NP_20190118_CTLAW18_4560422.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The legality of media streaming boxes has been a grey and contentious area in copyright law.

The revised Personal Data Protection Act will require individuals affected by a breach to be notified.

(See report, right.)\n\nThe ministry, together with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (Ipos), yesterday released details of these proposed changes in the 70-page Singapore Copyright Review Report.\n\nThe report makes 15 proposals, including a key one that creators will own the copyright to all commissioned works by default, unless they agree otherwise in writing.\n\nNow, the party that commissions a work owns its copyright.\n\nChanging the law \"protects unknowing creators, who may not understand the law, in less than ideal scenarios where there are no contracts dealing with copyright ownership\", said MinLaw in a statement yesterday.\n\nAnother proposal is for creators to be given a new right to be attributed as the creator of their work, even if they have sold the copyright to it.\n\nThis means that anyone using a work publicly - such as posting it on the Internet - will have to acknowledge its creator. There is currently no requirement that they do so.\n\n\"Proper attribution helps creators and performers build their reputation and incentivises creation of new works,\" the report said. \"This is especially important in the digital era, where works are easily misattributed or not attributed at all.\"\n\nThe report also proposes two exceptions designed to improve access to copyrighted materials for purposes of public interest, with appropriate safeguards.\n\nThe first is to allow non-profit schools and their students to use free online resources for teaching purposes. Their existing exceptions generally cover only copying a portion of a work.\n\nThe report also suggested that a new exception be made for those who use automated techniques to analyse text, data and other content to generate insights.\n\nAt present, those who do so risk infringing copyright as this typically requires large-scale copying of works without permission.\n\nAllowing them to do so legally will \"promote applications of data analytics and big data across a gamut of industries, unlocking new business opportunities, speeding up processes, and reducing costs for all\", MinLaw said.\n\nThe report was put together after a three-year review and two rounds of public consultations in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe draft legislative bill will be made available for the public to comment on when it is ready.\n\nLINETTE LAI, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Now, she seeks strength to face adversities in life.\n\nMs Ray also pierces her forehead, cheeks and tongue with skewers that feature Lord Murugan's vel (spear), Lord Shiva's trishul (trident) and the \"Om'\" symbol.\n\nFull-time national serviceman Sagar Parsat is another devotee. He went on a vegetarian diet for three weeks and started preparing his kavadi two months before the festival.\n\nHe said: \"The preparation period was intense. I had to maintain my temper and ensure my mind was pure. I couldn't even shave during that time.\"\n\nMr Sagar, 24, first carried a kavadi in 2017, to show his gratitude when he achieved something he had prayed for.\n\n\"My father carried the kavadi for seven years before I was born.

He ended up crashing into one of them, causing the officer's kneecap to be broken in the resulting collision.\n\nYesterday, Irfan was sentenced to 15 months' supervised probation and ordered to perform 120 hours of community service. He was also forbidden from driving any vehicle during this period, except when required to do so as part of his national service.\n\nHe was enlisted in May last year and is serving in the Singapore Armed Forces.\n\nIrfan had earlier pleaded guilty to one count of causing grievous hurt by a rash act, and another count of obstructing a customs officer.\n\nCourt papers showed Irfan had driven to Sungei Kadut Avenue with his girlfriend on Nov 10, 2017, to buy cigarettes from illegal peddlers.\n\nBut he could not find the brand that he wanted. As he was driving off, a group of Customs officers appeared in front of his car.\n\nThey identified themselves as officials and when Irfan stopped his car, they surrounded the vehicle.\n\nBut Irfan was worried they might discover the contraband cigarettes he had bought earlier and ignored their instructions to wind down his window for an inspection.\n\nHe sped off in his car and crashed into a 40-year-old officer who did not manage to jump out of the way.\n\nIrfan then hit a bicycle parked by the side of the road before he fled the scene in his car with his girlfriend.\n\nDuring sentencing, District Judge Ong Chin Rhu told Irfan, who was found suitable for probation, that the incident was a costly lesson.\n\nFor causing grievous hurt by a rash act, he could have been jailed for up to four years and fined up to $10,000.\n\nFor obstructing a customs officer, he could have been jailed for 18 months and fined up to $10,000.\n\nCARA WONG\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

In some cases the impact was positive but expected to be temporary.\n\nIn Richmond, which includes the port of Baltimore, \"ports saw robust activity in recent weeks\" that they attributed largely \"to orders being made early to avoid possible tariff hikes\".\n\nHowever, \"they expected trade to soften in the next few months.\"\n\nOne Virginia company even had Chinese goods shipped through the west coast ports to beat the tariffs, the report said. - AFP\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

This is because forecasts indicate such an outcome could be damaging not just to Britain, but also Ireland and continental Europe alike.\n\nAs a Remainer in 2016 who wishes Brussels well and wants to see Britain continue to be in a close, cooperative relationship with the EU-27, it has been painful to watch Mrs May's administration make mistake after mistake.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S. Korea protest against vaccine pass rule for kids\n\nMore related stories\n\nA different tone in negotiations could have made a difference alongside a coherent negotiating strategy that did not artificially draw so many supposed \"red lines\" so early.\n\nThe EU has not played a faultless game either. This is despite the plaudits it rightfully receives for proving a far more disciplined, effective negotiator than many in London anticipated two years ago.\n\nWhile Britain's negotiation strategy and vision has been \"missing in action\", Brussels has also struggled to define what Brexit should mean, partly because this forms part of difficult questions around where the EU is headed.\n\nTo be clear, Brussels has offered up numerous opportunities over the last two years to Britain and explained what these are, but there could have been greater willingness to think beyond standard options.\n\nMoreover, in what has been an inherently political negotiation over the withdrawal deal the last two years, the EU has sometimes been legalistic with the process in a way that would have made it hard for any British government, let alone this incompetent one, to deliver.\n\nFor instance, the withdrawal deal and the separate one to set up a new relationship are exceptionally hard to be undertaken in isolation, as the Northern Irish border issue underlines.\n\nLack of imagination by Brussels in Brexit talks potentially stems from initial complacency in some quarters of the EU over the concerns British voters expressed in the referendum, which may have been dismissed too easily in 2016 as British exceptionalism.\n\nHowever, even French President Emmanuel Macron admitted last year his country might vote for Frexit if a similar referendum were held in his country.\n\nMoreover, some EU decision makers, although initially concerned that Brexit could lead to a domino effect across the continent, have perhaps come to see Britain's departure as a \"problem\" that may even be positive for the EU, especially in a context where polls in 2016 and 2017 have shown popular support for the EU at record levels across much of the continent.\n\nNow is the time for Brussels, not just London, to redouble Brexit diplomacy to help ensure that a hard, disorderly exit does not come to pass.\n\nDelivering a smoother departure needs clear strategy and thinking on all sides to deliver on a new phase of constructive partnership that can bring benefits for both.\n\nThis article appeared in The Business Times yesterday.\n\nANDREW HAMMOND\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

What we have done is to use something we often ignore when eating durians - their seeds - to produce a 100 per cent natural food stabiliser that can even keep our gut system healthy,\" said Prof Chen.\n\nHe said a majority of these stabilisers are now harvested from the gum of acacia trees. It is commonly imported from Africa and is not something that can be mass produced here.\n\nExplaining the process, Prof Chen said the durian seeds are first sliced and boiled to extract the gum within. On its own, the gum can be used as a natural food stabiliser. These stabilisers, which contain sugar-protein biopolymers, are commonly used to give food products a smooth texture.\n\nThe durian gum stabiliser also holds together ingredients prone to separating - for example, when gelatin and a form of gum are added to soft candy and sweeteners. It can also act as an emulsifier in lotions and cosmetics, to prevent the ingredients from breaking apart.\n\nBut several more steps are needed to turn the gum, a cheap medium to grow bacteria, into a stabiliser with probiotics.\n\nTo grow probiotics bacteria, the durian seed gum is allowed to ferment with some added bacteria cultures for several days and centrifuged - a process that removes all moisture from a solution. The result is a light pink probiotic powder.\n\nThe scientists said compared to regular powder-based probiotics found in commercial food stabilisers, what they developed has been found to be 20 per cent more effective in keeping probiotics in the stabiliser alive.\n\nProf Chen believes this process will make probiotic compounds more than four times cheaper: from $60 for one litre of growth medium now in the industry, to $13 a litre.\n\nHis NTU research team is currently exploring several industry partnerships with interested companies.\n\nCHERYL TEH\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

During the shutdown, Mr Trump has blamed them for the stalemate, although he had earlier said he would take responsibility.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

His trial last week, in particular, was simply beautiful.\n\nYes, he finished only fourth behind Be Bee, who swooped home to win in a fairly smart time of 1min 00.91sec for the Polytrack 1,000m, but it was evident Sierra Conqueror could have won if his rider had not applied the brakes.\n\nThe KY Young-trained four-year-old Australian-bred was so full of running but was kept under wraps to finish just over a length behind.\n\nBack home, the bay gelding was ever so honest and consistent. From just three starts, he won twice - over 1,000m and 1,110m - and was second once. He also proved himself to be an all-weather galloper, having won on good and soft going.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nHis form filtered to Singapore with his all-the-way success over the Poly 1,000m in a Class 3 Div 2 event. His winning time was pretty good, 59.29sec.\n\nNow that he has improved further, Sierra Conqueror looks set to rule again in a similar Class 3 affair over the same trip in Race 6 tonight.\n\nThe Leticia Dragon-trained Nimble also ran well in his trial last week when a close third to Elite Power. The four-year-old Australian-bred was not hard pressed by his last-start winning rider, Michael Rodd.\n\nThe Australian took the brown gelding out for a spin on Tuesday and it was a good piece of work, one that suggested the horse is as nimble as ever.\n\nJohn Powell was the winning jockey when Nimble made a dream debut on Oct 26 last year in a Class 4 Premier event over the Poly 1,000m. His mount was well up and finished strongly to beat Ironside by 3/4 lengths in a quick 58.88sec.\n\nIronside went on to win his next start, so did Nimble. The dual-winning form was certainly strong.\n\nAlthough going second-up over the Poly 1,200m was not an easy task, Nimble scored again in spectacular fashion. Mind you, he was held up at one stage, but he let down beautifully to beat Yabadabadoo by 11/2 lengths in another noteworthy 1:12.04.\n\nWith his improvement, a hat-trick is certainly on the card.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Nothing has changed. So why did they sack Arsene? If you sack the manager, you need to start a revolution. If you don't give control to Emery, allow him to oversee a revolution, give him the power to bring in new players to change the playing style, then why create all of this mess?\"\n\nPart of the \"mess\" has to do with the curious case of Mesut Oezil, who hasn't played since Boxing Day and has polarised fans and pundits alike.\n\nPetit believes that the German wizard, who is the highest-paid player in Arsenal history, has lost his motivation.\n\n\"I think he lost his motivation and desire. He looks as if he is just waiting for his retirement,\" the 48 -year-old said.\n\n\"A player losing his motivation happens a lot... It's very difficult to play at the same level all of the time... He earns so much money, has already won so many titles... I can see what's going on out on the pitch and his body language is not good.\"\n\nFormer Tottenham Hotspur manager Tim Sherwood says that making Oezil feel like the \"main man\" can help the 30-year-old regain his form and improve the Gunners.\n\nSherwood said on Sky Sports' podcast The Debate: He's one of Emery's best players. You can't burn bridges with a player who is on £350,000 (S$612,000) a week... You have to get him on side and on the pitch, and do his best to make the team better.\n\n\"Guendouzi and Torreira are good at what they do, but they cannot see the pass like Oezil.\n\n\"Get your arm around him and make him feel like he's the main man, because Oezil on form is better than anything Arsenal have.\"\n\nArsenal face London rivals Chelsea on Sunday morning (Singapore time) and Emery will have to do without Henrikh Mkhitaryan (foot injury), who is set to return to training next week, the club have confirmed.\n\nBoth Rob Holding (knee) and Danny Welbeck (ankle) are also out as they are still recovering after surgery.\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Then the noise suddenly stopped, followed by an eerie silence.\"\n\nOther neighbours said Ms Begum had been seen arguing over the past few days with a bald man who often stayed over in her flat.\n\nA man living on the eighth storey said there was a particularly heated argument on Tuesday.\n\n\"They quarrelled for about an hour, shouting at each other outside the unit,\" said the man, who declined to be identified.\n\n\"I recognised the man, who is bald and heavily tattooed. He always parks his motorcycle at the same spot in the carpark.\"\n\nThe residents said police officers knocked on the doors of several neighbours at around 2am to ask they had heard any commotion or saw anyone leaving the scene.\n\nA neighbour on the same level told Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao that he last saw Ms Mallika outside her flat at about 1am with her head wrapped in a towel.\n\nMr Ahmad Hitam, 68, a retiree who lives on the same floor as Ms Mallika, said the block is new, and most residents started moving in only around June last year.\n\n\"There are many quarrels here, and everyone can hear because of the way sounds echo off the blocks,\" he said.\n\n\"I saw the couple frequently. The guy is quite buff while the woman is petite.\"\n\nChecks by TNP indicated that Ms Mallika was married in November 2013. The status of the marriage could not be confirmed.\n\nA business search also showed she started a beauty salon specialising in eyebrows at Toa Payoh Central in 2009. The licence was cancelled in early 2011.\n\nAt least five police investigators were seen entering the flat yesterday, with several others in the common corridor.\n\nThe police cordon, which was in place for more than 12 hours, was removed at around 6.30pm yesterday.\n\nInvestigators were also seen leaving the scene with two large ice boxes, believed to contain evidence, yesterday afternoon.\n\nPolice investigations are ongoing, and the suspect is expected to be charged in court with murder today.\n\nBy\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Alvaro Morata leaves. Gonzalo Higuain arrives. One big name cancels out the other, pacifying those in awe of the cult of celebrity.\n\nBut the Argentinian has fame, rather than form, in his corner and his reported loan move to London smacks of desperation.\n\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri is hoping for goals from an old colleague who doesn't score that often any more.\n\nIndeed, everything about the reported loan deal between Juventus and Chelsea to secure Higuain's services until the end of the season seems to contradict the needs and philosophies of both club and coach.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nGenerally speaking, Roman Abramovich has an aversion to signing older players. Ever since he allowed his personal relationship with Andriy Shevchenko to cloud his judgment, signing the fading striker for a silly sum, the Chelsea owner has insisted on birth-certificate checks.\n\nAnd yet Higuain is 31 and mostly plays like it. He's not a robust thirty-something, capable of reshaping his frame to suit his evolving game like Cristiano Ronaldo, the ageless colossus that replaced him at Juventus.\n\nFor Argentina and his many clubs, Higuain has carved a lucrative career from being the definitive lump up front. But he's slowing down, both on the pitch and on the stats sheet.\n\nHis league-record 36 goals for Sarri's Napoli earned a staggering 90 million-euro (S$139m) move to Juventus in 2016, but the figures have steadily declined ever since.\n\nA respectable 24 goals in his first season dropped to 16 in the second, despite leading the Juve line in a one-team league.\n\nFor club and country, the Argentinian has laboured under the suspicion of being a tad mercurial in front of goal. Indeed, Juventus lost patience and replaced him with Ronaldo, sending Higuain to AC Milan, where he has netted only once more than Morata at Chelsea.\n\nCombining league and Europa League appearances, Higuain has knocked in eight to Morata's seven this season, despite starting more games.\n\nMorata has averaged a goal every 168 minutes. Milan got only a goal every 216 minutes from Higuain.\n\nChelsea need goals, obviously. There's no question that the Morata experiment has failed.\n\nThe Blues are toiling to hold winning positions, considering they haven't scored more than twice in any of their last 13 games.\n\nThe last time they earned an EPL victory by more than one goal was seven games ago.\n\nHiguain enjoyed the most prolific season of his career at Sarri's Napoli, scoring a record-equalling 36 goals in Serie A, so they seem an obvious match made in heaven, right?\n\nThat depends on Sarri. As Morata and Olivier Giroud have discovered to their cost, Sarri shapes a side around his philosophy, rather than a particular group of players (which has benefited David Luiz, for example, but not the two strikers).\n\nPlaying Eden Hazard through the middle, in a false role, may not be a stop-gap measure, but a deliberate tactic that Sarri introduced at Napoli with remarkable success.\n\nSarri adores quick artistes fizzing around the box. Up front, he prefers nifty trios flipping positions and pulling defences out of shape.\n\nAgainst Newcastle United last weekend, Willian, Hazard and Pedro Rodriguez adopted similar roles to Lorenzo Insigne, Jose Callejon and Dries Mertens at Sarri's Napoli.\n\nSarri and Higuain's work at Napoli might have contributed to the Argentinian's greatest goal haul, but what's less remembered is that Sarri's Napoli actually improved once Higuain left for Juventus, finishing second with 91 points.\n\nNapoli's front three of Insigne, Callejon and Mertens took the breath away and Sarri's aesthetic brand of attacking football took him to Chelsea. Then and now, he favours roving, improvising forwards with quick feet. Higuain doesn't really fit the bill.\n\nBut Hazard does. Despite his preference for a left-sided role, he's already picked up 10 goals and 10 assists for the season.\n\nSarri's philosophy approach clearly agrees with the Belgian, which makes Higuain's reported loan deal all the more intriguing.\n\nMorata, Shevchenko, Fernnando Torres and even Giroud are all begrudging members of the Established Strikers Who Flopped at Chelsea club.\n\nHiguain's age, reputation, playing style and loss of form are just crying out to make him another disgruntled member. He is a brand name, but maybe not the right name for Chelsea.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nDiscover Thousands Of Jobs In SG's Aviation Industry\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2c1b1f25b172c37c16de09af2ac3363383b416735e0d581c2e8d86b9a19d0e7c/NP_20190118_NEIL18_4560660.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Gonzalo Higuain scored a record-equalling 36 goals for Napoli in the 2015/16 Serie A season, but the figures have steadily declined since.

I fear for them.\n\n\"They could be out of every major competition by the time Kane comes back and United will be the team benefiting if they collapse now.\"\n\nAldridge's former Ireland teammate Tony Cascarino also believes United could be the beneficiary of Kane's injury - in terms of their reported pursuit of Pochettino.\n\nHe told talkSPORT: \"Harry is a huge loss, this is a big blow to Tottenham and I think it's the final nail in the coffin of them having any chance of competing for the Premier League title.\n\n\"But thinking of the bigger picture, it might be another reason why Pochettino may go.\n\n\"If he thinks he can't have a fully fit Harry Kane every season and can't get a replacement in who is going to do a similar job - that's what they haven't got.\"\n\nIn addition to missing the services of Kane until early March due to ankle-ligament damage sustained against United, Spurs have also bid farewell to midfielder Mousa Dembele, who yesterday joined Chinese side Guangzhou R&F for £11 million (S$19.2m).\n\nPochettino, however, said that Kane's injury will not change the club's plans in the January transfer window.\n\nHe said: \"It didn't change our mind, I think it's a very good opportunity for players to play more, to step up. It's going to be a good opportunity for young players to show their quality.\"\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I will put these first and everything else last.\"\n\nKhan, who is one of ONE Championship's top mixed martial arts talents, is a participant in the highly-anticipated eight-man ONE Lightweight World Grand Prix.\n\nHe is scheduled to face Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt Ariel \"Tarzan\" Sexton at ONE: CALL TO GREATNESS in Singapore on  Feb 22.\n\nAs a father to be, Khan knows that taking care of an infant will cause many sleepless nights. Which is why he says that balance will be the most important aspect moving forward both in his life and in his athletic career.\n\n\"As sleep is essential for an athlete, I have to adjust and adapt,\" said Khan.\n\n\"I have to create a nap routine to make up for the lost sleep. I have no room for error now. My actions and the outcome of my career will determine the quality of life for my child and I definitely want to give my baby the best life possible.\n\n\"This totally changes the game for me. I'm more focused now than ever before.\"\n\nAmir Khan PHOTO: ONE CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nIn three months' time, Khan's life will change drastically.\n\nHe will be not only a top mixed martial arts contender but also a father.\n\nRegardless of the changes in his life, Khan says that martial arts will continue to play a major role in his day to day.\n\nAnd when his child is old enough to train, Khan says he will waste no time in bringing his first-born to Evolve MMA to experience martial arts firsthand from the world champion instructors.\n\n\"I want to emphasize the importance of both fitness and education equally. A healthy body creates a healthy mind,\" said Khan.\n\n\"Martial arts gave me purpose and direction. It gave me something I could be passionate about. This is what I also want for my child, whether that is martial arts or something else.\n\nAmir KhanPHOTO: ONE CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n\"I want my child to learn discipline, which means making sure that required tasks are completed such as schoolwork, chores, and training. I want to teach the value of integrity, and how martial arts taught me to be honest, respectful, and humble.\n\n\"I want to give my baby the confidence to achieve anything, but also to always remain truthful, nice and respectful towards everybody regardless of age, race or gender.\"\n\nKhan has learned many lessons over the course of his mixed martial arts career, which includes a solid start as an amateur. Even before he stepped into the cage, Khan has competed in other combat disciplines such as Muay Thai. His martial arts journey has been a long one, to say the least.\n\nThe 24-year-old lightweight, however, believes that there are two very important lessons he wants to teach his child, which will carve the pathway to success no matter the obstacles.\n\n\"I want my child to find something to be passionate about, the same may martial arts brought passion into my life. I want my child to have something to look forward to every day,\" Khan concluded.\n\n\"And when my child discovers that passion, I will teach the value of relentlessness -- that is to never give up when you set a goal. Having that relentless mindset can allow anyone to achieve great things in life.\"\n\nMMA (MIXED MARTIAL ARTS)\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He had stablemate Tun O'Reilly (Matthew Kellady) as a galloping companion.\n\nTun O'Reilly is slated to run in the Kranji Stakes D event for milers.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nHowever, of the two, it did appear to those at trackside that O'What A Feeling ticked all the boxes.\n\nBack to that last-start in December, it was a race dominated by the sweepers and, at the 200m mark, it resembled the charge of the horse brigade when the backmarkers came thundering home.\n\nO'What A Feeling was in that pack and, when the dust had settled, he found himself beaten into second spot by $98 outsider Billy Britain. That day, O'What A Feeling was ridden by Vlad Duric and punters sent him off as the $33 fourth pick.\n\nIt wasn't the most straightforward of rides for Duric as his mount had shifted in during the running. But it was still a dogged display which served to suggest he could be the one to beat in his next start - which just happens to be in Race 6 on Sunday.\n\nA six-year-old by O'Reilly, O'What A Feeling had two runs earlier - in October of last year - played bridesmaid to Lim's Ripple in a race run over the 2,000m. He was a tad unfortunate that day, having had to check at around the 1,200m mark.\n\nIt's been almost a year since he last won a race and the time looks ripe for him to knock in another one for his connections.\n\nAs for Tun O'Reilly, his galloping partner yesterday morning, his last win was way back in September of 2017. That was on debut and it also makes him winless for over 16 months.\n\nStill, he is not without a hope in that 1,600m race on Sunday.\n\nIndeed, he seems to be running into some kind of form recently and has made the board in three of his last four starts.\n\nLast time out, when drawn an outside alley, they changed riding tactics on him and attempted to go forward early. That he did, pinching the lead after the get-go. But it meant he had to race wide and without cover for quite a bit of the mile trip.\n\nHe finished sixth, but he's better than that. Have him in your calculations when planning an assault on those exotic bets.\n\nWe don't know much about him, but Smash would have gone into many notebooks when he finished third Federation over 1,200m on New Year's Day.\n\nAnd yesterday morning, the Michael Clements-trained youngster got himself ready for his Sunday assignment (Race 3) with a pleasing workout on the training track.\n\nRidden by Glen Boss, the son of Guillotine showed good action when running the 600m in 36.3sec.\n\nHe looks trim enough to run a good race over the the longer 1,400m on Sunday. Keep him on your shortlist.\n\nYesterday's Kranji gallops by horses engaged on Sunday\n\nRACE 1\n\nAstra\n\n*\n\n(B Woodworth) 35.5. Gridiron (G Boss)\n\n*\n\n35.5.

She had covered the 1,000m in 60.51sec.\n\nPHOTO: STC\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 16, 2019, 10:00pm\n\nArarat Lady whips the boys\n\nThe best from the trials held at Kranji on Tuesday morning\n\nShare this article\n\nArarat Lady shouldn't be so good. Her mum and dad weren't superstars and, as a yearling, she went under the hammer for just $3,000.\n\nBut she doesn't know any of that and, from what little we have seen from her, she's got, what they call, that \"great tick of the heart\".\n\nAnd it was this \"great tick of the heart\" which brought her a win and a placing so early in her career.\n\nAnd, judging from the way trainer Cliff Brown has been moulding her, there could be many more photo-taking sessions with Arafat Lady coming up in the winner's enclosure.\n\nThe filly was at the trials on Tuesday morning and, by all counts, she impressed.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nRidden by Michael Rodd and jumping from the outermost gate in that eight-horse hit-out, Ararat Lady was never in a real hurry and, for most of the trip, she allowed the boys to show off up front.\n\nThat, they did, with Great Seven, Chopin's Fantaisie and Kiss Your Song always prominent at the head of the field.\n\nBut once they reached the top of the stretch, the \"Lady\" made the boys look second-best.\n\nMustering up speed at the 250m mark, she came at them.\n\nTwo hundred metres out and only Twickenham looked dangerous.\n\nSo began the battle to the line. A battle between an eight-year-old veteran and the three-year-old filly.\n\nLocked together over the final stages, they went stride for stride. Heads up, heads down, there was no economy in effort.\n\nIf it was her aim to dominate, she did. In the shades of the winning post, Ararat Lady pipped Twickenham to the prize.\n\nShe had covered the 1,000m in 60.51sec. Not record-breaking but not bad at all.\n\nArarat Lady had two similar trials before her debut in mid-October last year.\n\nShe won them both - and with quite a bit of authority.\n\nAfter running second on debut, Ararat Lady had quite a huge fan base and they backed her down to $15 favouritism in her second start.\n\nTheir money was safe.\n\nRodd timed his run to perfection, asking the \"Lady\" for an effort 300m from home.\n\nShe obliged, beating the boys rather stylishly.\n\nWe have yet to see her in action in 2019.\n\nWhen he does go to the races, be sure you're with her. This \"Lady\" is no tramp.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, we saw a good run from Murrayfield.\n\nOut of touch with the leaders until the 300m mark, he came with a barnstorming run to wear down Lucky Hada (Daniel Moor) and newcomer Mr David.\n\nRidden by I Amirul, the Stephen Gray-trained runner would eventually put half a length between himself and Lucky Hada with Mr David (E Aslam) a weakening third.\n\nA hard one to pin down, his five wins have been well spaced out. Sparingly raced in 2018, he last saluted the judge in September and has yet to show up in the new year.\n\nBut keep him on your shortlist. He seems to be running into some kind of form and is always a good candidate for those novelty bets.\n\nTuesday's Kranji barrier trials results\n\nTRIAL 1\n\n1 Speedy Rose\n\n2 Winning Legend (M Rodd)\n\n3 Lucky Enough (D Moor)\n\n4 Meteor Loui (I Azhar)\n\nMargins and time:\n\nHd, 4¼, 18¼ (1min 02.71sec)\n\nTRIAL 2\n\n1 Murrayfield (I Amirul)\n\n2 Lucky Hada (Moor)\n\n3 Mr David (E Aslam)\n\n4 Richebourg (R Zawari)\n\n5 Star Jack (M Zaki)\n\n6 Magic City (F Yusoff)\n\nMargins and time:\n\n½, 2½, ¾, 17, 9 (1:02.39)\n\nTRIAL 3\n\n1 Ararat Lady (Rodd)\n\n2 Twickenham (Amirul)\n\n3 Great Seven\n\n4 Kiss Your Song (J Powell)\n\n5 Our Pinnacle (Moor)\n\n6 Sacred Guru (B Woodworth)\n\n7 Chopin's Fantaisie (G Boss)\n\n8 Tales Of Summer (N Zyrul)\n\nMargins and time:\n\nHd, 4, 6½, ½, 1, ½, 1 (1:00.51)\n\nTRIAL 4\n\n1 Silent Boss\n\n2 Axel (MM Firdaus)\n\n3 The Nutter (Zyrul)\n\n4 Heng Kingdom (B Thompson)\n\n5 Clarton Star (Zawari)\n\n6 Middle Kingdom (Moor)\n\n7 Cracking Tottie (Rood)\n\n8 Military Alliance (TH Koh)\n\nMargins and time:\n\nShd, 2¾, nk, nk, nk, 1¼, 4 (1:02.13)\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

For example, get a basic pot of pen cai, throw in a can of abalone, some meats and vegetables, and you will have a luxurious version.\n\nAny bundle from the major restaurant groups is worth considering because they have economies of scale to offer good deals.\n\nHere are some deals worth checking out:\n\nCRYSTAL JADE\n\nIts Auspicious Reunion Feast bundle (from $368.80) has five dishes - Bountiful Abalone Treasure Pot, Reunion Norwegian Salmon Yusheng, Fortune Chicken, Fried Glutinous Rice with Cured Meats and either a nian gao or savoury carrot cake - and that is good enough for a meal.\n\nOn its own, the pen cai is priced from $268.80 and has 18 items such as whole 10-head abalone, sea cucumber and fish maw.\n\nYou can order online (estore.crystaljade.com) or head down to the restaurants. Crystal Jade is working with several bank credit cards and you will be able to get discounts with them.\n\nTUNGLOK GROUP\n\nIts Take Home Feast (from $388) has five items for a fuss-free meal. The cost depends on the pen cai you pick (three choices) and how many people you will be feeding.\n\nThere will also be yusheng, superior herbal chicken, fried glutinous rice and nian gao.\n\nThere is a vegetarian version that starts at $268. If you are a Citibank or United Overseas Bank card holder, you will get 15 per cent off your Take Home Feast if you order by Sunday.\n\nMERCURE SINGAPORE BUGIS\n\nSong Garden (Mercure Singapore Bugis, Tel: 6521-9299) has curated the Home Reunion Takeaway set (from $498) and filled it with goodies.\n\nOne of the highlights is the Song Garden Supreme Fortune Pot, with ingredients such as Japanese eight-head abalone and crispy pork belly.\n\nYou can add on more sides such as Water Chestnut Cake ($20.80) and Steamed Carrot Cake with Chinese Sausage ($20.80).\n\nSHANGRI-LA HOTEL SINGAPORE\n\nThe Festive Counter (Tel: 6213-4398) at the lobby of Shangri-La Hotel Singapore is now open, and it has lots of Chinese New Year goodies available, including the Prosperity Luxury Combo ($528).\n\nThis set is good for eight and contains the usual line-up of festive dishes. The stars are the Abundance Treasure Pot and Fortune Abalone Yu Sheng.\n\nPARADISE GROUP\n\nThe Bountiful Takeaway Set ($328) from the Paradise Group has four dishes: Prosperity Abalone Yu Sheng, Treasure Pot, Black Truffle Kampong Chicken and Fortune Lotus Leaf Glutinous Rice.\n\nUsually the treasure pot is the centrepiece, but here, it is the chicken. It is baked for 90 minutes with black truffle and doused in a house-made sauce and will go great with rice.\n\nYou can order this from any of the group's restaurants.\n\nGIANT\n\nSupermarket chain Giant has made it easy to organise a steamboat with its steamboat bundle Click & Collect service. You get to choose from three bundle options, and each set features hotpot essentials and luxury ingredients such as Iberico and kurobuta pork, abalone and sea cucumber.\n\nThe bundle options are Success ($88, for four), Joy ($128, for eight) and Premium Good Luck ($168, for eight). You can do add-ons. To order, visit www.giant.sg/steamboat before Jan 28. Collect from Feb 1 at Giant Tampines, IMM, Suntec City and Sembawang.\n\nBy\n\nYeoh Wee Teck\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Yeoh Wee Teck\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d2e5c6b10b1b375a7a259c6e0e157efcbe6ce005ad91a99f11386f7d40f089f/NP_20190117_YECNY179SHV_4556657.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Auspicious Reunion Feast bundle from Crystal Jade.", "caption": "Auspicious Reunion Feast bundle from Crystal Jade.

One reason could be that many smaller companies choose not to formalise their flexible arrangements in order to retain management control and flexibility.\n\nAssociation of Small and Medium Enterprises vice-president Chew Lee Ching said small and medium-sized businesses recognise that flexi-work arrangements can be a way to retain staff amid the labour crunch but most do not have manpower capacity to offer them.\n\nFOR MORE, READ THE STRAITS TIMES TODAY\n\nJOANNA SEOW, MANPOWER CORRESPONDENT\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But it was no joking matter. April Fool's Day or not, it was devastating for trainer Michael Clements and his team when Chopin's Fantaisie returned to scale bleeding from the nostrils.\n\nHe had just won a Kranji Stakes B race over the 1,400m. But when there should have been champagne and celebration, there was doom and gloom. It was the second time Chopin's Fantaisie had bled and it meant a mandatory six months on the sidelines.\n\nSo off he went, packed up and put out to pasture in the open space in Malaysia which serves as a spelling station.\n\nThe six months quickly turned to nine months and it was on Tuesday that Chopin's Fantaisie was next seen on the racetrack. The occasion was the trials on Tuesday and the five-year-old had Glen Boss on the reins. Out of the gates with the rest, Boss never asked him to do more than what was required.\n\nThe pair eventually beat just one home in the trial won by Ararat Lady - but no one was keeping score.\n\nAll that mattered was that Chopin's Fantaisie's welfare and, on that count, it seemed all went well.\n\n\"He had a great trial,\" said Clements. \"He jumped well and was interested throughout.\n\n\"Glen sat on him and said he could have anytime pushed him up and he would have moved away, but he held on to him.\n\n\"I'll give him another trial in two weeks' time and we'll take it from there.\"\n\nBack to that win in April, he had run a lung-buster of a race and his connections were already dreaming big dreams when Vlad Duric brought him back to scale.\n\nIn their crystal ball, they saw the Singapore Four-Year-Old Challenge and the Derby.\n\nThen they saw the one thing which dashed all plans. Chopin's Fantaisie had bled - again.\n\nTo say it was another spanner in the works was a gross understatement. All the patience and hard work to bring him back had been snuffed out in just one race.\n\nBut no one was about to give up on the gelding. Like he did after that first bleeding attack, Clements and his team are now hoping for the same. And that is, that Chopin's Fantaisie returns as an even better horse.\n\n\"The good thing about him is while bleeding is a horrible experience for most horses, he seems to bounce back well from it.\n\n\"He's only lightly-raced, and he has the greatest temperament. You can do anything with him.\"\n\nStill, Clements is taking no chances. Another bleeding attack, and it could be \"game over\" for the gallant gelding.\n\nSo it is, for now, nothing's cast in stone. \"We have not locked in any race for him,\" said the trainer.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!
