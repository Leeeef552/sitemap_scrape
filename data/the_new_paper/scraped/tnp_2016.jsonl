Chinese newspaper Global Times reported that moviegoers in Beijing's Chaoyang district organised a protest demanding refunds after catching the film in 3D.\n\nThe film was shot in 2D and released in its original format elsewhere. But the paper said only eight of Beijing's 149 cinemas, and nine of Shanghai's 174 cinemas, were offering screenings of the 2D version.\n\nUniversal Pictures' Beijing office said on microblogging platform Sina Weibo that it is working with local distributors to arrange more 2D screenings to serve the audience's \"diversified moviegoing needs\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\nDepp-Heard divorce drama continues\n\nThe war is apparently not over between US actor Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard.\n\nThe 30-year-old US actress had announced that she would be donating the entire divorce settlement of US$7 million (S$9.4 million) to the American Civil Liberties Union and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles.\n\nBut Depp, 53, decided to cut out the middleman and donate the money directly to the charities in a series of instalments.\n\nHeard's team slammed his payment plan, saying in a statement: \"If Johnny wishes to change the settlement agreement, we must insist that he honour the full amount by donating US$14 million to charity, which, after accounting for his tax deduction, is equal to his US$7 million payment obligation to Amber.\n\n\"We would also insist that the full amount be paid immediately and not drawn out over many years.\"\n\nSeagal meets Belarus president\n\nUS actor Steven Seagal rubbed shoulders with Mr Alexander Lukashenko, the controversial president of Belarus, last Wednesday.\n\nSeagal even ate one of Mr Lukashenko's home-grown carrots in the latter's garden.\n\nPresidential press footage showed Mr Lukashenko picking up a long carrot, quickly peeling it and handing it to the 64-year-old martial arts star.\n\nSeagal was in Belarus for discussions with game developer Wargaming, which is famed for its World of Tanks video game.\n\nIt was not the first time Mr Lukashenko hosted a celebrity in his home near Minsk.\n\nFrench actor Gerard Depardieu was his guest for the harvest meal last year.\n\nParker stops being ambassador for EpiPen maker\n\nUS actress Sarah Jessica Parker ended her role as a spokesman for Mylan, the manufacturer of EpiPen, after the company hiked the price of the allergy injector to more than US$500 (S$676).\n\nIt was a more than 400 per cent increase since it released the product in 2007.\n\nParker, 51, became its paid spokesman after using the emergency device on her son, 13-year-old James Wilkie, when she realised he was severely allergic to peanuts.\n\nShe wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday: \"I'm left disappointed, saddened and deeply concerned by Mylan's actions.\n\n\"I do not condone this decision and I have ended my relationship with Mylan as a direct result of it.\"\n\nUsually I cringe through the (film's) premiere and hate everything I do.

(\n\nSee other\n\n)\n\nKEEN ON SPEED\n\nOn her decision to join the show, Dela Merced, who is also a model and a TV personality, said: \"Anything to do with speed, I'm in.\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm more than happy... to share my expertise. It's a great honour.\"\n\nThis expertise stems from a lifelong love affair with cars.\n\nShe \"grew up with cars\" as she helped to clean the vehicles at her father's second-hand dealership when she was a child.\n\nShe also had three older brothers who loved video games and introduced her to the racing video game Moto Roader.\n\n\"I fell in love with (racing) when I was a kid because of that game,\" Dela Merced recalled. \"(In) my first year of high school, I told my family that as soon as I hit 18, I'm going to race.\"\n\nDela Merced received \"an old, beat-up\" 1980's Toyota Starlet on her 18th birthday and became set on a career in motorsports.\n\nInitially, her family was not supportive because of the danger and competitiveness of racing, but her father allowed her to participate in his place at the Porsche World Roadshow, one of the very first professional driving events she was exposed to.\n\n\"It was supposed to be a one-time affair, but they saw potential in the way that I drove,\" she said.\n\nAlthough the desire to break gender stereotypes was not the reason she joined Celebrity Car Wars, she hopes her and fellow Filipino racecar driver Michele Bumgarner's involvement as coaches will inspire girls with an interest in motorsports.\n\n\"I'm sure that they are a lot more females around the globe who want to be racecar drivers, and when they see (Celebrity Car Wars), I hope they realise that they can,\" she said.\n\n\"It would be great to hear and see, months later, (women) actually doing it.\"\n\nThe whole stigma that women cannot drive was still rampant in the Philippines, so there was double the pressure and effort on my part to prove that I belonged.\n\n- Professional racecar driver Gaby Dela Merced\n\ntelevision\n\nCars\n\nDriving\n\nShare this

I love it,\" said the 28-year-old Kerber, who defeated Williams in the Australian Open final in January for her maiden Grand Slam title.\n\n\"Let's see what happens in the next two weeks.\"\n\nKerber is right to be cautious, having suffered in the past for allowing herself to get tied up in knots by predictions and permutations.\n\nAt the WTA Championships in Singapore last year, she needed to take just one set off Lucie Safarova to make the semi-finals of the lucrative season-ender.\n\nInstead, she got so distracted by the \"ifs\", \"whats\" and \"maybes\", that she was eliminated after being defeated in straight sets.\n\n\"I will not put too much pressure on this. If the day will come when I reach No. 1, that would be amazing,\" said the German.\n\nMATURITY\n\n\"I learned a lot of things the last year, especially with the Singapore thing. So I will try to enjoy every moment right now because it's one of the best seasons of my career.\"\n\nMuguruza, the world No. 3, has an outside chance of taking the top spot.\n\nBut the 22-year-old Spaniard, who made her Grand Slam breakthrough after beating Williams in the final of this year's French Open, has time on her side. She is 12 years younger than Williams.\n\nWhen the American first made No. 1 back in 2002, Muguruza was just eight.\n\n\"I feel the discussion (over the world No. 1 ranking) is much louder,\" said the Venezuela-born player.\n\n\"There are a couple of players that if they do really well and whatever the situations are, they can reach No. 1. So that creates a little bit of juicy comment.\"\n\nThe discussion is louder also because of the calibre of the players involved - both Kerber and Muguruza are now Grand Slam winners.\n\nOver the last decade, however, there were several women who became the top-ranked player without winning a Major either at the time or since.\n\nJelena Jankovic (18 weeks in total in 2008 and 2009), Dinara Safina (26 weeks in two 2009 spells) and Caroline Wozniacki (two periods stretching over 2010/11 and 2011/12, totalling 67 weeks).\n\nAll three women made the finals at Majors, went to No. 1 but never cracked a Grand Slam title.\n\nJankovic was runner-up at the 2008 US Open, Safina made the finals of the 2008 Australian Open and 2008 and 2009 French Opens.\n\nWozniacki was twice a finalist in New York - in 2009 and 2014.\n\nSix defeats in total - Williams was responsible for three of them. - AFP.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/79d0d7ba5e004606af7491b7ec92717f492e3b7073a1c5909c6a3b2bac123483/NP_20160829_WOMTEN29_1369495.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "UNDER SIEGE: Angelique Kerber and Garbine Muguruza will be Serena Williams (above) biggest threats at the US Open.", "caption": "UNDER SIEGE: Angelique Kerber and Garbine Muguruza will be Serena Williams (above) biggest threats at the US Open."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It's a slightly different mentality to maybe when you're younger and you feel like you have a bit more time on your side,\" said Murray.\n\nMurray has played in all of the first three finals of the Majors in 2016, losing to world No. 1 Djokovic in Melbourne and Paris before defeating Milos Raonic in straight sets in the Wimbledon final.\n\nMurray's consistency on the tour in recent weeks is in stark contrast to the roller-coaster fortunes of reigning champion Djokovic.\n\nAfter he won a maiden French Open to complete the career Grand Slam, all talk was of the Serb going on to retain his Wimbledon and US Open titles and clinch a calendar Grand Slam.\n\nThe expectations proved too heavy a burden when the 12-time Major winner was dumped out of Wimbledon in the third round for his earliest loss at a Major in seven years.\n\nA shock first-round defeat at the Olympics by Juan Martin del Potro and a withdrawal from Cincinnati with a wrist injury suggested all is not well with the 2011 and 2015 US Open winner.\n\n\"I am not 100 per cent.

I saw his will to work and improve, and find a good shape very quickly. I can also say that his performance can still improve.\n\nTITLE CHALLENGE\n\n\"But I'm pleased with his commitment and workrate - and the same goes for all the players. The attitude is good and I like this.\"\n\nHazard's performance in Chelsea's latest win hints at good things to come for the Blues, who are hoping to challenge for the title this season despite the huge amounts of money spent by rivals such as Manchester United and Manchester City.\n\nConte, who came straight to Stamford Bridge after guiding Italy to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016, has totally transformed the atmosphere in west London - and getting the best out of Hazard could be the key to future success.\n\n\"I'm pleased for him, but also for Pedro as a winger too,\" said Conte, who brought the former Barcelona wide man on against Burnley and saw him set up the third goal a minute from time.\n\n\"These are players with great talent, fantastic in one versus one. When you have these players with great talent, it's good for me to put them in the best condition to excite with this talent.\n\n\"It's a pity that now there is this international break. After three wins, I wanted to continue playing games. But we have to stop.\n\n\"Starting the season with three league wins and one in the cup is good for the confidence of the players, the fans, for the club, for me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Burnley manager Sean Dyche knows he needs to move quickly in a very difficult transfer market to prevent his side losing heavily at places like Stamford Bridge in future.\n\n\"It's tough,\" he said.\n\n\"That's the reality of where we're at as a club. It's a tough market. I'm hearing that from managers across the board.

In the second half he dropped physically. But of course we need him.\n\n\"I think what we have seen from him today is what we want from him. To give assists but as well to score goals.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nSep 9, 2022, 11:08am\n\nEnglish Premier League fixtures postponed after Queen Elizabeth's death\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"So I'm very happy that he scored today because that's what he has to add to his game.\n\n\"We paid a heavy price in our first game (the 4-3 defeat by Liverpool) because we were not ready.\n\n\"Now Mesut is nearly there, not completely, but he just goes again. For us, the break is not welcome.\"\n\nThe pressure had been on Wenger and his side heading into the weekend after perfect starts from both Manchester clubs had left them playing catch-up.\n\nThis, then, was just the performance and outcome required heading into the international break.\n\n\"I believe we shot ourselves in the foot in first game and were under huge pressure. We had two difficult away games (against Leicester City and Watford) but today I believe we had a good solid performance,\" Wenger said.\n\n\"We had a good cushion at half-time. At the moment we are not completely there physically and you could see that in the second half.\"\n\nNEW ARRIVALS\n\nThe imminent arrivals of defender Shkodran Mustafi from Valencia and striker Lucas Perez from Deportivo La Coruna, both of whom Wenger confirmed had passed medicals, should go a step towards placating fans left frustrated by their sluggish start.\n\n\"I think they should go through, both of them,\" he said.\n\n\"They've had medicals and we have to finish the paperwork. I don't know exactly when we'll announce it, but I think we'll announce it in the middle of the week.\"  - AFP.\n\nenglish premier league\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 23, 2021, 03:35pm\n\nHolland not counting on van Dijk for Euros\n\nMar 23, 2021, 03:11pm\n\nThiago laments emotional difficulty of pandemic football\n\nMar 10, 2021, 04:22pm\n\nMourinho looking to mark career milestone with trophy for Spurs\n\nMar 9, 2021, 09:56am\n\nChelsea's mean defence is down to trust and courage: Tuchel\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/432c63c2c98fee4fcad98b0e32440688d578198bc1972704a183b7c30f80dc5b/NP_20160829_ARS29_1369572.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6432b67dd00690b82eaf11d27c5f42a592228f6a564c4b4d552a61210421b81d/dw-football-qe2-220909.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "English Premier League fixtures postponed after Queen Elizabeth's death", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5de22c0d94ccaaa9c5aab6910a26b058bbe4700b6c649266195497f929b10221/vvd24.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Holland not counting on van Dijk for Euros", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Some had joined the security agencies when Singapore and Malaysia were riddled with communist assassins.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1956, there were more than 20 incidents of communist gunmen shooting, stabbing and even lobbing grenades at police officers, Voluntary Special Constables and detectives - many of whom were hurt and killed.\n\nThese men donned their uniforms during those turbulent years.\n\nMany of the 13 men on that Feb 9, 1974, Japan Airlines flight to Kuwait had seen frontline action prior.\n\nRetired Lieutenant-Colonel Clarence Tan Kim Peng served with several units including the Malaysian Special Operations Force during Konfrontasi (1963-1966).\n\nSuperintendent S. Rajagopal of the counter terrorism unit, Internal Security Department (ISD), was trained to take the bullet while protecting Singapore's first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew from communist assassins (1959-1960).\n\nAnd the men continued to be involved in major operations, away from prying eyes and never for self-glorification.\n\nISD deputy director Seah Wai Toh was involved in negotiating the surrender of four armed Vietnamese who had hijacked an Air Vietnam flight in 1977.\n\nMr Saraj Din, also of ISD, was involved in the 1991 SQ117 operations in which four Pakistani hijackers seized a Singapore Airlines plane.\n\nUstaz Abu Bakar, who was a Syariah Court official in 1974, was involved in the rehabilitation of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorists here.\n\nSo much of the discourse of Singapore is wrapped around its position as an economic miracle.\n\nBut without men and women like the 13 in 1974, there would be no security. Without security, there would be no economic miracle.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Was resolved and life is going on like everything else.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal insisted yesterday morning that they have no intention of loosening their grip on power despite the sport's \"Big Four\" slipping into the twilight of their careers.\n\nMurray, Nadal, Djokovic and Roger Federer have accounted for 46 of the last 53 Majors among them.\n\nThe physical cracks are starting to show - Djokovic and Nadal have been bothered by wrist problems in recent weeks while 35-year-old Federer has shut down his 2016 season due to a knee injury.\n\nBut Murray, described by top-10 rival Kei Nishikori as \"Ironman\" for his battling run to the Olympic Games gold medal in Rio, says that at 29 years old, he is using his age as a motivating factor.\n\n\"I'd imagine I'd be playing at this level for three, four more years, max,\" said Murray, the holder of three Grand Slam titles.\n\n\"It's not easy to do that. I hope I'm still playing like this when I'm 38 years old, but it's pretty unlikely.\n\n\"I want to make the most of every tournament I play in and try and win and achieve as much as I can the next few years.\"\n\nNadal, a year older than both Djokovic and Murray at 30, has endured a catalogue of injury woes throughout his career, but went on a marathon run at the Olympics where he lost in the semi-finals of the singles but won gold in the men's doubles.\n\n\"The 'Big Four' are getting older. But still Novak is No. 1, Andy No. 2,\" said 14-time Grand Slam champion Nadal.\n\n\"It's obvious that we will not be here forever, but I think I can play to the level I had before my injury for the next three, four years.\"\n\nDjokovic believes that he remains at the peak of his powers despite a shock third-round loss at Wimbledon.\n\n\"I'm 29 and believe that I'm at a peak of my abilities as a tennis player,\" said the Serb.\n\n\"I'll try to keep that peak as consistent and enduring as much as possible.\"\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nTennis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 02:25am\n\nChinese tennis player Peng Shuai denies making accusation of sexual assault\n\nFeb 4, 2022, 08:01am\n\nBarca official resigns after calling Spanish tennis star Nadal an 'enemy of the state'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nDance your WiFi troubles away with StarHub Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b2939108a54d3cc0e941dff11fe7a9a52a996839db59a4e9ce506506332d441e/federer.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Federer bids emotional farewell to tennis at Laver Cup", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b33f7573f28d39ddab2516b5cc97ac9b727167a778a61651942e1ca8f8be39e3/ac_serena1_010922.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Serena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I think I just am more relaxed, for sure.\"\n\nWilliams, 34, said her shoulder issues surfaced the day after the Wimbledon final, where she beat Angelique Kerber of Germany to win her 22nd Grand Slam singles title to match Steffi Graf for most in the Open era.\n\nThe hard-serving American has played only seven tournaments this year, with a third-round exit from the Rio Olympic singles and a first-round elimination from the Rio doubles with sister Venus her only tournament action since Wimbledon.\n\n\"I think usually I prefer to play more coming into the final Grand Slam of the year, but there is nothing we can do about it. You just have to make the best of every single opportunity. That's all I can do now,\" she said.\n\nWith Kerber, who beat Williams in the final of the Australian Open, threatening to leapfrog her into the world No. 1 spot at last week's Western & Southern Open, the American asked for a Cincinnati wildcard but, after practising there, decided she could not compete.\n\nThe German fell in the final to Karolina Pliskova, allowing Williams to hold the top spot through the Open and extend her streak to 186 weeks at No. 1, equalling Graf for the longest continuous reign.\n\nFirst up for Williams in New York will be Russian left-hander Ekaterina Makarova, who has lost four of five matches to the American but beat her at the 2012 Australian Open.\n\n\"I'm okay with it,\" Williams said about the draw.\n\n\"I try to look at it, we all always have tough matches. \"She's a big fighter.

Until now, of course, results help.\"\n\nThe 45-year-old added that new signing Claudio Bravo will not be rushed straight into the starting 11 for their Premier League clash with West Ham tonight.\n\nThe Chile international completed a £13.75-million ($24.5m) move from Barcelona to City earlier this week and was expected to be immediately installed as Guardiola's new No. 1.\n\nNOT READY\n\nBut the Spaniard, who has so far preferred Willy Caballero to Joe Hart in the Premier League, does not think the 33-year-old Bravo is ready for action yet.\n\nIt is therefore likely that Caballero will play, even though England international Hart was restored to the starting line-up for Thursday's Champions League play-off victory over Steaua Bucharest.\n\nGuardiola said of Bravo: \"He's fit, but he's not going to play this weekend.\"\n\nThe manager, however, made clear he feels the new signing fits the bill in terms of the ball-playing goalkeeper he is looking for, with Hart's distribution being his perceived weakness.\n\nThe City boss said of Bravo: \"He's a goalkeeper with a lot of experience in Spain and with the (Chile) national team.\n\n\"His experience, to anticipate situations not in the box and in front of the box, being good in the build-up play and quick under the posts - he is a good player for us.\"\n\nThe Chilean, meanwhile, said that his new boss and his footballing philosophy are infectious.\n\n\"I think when the best manager in the world explains a project to you, it makes you motivated to see football differently.

It reflects a serious and fair solution for European club football.\n\n\"I am particularly pleased with the fact that the European football community remains united moving forward.\"\n\nUefa has been without a president since last December when Frenchman Michel Platini was banned for eight years by global football body Fifa for ethics violations, later reduced to four on appeal by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nUefa will hold an election to find a replacement for Platini in Athens on Sept 16.\n\nMichael van Praag, Angel Maria Villar and Aleksandar Ceferin, the heads of the Dutch, Spanish and Slovenian federations respectively, are the three candidates.\n\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo won the Uefa Best Player in Europe Award on Thursday after winning both last season's Champions League and Euro 2016 with Portugal.\n\nRonaldo, 31, received the accolade for the second time in his career, after finishing ahead of Real teammate Gareth Bale and Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann.\n\n\"I'm obviously delighted to receive this award. It's been an incredible season, but the two other players deserve it as well,\" said Ronaldo, who also won the prize in 2013-14.\n\nRonaldo struck the winning spot-kick as Real claimed a record 11th European Cup title, beating city rivals Atletico on penalties in May, before leading his country to Euro 2016 glory.\n\nRonaldo scored three goals en route to the final of the tournament to equal Platini's record of nine goals in the European Championship Finals.\n\nThe award was voted for by journalists from each of Uefa's 55 member associations. - Wire Services.\n\nSILVERWARE: Cristiano Ronaldo is Uefa's Best Player in Europe after lifting the Champions League trophy (above) with Real Madrid and winning Euro 2016 with Portugal.

When they met in this fixture in the 2014/15 season, they drew 1-1. In their last five meetings, Chelsea have led at the interval.\n\nCan try: Chelsea on 1/2 Goal\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE v BOURNEMOUTH\n\nLast season, the Eagles were dismal at home - winning six from 19.\n\nBut the same goes for the Cherries. They, too, won only six times while on the road. Last season, 32 of Bournemouth's matches had goals at the break. In all, 22 of them ended EVEN.

Seven of their last 10 meetings ended with one goal at the interval.\n\nCan try: Everton 1-0 at the break\n\nLEICESTER v SWANSEA\n\nLast season, the wily Foxes scored seven goals against the Swans - without reply.

The Black Cats, on the other hand, were disappointing when on the road, winning just three from their 19 away games.\n\nOn last season's stats, EVEN seems the way to go. Their last three meetings saw them level at the break.\n\nCan try: THREE on Total Goals\n\nHULL v MAN UNITED\n\nThe head-to-head stats say the Tigers cannot win. However, when the two teams last met in May 2015, Hull held on to a 0-0 draw.\n\nWorth noting that last season, the Red Devils won just seven of 19 when playing away and EVEN seemed to be the call in Man United matches. So far this season, it's been Even-Even.\n\nCan try: Man United on the 1x2\n\nWEST BROM v MIDDLESBROUGH\n\nThe last time these two teams clashed was in the Championship of the 2009/10 season.\n\nThat season, the Baggies won 5-0 (away) and 2-0 (home). Only once in their last 10 meetings has it been 0-0 at the interval. The last time Boro beat West Brom was in 2006.\n\nCan try: EVEN on Even-Odd option\n\nMAN CITY v WEST HAM\n\nOnly twice in their last 10 meetings have they marched off all square.\n\nLast season, Man City lost just five from 19 matches at home while the Hammers also lost five of 19 when playing away.

I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm saying it's very difficult.\n\n\"We have a decision completely made about (Paul) Pogba, (Ander) Herrera, (Morgan) Schneiderlin, (Marouane) Fellaini and Michael Carrick (Schweinsteiger's fellow central midfielders).\n\n\"We have five players for two positions. It's very difficult that an opportunity will arrive.\"\n\nAfter reports emerged of ex-Bayern man Schweinsteiger, a World Cup winner with Germany, being made to train with United's reserves by his new manager Mourinho, Rummenigge was quoted earlier this month as saying he could \"hardly believe\" such treatment, labelling it \"a lack of respect for a worthy player\".\n\nAnd Mourinho said yesterday: \"I thought after I read some quotes from people at Bayern Munich that they would run to Manchester to bring him (Schweinsteiger) back, but no, that did not happen.\n\n\"I am quite surprised that Mr Rummennigge is not here now to take him back.\"\n\nSchweinsteiger has two years left on his United contract and, in terms of the prospect of him staying on at United despite not playing, Mourinho said: \"I cannot answer for him. It's his life. It's his career.\n\n\"He has a contract with Man United and has the right to make that decision to stay.\n\n\"That's not a problem for us. Football is made of decisions. I did that all my career.\n\n\"Bastian is not speaking a lot. He gave this last statement, which he is completely free to do in an objective and polite way like he did. There are no problems at all.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hull's caretaker boss Mike Phelan is not expecting any new signings to boost his threadbare squad before tomorrow morning's (Singapore time) game against Man United despite \"a few fees\" being agreed.\n\n\"We've agreed a few fees but haven't got into discussions yet down the line as to what else it's going to cost us on top of that,\" he said.\n\n\"We need as many as we can get. We talked a few weeks ago about maybe six, now that may be more, it may be less. We just have to pursue our interests and see if we can do those deals.\"\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nepl\n\nManchester United\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e063cad2e2a0fd55f70b7eb997d95ce9631ea9f5a00942d8f56354cfe12d876b/NP_20160827_UNITED27_1368408.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jose Mourinho.", "caption": "Jose Mourinho."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

She was banned for 30 days in 2015 after an incident at one of the national team's training camps.\n\n\"Taking into consideration the past incidents involving Hope, as well as the private conversations we've had requiring her to conduct herself in a manner befitting a US National Team member, US Soccer determined this is the appropriate disciplinary action.\"\n\nSolo labelled Sweden \"cowards\" after the world champion Americans' bid for a fourth straight Olympic gold ended in quarter-final defeat.\n\n\"We played a bunch of cowards,\" Solo said.\n\n\"The better team did not win today. I strongly believe that. I don't think they're going to make it far in the tournament.\"\n\nSolo made the comments because she felt the Swedes, who finished runners-up to gold medallists Germany, were playing too defensively.\n\nThe defeat was the Americans' first in 15 games at the Olympics and only their third in Games history, having won four golds and a silver since women's football was introduced to the Olympic programme.\n\nUS Soccer said in the news release that Solo won't be eligible to try out for the national team again until next February. - AFP.\n\nFootball\n\nRio Olympics\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Money Market Funds in Singapore for Smarter Cash Management\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5198791845f97e5be8e7b33691b240f021d6adcf5205cbdb22a365a2e6f46340/NP_20160826_HOPE26_1367106.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It's been really good.\"\n\nMurray has played in all of the first three finals of the Majors in 2016, losing to world No. 1 Djokovic in Melbourne and Paris before putting Milos Raonic, one of the sport's widely-hyped new generation, in his place in a straight-set spanking in the Wimbledon final.\n\nThe only worry for Murray is his relatively mediocre record in New York in the years since his first win - runs to the quarter-finals in 2013 and 2014 were followed by a fourth-round exit to Kevin Anderson of South Africa 12 months ago. - AFP.\n\nTennis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 02:25am\n\nChinese tennis player Peng Shuai denies making accusation of sexual assault\n\nFeb 4, 2022, 08:01am\n\nBarca official resigns after calling Spanish tennis star Nadal an 'enemy of the state'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nRECOMMENDATION", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b2939108a54d3cc0e941dff11fe7a9a52a996839db59a4e9ce506506332d441e/federer.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Federer bids emotional farewell to tennis at Laver Cup", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b33f7573f28d39ddab2516b5cc97ac9b727167a778a61651942e1ca8f8be39e3/ac_serena1_010922.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Serena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

We showed quality, we showed the right spirit, we showed character. I am proud of what they have done and how they fought,\" said Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic.\n\nBoro manager Karanka was annoyed at seeing his side crash out to a side from a lower league.\n\nHe said: \"I'm disappointed because I said before the game this trophy is very important for the club.\n\n\"I have to apologise to our crowd because they came here midweek and it's an important trophy for this club, we respect this trophy a lot. So this has been difficult.\"\n\nKaranka made six changes for the tie, but does not believe his selection can be blamed for the result.\n\n\"They (Fulham) made 10 changes, so it's not a good explanation,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes you think the game is going to be easy because the other team play with 10 different players and you score the first goal. That was the biggest mistake.\n\n\"We thought we were better than the other team, we relaxed on the pitch. This kind of attitude reminds me of the past.\"\n\nMiddlesbrough's disappointment was made worse by injuries to two left backs - Fabio da Silva and George Friend - which leaves Karanka with a problem ahead of Sunday's trip to West Brom.\n\nIt could force the manager into the transfer market, but he insists he will not make any knee-jerk decisions.\n\nHe said: \"I don't know if I'll bring in one or two or three. But I won't say today because we lost the game we need five players. It's the same as I said two weeks ago.\" - Wire Services.\n\nOTHER RESULTS\n\nMorecambe 1 Bournemouth 2\n\nSunderland 1 Shrewsbury 0\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/474b6fbc2e079a80f6e542373b0bfce6bfdeeb2c1617d03460b2f7885ec3dbe3/NP_20160826_BURN26_1367003.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "OUT THEY GO: David Nugent's (top, in blue) goal for Middlesbrough is not enough to stop his side tumbling out of the League Cup, a fate also suffered by Burnley, after Accrington Stanley's Matthew Pearson scores the winner in extra time.", "caption": "OUT THEY GO: David Nugent's (top, in blue) goal for Middlesbrough is not enough to stop his side tumbling out of the League Cup, a fate also suffered by Burnley, after Accrington Stanley's Matthew Pearson scores the winner in extra time."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

If successful, 80 to 100 units will be rolled out in the near future at \"cool zones\" within four of Mandai Park Holdings' wildlife parks: the Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park.\n\nThe cool zones include areas such as ticketing counters and restaurants, said Mandai Park Holdings' group chief executive officer Mike Barclay.\n\nWhile a timeline for the roll-out and cost has not been determined, Mr Gareth Tang, the project's engineering lead and general manager for Innosparks, said that cost-effectiveness is key for cooling large outdoor spaces.\n\nAn Airbitat unit costs $2.50 a day to run, while an air-con unit with a similar capacity costs about $12.50, said Mr Tang.\n\nSingapore\n\nSingapore Zoo\n\nanimals\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e4097cd49a13108451f2614e3b7070d4394880dd539f3d6bab9afa7ecbfa6b26/NP_20160826_NWZOO26_1367103.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "REFRESHING: (Above) Steffi Teo, 8, and her brother Leroy, 6, enjoying the cool air from the Airbitat Smart Cooler.

article is more than 12 months old\n\nAug 25, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nM'sia to table marriage law amendments\n\nShare this article\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced yesterday that amendments to the marriage law would be tabled in the next Parliament session, possibly ending years of disputes over parenting rights between divorced Muslims and non-Muslim spouses.\n\nHe said the amendment would be founded on the principle of fairness for all so that couples can settle their marriage issues in civil court and move on with their lives.\n\nHe added that there was a need to address loopholes in the law or any overlapping ones in existing laws.\n\n\"The amendment of this Act will provide an opportunity for partners to resolve the issue of civil marriage in the civil courts, thus enabling them to continue their life like other couples to marry non-Muslims,\" Malaysian media reported Mr Najib as saying.\n\n\"At the same time, the clash between the Civil Court and Syariah Court arising from conversion to Islam by one of the spouses may be removed and the legislative gaps and duplication of the provisions within the existing law may be resolved.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul

parenting rights after well-known court cases of  unilateral conversion also highlighted issues of child support and custody.\n\nMr Najib said the amendments would \"maintain the principle of plurality\" besides upholding the rule of Islam.\n\nIn 2009, the Malaysian cabinet decided to bar unilateral conversion of children, but the proposed amendments were shelved from being tabled in Parliament after intervention by the Conference of Rulers.\n\nmalaysia\n\nNajib Razak\n\nIslam\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia

He was 92.\n\nIn the presence of his family, Mr Nathan was also given the highest honour accorded to a leader: The Singapore flag draped over the casket.\n\nVigil guards, comprising four uniformed officers, stood at the corners of the casket with their heads bowed, backs turned away and ceremonial sword inverted - a special mark of respect.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 27, 2025, 12:11am\n\nWho's that man acting as President Tharman at NDP rehearsals?

He had taken the bus and arrived at 7am to say \"goodbye to a humble leader\".\n\nAnother was Madam Rohani Dukiran, 48, who postponed her dialysis treatment to the afternoon \"so that I can pay respects to a man who was genuinely concerned for ordinary Singaporeans like my children and me\".\n\nMadam Rohani, who suffers from kidney failure, said she met Mr Nathan twice.\n\nThe first meeting was in 2004, when her children, who were in the West View Primary School brass band, won gold at the Singapore Youth Festival and were invited to play at the Istana.\n\nThe next and last meeting was in 2009, when Mr Nathan helped cook briyani at the Charity Briyani Project at the President's Challenge.\n\nA BOW AND A PRAYER\n\nIn the main hall yesterday, people from all walks of life shuffled through, stopping to bow  and say a prayer.

We had prepared for the match well and we knew what to do out there, but we didn't do the right things.\n\n\"Nor did they create chances but they scored early from a free-kick out wide.\n\n\"We didn't play well and we got two red cards. We gave everything even when we were down to nine men. Then we conceded a second and it was game over.\"\n\nBut for Porto's Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas, it was a memorable match.\n\nIt gave him a chance to play in the Champions League for a remarkable 18th consecutive season.\n\nFormer Manchester United star Ryan Giggs is the only player to have achieved the feat before his retirement in 2014.\n\nCasillas, 35, tweeted after the game: \"Victory in Rome and qualification for the Champions League, great team!!!\"\n\nHe added: \"I've been in the Champions League for many years now and it's important to be in Europe's biggest competition. We've got big ambitions.\"\n\nCasillas lifted the Champions League trophy three times during his 16 seasons at Real Madrid.\n\nThe Spain international made his debut in the competition in September 1999 against Olympiakos.  - Wire Services.\n\nsport\n\nFootball\n\nChampions League\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThese 5 S-REITs Are Outperforming in 2025 - Here’s Why\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ba3e044f74df0e8640c1ef178ee60bb327aca38e31f710a74e7d93e2404f75c3/NP_20160825_CHAMPS25_1366003.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "DOWN AND OUT: Roma captain Danielle de Rossi (above) is given the marching orders.", "caption": "DOWN AND OUT: Roma captain Danielle de Rossi (above) is given the marching orders."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

One of the sniffers suddenly stopped and went back to a spot.\n\nThat was where the digging would start, but former firefighter Daniela Romanato, who was helping out with the rescue operation, did not hold out much hope.\n\n\"The dogs are trained to search and indicate trapped people.\n\n\"One has indicated there is someone underneath the rubble here, but no barking means the person is most likely dead,\" she said.\n\n\"We're sending a smaller dog in to see if it can get closer to the person, but it's very unlikely we're talking about survivors under here.\"\n\nSEARCH\n\nMr Bordo's brother Domenico looked on as the search progressed.\n\nHe said: \"We live quite far away, but felt the quake. We rushed to get news from the television and as soon as we saw it was here, we called my sister, but she didn't answer.\n\n\"I feared the worst and was right. I don't see how she could have survived under there.\"\n\nIn Accumoli, photographer Emiliano Grillotti said he saw over 15 people digging with their bare hands to save a family of four, according to La Repubblica.\n\nThis latest disaster was Italy's most powerful earthquake since 2009, when some 300 people died in and around the city of L'Aquila, just to the south of the area hit yesterday.\n\nMs Lina Mercantini of Ceselli, Umbria, told Reuters: \"It was so strong. It seemed the bed was walking across the room by itself with us on it.\"\n\nThe shocks were strong enough to wake residents of central Rome, some 150km away.\n\nThe worst damage was suffered by Pescara del Tronto, a hamlet near Arquata in the Marche region which \"just completely disintegrated\", according to mayor Aleandro Petrucci.\n\nMr Tommaso della Longa, a Red Cross spokesman, said the town of Amatrice, which was at the epicentre of the quake, has been \"almost completely destroyed\".\n\nEARTHQUAKES\n\nItaly\n\ndisaster\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 10, 2025, 06:39am\n\nSingapore Red Cross commits another $550,000 worth of supplies for Myanmar quake aid\n\nApr 5, 2025, 12:41am\n\nSingapore sends second wave of aid to quake-hit Myanmar\n\nApr 2, 2025, 01:30am\n\n'We won't give up': S'pore's Operation Lionheart presses on in Myanmar\n\nApr 1, 2025, 07:41am\n\nEarthquake tremors don't deter S'porean influencer from completing facelift in bangkok\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b952f92606be34b34d833eb030a0ef65cc8d89a7bbf2728ab7a11cafc32e6129/NP_20160825_QUAKE25_1366093.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CATASTROPHE: Buildings were reduced to dusty piles of masonry in communities close to the epicentre of the quake.

Especially for the fans who don't deserve to see us losing like that.\n\n\"They were very warm and they didn't deserve that performance.\n\n\"Until we scored, we were in control. We created about seven or eight chances and, as soon as we got ahead, we completely changed the way we played.\n\n\"I need to change this mentality of the players when we go ahead. I'm very angry because we can't see the danger of teams when we go ahead.\n\n\"The moment we go ahead, we should continue to play well, but we couldn't see the danger and got complacent.\n\n\"Instead of becoming stronger and working harder, we changed our attitude completely. I don't think I made too many changes, we were creating chances regardless.\n\n\"It was the same team in the second half, so I don't think it's a fair assessment to say I made too many changes. The fans are right to be upset, they deserved better.\n\n\"The players are fit enough. Even though all players get tired in extra time, perhaps they were mentally tired a bit.\"\n\nGillingham boss Justin Edinburgh, though, hailed the result as the best of his 10-year managerial career.\n\nHe said: \"In the end, we deserved it. We had to ride our luck a little bit in the first half.\n\n\"When we missed the penalty, I thought we missed our chance but we showed great courage and spirit to keep going.\n\nCHARACTER\n\n\"For Dack to come back from the penalty miss shows the character of the man.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can keep hold of him. We're not in a position to sell but, if he does want to leave, we'll get the right fee that his talents demand.\n\n\"It's a proud moment for the club to come to a Premier League team with international stars and win. The level of fitness from my players was quite extraordinary.\n\n\"It's a credit to the players that they continued to press late on when Watford looked a bit jaded. It's without a doubt the biggest win of my managerial career and it's great for the club.\n\n\"We know that we had to fight harder and run harder than we usually do.

They've had a couple of opportunities and the two goals are poor goals from our point of view.\n\n\"If we had come here and didn't open them up and didn't play well, then you can slaughter us, but we did that.\n\n\"We've not hit the back of the net and that's what you have to do.

They were banned from football for eight years in December.\n\nA Fifa appeals committee cut those penalties to six years in February, just before Blatter's successor, Gianni Infantino, was elected as Fifa's new president.\n\nBlatter's hopes for redemption at CAS are likely hampered by Platini's failed appeal at the Lausanne-based court.\n\nIn a May ruling, CAS judges said they were \"not convinced\" that the $2m payment was legitimate.\n\nThey did, however, reduce the suspension against the former European football chief to four years. Throughout the protracted saga, both Blatter and Platini have insisted the payment was part of a legitimate oral contract.\n\nArguments at CAS are expected to last one day, although a decision may take several weeks. - AFP.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

They set aside 'safety budgets' to cover the enforcement fines.\"\n\nAnother factor, he said, was workers' health.\n\nIn the last three years, a third of work fatalities involved workers with existing medical conditions such as heart disease and hypertension that were aggravated by work, resulting in accidents.\n\nHe also stressed the growing need to redesign jobs for elderly workers, observing that 18 per cent of the accidents in the first half of this year involved workers aged 55 and older.\n\nHe called for a more \"progressive and pervasive culture\" to be inculcated in WSH here.\n\nWorkplace Accident\n\nSingapore\n\nLim Swee Say\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 29, 2022, 08:39am\n\nRifle Range workplace death: Victim was to be married in Sept\n\nNov 29, 2022, 10:36am\n\nTwo more workplace deaths, with one falling into the sea and another falling from height\n\nOct 17, 2021, 10:50pm\n\nCleaner dies in Punggol HDB trash compactor\n\nOct 8, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nMan falls through rubbish chute in Bukit Merah\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f94f5e5209f3e80d8a01dc49753ff5f4b20321b3c715ab55ad74c0b17dc7e6cf/FOR-FB.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Container falls on forklift at Pasir Panjang Terminal, man taken to hospital", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/473338adbeae0501db22142420eea0c05d3e87632ee53e3f4df916ab6f66b58c/20221229433435211545e7ad-7b1c-4df0-b47d-68e39286e7ed_0.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Rifle Range workplace death: Victim was to be married in Sept", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

And it came early.\n\nNguyen opened Red Lantern in Sydney in 2001 when he was just 23 years old. The Vietnamese restaurant, with branches in Sydney and Brisbane, has won many awards.\n\nHe has plans to take Red Lantern to Hong Kong and Vietnam.\n\nLOVE FOR FOOD\n\nAll this wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for his love for street food.\n\n\"Street food has always been fascinating to me as it's the real food of the country that you're travelling in.\n\n\"Sitting or standing there on the street and eating, you really get a sense of where you are, and you get to converse and meet the locals and get a sense of the real history behind the country,\" said Nguyen.\n\nHe spoke of how he would take back these food memories and then tweak the recipes a little for his restaurant menu.\n\n\"The street food vendors have been cooking for generations and generations, so they've really got the flavours right.\n\n\"I'd take street food dishes from all over Asia and use Wagyu beef, Kurobuta pork or organic vegetables, and bring (the dish) up to more of a restaurant experience.\"\n\nNguyen's family, refugees from Vietnam, settled in Sydney's Cabramatta suburb, where \"a lot of the Vietnamese community or the Vietnamese boat people lived\".\n\n\"Living (there), you could be living in Saigon, so I grew up (amid) a very strong Vietnamese culture. So when I travel (around) Asia or back to Vietnam, I really feel like I'm at home.\"\n\nNguyen hopes to be able to come to Singapore for his next series, as \"Singapore's food culture is very vibrant and diverse\".\n\n\"I can go to Singapore and feel like I'm in three or four different countries at once... it's such a melting pot of Asian cultures.\"\n\nBy\n\nJoanne Soh\n\nRead articles by Joanne Soh\n\nmakan\n\nVietnam\n\nhawker\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 7, 2025, 09:00am\n\nWill Uncle Roger eventually show Singaporeans what 'proper' fried rice is?\n\nSep 11, 2024, 07:22am\n\nUncle Roger slammed for 'poor' joke at his new restaurant\n\nAug 27, 2024, 06:01am\n\nFrom dishwasher to chef, Prince prepares meals fit for a king\n\nJul 5, 2024, 03:37am\n\nMakan ideas for that get-together of foodies\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/73c32b7e19ab4c0d25d83738591a209f59100c19f347c68446ae7bd2df137204/np_20160824_jsluke24-f1m_1363444.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "FOODIE: Vietnamese-Australian chef and restaurateur Luke Nguyen on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City for the TV series Luke Nguyen’s Street Food Asia.

Yet a last-minute scramble meant that venues and a new metro line to the Olympic Park were ready in time.\n\nSecurity fears, which prompted the deployment of 85,000 police and security staff for the Games, were also proven wrong - there were no major attacks of the kind seen recently in Europe.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 25, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSolo handed six-month ban\n\nMore related stories\n\nYet, in terms of the long-term benefits to residents and the image of Rio to the outside world, the Games could have been so much more.\n\n\"If we're content to call the absence of catastrophe an Olympic success, then I suppose it was a success but, if that is the case, we are setting the bar too low,\" said Jules Boykoff, a professor at Pacific University in Oregon and author of a book on the political history of the Games.\n\n\"From the point of view of the lives of ordinary people in Rio, it was not a successful Games. It was a massively missed opportunity.\"\n\nIn 2009, when a triumphant Brazil won the right to host the Games by a landslide at an IOC meeting in Copenhagen, a tearful President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said it would seal Brazil's entry into the club of \"first-class\" nations.\n\n\"The world has recognised that the time has come for Brazil!\" Lula said, predicting the Games would showcase the nation's improved governance and booming economic growth.\n\nSeven years later, the Games arrived at just the wrong moment for Brazil. Its economy has been ravaged by a commodities collapse, while a corruption scandal has ensnared the construction firms building infrastructure for the Games and swept Lula's leftist Workers Party from power.\n\nThe run-up to the Games, an unrivalled moment to showcase Brazil's most picturesque city, was dominated instead by headlines over the impeachment of Lula's successor, Dilma Rousseff, the spread of Zika, and resurgent crime levels in the city's slums due to rising unemployment and under-funded police.\n\nISSUES\n\nThe enduring images of the Games will be not just the great sporting achievements - from US swimmer Michael Phelps' 28th Olympic medal to Usain Bolt's historic sprint \"triple-triple\" - but also the organisational problems, empty seats and crime.\n\n\"The country put its image at risk in bidding for the Games and the risk did not work out because it became brutally obvious Brazil has not resolved its problems,\" said Christopher Gaffney, an Olympic expert and geographer at the University of Zurich, who lived in Rio until last year.\n\nRio's mayor Eduardo Paes accepts that, while progress was made, the Games fell far short of their target in tackling environmental issues like water pollution.\n\nRoughly half the city's sewage still flows untreated into Guanabara bay.\n\nA Reuters study showed that pledges on reducing air pollution were also missed.\n\nCampaigners railed against the relocation of tens of thousands of people to build infrastructure for the Games.\n\nThe decision to focus new transportation routes on the wealthier Western districts, where the Olympic Park was built, meant they would do little to curb the long daily commutes of the poor from Rio's sprawling northern slums.\n\nThe sight of the Maracana Stadium brightly illuminated for the closing ceremony, while a power cut plunged neighbouring streets into darkness epitomised the lopsided benefits of the games.\n\nHIGHER TARIFF\n\nLocal media has reported that electricity tariffs will need to be raised to cover the cost of lighting the Games.\n\nOne major uncertainty is the size of the final bill for the Games, in the midst of the country's deepest economic recession since the 1930s.\n\nThe government has already said it will need to put in more public money to balance the books, yet it is resisting calls to make the Games' accounts public.\n\nMany observers expect the official US$12 billion ($16b) price tag to be exceeded.\n\nFor many in Brazil, the Games will be remembered as a success for one moment - when footballer Neymar clinched the gold medal with the final penalty of the match against Germany.\n\nYet residents like Luciana Cabral, a 25-year-old advertising student, said the Games appeared to have done little to improve the everyday life of ordinary people in Rio.\n\n\"On top of that, we still don't know what the real cost of the infrastructure will be, so we have to wait and see,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't want to say the whole thing was a failure, but there were a lot of things that weren't done well.\" -

It was the 21st straight month of declining inflation.\n\nThis has been the longest stretch of negative inflation seen here since 1977.\n\nOverall consumer prices fell 0.7 per cent last month from July last year, data released yesterday by the Statistics Department showed.\n\nThe decline was slightly higher than economists' forecasts of a 0.5 per cent decrease and the same as the decline in June, The Straits Times reported.\n\nPrivate road transport costs, which includes cars, slid 4.4 per cent year-on-year. The cost of fuel and utilities also fell 8.9 per cent compared with the same month a year ago.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 07:51am\n\n$10 million Toto results to be announced on July 17\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut prices elsewhere in the economy continued to edge upwards.\n\nFood prices rose 2.1 per cent in July compared with the same month a year ago, while the cost of household durables and services increased 3.2 per cent.\n\nCore inflation, which strips out accommodation and private road transport costs to better gauge everyday expenses, was up 1 per cent.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore expects core inflation to pick up gradually over the course of the year, partly because oil prices are expected to be slightly higher in this half of the year compared with the first half.\n\nThe disinflationary effects of Budget measures and other one-off programmes will also ease as time goes by. These measures include medical subsidies under the Pioneer Generation Package, the reduction in the concessionary foreign domestic worker levy, and the abolition of national examination fees for Singaporeans implemented last year.\n\nSingapore\n\nEconomy\n\nBusiness\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3dffca45ca3e48aaf4294aa8e7321533eba807763558babf8bbf0e5a61cfea83/2021101813429777892e2423-c629-486b-a96b-22bba40bd71e.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "$10 million Toto results to be announced on July 17", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/20a80f56aaa212cb613c5994295493e8e42f5a22f114bf3961c2d3d0b98ed1f7/egg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Passers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Another proposed change is allowing public schools to reproduce and share content on student portals for teaching purposes.

One evening, it had about 30 players, mostly in their teens and 20s.\n\n\"It just shows how little data there is about Iran on the Internet,\" said Shayan, 15, complaining about the lack of features in Tehran.\n\nSome people have travelled from the town of Karaj, 30km west of Tehran, to play here, added Shayan.\n\nMeanwhile, Islamic leaders in Malaysia said Muslims should avoid playing the game as it was harmful and could \"lead to gambling\".\n\nThe game went live yesterday.\n\nSenior religious official Zulkifli Mohamad al-Bakri said the city's Islamic Legal Consultative Committee had taken into consideration top scholars' opinions on the cartoon creatures.\n\n\"Pokemon Go and all the Pokemon characters should be avoided as it can bring harm,\" he was quoted as saying by the national news agency Bernama.\n\n\"The game promoted a search for power and deities with certain powers, which could lead to gambling.\"\n\nIRAN\n\npokemon\n\npolice\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nFeb 10, 2025, 11:59pm\n\nS'pore to deport Iranian woman, Malaysian husband deemed to be threat to national security\n\nAug 2, 2024, 09:34am\n\nSIA, Scoot flights avoid Iranian airspace again\n\nFeb 13, 2024, 08:17am\n\nCentenarian to compete in World Aquatics Masters C'ships\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bd7cf2404970574cd84d7df3f699fe0cc9277b8fc2e501c0b1b5238911db8bec/np_20160808_go08_1349015.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "TRAINERS: Iranians playing Pokemon Go in Tehran’s Mellat Park last week.

Animals that are used to human contact would also be easier to manage under the programme.\n\nThe marine mammals will be sent to a 15,000ha bay, which will protect the manatees from marine traffic by way of a no-entry zone.\n\nThe future offspring from the initial 15 manatees will be reintroduced to the wild to repopulate the region.\n\nAccording to National Geographic, there are three species of manatees, all of which are threatened by extinction.\n\nBecause they are large and slow-moving marine mammals, they are often easy targets for hunters who kill them for their oil and hides.\n\nThey are also vulnerable to being hit by boats and getting caught in carelessly discarded fishing nets.\n\nSingapore\n\nanimals\n\nEnvironment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7a969b9f4f954283379b896316cebbb66907efaeac09b50199ac981b4d917e74/np_20160808_nwmanatee08_1349147.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "FAREWELL: Mrs Laurence Beau, deputy head of mission at the Embassy of France, and Mandai Park Holdings group CEO Mike Barclay, feeding a manatee yesterday.

one of three professional boxers competing in the Olympics for the first time in its long history - wagged his finger in the air and shook his head in disbelief and was later seen remonstrating with boxing officials.\n\nAs part of moves to boost its popularity, especially in the United States, Olympic boxing has allowed in the pros, dropped headguards for men and ditched the punch-counting method to decide fights.\n\nBut, if the AIBA, the governing body, hoped it would result in fewer controversies, it may have to think again.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\nLoh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities\n\nMore related stories\n\nNjikam, 32, said that he felt he won at least two of the rounds and some observers agreed.\n\n\"I told them that I came from far away for this competition and I am professional,\" he said, when asked what he had been saying animatedly to boxing officials just outside the venue, as his family looked on.\n\n\"I took too much time to enter the fight in the first round, because I wanted to know what he was going to do.\n\n\"But the second and third rounds, I put on the pressure and I hit him with more punches than he hit me with, so I'm very unhappy with the decision -

Where does Folha get this dumb idea from? They messed up badly,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe Olympic organising committee told AFP in a statement only that \"there is no robbery\", declining to explain further.\n\nBut in a new twist on Monday, a Globo newspaper columnist Lauro Jardim reported that the controversial scene was being axed.\n\nHe said directors had meant to have the scene show a street vendor running up to Ms Bundchen to sell her a bikini.\n\n\"On paper, it was perfect. At the rehearsal yesterday, however, it didn't work,\" the columnist wrote.\n\n\"It gave the impression to those watching that it was about an assault.

This makes Australia seem more religious than it really is,\" said the foundation's president, Ms Kylie Sturgess, who's encouraging people \"to be counted as what they are\".\n\nShe told AFP: \"Our attitude is, well here's an opportunity to have a say on the census; pop down what you are. Maybe 'no religion' suits you, maybe you are someone who has drifted away from the church.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 25, 2025, 09:01am\n\nS'porean charged in Australia with importing 40kg of meth, cocaine into Sydney\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"But unfortunately 'Jedi' is just not an option on the census.\"\n\nThe joke arose years ago when an e-mail campaign wrongly claimed that if 8,000 people put themselves down as Jedi, it would have to be officially recognised as a religion.\n\nAt the 2001 Australian census, more than 70,500 people listed their faith as \"Jedi knight\" or something similar, which would indicate the country had nearly as many believers in the Force as it had members of the Salvation Army.\n\nOTHER COUNTRIES\n\n\"Whether or not people took the claim seriously, it was the start of a reporting phenomenon that gained speed internationally,\" the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said in 2013, adding that New Zealand, Canada, England and Wales subsequently reported large Jedi contingents.\n\nMs Sturgess admitted she has put down Jedi as a \"bit of a laugh\" in the past.\n\n\"But the fact is that the ABS just doesn't count it, they consider it 'not defined',\" she said, adding \"the joke is kinda getting a bit old\".\n\nAustralian statisticians could instead follow Britain's example. In the 2001 England and Wales census, 390,000 people, or 0.7 per cent of the population, entered their religion as \"Jedi\" but they were included among the atheists.\n\nOr they could embrace non-traditional movements as New Zealand did last year when it recognised pastafarians - who wear colanders on their heads, revere pirates and believe the world was created by a giant deity made of spaghetti.\n\nAustralia\n\nreligion\n\nStar Wars\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 22, 2025, 06:11am\n\nAustralian-American woman to become first Singapore-born to travel into space\n\nFeb 22, 2025, 12:14am\n\nAustralian caught with banned items tries to flee S'pore with someone else's passport\n\nDec 11, 2024, 04:04am\n\nS'pore man, 27, remains in custody in Australia for alleged murder\n\nNov 14, 2024, 10:48pm\n\nNew camp for SAF soldiers on Exercise Wallaby in Australia now operational\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c8359826b90f0c4bfb11a11925a936e3fcfa3f9a93556b4be5034bb9f35ee5c1/aidrug250225.jpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "S'porean charged in Australia with importing 40kg of meth, cocaine into Sydney", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f9df3d708781828e2d106633be0d9ea724bb67cdbb93992bea172926e3ecfd1a/Screenshot%202025-02-22%20at%202.09.15%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=318", "alt_text": "Australian-American woman to become first Singapore-born to travel into space", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I mean, look at our faces. Many people say we have the same one.\n\n\"If I have to pick one swimming idol, it will have to be my older sister, who was the first in our family to qualify for the Olympics in 2008 when she was 16.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\nLoh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"She has always been my biggest inspiration. She showed me that anything is possible. As long as you dare to dream it, you can reach it if you try.\"\n\nThe early mornings of waking up at 4.45am and ploughing through seven hours of swimming and gymwork (across three sessions) a day, five times a week, covering up to 60km in the pool is not something that every person empathises with.\n\nBut the Quahs are thankful they have each other.\n\nZheng Wen added: \"Having a familiar face away from home helps and the support my older sister provides me so far away from home is really important to me.\n\n\"That kind of understanding comes only from someone who's also involved in the sport. It's really important that we support each other and push each other to the next level.\n\n\"I have to attribute a lot of my success to family support and the advice my sisters have given me. It's been really invaluable.\"\n\nThis would be Ting Wen's second Olympics after her debut at Beijing 2008. Having missed out on London 2012 through injury, the 23-year-old will be swimming the 100m butterfly in this edition.\n\nGOAL\n\nShe said: \"It was a goal of ours to be able to represent Singapore at an Olympics together and we missed that in 2012, so it's great to be able to do that this year.\n\n\"It's one thing to be able to represent Singapore on the highest level; it's another to do that with someone who has been with you throughout the journey, whom you can trust and share everything with.\n\n\"We are a very small team, but there's no one I'd rather be here and be competing with than Zheng.\"\n\nWhile the duo's pedigree has been proven - they have won a total of 20 gold medals at the SEA Games and seven at the Asian Youth Games - it is Zheng Wen who is proving he can blossom into a world-beater with three silvers and five bronzes across four stops of last year's Fina World Cup series.\n\nIt has been a remarkable rise for a swimmer who had doubts after \"always losing to my compatriots\" before he won his first SEA Games gold medal in the 400m individual medley as a 15-year-old at Indonesia 2011, which convinced him that he has a future in the sport.\n\nAnd, even then, it took plenty of sacrifices and hard work for him to emerge from the bottom of the pool - at London 2012, he was placed 33rd out of 37 swimmers in the 400m IM and was last out of 35 swimmers for the 200m backstroke - and talk about fighting for a final.\n\nZheng Wen said: \"I may not have beaten Chad le Clos or Viktor Bromer but, having raced against them and running them close at the World Cup, I find that I'm not being scared of the occasion and it's awesome.\n\n\"The aim for Rio is to make the semi-finals or a final.

We may disagree how we get there, but we all work towards the same goal of protecting clean athletes.\n\n\"Despite these discrepancies, we agree we must not allow such a situation to happen again.\"\n\nBach also said the doping system needed a complete restructure.\n\n\"Engagement and not isolation is the key to build a more robust anti-doping system,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian swimmers Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev have been cleared to compete at the Rio Olympics, their representatives said yesterday, though there was no official confirmation.\n\nNO CONFIRMATION\n\nWorld swimming's governing body Fina, the Russian swimming federation and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) have not confirmed that Lobintsev and Morozov will in fact be competing in Rio.\n\nA ruling by CAS was expected this morning (Singapore time).\n\nBut speaking to Interfax news agency, Lobintsev's agent, Andrei Mitkov said: \"I can confirm that Lobintsev and Morozov are being allowed to compete in the Games.\n\n\"We will meet with IOC representatives to discuss the outcome for this situation.\"\n\nLawyer Artyom Patsev, who represents the swimmers, told TASS news agency that they had received the green light from Fina to compete in Rio.\n\nMorozov, 24, and Lobintsev, 27, have called on the CAS to declare \"invalid and unenforceable\" an IOC order for federations to exclude athletes implicated in the investigation into Russia's state-run doping system.\n\nThey were among seven Russians banned by Fina last month.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nRio Olympics\n\nRussia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSchooling offered free flights on AirAsia\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nFree flights for Schooling, other Asean Olympic winners\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nCampbell reveals hernia injury\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRio 2016: Boos or boost for Brazil?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - Unlock Growth with Smarter Cash Strategies\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/57b88c70cf9cc93309e92a0a78df6e26efdddd226828f6522d9546ec147c7ae8/NP_20160803_IOC03_1344105.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS!

We just paid HK$6 ($1.04) per hour to play at a bay,\" she said.\n\nLater, Chan was talent-spotted by officials of Hong Kong's junior golfer development programme, who sent her to compete in youth events overseas.\n\nWith limited access to the financial hub's expensive golf clubs, she earned a scholarship to attend university in the United States, where she trains.\n\n\"When I was younger, there was not much opportunity for me to practise in real ranges. This is my weakness, so I need to work harder,\" she said.\n\nChan will face the world's best in Rio, including Lydia Ko from New Zealand and South Korea's Park InBee.\n\nShe hopes to finish in the top 40, but said her main aim was just to \"learn\" from the professionals around her.\n\n\"There are 57 professionals. To enter the Olympics as an amateur is already a difficult thing.

I'm fine and feeling really good, great, and really looking forward to racing,\" she said.\n\nEven so, Kromowidjojo said, she doesn't consider herself the favourite to defend her titles, with Cate Campbell topping the times this year in both events - and with a world record of 52.06 seconds to boot in the 100m free.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 3, 2025, 12:38am\n\n100 days to go: S'pore's swimmers gear up for World Aquatics Championships\n\nMore related stories\n\nKromowidjojo is right behind the elder Campbell sister in the 50m world rankings, but it's Bronte Campbell who owns the second-fastest 100m time of 2016, with Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom third-quickest this season.\n\n\"I don't consider myself the favourite,\" Kromowidjojo said.\n\n\"Cate Campbell, her little sister and Sarah Sjostrom are really strong swimmers, but I'm sure I'm going to fight for the gold medals.\"\n\nKromowidjojo reflected on the fame her London triumphs had brought, which, she said, \"completely changed my life\".\n\n\"Of course I'd already achieved some success before then but, after London, the madness began,\" she said.\n\n\"People in Holland and the media went really crazy.

article is more than 12 months old\n\nAug 2, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nNo live broadcast on Youtube for S'pore\n\nShare this article\n\nAn online report circulated widely on social media over the last two days on Sports24hour.com said that Singapore is one of 64 countries which can catch the Olympics live on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) YouTube channel.\n\nBut Olympics broadcast rights holder Dentsu have dashed the hopes of Singaporeans hoping to watch the sporting action as it happens, saying that the report is inaccurate.\n\nA Dentsu spokesman told The Straits Times yesterday: \"There will be no live streaming on YouTube.\n\n\"Therefore we are encouraging Mediacorp to take up the option to add live television coverage.\"\n\nHe added that any website which streams content illegally would be directed by the IOC and Dentsu to shut down the stream.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\nLoh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities\n\nMore related stories\n\nLast month, The New Paper reported that Singapore will not be able to watch the Olympics live.\n\nIt was reported that local broadcasters made a bid of around US$2 million ($2.67m) to the IOC for the TV rights for Rio 2016, only to be told to go through Dentsu, who last year won Olympic broadcast rights for 22 Asian countries from 2018 to 2024.\n\nIt is understood that the broadcasters baulked at the estimated US$6m price tag Dentsu offered for free-to-air \"live\" TV rights, fearing that it will set a precedent for even bigger price jumps for future Summer Olympics.\n\nInstead, free-to-air broadcaster Mediacorp has secured a deal worth about US$2m for delayed telecasts, daily highlights and feed from the Olympic news channel for between 10 and 12 hours daily.\n\nMediacorp is the only broadcaster in Singapore to offer any form of television coverage of the Games.\n\n- SAZALI ABDUL AZI\n\nZ\n\nOlympics\n\nmedia\n\nSingapore\n\nShare this

It was his fourth defeat in a major final with Argentina.\n\n\"I'm optimistic about Messi,\" Bauza was quoted as saying in the Argentine daily La Nacion.\n\n\"I hope the chat with him will help for him to carry on in the national team.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I want to explain to Messi what my (tactical) idea is. The least of my worries is his position on the pitch. There's no need to convince Messi of anything, the plan is to talk about football.\"\n\nBauza, 58, takes on the job after a strong season at Brazilian club Sao Paulo, which he coached to the semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores.\n\n\"We hope he will have the success we all need,\" said Armando Perez, the president of a committee named by Fifa to whip things into shape at the crisis-plagued Argentine Football Association (AFA).\n\nThe new coach faces the stigma of being the default choice. A string of potential coaches including Diego Simeone of Atletico Madrid, Jorge Sampaoli of Sevilla and Mauricio Pochettino of Tottenham Hotspur reportedly declined the job.\n\n\"We were in talks with a lot of people... Mr Bauza is the best,\" said Perez.\n\nBauza, who will sign his contract in Buenos Aires on Friday, has only a couple of weeks to decide on his squad for qualifiers at home to Uruguay and away to Venezuela in the first week of next month.\n\n\"There isn't much time. My first squad won't have many changes, but I want to talk with five or six of the leading players,\" Bauza said, no doubt referring to the likes of Javier Mascherano, Angel di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain.\n\nHe also opened the door for Carlos Tevez, overlooked by Martino since a World Cup qualifier against Paraguay in Asuncion last October where he won his 76th cap.\n\n\"I'm thinking of Tevez as I am about other players... Tevez is a player good enough for the national team,\" Bauza said.\n\nNOT DEFENSIVE-MINDED\n\nBauza has won two Copa Libertadores - one in 2014 with Pope Francis' favourite team, San Lorenzo, the other in 2008 with Ecuadoran side LDU Quito.\n\nA former central defender, he rejected a tag as a defensive coach, saying: \"I'm one of those who think that all (the team) have to defend. Football today is like that.\n\n\"You can defend in your opponents' half if the pressure is high (up the field), but it's easier when you have players of the quality of the Argentina team. The options they offer you are many.\"\n\nArgentina are third in the 10-nation South American World Cup qualifying group with 11 points from six matches, two points behind leading pair Uruguay and Ecuador.\n\nThe top four teams after 18 matches go through to the Russia Finals, while the fifth-placed team goes into an intercontinental play-off for one more berth. - AFP.\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f187a2b09182854dd1a9dec0819789dad8d6c0c4c7e21d4f10d5a0bb18f571d7/NP_20160803_ARG03_1343893.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "WINNER: Argentina's new coach Edgardo Bauza has won the Copa Libertadores with San Lorenzo in 2014 and with Ecuadoran side LDU Quito in 2008.", "caption": "WINNER: Argentina's new coach Edgardo Bauza has won the Copa Libertadores with San Lorenzo in 2014 and with Ecuadoran side LDU Quito in 2008."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It's more than half the team. It was a gamble and it didn't pay off,\" Rooney told the Daily Mail yesterday.\n\n\"We had lost momentum from the Slovakia game and tournament football is about confidence. You get that from winning.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We didn't play great in the friendlies, but we won. So you try to build, even from before the tournament, but we couldn't get that consistency once it began.\n\n\"It was Roy's decision to make changes against Slovakia and either way, the team he put out should have been able to win.\n\n\"But, right or wrong, I wanted to play and I can't deny that.\"\n\nRooney came on as a substitute against Slovakia, but the 30-year-old insisted that Hodgson, who stepped down immediately after the Iceland debacle, should have retained the team that defeated Wales in the previous fixture.\n\n\"When I came on against Slovakia, it was difficult to change the game, impossible really. I was running around just trying to get the energy back into the team,\" he said.\n\n\"Watching, I felt we lacked aggression - in the running, in the passing, we didn't have the tempo, so that's what I was trying to create.\"\n\nKANE'S CORNER DUTY\n\nRooney also revealed that it was his decision to stop Harry Kane from taking corners at Euro 2016.\n\nKane took all six corners in the opening game of England's ill-fated campaign against Russia in Marseille.\n\nHodgson was heavily criticised for employing last season's 25-goal top English Premier League scorer in this way and Rooney has now said he intervened in the matter.\n\nAsked in an interview with the Daily Mail if it was his decision to relieve Kane of corner duty, Rooney simply replied: \"Yes.\"\n\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer was among those to criticise Hodgson at the time, saying Kane was \"well within his rights\" to tell the manager that he should be in the penalty area on the end of corners rather than taking them.\n\nShearer said Rooney and Adam Lallana were better suited to the role, and now Kane's club manager Mauricio Pochettino has expressed his surprise at Hodgson's call in France.\n\n\"I don't want to criticise,\" Tottenham boss Pochettino told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"But Harry is a top scorer, so why is he taking free-kicks or corners if his skill is to score? You need him to stay in the box, not outside.\"\n\nRooney, meanwhile, said that he will continue playing for England for at least two more years - whether he is captain or not.\n\nNew England boss Sam Allardyce has remained tight-lipped over the Manchester United player's future as the Three Lions skipper since his appointment.\n\nAllardyce has said he will reveal his decision when the squad meet up for their World Cup qualifier against Slovakia next month.\n\nHowever, Rooney has no intention of considering his international future for another two years, even if Allardyce hands the armband to someone else.\n\nHe said: \"I'll carry on until the World Cup in 2018 and then I might have a decision to make.\n\n\"But, for the next two years, captain or not captain, I'll turn up and be available to play if I am wanted.\"\n\nRooney added: \"I've spoken to him (Allardyce). Not at length about how we're going to play or my role, but he seems very excited about the job and he'll have his own way of doing it.\n\n\"I don't think it would be fair to expect him to make a decision on the captaincy now.\n\n\"So I'll wait and see what he thinks. He'll want to see the group, work with us all and then make his decision.\"\n\n- PA Sport.\n\nFootball\n\nEuro 2016\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cd088de8172347c7f65e3d0cb3c040ed9513eb762cd46cf3933b12cb7643f399/NP_20160802_ROON02_1343029.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "STEPPING IN: England captain Wayne Rooney (No. 10) has revealed that it was his decision to stop Harry Kane from taking corners at Euro 2016, not Roy Hodgson.", "caption": "STEPPING IN: England captain Wayne Rooney (No. 10) has revealed that it was his decision to stop Harry Kane from taking corners at Euro 2016, not Roy Hodgson."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Being nicer to herself and learning how to smile on the greens.\n\nThat is how the 20-year-old became the first golfer from her country to lift a Major title after winning the Women's British Open at Woburn Golf Club yesterday morning (Singapore time).\n\nShe finished three strokes clear of South Korea's Lee Mirim and American Mo Martin with a 16-under total of 272.\n\nAt the same tournament last year, Ariya failed to qualify for the final two rounds for the 10th consecutive tournament.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt wasn't supposed to pan out this way for a player destined for stardom.\n\nAt 11, Ariya became the youngest player to qualify for an LPGA event.\n\nWhen she turned pro in 2012, she was ranked No. 2 in the world amateur rankings, behind only current world No. 1 Lydia Ko.\n\nBut, a year later, Ariya suffered a shoulder injury while chasing her sister Moriya, a fellow LPGA Tour player, and trying to spray water on her before an event.\n\nAfter her win yesterday, the player nicknamed \"May\", said: \"Everything in the past was good for me because I learned from it, especially when I missed 10 cuts in a row.\n\nPATIENT\n\n\"I know how to come back, I know how to be patient.\n\n\"Everybody is going to have bad times in their life and I think I have had that already.\"\n\nThe bad times were so brutal that the world No. 2 was scared to hit the ball. Then Ariya had an attitude adjustment and learned how to be nice to herself.\n\nAt the KPMG Women's PGA Championship in June, she said: \"Right now, I am really happy; no matter what the result (of a shot), I'm just very happy with it.\n\n\"The only thing I have to do, is I have to be nice to myself, and not complain about every single shot.\"\n\nThe Thai had every right to complain when she finished fourth in the year's first Major - the ANA Inspiration - after leading by two shots with three holes to play.\n\nInstead, she turned to her swing coach Gary Gilchrist and golf coaches Lynn Marriott and Pia Nilsson.\n\nThey concluded that under pressure, the world No. 2 sped up her routine, leading to more tension and tightness in her body.\n\nHer coaching team tried several \"triggers\" to control her game before arriving at the solution - smiling.\n\n\"May is so cute, her big smile is obvious,\" Nilsson said.\n\n\"Really, though, it's not about the smile. It's about how she feels inside that's important. When we tried the smile, she said, 'That's me'.\"\n\nSaid Ariya: \"I'm pretty sure I learned a lot from that (the ANA Inspiration) because when I feel nervous now, I know what to do.\n\n\"The last few holes here I tried to be patient and to commit to my shots.\"\n\nA month after the ANA Inspiration in April, which Ko won, the Thai became the first player on the LPGA Tour to get her first three wins in consecutive events.\n\nSaid Ko: \"I think it's been amazing. We all know she's a great player, so it's always good to see her doing so well. And especially with her being such a nice person, too.\"\n\nTour veteran Christina Kim added: \"She's going to be unstoppable... She's only scratched the surface of what she could become.\"\n\nWhat she became yesterday morning was the winner of one of golf's most prestigious trophies.\n\nDescribing the pre-shot routine that has helped her turn multiple missed cuts into a Major moment, Ariya said: \"I really want to try to feel relaxed and I feel like what is going to make me happy is to smile.\"\n\nIn Woburn, it proved to be a winning smile. - Wire Services.\n\nAriya shows us all you can go through tough times in life, but you can come back.\n\n- Swing coach Gary Gilchrist on his charge Ariya Jutanugarn\n\nsport\n\nGolf\n\nthailand\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nFind the Best Fixed Deposit Rates\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0cc2cc6ea1966f83931d15aed8996100e8ed59a93d73958306a10e0032fecf25/NP_20160802_ARIYA02_1343088.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ariya Jutanugarn.", "caption": "Ariya Jutanugarn."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The US needs no more neanderthal input to this already disgraceful election,\" read one tweet.\n\n\"I am appalled and outraged\" by the cover photo, read another tweet, adding: \"Misogyny is misogyny.\"\n\nSeveral other tweets decried the \"attempts to shame\" Mrs Trump.\n\nSome wondered how conservative evangelical Christians would react, while others wondered if Mr Murdoch, who also holds conservative views, had turned against Mr Trump.\n\nMrs Trump met Mr Trump in 1998, and became the real estate tycoon's third wife in 2005.\n\nunited states\n\ndonald trump\n\nPOLITICIANS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 30, 2025, 07:03am\n\nSingaporeans travelling to US advised to check latest entry requirements and comply: MFA\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nS'poreans looking to pursue studies in US can still submit visa applications: US Embassy\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:02am\n\nConfused, nervous, told to 'wait for updates': Singapore students at Harvard react to US ban\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/10a654700c579f9af06bcf7ebb4f8f9c561811e1ec682c73b5f03b27b6e548d8/NP_20160802_WIN02_1342845.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "TALK OF THE TOWN: Mr Donald Trump and his third wife Melania.", "caption": "TALK OF THE TOWN: Mr Donald Trump and his third wife Melania."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2a46ea4106ae0b5a959297e2272ab889bd6dddb391db51ad4f6af0a57114f0fe/434203950.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Anxious Harvard-bound Singaporeans press ahead with plans, even as some still do not have visas", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9ba22c7c80eb08300f3647c2c23e6f1c131b8935c8cdec5b82ad49e78f8d3eda/LYNXMPEL4E0LU-1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Singaporeans travelling to US advised to check latest entry requirements and comply: MFA", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

A man in my train carriage also picked up the emergency phone and tried calling, but there was no response.\n\n\"The train's speed was quite fast and it also did not slow down as it usually does at corners.\"\n\nMs Bong said the two-carriage train, which contained about 20 passengers, ended up stopping just before the platform at Phoenix station after another commuter used her mobile phone to call a number listed in the train.\n\nAn SMRT staff member subsequently arrived and forced open the train's door, before driving the train to the platform where everyone alighted safely, she added.\n\nMs Bong, who lives in Choa Chu Kang, said she takes the BPLRT every day, but that this was her first time encountering such an incident.\n\nIn her Facebook post, Ms Bong questioned why the train's emergency button and phone were not working.\n\nSMRT said Ms Bong was probably referring to the train's emergency halt request button, which can only be activated when a train comes to a complete stop at a station, which prevents it from moving off again.\n\nThe BPLRT Operations Control Centre (OCC) also received separate alerts from commuters through the station intercom, the train's emergency phone and through the OCC hotline, it added.\n\nFURTHER CHECKS\n\nSMRT explained that the OCC had imposed a \"speed code restriction\", which allowed the train to stop before Phoenix station.\n\nWhile Ms Bong said that she felt that the train had been moving quite fast, SMRT confirmed that it did not exceed 55kmh during the incident.\n\nBPLRT trains typically operate at between 30kmh and 55kmh.\n\n\"The train was later withdrawn to the depot for further checks. All equipment in the train, including the emergency phone, are checked before the train is put into service each day,\" it said in its statement.\n\n\"We would like to reassure all commuters that our staff will not hesitate to take immediate action as safety is our top priority.\" - The Straits Times Online\n\nWhen the train did not stop at Jelapang, we tried pressing the emergency button, but it was not working.

I am ashamed of him,\" Harting said.\n\n\"I have often expressed my disappointment in Bach, but this is a new dimension of disappointment.\"\n\nHarting has never been afraid to make a stand.\n\nIn 2014, the German had himself removed from the list of candidates for World Athlete of the Year, in protest against the nomination of US sprinter Justin Gatlin, who has twice been banned from athletics over positive drug tests.\n\nInjury saw him miss the entire 2015 season with injury and he has struggled with knee and shoulder problems this season.\n\nHe says he is no longer the favourite, with Poland's Piotr Malachowski arriving in Rio as the world champion - a state of affairs Harting enjoys.\n\n\"In 2012, I was at a totally different, much higher level. I have to accept that,\" Harting told SID, an AFP subsidiary.\n\n\"I am no longer the hunted, now I'm the hunter - I like that.\n\n\"The other boys haven't seen me on the big stage for a while, I'm a factor they can't control, that is my advantage.\n\n\"I'll give it my all and have never had the thought 'what if?', that just costs energy.\"\n\nHarting loves a challenge and thrives on pressure.\n\nWhen the 2009 world championships were held at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, which he regards as his home turf, he was in his element.\n\nHis long-time rival Malachowski threw 68.77m with his opening throw and extended his lead to 69.15m on his fifth and penultimate throw.\n\nEnter Harting, who saved his best for last by launching a personal best of 69.43m to win the gold with his final throw.\n\nHarting's shirt did not stand a chance as he ripped it to shreds in euphoric celebration and the Berlin crowd lapped it up.\n\nHaving finished fourth at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Harting got a monkey off his back by winning the 2012 Olympic title which he says made him a \"complete athlete\".\n\nBut four years on and past 30, the German knows this is likely to be his last crack at another Olympic medal.\n\n\"Life will go one without a gold medal,\" he said.\n\n\"The pressure to perform before London was terrible. I have always said the last six weeks of training are always my strongest, we'll see whether it will be enough.\n\n\"Of course, I want to win gold, but I had it once and I know how quickly the medal loses its shine.\"\n\n- AFP.\n\nRio Olympics\n\nathletics\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSchooling offered free flights on AirAsia\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nFree flights for Schooling, other Asean Olympic winners\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nCampbell reveals hernia injury\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRio 2016: Boos or boost for Brazil?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nUNIQLO\n\nNew diverse jeans everyone’s wearing, from slim to wide fits\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5aa5549542dca26539490b4a6d0b02fb70b3deff4cef1b2560f01ac3b00a9f9a/NP_20160802_HART02_1342966.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Robert Harting", "caption": "Robert Harting"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I trust people will realise the difficult situation we are in. We did our best to address the situation in a way to protect clean athletes.\"\n\nThree IOC executive members have been named to make a final decision on which Russian athletes will compete in Rio once the individual federations have made their lists.\n\nThe IOC said the Russian team will be finalised before Friday's opening ceremony at the Rio Olympic stadium.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said yesterday that international sport will be heading on the \"road to nowhere\" unless doping sanctions are applied in the same way to all countries.\n\n\"The (anti-doping) system needs to be equally integrated and a unique system in all countries of the world,\" Mutko told Russian media.\n\n\"If we can achieve this, then the fight against doping will have some kind of final effect.\n\n\"If the system will work one way in a given country, and we will have to fulfil others' requirements, then that's a road to nowhere.\"\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nRio Olympics\n\nRussia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSchooling offered free flights on AirAsia\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nFree flights for Schooling, other Asean Olympic winners\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nCampbell reveals hernia injury\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRio 2016: Boos or boost for Brazil?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nChina Market Revival - Here’s Why It Matters\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a29cdb7e10a3975cb4b1261facbb5a54bb4276683cc6122cb9ece986fb09e6c6/NP_20160802_RUSSIA02_1343105.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

A special thank you to the fans - you make this such a great event.\"\n\nThe Briton took the chequered flag less than two seconds ahead of the German, who had lined up on pole position at the Hungaroring but lost out to Hamilton at the start in the key moment of the race.\n\nHamilton now leads Rosberg by six points after 11 of the season's 21 races. The Briton has won five of the last six races, including the last three.\n\nOVERTAKING SCHUMI\n\nUntil yesterday, he had shared the record for Hungary GP wins with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher.\n\n\"I grew up watching Michael, so to have a similar number, and now one more than he had here, is incredible,\" said Hamilton.\n\nAustralian Daniel Ricciardo finished third for Red Bull after pushing the Mercedes pair hard enough at one point for the champions to tell Hamilton to pick up the pace.\n\nFerrari's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, also a previous winner in Hungary, finished fourth after sounding off over the team radio about slower cars holding him up as he lapped them.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen held off Ferrari's feisty Kimi Raikkonen for fifth. The Finn had started 14th but a long first stint saw him challenging the Dutchman.\n\nThe battle between the pair provided a moment of excitement in an otherwise uneventful race, with Raikkonen clipping the back of Verstappen's car and damaging his front wing in an attempt to pass the 18-year-old.\n\nFernando Alonso was the sole-surviving McLaren in seventh.\n\nMcLaren's hopes of a strong result on the back of their best qualifying performance since renewing their engine partnership with Honda were dashed early on, with Jenson Button falling down the order with hydraulics problems.\n\nThe 2009 world champion also collected a drive-through penalty for a breach of radio rules before finally retiring late in the race.\n\nRosberg, who has also won five races this year, will have the chance to seize back the lead in his home German Grand Prix.\n\nHOCKENHEIM NEXT\n\nThe race at Hockenheim, absent from last year's calendar, takes place this weekend.\n\n\"It was all down to the start in the end,\" said Rosberg, of yesterday's race.\n\n\"From then on, I was trying to put all the pressure on Lewis but it's not possible to pass at this track.\n\n\"To have the next race coming up very quickly sounds good, at my home race... it's going to be awesome.\" - Reuters.\n\nHUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX (Top 5)\n\n1.

Both times they led 2-0 at the interval.\n\nLast term, Leicester lost just once when playing at King Power Stadium. As for the Swans, they won just four from 19 while on the road.\n\nCan try: Swansea at +1.5 Goals\n\nSOUTHAMPTON v SUNDERLAND\n\nLast season, the Saints were strong at St Mary's, losing just five from 19. The Black Cats, on the other hand, were disappointing when on the road, winning just three from their 19 away games.\n\nOn last season's stats, EVEN seems the way to go. Their last three meetings saw them level at the break.\n\nCan try: THREE on Total Goals\n\nHULL v MAN UNITED\n\nThe head-to-head stats say the Tigers cannot win. However, when the two teams last met in May 2015, Hull held on to a 0-0 draw.\n\nWorth noting that last season, the Red Devils won just seven of 19 when playing away and EVEN seemed to be the call in Man United matches. So far this season, it's been Even-Even.\n\nCan try: Man United on the 1x2\n\nWEST BROM v MIDDLESBROUGH\n\nThe last time these two teams clashed was in the Championship of the 2009/10 season.\n\nThat season, the Baggies won 5-0 (away) and 2-0 (home). Only once in their last 10 meetings has it been 0-0 at the interval. The last time Boro beat West Brom was in 2006.\n\nCan try: EVEN on Even-Odd option\n\nMAN CITY v WEST HAM\n\nOnly twice in their last 10 meetings have they marched off all square.\n\nLast season, Man City lost just five from 19 matches at home while the Hammers also lost five of 19 when playing away. OVER 2.5 seems to be the way to go in matches involving these two teams. This season, both of City's matches ended ODD.\n\nCan try: OVER 2.5 on Over/Under option\n\nenglish premier league\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 23, 2021, 03:35pm\n\nHolland not counting on van Dijk for Euros\n\nMar 23, 2021, 03:11pm\n\nThiago laments emotional difficulty of pandemic football\n\nMar 10, 2021, 04:22pm\n\nMourinho looking to mark career milestone with trophy for Spurs\n\nMar 9, 2021, 09:56am\n\nChelsea's mean defence is down to trust and courage: Tuchel\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e1b5e6d59c16d33d904c9b1aac05385b82b649d8783a9cfda7dbfb8f997a86ea/NP_20160827_BMTEAMS27_1368098.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CATALYST: Arsenal's wizard Mesut Oezil (above) is in line for his first start this season, after making a substitute appearance in the 0-0 draw with Leicester.", "caption": "CATALYST: Arsenal's wizard Mesut Oezil (above) is in line for his first start this season, after making a substitute appearance in the 0-0 draw with Leicester."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6432b67dd00690b82eaf11d27c5f42a592228f6a564c4b4d552a61210421b81d/dw-football-qe2-220909.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "English Premier League fixtures postponed after Queen Elizabeth's death", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5de22c0d94ccaaa9c5aab6910a26b058bbe4700b6c649266195497f929b10221/vvd24.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Holland not counting on van Dijk for Euros", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

What a day! The traffic was difficult to navigate, but it was an amazing race. A special thank you to the fans - you make this such a great event.\"\n\nThe Briton took the chequered flag less than two seconds ahead of the German, who had lined up on pole position at the Hungaroring but lost out to Hamilton at the start in the key moment of the race.\n\nHamilton now leads Rosberg by six points after 11 of the season's 21 races. The Briton has won five of the last six races, including the last three.\n\nOVERTAKING SCHUMI\n\nUntil yesterday, he had shared the record for Hungary GP wins with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher.\n\n\"I grew up watching Michael, so to have a similar number, and now one more than he had here, is incredible,\" said Hamilton.\n\nAustralian Daniel Ricciardo finished third for Red Bull after pushing the Mercedes pair hard enough at one point for the champions to tell Hamilton to pick up the pace.\n\nFerrari's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, also a previous winner in Hungary, finished fourth after sounding off over the team radio about slower cars holding him up as he lapped them.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen held off Ferrari's feisty Kimi Raikkonen for fifth. The Finn had started 14th but a long first stint saw him challenging the Dutchman.\n\nThe battle between the pair provided a moment of excitement in an otherwise uneventful race, with Raikkonen clipping the back of Verstappen's car and damaging his front wing in an attempt to pass the 18-year-old.\n\nFernando Alonso was the sole-surviving McLaren in seventh.\n\nMcLaren's hopes of a strong result on the back of their best qualifying performance since renewing their engine partnership with Honda were dashed early on, with Jenson Button falling down the order with hydraulics problems.\n\nThe 2009 world champion also collected a drive-through penalty for a breach of radio rules before finally retiring late in the race.\n\nRosberg, who has also won five races this year, will have the chance to seize back the lead in his home German Grand Prix.\n\nHOCKENHEIM NEXT\n\nThe race at Hockenheim, absent from last year's calendar, takes place this weekend.\n\n\"It was all down to the start in the end,\" said Rosberg, of yesterday's race.\n\n\"From then on, I was trying to put all the pressure on Lewis but it's not possible to pass at this track.\n\n\"To have the next race coming up very quickly sounds good, at my home race... it's going to be awesome.\" - Reuters.\n\nHUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX (Top 5)\n\n1.

At the end of the day, Russians are not the only sportsmen or women who have been found doping.\"\n\nThe stunning allegations about Russian cheating forced the IOC to take aggressive action without the luxury of time, Bach explained.\n\nRussian athletes \"have to assume a collective responsibility\" for operating in such a corrupt system, he said.\n\nBut, rather than implementing an outright ban on the whole country, the IOC wanted to send \"a message of encouragement to the clean Russian athletes to show that they are clean\".\n\n\"It's fine to talk about collective responsibility,\" Bach said, \"but... You have to be able to look in the eyes of every athlete concerned.\"\n\nAsked how he would respond to critics accusing the IOC of treating Russia too softly, Bach said \"read the decision\", stressing that the ROC was being treated more harshly than every other national Olympic committee. - Wire Services.\n\nIt is a specific challenge for our sportsmen but I am absolutely sure that the majority of the Russian team will meet the criteria.\n\n- Russia sports minister Vitaly Mutko, who believes most of the country's athletes will meet IOC's strict criteria to compete at next month's Rio Olympics\n\nOlympics\n\nINTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE\n\nIOC\n\npresident\n\nThomas Bach\n\nRussia\n\nRIO GAMES\n\nRUSSIAN OLYMPIC COMMITTEE\n\nROC\n\ngymnast\n\nALIYA MUSTAFINA\n\ndiver\n\nILYA ZAKHAROV\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 11:34pm\n\nEx-swimmer Mark Chay set to become new SNOC secretary-general\n\nFeb 2, 2025, 12:27am\n\nJason Teh just one match from ending badminton title drought\n\nDec 4, 2024, 06:12am\n\nSingapore's first Olympic medallist Tan Howe Liang dies aged 91\n\nNov 11, 2024, 10:59pm\n\nKoen Pang and Izaac Quek qualify for World Table Tennis Finals\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/52ee3bd195ffac90f71130737e6bab7b115c83b1eeb634def2efee644adce1bd/NP_20160725_RUSSIA25_1334642.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "RACE AGAINST TIME: London 2012 gold medallists, gymnast Aliya Mustafina (above) and diver Ilya Zakharov, have to be passed \"fit\" by the respective international federations to have a chance of being in the 2016 Russian Olympic team.", "caption": "RACE AGAINST TIME: London 2012 gold medallists, gymnast Aliya Mustafina (above) and diver Ilya Zakharov, have to be passed \"fit\" by the respective international federations to have a chance of being in the 2016 Russian Olympic team."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/78bf94264510b2d01346c457f6e7e659ab973208ea51fe4278d2e89b570a0381/20250526739592073z6a4121a.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Loh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a1a3c7ed610c7e4e9061a80364c3db132f4768b716ef5d89ed7c51732a276c44/dlswim16.66a955ae.Attachment.024714.jpg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ex-swimmer Mark Chay set to become new SNOC secretary-general", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But when you play with other people you strengthen your weaknesses.\n\n\"And since we've come back together we've become a lot more rounded.\"\n\nThey will bid to burnish Britain's solid record in Olympic mixed doubles, which includes Simon Archer and Joanne Goode's bronze at the 2000 Sydney Games and Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson's silver in Athens in 2004.\n\nHaving battled for three years to get to Rio, the idea of letting off steam with a medal around their necks is a tickling one for the couple.\n\n\"It'd be a great holiday after winning a medal, I'd go on a one-month bender,\" Gabby laughs.\n\n\"Straight to Vegas!\" adds Chris.\n\n- Reuters.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n7th\n\nChris and Gabby Adcock are the seventh seeds for the mixed doubles at the Rio Olympics.\n\nsport\n\nRio Olympics\n\nGABBY ADCOCK\n\nCHRIS ADCOCK\n\nbadminton\n\nmixed doubles\n\nGreat Britain\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4740c3002535b4a9d0b055efd516aa55c51de418d83a4d29eac7c33030171ce4/NP_20160725_BAD25_1334583.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chris (left) and Gabby Adcock (right).", "caption": "Chris (left) and Gabby Adcock (right)."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Malaysian athletes have mounted the Olympic podium six times, but never climbed to the top.\n\nLee meant for London to be his Olympic swansong but, three months shy of his 34th birthday, he will contest his fourth Games where fans will hope for another battle royal with arch-rival Lin.\n\n\"(Gold) is not only my dream, but also the dream of all Malaysians,\" Lee told Malaysian media recently.\n\n\"I have to make the best preparation as this is my last Olympics.\"\n\nHis reputation has been stained after he failed a drug test at the 2014 world championships.\n\nHe was provisionally suspended in November of that year and faced a potentially career-ending ban after testing positive for dexamethasone, a widely administered anti-inflammatory used to treat asthma and altitude sickness.\n\nYet the following April, the Badminton World Federation (BWF) controversially handed him a back-dated eight-month ban that allowed him to return to competition a few days after the judgment, convinced by Lee's claim that he had taken the substance inadvertently and had no intention to cheat.\n\nLee's ranking plummeted outside the top 100 while sidelined, but he has fought back hard over the past year and reclaimed the No. 1 spot from Chinese world champion Chen Long with victory at the Indonesian Open in June.\n\nLee's Indonesian coach Hendrawan and the Badminton Association of Malaysia have largely kept the shuttler sheltered from the Games hype and also been cagey about the player's fitness after he missed tournaments in Australia and Taiwan last month due to a buttock injury.\n\nBut Lee will be front and centre at Rio as Malaysia's flag-bearer at the opening ceremony.\n\nFrom there, he has \"nowhere to hide\", Hendrawan admitted.\n\n- Reuters.\n\nOlympics\n\nbadminton\n\nworld No. 1\n\nLee Chong Wei\n\nmalaysia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 11:34pm\n\nEx-swimmer Mark Chay set to become new SNOC secretary-general\n\nFeb 2, 2025, 12:27am\n\nJason Teh just one match from ending badminton title drought\n\nDec 4, 2024, 06:12am\n\nSingapore's first Olympic medallist Tan Howe Liang dies aged 91\n\nNov 11, 2024, 10:59pm\n\nKoen Pang and Izaac Quek qualify for World Table Tennis Finals\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e847c8977bf30dd65f7171da5c48455eaf03d9e8fff2b68c5ef81084293283a4/NP_20160725_LEE25_1334570.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Lee Chong Wei.", "caption": "Lee Chong Wei."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/78bf94264510b2d01346c457f6e7e659ab973208ea51fe4278d2e89b570a0381/20250526739592073z6a4121a.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Loh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a1a3c7ed610c7e4e9061a80364c3db132f4768b716ef5d89ed7c51732a276c44/dlswim16.66a955ae.Attachment.024714.jpg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ex-swimmer Mark Chay set to become new SNOC secretary-general", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Why should we not shake hands? No reason why. He will want to win, I will want to win. That's all.\"\n\nMourinho sang from the same hymn sheet.\n\nWhen asked if he would offer his hand to Guardiola, he replied: \"Of course, I will shake his hand. Why wouldn't I?\"\n\n\"We worked together for three years (at Barcelona), we were opponents but we are professionals.\n\n\"I don't see why I wouldn't shake his hand.\"\n\nIt is the pitch in Beijing that is of more concern on both their minds.\n\nHeavy rainfall over the past week has damaged the playing surface at the Bird's Nest.\n\nIn a bid to prevent damaging the pitch further, City and United agreed to train at the nearby Olympic Sports Centre yesterday.\n\nAn International Champions Cup spokesman said the surface would be \"fine\", but Guardiola's concerns were understandable.\n\n\"We didn't see the pitch but there is a lot of water in the last days, so we understand it's not in a good condition, but okay we're going to adapt and adjust,\" the City boss said.\n\n\"It's our second game of preparation. The most important thing is that the players are not going to be injured.\n\n\"We know the humidity for the training is not ideal but we also know that it's so important to come here to know the people and to play a good two games against amazing teams like United and Dortmund.\n\n\"We don't want to expend too much energy in training because of the humidity but we stay here, we play, and then go back to Manchester for two more weeks of preparation before the first official game.\"\n\nGuardiola and midfielder Fernandinho were given towels during a sweltering press conference that offered little respite from the heat and humidity.\n\nVincent Kompany was among those training yesterday morning, albeit away from his teammates as the City captain looks to bounce back from a difficult run of injuries.\n\nGuardiola confirmed the Belgium defender, 30, will not play tonight, but could be ready for their Aug 13 season-opener against Sunderland.\n\n\"The most important thing is for Vincent to get fit,\" he said.\n\n\"If it's for Sunderland, perfect.

But differences exist once you look beyond their spoked wheels.\n\nOn the cafe racer-styled Thruxton R, you'll zero in on the elongated fuel tank, a throwback to the past when brave men went racing wearing only half-shell helmets and knee-high leather boots.\n\nThe inverted gold forks and dual Ohlins rear shocks add a touch of modernity and bling.\n\nThe T120 sports a huge semi-circular grab rail and front dual disc brakes attached to a big wheel hub, which are a welcome addition.\n\nIts fuel tank badge is now sleeker and smaller.\n\nERGONOMICS\n\nMy 1.78m-tall frame agrees with the T120's upright riding posture because my hands fall naturally onto the handlebars and my feet rest on pegs as if I'm sitting on an office chair.\n\nI was expecting the one-seater Thruxton R to be a torture instrument given its racer-boy styling.\n\nSurprisingly, there was no weight bearing on my wrists simply because the Thruxton R isn't designed like a modern, nose-down sports bike.\n\nIt has an unbelievably slim waistline as you grip your knees against the fuel tank.\n\nPOWER & HANDLING\n\nBoth six-speed Triumphs sport bigger 1,200cc engines.\n\nI recall the older 900cc Triumphs lacked the top speed and that extra gear to run with the bigger boys on highways.\n\nThe 2016 Thruxton R churns a maximum power close to 100hp and spits out 112Nm of torque.\n\nIts \"High Power\" engine towers over its predecessor as it produces 62 per cent more torque and 41 per cent more horsepower.\n\nThe T120 \"High Torque\" engine boasts similar improvements.\n\nWhat this means is that you won't be the last one pulling away from traffic stops.\n\nStill, the Triumphs' power output is mild compared with other naked motorcycles with similar engine capacities which hover in the 150hp region.\n\nBut what the gentleman's bike lacks in power and torque, it makes up in the handling department.\n\nBoth low-revving Triumphs are predictable to ride and comfortable.\n\nWhile the T120 may be a little slower-steering and has softer suspension than the Thruxton R, it now stops quicker thanks to dual disc brakes at the front.\n\nThe sportier Thruxton does every thing better given its powerful, radially-mounted front Brembo brakes, fully adjustable suspension and sticky Pirelli tyres.\n\nWhat can be irritating about the Thruxton R is the glare from the tilted dual clocks and chromed top yoke when the sun is directly overhead.\n\nAlso, the rear-view mirrors need to be bigger to see traffic behind you.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nIn essence, the Triumphs are modern bikes made to look simple and retro.\n\nBoth have rain and road riding modes - the Thruxton R has an extra \"sport\" mode which allows instant power delivery and more punch.\n\nTraction control and anti-lock brakes are standard. While the speedometer and rev-counter are analogue, there are digital gauges for fuel consumption, distance travelled and selected ride modes.\n\nVERDICT\n\nIf you're a confident gentleman who's not bothered about breakneck speeds or gut-punching torque, either of the Triumphs would suit you. Both feature timeless designs that are making a comeback.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nMAKE & MODEL\n\nTriumph Bonneville T120 and Thruxton R\n\nCAPACITY\n\nBoth 1,200cc\n\nENGINE\n\nBoth water-cooled, parallel-twin cylinder\n\nTRANSMISSION\n\n6-speed\n\nMACHINE PRICE\n\nT120: $22,500,\n\nThruxton R: $27,000.\n\nFor more information, call Mah Pte Ltd at 6295-6393.\n\nBy\n\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Zaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nbiker\n\nREVIEWS\n\nmotorcycle\n\nTRIUMPH T120 AND THRUXTON R\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nBiker Boy: Quick fix at Harley-Davidson's revamped workshop\n\nSep 17, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nGiving F1 a two-wheel boost\n\nSep 3, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nHe once raced 2 weeks after breaking ankle\n\nAug 20, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRight gear, right habits, stay safe\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/03e9d801936e4a319652385d0427c324b0fe5e893d3d9f9292e48ac26c5ae2dc/NP_20160724_BIKER24-NOE_1333156.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Triumph Bonneville T120.", "caption": "Triumph Bonneville T120."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/091528e9c5f0e31e8abe9236bce9b8579849c22c9f6694d77d2dcfc581a528d3/NP_20161203_BIKER03_1457186.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "How to ride out the tough times", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1d601f0617d9c4059771f6a8d90d63ff2d29ff40e714af0b918ed3577f9333bd/NP_20161030_BIKER30-G17_1425327.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Biker Boy: Quick fix at Harley-Davidson's revamped workshop", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I was disappointed, especially in Justin Gatlin.\"\n\nGatlin, 34, who took silver behind Bolt at last year's world championships in the 100m and 200m, has been one of Bolt's most consistent rivals in recent years.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the US Olympic trials in Eugene earlier this month, Gatlin said he was in no doubt that Bolt would be fit to run at the Olympics, which begin on Aug 5.\n\n\"At the end of the day, when you command a certain power in track and field, sometimes you can exercise it,\" he said, alluding to preferential treatment for Bolt.\n\n\"That's what's happening right now - he's injured, he has a medical pass, that's what his country does.\"\n\nBolt (right) looked like he has work to do if he is to complete the famed triple-triple in Rio.\n\nHe was short of sharpness in every aspect in the 200m race yesterday morning.\n\nHis usual late surge was absent and he had to battle all the way to the line for a time of 19.89, considerably shy of American LaShawn Merritt's season-leading 19.74.\n\nPanama's Edward Alonso was second in 20.04, with Briton Adam Gemili third in 20.07.\n\nBolt, who turns 30 next month, travels to Rio in search of a third successive gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay.\n\n\"I tried to hold my form. I'm not fully in shape, I need more work, but I will be fine,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm feeling good and happy I could run and finish the race without any injuries.\" - Wire Services.\n\nsport\n\nOlympics\n\nathletics\n\nBOLT\n\nGATLIN\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0616c3720f95ac11a7245bdc13ad29643f4b9976ed003089e5ec9a2493d8da5f/NP_20160724_BOLT24_1333746.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

now it is patriotism, increasing the prestige of the authorities inside the country.\"\n\nATTACK\n\nThat may go some way also to explaining the reactions by Russian officials and a large swathe of the population to the latest scandal, which saw Russia accused of state-run doping that included the samples of cheating athletes swopped for clean ones in Sochi.\n\nUkraine, Syria and now doping: for many in Russia, it is just the latest attack by the West.\n\nRather than focus their ire on the officials accused of systematic cheating, Russians have tended to lash out at the allegations as just the latest move in a broader political campaign to damage the country.\n\nWith ties with the West already at their lowest ebb since the collapse of the Soviet Union over the crisis in Ukraine, Putin has also drawn parallels with the Cold War-era confrontation in sport.\n\n\"Recent events, the difficult atmosphere around international sports and the Olympic movement, unfortunately stir analogies with the 1980s,\" Putin warned this week, citing the boycotts of the 1980 Games in Moscow and 1984 competition in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Now we are witnessing a dangerous return to political interference in sport.\"\n\nOthers, however, argue that the political meddling in sport is coming mainly from the Russian authorities - and desperation for success lies behind the current doping scandal.\n\nA report released by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) this week detailing the \"state-dictated\" system to hide drug-test failures said it was put in place after a dismal showing at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\n\"It was decided that this could not happen at Sochi and the plan to ensure lots of medal winners was concocted\" by the sports ministry, the report cited whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov as saying.\n\nRussia went on to top the medals table in Sochi - another source of enormous national pride for Putin and many Russians.\n\nOnly now have the extraordinary lengths they went to get there been revealed.\n\nWhile Putin has furiously denied that there is any state-run doping programme in Russia, analyst Kalachev said that the Kremlin's thirst for victory was likely fuelling the cheating.\n\n\"Some here like to say that Putin's ideal is the GDR (former Communist East Germany),\" Kalachev said, pointing to the country where the Kremlin leader served as a KGB officer and which ran a notorious doping campaign.\n\n\"The successes of the GDR in sport relied heavily on doping.

Long tipped as a potential No. 1, but yet to take the plunge.\n\n2 ROY KEANE\n\nPrevious jobs in charge of Sunderland and Ipswich ended disappointingly, but potential was shown and has remained involved in the game with backroom roles at Aston Villa and with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nHard to guess how he might dovetail with the unpredictable Allam family.\n\n3 STEVE McCLAREN\n\nDebate remains over whether he is more of a coach than a manager, but the former England boss had enjoyed good times with Middlesbrough and FC Twente as well as less distinguished stints with the national team, Derby and Newcastle. Hull is also close to his York roots and he may find a Premier League job hard to turn down regardless of the circumstances.\n\n4 RYAN GIGGS\n\nNow looking for a managerial post after three years learning the trade under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. After almost 30 years as player and coach at United, his first job away from Old Trafford will be keenly watched.\n\n5 KARL ROBINSON\n\nThe highly-rated manager of MK Dons has seemed destined for bigger things for some time, although he has so far resisted the temptation to leave.\n\nAfter six years in Milton Keynes and being unable to prevent relegation from the Championship, the time could be now.\n\n6 NEIL WARNOCK\n\nThe much-travelled veteran could hardly be a long-term choice, but he is consistently linked with jobs in the Yorkshire area and appears to relish awkward challenges like this one.

Above all, we have to make the people and the whole country proud.\n\n\"While my main focus will be on the senior team and getting positive results, I want to add my influence to the great work being done across the development teams at St George's Park - a facility I have used with my previous clubs.\n\n\"I know we have talented, committed players and it is time for us to deliver.\"FA chief executive Martin Glenn, who headed a unanimous selection panel alongside acting chairman David Gill and technical director Dan Ashworth, said: \"Sam Allardyce is the right man for the England job.\"His excellent managerial credentials, including his ability to realise the potential of players and teams, develop a strong team ethos and embrace modern methods that enhance performance, made him the outstanding choice.\"\n\nAllardyce will face the media at St George's Park, where he will be based, tomorrow morning with his first match taking place against unnamed opponents at Wembley on Sept 1.\n\nWayne Rooney, Hodgson's captain for the past two years, welcomed the news from Manchester United's pre-season tour of China and vowed to remain available for national duty.\n\nSkipper Rooney, his country's all-time leading goalscorer, was part of a Three Lions side humiliated by Iceland at Euro 2016 and suggestions followed that he may retire from the international stage.\n\nBut the Manchester United forward, who turns 31 in October, is keen to continue and is relishing the chance to work with Allardyce.\n\nSpeaking on United's pre-season tour of China, Rooney told various newspapers: \"Yeah, I think it's a good appointment for England.\n\n\"He will probably bring a different way of playing to England and, hopefully, it's a good way and we can be successful under him.\n\n\"I only know him through teams he has managed. I have seen him a few times off the pitch, but it's like everyone, I know him through the teams in the Premier League.\n\n\"Am I going to carry on? Of course. It was asked of me after the Euros but, yes, I'll be there.\"\n\n- PA Sport.\n\n\"I wish him well and now he can focus to win the next World Cup. I believe you have the players in England to do well. Recently he has done well at Sunderland from a very, very bad position. He has a capacity to get the best out of his teams. His teams are always difficult to beat, yes.

But they had a little problem physically and mentally.\"\n\nIndeed, the local boys started strongly but faded as the second half wore on and they failed to carve out clear chances.\n\nStriker Amiruldin Asraf came within centimetres of opening the scoring after just nine minutes when his superb effort from 20 metres looked destined for the top corner, only for Iran goalkeeper Nima Mirzazad to pull off a finger-tip save at full stretch.\n\nIran then had a golden opportunity to take the lead in the 18th minute when Singapore skipper Shahrin Saberin played a weak backpass intended for his goalkeeper Zharfan Rohaizad but it went straight into Reza Karamollachaab's path. The Iran striker's effort was deflected over by Zharfan.\n\nThere was no denying the Middle East side in the 31st minute when the Singapore defence played themselves into trouble, allowing Mehdikhani to dribble across the box before firing home a low shot past Zharfan.\n\nIn the second half, Iran had a number of good chances to put the game to bed, but were foiled by poor finishing and, on one occasion, the woodwork.\n\nSingapore's best chance of an equaliser came in the 80th minute, when the ball was played into Amiruldin in the box.\n\nBut the striker could not get a shot away, and instead set up teammate Adam Swandi, whose effort was blocked by an Iranian defender.\n\nPost-game, an exhausted Adam said: \"I felt the team performance was quite good.\n\n\"It was our spirit that gave us a chance. At the start of the game, we had some chances, but luck wasn't on our side.\"\n\nAdded captain Shahrin: \"Tonight, everyone was hungrier than in Teheran.\n\n\"Maybe it is because those games were just friendlies, and our mindset then was just to test ourselves against one of the top teams in Asia.\n\n\"But now, we know we can compete against the likes of Iran... the most important thing is to get our mentality right.\"\n\nSingapore coach Tardy agreed with Peiravani's assessment that his team played much better than three months ago, but said they could still do more.\n\n\"Yes, especially with the fighting spirit of the players,\" said the Frenchman. \"In the first half, we played well, but again conceded a stupid goal.\n\n\"We played a good game but we missed a few things, such as (executing) technical ability under pressure, but what we can keep is the spirit of the boys.\n\n\"Everyone showed they wanted to prove something, that they are proud to play this kind of game for the country.\n\n\"They wanted to finish by winning but unfortunately we didn't, so the players are disappointed.\"\n\nTHIRD-PLACE PLAY-OFF\n\nUzbekistan 4 Hong Kong 0\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nFootball\n\nUNDER 21\n\nSINGAPORE U21\n\nIRAN U21\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/44b240c3fad79f9762870f1836733f53cf6a17d4f20ce559ffa6b4f5be698ad9/NP_20160724_SZSOC24-1ZP_1333801.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "YOUNG GUNS: Singapore striker Amiruldin Asraf (centre) giving a spirited display against the fancied Iranians.", "caption": "YOUNG GUNS: Singapore striker Amiruldin Asraf (centre) giving a spirited display against the fancied Iranians."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Rusyaidi who? Joshua who? Amiruldin who?\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nIndeed, not many give Richard Tardy's charges a chance at the SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur in 13 months' time.\n\nBut, as their performances against Hong Kong and Iran in the International Challenge Cup showed, these boys have enough fight in them.\n\nNo one expected them to thump Hong Kong 5-0 in the first game.\n\nBut, powered by a sparkling performance by TNP-Dollah Kassim Award winner Joshua Pereira, 19, they did just that.\n\nNo one - not even the Iran coach, who had beaten Tardy's team twice in March - expected them to give the Asian powerhouses such a close fight in the final yesterday. But they did.\n\nOne can point to the fact the Iranians were made up mostly of Under-19 players.\n\nBut, did you know Singapore's starting 11 last night had two 17-year-olds in midfielder Hami Syahin and winger Haiqal Pashia?\n\nIn fact, only four players in the team were above the age of 19.\n\nEvery Iranian player was bigger and taller than the Singapore players, but the local boys still gave as good as they got.\n\nThere is clearly potential to be tapped on.\n\nCONFIDENT\n\nHami showed a confidence that belied his tender age and diminutive build (he stands at just 1.66m), even attempting a shot from the halfway line last night, which dropped a few metres wide of goal.\n\nStriker Amiruldin Asraf, 19, plays for S.League side Home United's reserve team, but the son of former national striker Nordin Khalil perhaps did enough in these two games to show Home coach Philippe Aw he could be ready for the first team.\n\nBut the players need more tests against teams like Iran, and in competitions such as these, to get better.\n\nAdam, who Tardy says has enough skill to be a \"technical leader\" for the team, ran his socks off, and started making stray passes in the final 10 minutes. He was exhausted.\n\nIn fact, with about 15 minutes to go, Tardy was maniacally screaming from his touchline, cajoling his players to make runs and move.\n\nThe minds were willing, but the flesh was weak.\n\nThat's why the Football Association of Singapore needs to make sure this group of boys continue to play against the top teams in the continent as much as possible over the next year, if they hope to pull off a surprise in KL.\n\nAs Iran coach Amirhossein Peiravani said: \"Singapore need to work on their mental side...

CHERYL YING (yinghqc@sph.com.sg) asks two engineers what they love about their job\n\nShare this article\n\nForget the One Ring from the Lord Of The Rings books. Mr Edward Tiong has something cooler. He and his partner are the creators of the Sesame Ring.\n\nWhile studying at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), they noticed that it was a hassle to whip out their student matriculation card every time they had to enter a venue.\n\n\"We looked at the technology inside the card and shrunk it down to something that we could easily wear on our fingers,\" says the 27-year-old who graduated last year with a degree in engineering systems and design.\n\nAnd so the Sesame Ring was born. The ring is now used in SUTD and was also adapted into a wristband that is used by several start-ups here.\n\nEven the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in the US took a liking to the ring and gave him the rights to develop and sell this wearable technology for its metro system.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 21, 2025, 06:51am\n\n'Too fat cannot, too skinny cannot': Employer asks for applicant's full-body photo\n\nMore related stories\n\nPATENT\n\nMr Tiong and his partner have a provisional patent for the Sesame Ring. He hopes to eventually adapt this technology completely into a mobile device, so that people can get around with just with their mobile phones.\n\nCreations such as the Sesame Ring prove that concepts learnt in engineering can be applied to real life. Mr Tiong believes that as an engineer, there is always space to innovate and be creative.\n\n\"Engineers by training are the ones who are able to step into the most (number of) industries after they graduate,\" he says.\n\nHe shared his experience in exploration and discovery at the Singapore Science Festival's National Engineers Dayyesterday.\n\nHe says it all started when he fixed his own PlayStation console.\n\nMr Tiong says: \"I realised that if you are daring enough to poke around and explore, you'll find interesting gems. Problems don't look that complicated once you start working on them, and it can be just a very simple solution like clicking things into place.\"\n\nBy\n\nCheryl Ying\n\nRead articles by Cheryl Ying\n\njobs\n\nSingapore\n\nTechnology\n\nengineer\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 22, 2025, 02:54am\n\nEx-offender starts café to offer others job, community, acceptance\n\nJan 2, 2025, 11:56pm\n\nRepeatedly bitten but never shy\n\nNov 12, 2024, 01:27am\n\nSecurity guard, 70, scammed into paying $5,000 for teaching job in Laos\n\nOct 29, 2024, 03:13am\n\nS'pore employment rate up in Q3 2024, retrenchments down\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6a424a2646956f1634fa16859d77d16e8813fb640910ab24b194eb13b695ccd8/NP_20160724_CYENGINEER_1333627.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Edward Tiong (above)", "caption": "Mr Edward Tiong (above)"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2d88a44bcc0318c1c0505922b0557e720e81600cf720bf7a53bda5f1533f33cb/hire_0.png?w=150", "alt_text": "'Too fat cannot, too skinny cannot': Employer asks for applicant's full-body photo", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ff8a255aed6c1126a09d8d68c8295e6e3d671940e7aca2cc8473f6e64461defa/22a6f039c61c0edadcdf5e71fa6652df45f0df3303477f6e1f64924a6381443c.png?w=318", "alt_text": "Ex-offender starts café to offer others job, community, acceptance", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

If any new credible evidence emerges, the three countries will continue to work together to analyse the evidence.\"\n\nHe also said cost was not a factor in deciding to suspend the search.\n\nHe noted that all data and information collected from the search would be released to the public, but that \"this needs time for compiling\".\n\nMeanwhile, various media reported yesterday that the plane's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, conducted a simulation of a similar path just weeks prior, using an elaborate home-built flight simulator to steer himself over the Strait of Malacca and into the remote southern Indian ocean - a course with striking resemblance to the route MH370 is believed to have taken.\n\nThe finding, which casts a shadow of suspicion over the 53-year-old pilot, was first published Friday by New York magazine, which obtained a confidential document from Malaysian police investigating the incident.\n\nAccording to the document, the FBI recovered deleted data points from the flight simulator on Zaharie's hard drive. \"We found a flight path that leads to the Southern Indian Ocean, among the numerous other flight paths charted on the flight simulator, that could be of interest,\" the document said.\n\nmalaysia\n\nmalaysia airlines\n\nMH370\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18eb560a13fda40eee3df589c84bcd6062a3c2b8374d9d3f1eccc808100d7021/NP_20160724_PLANE24-9S4_1333768.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CLOSING: The search will be suspended if the aircraft is not discovered after the search zone is completely scoured.", "caption": "CLOSING: The search will be suspended if the aircraft is not discovered after the search zone is completely scoured."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ad66bd2a3f3636a95fce240f004f94e2b834d9cf9917fd4792d04d4fb9ec20b7/VEP.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Singaporean drivers beware: VEP fines have started", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9440467cfa4430cdf4dc361e70f98f190aafdfd03c05e753e47166cc5c948627/FW1486550KL2326062025MAHKAMAHAMPANG-ChooKiong.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But no, I'm already 34, and I will choose my family,\" Isinbayeva said.\n\nThe two-time Olympic champion said that she planned to launch a legal appeal.\n\n\"There is some point in lodging an appeal as an individual to complain against the CAS decision,\" she said.\n\n\"If this is upheld, to go further to the international court of human rights, to prove there that I was not involved (in doping).\n\n\"For me, it will be a question of principle and it's already not in any way linked to participating in the Games in Rio, since there won't be time for that to happen,\" she said.\n\nCLINGING ON\n\nSports minister Vitaly Mutko, who has clung on despite the scandal, said Moscow now hopes the IOC will defer to individual international sporting federations to decide whether other Russian squads can compete.\n\nThe CAS ruling has been the focus of Olympic attention since an independent World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) report this week said Russia ran a \"state-dictated fail-safe system\" of drug cheating in 30 sports at the 2014 Sochi Games and other major events.\n\nBut Russia has found support from some international sports bodies, with the International Judo Federation (IJF) insisting all clean athletes should be allowed to take part in Rio.\n\n\"We hope that by allowing participation of Russian athletes in Rio 2016, we will send out a positive message to all the young people who deserve to be given examples of friendship instead of examples of Cold War,\" said IJF president Marius Vizer.\n\nIndividual Russian federations said they were now looking nervously ahead for the IOC to make its next move.\n\n\"We're all in suspense waiting for the IOC decision,\" wrestling federation president Mikhail Mamiashvili told AFP. \"I hope that the common sense and personal responsibility of those who will take the decision will prevail.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the IOC announced yesterday that 45 athletes have failed dope tests after their samples from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2012 London Games were re-analysed.\n\nThe results are from a second wave of re-tests and take the total number of athletes who tested positive for prohibited substances to 98, the IOC added in a statement.\n\nOf the 45 failed tests announced yesterday, 30 were from Beijing, including 23 medallists, and 15 were from London.\n\nThe IOC did not say if any of the London athletes had won medals.\n\n\"The new re-analysis once again shows the commitment of the IOC in the fight against doping,\" IOC president Bach said.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nsport\n\nOlympics\n\nRussia\n\ndoping\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1ec5b9d02e8e4c3fc5e4887a48886e10e6dd711479a625907537a777e132f29c/NP_20160723_RUS23_1332769.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "\"If the International Olympic Committee refuses to allow Russian competitors to go to the Olympics, I don’t see any point any more in continuing training.\" -

article is more than 12 months old\n\nJul 22, 2016, 10:02pm\n\nBruce quits Hull: reports\n\nShare this article\n\nSteve Bruce has resigned as manager of Hull City, according to reports.\n\nBruce, 55, led Hull to promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in May, but has reportedly quit following a meeting with the club's owners and did not take training yesterday morning.\n\nThe former Sunderland, Wigan and Birmingham boss, appointed at the KC Stadium in June 2012, was interviewed for the England job on Monday, but the Football Association announced Sam Allardyce as Roy Hodgson's successor yesterday.\n\nBruce, whose offer to resign in 2014 following the club's relegation was turned down, revealed he was unsure of his future after the Tigers' play-off triumph over Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nHull chairman Assem Allam, who missed the trip to Wembley after undergoing surgery, has been in takeover talks with two American consortiums and the club announced this week that those had been put on hold to allow them to prepare for life back in the top flight.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut no major new signings have been made with the start of the new season just three weeks away.\n\nBruce is understood to have sought assurances from the Allam family over the club's future, while his frustrations over lack of player recruitment have grown with goalkeeper Allan McGregor, Michael Dawson, Moses Odubajo and his son, Alex, all ruled out through long-term injuries.\n\nAllam first put the club up for sale in 2014 after the FA rejected his bid to change their name to Hull Tigers and, due to ill health, has delegated the day-to-day running of the club to his son and vice-chairman Ehab.\n\nSUCCESSFUL\n\nBruce signed a new three-year contract in March 2015 and is the most successful manager in Hull's history, twice winning promotion to the Premier League with the club and guiding them to their first FA Cup final appearance in 2014 when they lost to Arsenal.\n\nHis coaching career began with brief assignments at Sheffield United, Huddersfield, Wigan and Crystal Palace, but he put a reputation for itchy feet behind him during a largely successful six-year stay at Birmingham, whom he also led to the Premier League on two occasions.\n\nHe went on to manage Wigan again and then Sunderland, who sacked him in November 2011, before he was appointed as Nick Barmby's successor at Hull in June 2012.\n\n- PA Sport.\n\nsport\n\nFootball\n\nSteve Bruce\n\nengland\n\nShare

We came in second last year, which was disappointing. But we're on the right track.\"\n\nArsenal, who face Lens in their first pre-season friendly this morning (Singapore time) before flying for two matches in the United States, now have the financial muscle to compete for the biggest names following years of being beaten to the punch as they continued to pay off their move to the Emirates Stadium.\n\nYOUNG TALENT\n\nBut Gazidis insists they will continue with their policy of believing in their young talent and do not operate to a model that would see them match the money being spent by rivals with wealthy backers.\n\n\"We're making progress in what is a fiercely competitive world, against competitors that have the capability to spend far more money than we do,\" he said.\n\n\"We're doing it by being very, very disciplined; spending money where we believe it makes a difference, but also giving young players a chance and believing in ourselves and our values.\"\n\nArsenal have signed young Japan striker Takuma Asano as well as Xhaka but, given the belief in the current squad, there may be no further additions to Wenger's attacking options despite a long-term injury to Danny Welbeck and both Olivier Giroud and Sanchez set to miss the start of the season following international exertions.\n\nYesterday, Arsenal confirmed the signing of England Under-21 defender Rob Holding from League One side Bolton. The 20-year-old came through the ranks at Bolton before breaking into the first team 12 months ago and immediately went on to establish himself in the side.\n\nBolton finished bottom of the Championship as they dropped down to the third tier but that did not stop Holding picking up the club's Player of the Season award.\n\nThe versatile defender was their third summer acquisition, but both the fee and the length of the contract were undisclosed.\n\n- PA Sport.\n\nsport\n\nFootball\n\nenglish premier league\n\nepl\n\narsenal\n\ntitle\n\ntransfer\n\nIvan Gazidis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c236ae4f6c8a1d753933587cc3971fe3325643117cef39b7906d2bdd0a9f4ca7/NP_20160723_ARS23_1332967.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "INVINCIBLES: Arsenal's class of 2003/04 (left) were the last Gunners team to win the Premier League.", "caption": "INVINCIBLES: Arsenal's class of 2003/04 (left) were the last Gunners team to win the Premier League."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

meaning it was manned at the end - and made it beyond the area marked out by calculations from satellite images.\n\nHe said: \"If it was manned, it could glide for a long way.\n\n\"You could glide it for further than our search area is, so I believe the logical conclusion will be, well, maybe, that is the other scenario.\"\n\nDoubts that the search teams are looking in the right place will fuel calls for all data to be made publicly available so that academics and rival companies can pursue an \"open source\" solution - a collaborative public answer to the airline industry's greatest mystery.\n\nFugro's controlled glide hypothesis is also the first time officials have lent some support to contested theories that someone was in control during the flight's final moments.\n\nmalaysia\n\nMH370\n\nAustralia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ab99ebb26c3c31bd5e9f441d1e4334c7e6afd15b969dd65ae8ded71ed1f15e1e/NP_20160722_SEARCH22_1331935.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "DEBRIS: This undated handout photo released by the Australia Transport Safety Bureau on Wednesday shows Malaysian and Australian investigators examining a piece of aircraft debris found on Pemba Island off the coast of Tanzania.", "caption": "DEBRIS: This undated handout photo released by the Australia Transport Safety Bureau on Wednesday shows Malaysian and Australian investigators examining a piece of aircraft debris found on Pemba Island off the coast of Tanzania."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ad66bd2a3f3636a95fce240f004f94e2b834d9cf9917fd4792d04d4fb9ec20b7/VEP.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Singaporean drivers beware: VEP fines have started", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9440467cfa4430cdf4dc361e70f98f190aafdfd03c05e753e47166cc5c948627/FW1486550KL2326062025MAHKAMAHAMPANG-ChooKiong.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Why not?\n\n\"If you take a team from the lower part of the table, you have to adapt what you want to do.\n\n\"You have to defend and be organised or you will go down.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"So I think it depends on the situation, whether you have a top team, a middle team or a bottom team.\n\n\"Many times Sam has managed a team that have been struggling for survival and he has done the job.\"\n\nAllardyce himself has previously claimed that he would have landed a job at one of the Premier League's bigger teams if he was a foreigner, adding that he would win trophies galore if he managed one of England or Europe's bigger clubs.\n\nFormer England midfielder Jamie Redknapp called criticisms of his playing style \"cliche\".\n\nCLICHE\n\nHe wrote in his Daily Mail column: \"His 'way of playing' is a cliche. I've played against his teams and they could play too.\n\n\"Sure, if you wanted to fight, they would fight but, if you played, they would try to match you.\n\n\"He made the most of his players and adapted his style to their strengths.\"\n\nSir Alex Ferguson, meanwhile, opined that the English FA's prospective decision to go for a homegrown candidate is the right one.\n\nHe said: \"(Allardyce is) certainly the top Englishman. You can search the world for a top manager, but it was right to appoint an Englishman.\"\n\nEven former critic Mourinho believes the 61-year-old is ready for the \"big one\".\n\nSaid the Manchester United boss: \"I think he's the right person. I think he is a good choice...\n\n\"I think Sam never had the big chance at the highest level - lots of experiences in the Premier League but never that big one.\n\n\"And now he has the big one, so I think he is more than ready.\n\n\"I think he is a good motivator, I think he can create a good team spirit with his players.\"\n\nBeing a master motivator is one of Allardyce's strong suits, according to former player Kevin Davies.\n\nDescribing his former Bolton Wanderers boss, he told talkSPORT: \"He makes you think, 'Yeah, I really want to play for this guy'.\n\n\"I think he's done that with a lot of players. That's why we had success at Bolton, because of what he gave you individually - he could sit you down and motivate you as an individual - and he could do that in team meetings as well...\n\n\"He's an expert at that.\"\n\nAllardyce's former No. 2 Phil Brown added that England's humbling Euro 2016 Round-of-16 defeat by Iceland wouldn't have happened had his old boss been in charge.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: \"The game against Iceland, I thought we looked devoid of ideas, it looked as if we did not have a game plan.\n\n\"Sam would never go into a game without a game plan and certainly a change of plan, if something went wrong.\"\n\nIn addition to having a coherent strategy, Redknapp believes the new England boss needs to adjust the attitude of his charges.\n\nHe said: \"Allardyce's in-tray: stop England playing like they are scared, stop the players looking as if tournaments are a chore delaying their holidays, stop the paranoia...\n\n\"Being manager of England is not a difficult job, but I think a lot of people have made it look difficult recently.\n\n\"There is talk of the job being a poisoned chalice and a bad time to take over. I couldn't disagree more.\n\n\"I am convinced we have good players and he will love the idea of getting his hands on John Stones, Marcus Rashford, Dele Alli, Harry Kane, Eric Dier and Ross Barkley.\" - Wire Services.\n\nHe's very organised, so it will be a very organised team...

I felt I had to show Singapore what my true ability was,\" said Chadwick, who arrived in Singapore yesterday week, along with his wife and two-year-old daughter and was seen at the Kranji meeting the following night.\n\n\"I'm always looking to go somewhere during the past few off-seasons, and I've always wanted to come and ride here, but couldn't for various reasons, mostly because I always had things to do,\" he said.\n\n\"I went to UK in 2012 and won the Silver Saddle at the Shergar Cup. I was in the Rest Of The World Team with Yutaka Take and Aaron Gryder, finished second three times before winning the last race on Mince.\n\n\"I ended up staying longer there and eventually rode three winners from 20 rides, which was pretty good.\n\n\"But I felt this year was the right time to come to Singapore even if at first, I also had the Australian option, but the bonus is the nicer weather in Singapore.\"\n\nChadwick, who honed his craft in New South Wales, could have gone Down Under to return to his old school, but was glad he ticked the Singapore box.\n\n\"I know there are a lot more expat riders here now, but I relish the challenge. I'm here to try my best and hopefully I can make a fist of it,\" said Chadwick, who was at his first day of trackwork on Tuesday.\n\n\"I am thankful to the Singapore Turf Club for the chance they have given me. My philosophy is if you keep working hard, the results will come.\n\n\"I will be riding for some Hong Kong owners and also for the Lucky Stable. For a first week, I've been booked for five rides on Friday and four rides on Sunday, which is not too bad.\n\nFITNESS\n\n\"I don't know all the rides, but I know I've got a few for Leticia Dragon and two for Leslie Khoo (Sing Roulette and Man Of Power). It's quite a good start.\"\n\nChadwick, who can ride at around 51.5kg, is keen to get as much support as possible during his brief passage as, to him, his fitness can only improve with more rides.\n\n\"I need to get my fitness back, especially with the muscle in my right leg,\" said Chadwick, who also spent part of his childhood in Singapore, where his parents were stationed for a while.\n\n\"My right leg is already my weak leg as I was born with a dislocated patella and that is exactly where I hurt myself in a barrier accident.\n\n\"I had to go for major knee reconstruction which was quite complex as my doctors had to make sure they did not make the other muscle in my thigh worse.\n\n\"That's why I missed out most of the last season and only started riding back in February.\n\n\"It was hard to get back into it, especially with Joao Moreira and Zac Purton getting the pick of the rides, but luckily John Size put me on a winner and it's picked up since.\n\n\"It's only towards the end of the season in the last 10 meetings that I started to ride more winners, mainly for Tony Cruz. I did get a personal trainer to improve on my fitness as he can really pinpoint which area I need to work on, but I was still not 100% happy with my fitness, especially with the lack of muscle around my thigh, hamstring and quads.\n\n\"I was off so long, for almost half the season. It's taken me two months to get my fitness back and I didn't want to lose it even more during the break and that's why I wanted to keep riding.\n\n\"The next five weeks in Singapore will be all about keeping fit, both mentally and physically, and hopefully I can also ride a lot of winners.\"\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nFind the Best Fixed Deposit Rates\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e66377f314963577184d6c3847189d427a4064f8672244ba009c6837a6c2b693/np_20160722_chadwick22_1331083.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "RIGHT TIME: Hong Kong jockey Matthew Chadwick relishes the challenge against the top-quality expat riders at Kranji and the warmer weather is a bonus.

The restrictions had previously included the pit lane.\n\n- AFP.\n\nformula one\n\nNEW RULES\n\nradio\n\nhungarian grand prix\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 4, 2024, 02:02am\n\nHPL asks to halt trading ahead of Ong Beng Seng's court session\n\nOct 3, 2024, 11:31pm\n\nProperty tycoon Ong Beng Seng to be charged on Oct 4\n\nSep 20, 2024, 11:13am\n\nF1 rakes in big bucks but not everyone benefits from it\n\nSep 17, 2024, 07:10am\n\nLive screening of Singapore Grand Prix at 5 community hubs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThe Underrated Strategy That Keeps Your Investments on Track\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fbf0e71511ad779bd5449320ac0216011fea703a9f20744d83b34a86218646fc/file7yxn5uaybr61ipt2vur2.jpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Christian Ho crowned 2024 Eurocup-3 champion", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2f36cf6c81a2fa041f76dd1f524c6e700d509d8196801eef1d1b303ee33737a6/obs11120copy.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "HPL asks to halt trading ahead of Ong Beng Seng's court session", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

In 2014, he pledged allegiance to ISIS and earlier this year, the US placed him on a list of global terrorists.\n\n\"The group is obviously weakened now that we got the leader,\" national police chief Tito Karnavian told reporters, as he confirmed the militant's death.\n\nEXTREMISTS\n\nHe said the country's extremists had wanted to transform the Poso district, where Santoso and his followers were based, into a \"safe haven\" and a regional power base.\n\n\"With this group broken, the hope for a base there is gone,\" he added.\n\nAfter Indonesia suffered a string of extremist attacks in the early 2000s, including the 2002 Bali bombings which killed more than 200, the authorities launched a crackdown that weakened the most dangerous networks.\n\nBut Santoso's group remained a thorn in the side of the government, with the long-haired, gun-toting militant regularly appearing in videos urging extremists to launch attacks.\n\nThe picture has changed recently, with other cells now considered a greater threat - Santoso was not believed to have played a role in an ISIS-claimed attack in Jakarta in January that left four attackers and four civilians dead.\n\nSantoso also attracted militants from abroad, with several members of China's mostly Muslim Uighur minority travelling to Indonesia to join his group.\n\nUnfortunately, security experts believe Santoso's death would not undermine support for ISIS in Indonesia, Reuters reported.\n\nindonesia\n\nISIS\n\nattack\n\nSANTOSO\n\nOPERATION TINOMBALA\n\nPOSO\n\ngunfire\n\nhunt\n\nsecurity forces\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 05:17am\n\nSIA, Scoot flights from Changi Airport to Bali among dozens cancelled after Indonesia volcano eruption\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nMan to be charged for buying KrisFlyer accounts illegally to use air miles on purchases\n\nMar 8, 2025, 11:47pm\n\nIndonesian man allegedly flashes at air stewardess on Singapore-bound flight\n\nJan 25, 2025, 01:00am\n\nCPIB arrests businessman wanted in Indonesia for alleged corruption\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8d726e343d071177a9567c23c9b7aed57820c3598b9ef2b7ca7635c86ea3fad4/NP_20160720_DEAD20_1329504.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "VIOLENT END: (Above) Santoso (head covered), who was shot dead, with his confidant Basri.

The appointment of Jose Mourinho is a fantastic appointment.\n\n\"We are all as a group of players excited by it and the signings that we have made have been fantastic.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can have a good start to the season and be successful at the end of it.\"\n\nUnited get their campaign underway at Bournemouth on Aug 14, by which point Rooney's role within Mourinho's new-look team should have become clearer.\n\nHow best to utilise the 30-year-old is a question made all the more intriguing by the United boss saying he has no intention of playing the skipper in a deeper midfield role like predecessor van Gaal or former England manager Roy Hodgson.\n\nThe summer acquisitions of Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan have increased the competition for places in attack and Rooney knows how many eyes will be on him.\n\n\"You always feel pressure when you play for Manchester United,\" the captain said.\n\n\"It's one of, if not the, biggest football club in the world and it is a pleasure to have played for them for them for so long.\n\n\"Always you feel like you've got to prove yourself each season and it's a joy to play for them so, of course, there's pressure, there's pressure to be successful.\"\n\nRooney's first media appearance since England's embarrassing Euro 2016 exit to Iceland came during a peculiar and wide-ranging press conference with United's global partner Gulf Oil International.\n\nIt was taken in good humour, though, as was a question about how the captain was finding it working under former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss Mourinho.\n\n\"Well, I've had only one day before we come out,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"But it was a very good day, a good training session.\n\n\"But you have to look at the teams he has been at before and the success he has brought to those teams, which we're hoping and we believe that he can bring that success to us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Man United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has not travelled for United's clash against Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai tomorrow amid reports that a world-record offer for Pogba has been rejected.\n\nNO UNITED START\n\nThe 23-year-old departed Old Trafford four years ago having failed to make a single first-team start, racking up a mere seven appearances in all competitions.\n\nPogba subsequently flourished and has transformed into one of the world's best midfielders, shining during a medal-laden period with Serie A champions Juventus.\n\nNow, though, a return to United could be on the cards and the Guardian reports a transfer package worth £100 million ($178m) has been turned down by the Turin giants.\n\nThe newspaper says Juventus want a basic £100m plus £8m add-ons for a player who is also attracting interest from Real Madrid, with head coach Zinedine Zidane an admirer of the midfielder.\n\nHowever, United are the bookmakers' favourites to sign Pogba and Woodward was conspicuous by his absence when the team landed in Shanghai yesterday.\n\nWoodward is hoping to add Pogba to the summer arrivals of Bailly, Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan, the last two are clients of Pogba's agent Mino Raiola.\n\nReports in Italy suggest the player has told Juventus he wants to leave, having last week publicly stated his happiness at the club.\n\nIt is understood Woodward could head to China for the second friendly against Manchester City in Beijing on Monday.\n\n-

However, when the two teams last met in May 2015, Hull held on to a 0-0 draw.\n\nWorth noting that last season, the Red Devils won just seven of 19 when playing away and EVEN seemed to be the call in Man United matches.

What a day! The traffic was difficult to navigate, but it was an amazing race. A special thank you to the fans - you make this such a great event.\"\n\nThe Briton took the chequered flag less than two seconds ahead of the German, who had lined up on pole position at the Hungaroring but lost out to Hamilton at the start in the key moment of the race.\n\nHamilton now leads Rosberg by six points after 11 of the season's 21 races. The Briton has won five of the last six races, including the last three.\n\nOVERTAKING SCHUMI\n\nUntil yesterday, he had shared the record for Hungary GP wins with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher.\n\n\"I grew up watching Michael, so to have a similar number, and now one more than he had here, is incredible,\" said Hamilton.\n\nAustralian Daniel Ricciardo finished third for Red Bull after pushing the Mercedes pair hard enough at one point for the champions to tell Hamilton to pick up the pace.\n\nFerrari's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, also a previous winner in Hungary, finished fourth after sounding off over the team radio about slower cars holding him up as he lapped them.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen held off Ferrari's feisty Kimi Raikkonen for fifth. The Finn had started 14th but a long first stint saw him challenging the Dutchman.\n\nThe battle between the pair provided a moment of excitement in an otherwise uneventful race, with Raikkonen clipping the back of Verstappen's car and damaging his front wing in an attempt to pass the 18-year-old.\n\nFernando Alonso was the sole-surviving McLaren in seventh.\n\nMcLaren's hopes of a strong result on the back of their best qualifying performance since renewing their engine partnership with Honda were dashed early on, with Jenson Button falling down the order with hydraulics problems.\n\nThe 2009 world champion also collected a drive-through penalty for a breach of radio rules before finally retiring late in the race.\n\nRosberg, who has also won five races this year, will have the chance to seize back the lead in his home German Grand Prix.\n\nHOCKENHEIM NEXT\n\nThe race at Hockenheim, absent from last year's calendar, takes place this weekend.\n\n\"It was all down to the start in the end,\" said Rosberg, of yesterday's race.\n\n\"From then on, I was trying to put all the pressure on Lewis but it's not possible to pass at this track.\n\n\"To have the next race coming up very quickly sounds good, at my home race... it's going to be awesome.\" - Reuters.\n\nHUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX (Top 5)\n\n1.

But one lapse saw them failing to make the final, losing 1-0 to Hong Kah Secondary School.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\nDefending champions Hong Kah found just one crack in Siglap's defence and, from that, they poached the winning goal.\n\nHong Kah's Shahrulnizam Mazlan capitalised on the only big chance.\n\nHe sped past the centre backs and beat goalkeeper Yeo Wen Bin for the killer goal in the 65th minute.\n\nSiglap were stunned, but they refused to lie down.\n\nThey kept the pressure up and had a chance to take the game into extra-time but were denied by a goal-line save by Hong Kah skipper Muhammad Nurdanial.\n\nSaid Nurdanial: \"I knew that he was going to for the far post and, thankfully, I managed to get there in time.\"\n\nSiglap were crestfallen. But their head coach Fabio Fantecelle, 42, tried to lift their spirits.\n\n\"It's very heartening to see my boys give of their best and come so far in the tournament,\" he said. \"My boys worked really hard today, and played well against an experienced and strong side like Hong Kah.\"\n\nIn an earlier match, Tanjong Katong beat St Gabriel's Secondary 4-1 to secure their spot in the final.\n\nTanjong Katong's Muhammad Syafiq scored the opener in the second minute and found the net again in the 23rd while Banbury Lee got the third eight minutes from the break after a diagonal cross left the opposing goalkeeper rooted.\n\nHaiqal Assyiddiq went on to seal the deal with a fourth in the 45th minute before St Gabriel's grabbed a consolation goal six minutes later.\n\nThe final wll be played at the Jalan Besar Stadium at 4.40pm on Wednesday.\n\nSt Gabriel's face Siglap for the third-placed play-off at 3pm.\n\nBy\n\nHaresh Kumar Ramani\n\nRead articles by Haresh Kumar Ramani\n\nsport\n\nSCHOOLS SPORTS\n\nSiglap\n\nTANJONG KATONG SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nST GABRIEL SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nHONGKAH SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6964493b20a4d4b56a82b3c4800c6e5661716dfc0dc83fc18404b333204dc917/NP_20160723_HKSOC23_1333081.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "ON TO THE FINAL: Shahrulnizam Mazlan (left) celebrating with teammate Mohammad Nizam after scoring the only goal for Hong Kah Secondary School to send them to the National Schools' B Division final.  ", "caption": "ON TO THE FINAL: Shahrulnizam Mazlan (left) celebrating with teammate Mohammad Nizam after scoring the only goal for Hong Kah Secondary School to send them to the National Schools' B Division final."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It does not cause stomach bloating or discomfort.\n\nThis is an important factor that ensures I drink sufficiently and comfortably.\n\nIt also contains carbohydrates to refuel my working muscles and helps promote muscle recovery, which is critical in a marathon.\n\nIt keeps me hydrated and gives me something to look forward to when the going gets tough.\n\nTrain hard and drink smart as you plan to race!\n\nSingapore national marathoner Soh Rui Yong was talking to Sazali Abdul Aziz.\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nsport\n\nSoh Rui Yong\n\nMarathon\n\nH-TWO-O\n\nRUN\n\nHYDRATE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/15572552d9348789e05c0585473a8de6bf72be15500a2f1a38fad5edc0a46909/NP_20160721_SZSOH21_1330309.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "DRINK UP: Marathoner Soh Rui Yong (left) drinks H-TWO-O for his long runs. ", "caption": "DRINK UP: Marathoner Soh Rui Yong (left) drinks H-TWO-O for his long runs."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The appointment of Jose Mourinho is a fantastic appointment.\n\n\"We are all as a group of players excited by it and the signings that we have made have been fantastic.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can have a good start to the season and be successful at the end of it.\"\n\nUnited get their campaign underway at Bournemouth on Aug 14, by which point Rooney's role within Mourinho's new-look team should have become clearer.\n\nHow best to utilise the 30-year-old is a question made all the more intriguing by the United boss saying he has no intention of playing the skipper in a deeper midfield role like predecessor van Gaal or former England manager Roy Hodgson.\n\nThe summer acquisitions of Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan have increased the competition for places in attack and Rooney knows how many eyes will be on him.\n\n\"You always feel pressure when you play for Manchester United,\" the captain said.\n\n\"It's one of, if not the, biggest football club in the world and it is a pleasure to have played for them for them for so long.\n\n\"Always you feel like you've got to prove yourself each season and it's a joy to play for them so, of course, there's pressure, there's pressure to be successful.\"\n\nRooney's first media appearance since England's embarrassing Euro 2016 exit to Iceland came during a peculiar and wide-ranging press conference with United's global partner Gulf Oil International.\n\nIt was taken in good humour, though, as was a question about how the captain was finding it working under former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss Mourinho.\n\n\"Well, I've had only one day before we come out,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"But it was a very good day, a good training session.\n\n\"But you have to look at the teams he has been at before and the success he has brought to those teams, which we're hoping and we believe that he can bring that success to us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Man United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has not travelled for United's clash against Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai tomorrow amid reports that a world-record offer for Pogba has been rejected.\n\nNO UNITED START\n\nThe 23-year-old departed Old Trafford four years ago having failed to make a single first-team start, racking up a mere seven appearances in all competitions.\n\nPogba subsequently flourished and has transformed into one of the world's best midfielders, shining during a medal-laden period with Serie A champions Juventus.\n\nNow, though, a return to United could be on the cards and the Guardian reports a transfer package worth £100 million ($178m) has been turned down by the Turin giants.\n\nThe newspaper says Juventus want a basic £100m plus £8m add-ons for a player who is also attracting interest from Real Madrid, with head coach Zinedine Zidane an admirer of the midfielder.\n\nHowever, United are the bookmakers' favourites to sign Pogba and Woodward was conspicuous by his absence when the team landed in Shanghai yesterday.\n\nWoodward is hoping to add Pogba to the summer arrivals of Bailly, Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan, the last two are clients of Pogba's agent Mino Raiola.\n\nReports in Italy suggest the player has told Juventus he wants to leave, having last week publicly stated his happiness at the club.\n\nIt is understood Woodward could head to China for the second friendly against Manchester City in Beijing on Monday.\n\n-

These shareholders will have to hold at least 75 per cent of the value of SMRT shares held by all shareholders present at the meeting.\n\nSingapore\n\nsmrt\n\nBusiness\n\nTEMASEK HOLDINGS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nTrendingResults\n\nWhat’s my car worth?

Among these, the capacity for destruction rather than creation knows no bounds.\n\nIt could have been so different, had man worked together to erase the ills of the world much earlier.\n\nI feel the 1970s was when the negativity set in, with many looking inwards to satisfy one's own selfish desires.\n\nThis is where the seeds of discontent were sown.\n\nThe deadly sin of greed took on frightening proportions.\n\nIt is a pity, as we had a chance to start over and not repeat the same mistakes after the two World Wars.\n\nBut we have learnt little, it would seem.\n\nAnd this is being taken advantage of by those who serve their own lust for wealth, power or glory.\n\nIt is clear that it is not some unseen hand at work, or evil prophecy of impending doom, but rather our own actions that have brought us to this point.\n\nSingapore\n\npolitics\n\nterrorism\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\n12\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\n5\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\n1\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\n4\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nTrendingResults\n\nWhat’s my car worth?

The pictures have been circulating online and have enraged environmentalists.\n\nConservation research group Danau Girang Field Centre director Benoît Goossens, who posted on its Facebook page, said it was incomprehensible to think that such an act was allowed to be carried out there, Malay Mail Online reported.\n\nThe photos were supposedly taken on July 16, reports said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 4, 2024, 09:00pm\n\nSurvivors of 2015 Sabah quake want to summit Mt Kinabalu\n\nMore related stories\n\nAsked if state authorities were aware of the killing, Mr Masidi said: \"What difference does it make when there is no law against it?\n\n\"The photos speaks volumes of what I and many other Sabahans have been advocating for the last five years.\"\n\nHe added that he had given his thoughts on the problems many times in the past.\n\nCRAZY\n\nDr Goossens said: \"The massacre has to stop. It is crazy to think that it is happening a few miles from the best diving spots where divers go to see sharks.\n\n\"I think Sabah should make a stand and put sharks under special protection in Sabah's waters and enforce it.\n\n\"Sharks attract divers from all over the world to Sabah, it is a huge tourism industry bringing millions to the state. Sabah needs to get its own law, ban shark killing and finning, and enforce the law in its waters.\"\n\nFollowing reports of an 80 per cent decline of sharks in its waters, the state has been pushing for the federal government to ban shark hunting and finning by amending its Fisheries Act.\n\nBut its three-year proposal was dismissed, claiming that shark hunting was not a huge business in the state.\n\nThe Sabah Shark Protection Association said a law banning shark hunting was just as important as having sanctuaries, The Star reported.\n\nIts chairman Aderick Chong added that without such laws, shark hunting would continue.\n\nMalaysia is currently the world's ninth-largest shark producer.\n\nConservation organisation Traffic reported that more than 231 tonnes of sharks were caught in Malaysia between 2002 and 2011, accounting for 2.9 per cent of the total globally-reported shark catch.\n\nFisheries statistics also showed a decreasing amount of sharks being caught each year since 2003, indicating a decline in its population.\n\nMr Masidi has since said that the state will enforce its own shark sanctuary through its marine parks soon.\n\nThe Tun Sakaran marine park in Semporna, Tunku Abdul Rahman marine park fronting the state capital and the proposed Tun Mustapha marine park in Kudat would be declared shark sanctuaries.\n\nThe three parks total about 2 million hectares and is home to about 80 per cent of the state's shark population.\n\nThe Tun Mustapha marine park is set to be launched on Sunday.\n\nsabah\n\nsea\n\nFISH DEATHS\n\nSHARK FINNING\n\nMabul\n\nDIVING SPOTS\n\nTourism\n\nhunting\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 17, 2023, 10:16am\n\n8 people fall for Sabah tour package scam, losing thousands\n\nFeb 21, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nJoie spurred on by tragedy\n\nFeb 6, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nBoat owner pleads not guilty to sinking incident in Sabah\n\nJan 31, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nSurvivors huddled to stay alive in cold waters\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a58ae66eecaafbd8623b4ce9a8d0331e72eb4844a1e923441905531781f56fd8/NP_20160720_SHARK20_1329599.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "HUNTED: More than 231 tonnes of sharks were caught in Malaysia between 2002 and 2011.", "caption": "HUNTED: More than 231 tonnes of sharks were caught in Malaysia between 2002 and 2011."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/717d4112d94e39f3189babf54019355824edc12c33428734c231b3b6a34bb33b/screenshot_2024-08-04_at_1.13.52_pm.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Survivors of 2015 Sabah quake want to summit Mt Kinabalu", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f006a6f23eb8940f262f36522197346b5fb82d98e6a2dd3a8380402ae1628f7f/travelscam.jpeg?w=318", "alt_text": "8 people fall for Sabah tour package scam, losing thousands", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It's the PGA in a week's time (at Baltusrol) and then the Olympics.

It was great to get that win there.\"\n\nHis success on the fairways of Troon was a far cry from the time four years ago when Stenson had slumped to 230th in the world rankings.\n\nAdd in the loss of millions of dollars in disgraced financier Allen Stanford's Ponzi scheme in 2009, as well as some serious health problems - including one caused by a parasite picked up on holiday - and Stenson's recovery is all the more remarkable.\n\n\"The second slump in my career was nothing compared to the one I had in the early 2000s,\" he added.\n\n\"I managed to put my game together with a lot of hard work and a lot of help from my team and support from my family, friends and everyone else.\n\n\"If I didn't believe, I wouldn't be sitting here.

Following victory at the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, the glorious spell was broken by poor results at Brazil 2014 and Euro 2016. Del Bosque decided to step down after Spain's exit from the Euros but, prior to officially leaving his post, the manager met with Fifa.com to give his verdict on his time in charge of the European giants.\n\nShare this article\n\nNow that your eight-year spell as Spain coach has drawn to a close, what's your verdict on your time in charge?\n\nDEL BOSQUE:\n\nThere's been a bit of everything. We've had the opportunity to win a lot of things, but we've also suffered defeats. That's sport.\n\nBut I leave with a clear conscience and the feeling of having fulfilled my duty to Spanish football.\n\nDo you have any regrets?\n\nNo, to be honest, I don't. I'm not saying that I'm leaving having completed every task I was set, because we knew that was impossible.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\nTo have won another World Cup and another Euro would have been virtually impossible. I go with a feeling of not leaving any loose ends.\n\nWe were able to continue the great work we inherited from Luis Aragones in 2008, and the national squad we leave behind is one that can and should be viewed with optimism.\n\nYou have always shown a lot of gratitude for the job that Aragones did. Can you explain to us what you inherited from him and what legacy you leave for your successor?\n\nWe inherited a style of play and a pathway that was laid out. But, after that, each coach has to guide the team in his own way, depending on his background, character and personality.\n\nNo two coaches are the same but, at that moment in time, in 2008, the path was very well laid out for us.\n\nNow, too, I think the team are moving in the right direction, with the proviso that whoever comes in will need to bring in those players that merit inclusion, just as we did.\n\nIt must have been a privilege to be Spain head coach, given the generation of footballers at your disposal, but what was the main downside of the job?\n\nIt's when you have to make decisions trying to pick the best (players) and you might not get it right, because the margins involved are so tight.\n\nSo, yes, I'd include that in the negative box, that sometimes when choosing players we might have wronged some of them, though not through any sense of malice at all.\n\nWhen it comes to assembling any successful team, the players' talent and the coach's guidance go hand-in-hand. Percentage-wise, how much influence would you attribute to each of these two factors?\n\nThe main thing is to have good \"raw material\" at your disposal and then comes the coach's good judgment and sense of balance.\n\nThere are two areas where a coach needs to have an impact. (Firstly), when the squad are together, he should be a good leader and foster a friendly atmosphere within the group.\n\nAnd, secondly, he should provide the tools to help them become a great \"team\" in every sense of the word.\n\nSpain achieved success playing with a very characteristic style but, after what happened at Brazil 2014 and Euro 2016, this has come up for debate. Should this style be non-negotiable, as Xavi Hernandez often says?\n\nThat's a decision for the new coach and I don't think I should have any say at all.\n\nI'm keeping out of it. Whoever comes in will decide and will get it right.\n\nDo you have any advice for your successor?\n\nNo, no, no, not at all. Each one of us sees football in a different way and what seems right to me might not be shared by the next in charge.\n\nThe next coach must be given absolute freedom to shape things as he sees fit.\n\nI don't feel persecuted, that would be unfair. There is a group who want Spain to lose. They're the minority, because the rest are fantastic. But they're waiting for the smallest thing, to cut off your head. Now that Spain aren't winning, they appear more frequently. Fortunately, they are very few.\n\n- Outgoing Spain coach Vicente del Bosque, on the criticism he has received\n\nsport\n\nFootball\n\nEuro\n\nSpain\n\nDEL BOSQUE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cd971acb242f9e17c6d435465fa5bb08655c16ecde116ab451a51a10de788051/NP_20160720_DEL20_1329463.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Vicente del Bosque.", "caption": "Vicente del Bosque."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Women fighters will still wear them.\n\nMost in the fight game support the ditching of headwear, after the Aiba said extensive studies found that there were actually fewer concussions without headguards.\n\nCritics say there are likely to be more cuts as a result and, with so many fights packed into a fortnight, competitors will have little time for those wounds to heal between bouts.\n\nThat means there could be plenty of blood. And that is not all.\n\nThe deeply unpopular punch-counting system of scoring - which has thrown up numerous controversies over the years - has also been ditched to again bring Olympic boxing closer in line with professional bouts.\n\n10-POINT MUST SYSTEM\n\nNow ringside judges will use the \"10-point must system\", with the fighter that wins the round getting 10 points and the other between six and nine. For example, a 10-9 round means that it was close.\n\nThe United States, Cuba and Britain are the most successful countries and some of the world's finest boxers launched their careers at the Olympics.\n\nA certain Cassius Clay - later to call himself Muhammad Ali - won gold at the Rome Olympics in 1960.\n\nOther notable Olympic boxers who went on to stardom include Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Sugar Ray Leonard, Evander Holyfield, Oscar de la Hoya, Lennox Lewis and Floyd Mayweather.\n\nThe latest is Anthony Joshua, Britain's heavyweight champion from 2012, who is unbeaten as a pro and ploughing his way through the division.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of fighters who were brilliant Olympians but flopped as pros - think the widely ridiculed Audley \"A-Force\" Harrison, Britain's 2000 gold medallist.\n\nOlympic boxing will span almost the entire two weeks in Rio and 13 categories, with three weight classes for women and 10 for men.\n\nIt is just the second time in Olympic history that women will take part.\n\nSince its inclusion in the Olympic programme in 1904, boxing has been staged at every edition of the Games, except in 1912 in Stockholm because Swedish law did not allow the sport. - AFP.\n\nsport\n\nRio Olympics\n\nboxing\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nUNIQLO\n\nNew diverse jeans everyone’s wearing, from slim to wide fits\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/11b87230345ab526e88524baec8d00204ce1bf1e01a761e5bcc2656b772f0061/NP_20160720_BOX20A_1329401.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "RIO BOUND: Joe Joyce (above) will represent Britain in the ­super-heavyweight division at the Olympics next month.", "caption": "RIO BOUND: Joe Joyce (above) will represent Britain in the ­super-heavyweight division at the Olympics next month."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

That's probably why it's disappointing in that I don't have a point where I can look back and say, I should have done that or had I only done this,\" Mickelson admitted.\n\n\"I played a bogey-free round of 65 on the final round of a Major, usually that's good enough to do it and I got beat.\"\n\nMickelson's round featured four birdies as well as an eagle at the par-five fourth hole. It was a fourth consecutive under-par effort for him in often challenging conditions on Scotland's west coast.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTiger Woods moots part-time return\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe had started with a 63 to equal the lowest ever round in a Major, but Stenson repeated that feat on Sunday with 10 birdies on his way to lifting the Claret Jug.\n\n\"It's disappointing to come in second, but I'm happy for Henrik,\" Mickelson said.\n\n\"We've been friends for some time. I've always thought that he is one of the best ball-strikers in the game and that Major championships are perfectly suited for him.\n\n\"I knew that he would ultimately come through and win. I'm happy that he did. I'm disappointed that it was at my expense.\"\n\nCATCHING THE LIP\n\nMickelson had started the day one shot behind Stenson, but a birdie at the first combined with a bogey by his opponent saw the two swop places.\n\nStenson recovered from that, but the two were neck and neck before the Swede birdied the short 14th.\n\nHe then produced a stunning putt for another birdie at 15 and, at the long 16th, Mickelson saw an eagle putt stop dead on the edge of the hole.\n\n\"I really thought that was going to go in,\" he said.\n\n\"But it seems there have been a couple of putts like that this week.

who will now both be invested in expanding playing opportunities in Asia and the rest of the globe.\n\nThe two Tours will have a new joint office in Singapore, but will retain their own separate identity in terms of brand and logo, and will be managed by their own individual boards.\n\n\"Following successful discussions over the past year to develop our joint vision, we are delighted to announce this 'Strategic Alliance',\" Keith Pelley, chief executive of the European Tour, said.\n\n\"We have enjoyed a very strong and prosperous relationship with the Asian Tour over the past 17 years, and this formalises that partnership, representing an exciting new era in our association.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTiger Woods moots part-time return\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Malaysian Open in 1999 was the first co-sanctioned Tour between the two organisations, which have since conducted 95 such tournaments.\n\nPLAYER CONCERNS\n\nTalks on the expected union appeared to be in trouble in December when Asian Tour chief executive Mike Kerr resigned for unspecified reasons, following player concerns about limited opportunities on the combined circuit.\n\nIn December, after Kerr's departure, the old Asian Tour board of directors, including former European Tour chief Ken Schofield, was ousted.\n\nFour Asian businessmen were voted in as non-playing directors, three board player members were also removed and Kyi Hla Han was promoted from chairman to \"interim Tour Commissioner\".\n\nLast year's Asian Tour featured only 12 stand-alone events with many more co-sanctioned with larger circuits such as the European, US PGA and Japan Tours, who all boast fuller schedules and bigger prize money.\n\n\"This is a positive step forward in our desire to further grow professional golf in Asia and around the world,\" Han said.\n\n\"We are also confident a greater collaboration between the Asian Tour and European Tour will deliver a stronger product to our partners and appeal to new sponsors to get involved with the game.\n\n\"The future looks very exciting for the Asian Tour and European Tour.\"\n\n- Reuters.\n\nGolf\n\nAsian Tour\n\nEuropean

There were photos showing some of them stripped to their underpants and handcuffed on the floors of police buses and a sports hall.\n\nSeveral thousand prosecutors and judges have also been

was underway to purge the civil service.\n\nTurkey blames the failed coup on Fethullah Gulen, a cleric based in the US, who has a wide following in Turkey but denies any involvement.\n\nAnkara has demanded Washington hand him over.\n\nWashington says it is prepared to extradite him but only if Turkey provides evidence linking him to crime.\n\nREJECTED\n\nPM Yildirim rejected that demand.\n\n\"We would be disappointed if our friends told us to present proof even though members of the assassin organisation are trying to destroy an elected government under the directions of that person,\" he said.\n\n\"At this stage, there could even be a questioning of our friendship.\"\n\nMr Yildirim said 232 people were killed in Friday night's violence, 208 of them civilians, police and

So that thing, you know, it's not part of me.\"\n\nSemenya's full health records have never been made public, but her case triggered a debate in sport over hyperandrogenism, a condition involving overproduction of male sex hormones.\n\nLast year, regulations were suspended that required women athletes to take testosterone-lowering medication if their levels were above a legal mark.\n\nThe ruling ended much of the uncertainty over Semenya's right to run, even if some of her competitors still feel she holds an unfair natural advantage.\n\nSemenya has put in some startling track times in recent months.\n\nShe scored a golden hat-trick at the African championships, winning the 1,500m and 800m titles and anchoring the 4x400m relay to first place.\n\nIn April, she became the first person to take triple gold in the 400m, 800m and 1,500m races - all in a single day at the South African national championships in Stellenbosch.\n\nSemenya had also run the fastest 800m times in the world this year, posting 1min 56.64sec twice, in Rome and Rabat, before clocking 1:55.33 at Monaco's Diamond League last Friday.\n\n\"She's a clear favourite for an Olympic gold medal,\" said Hezekiel Sepeng, athletics manager with Athletics South Africa.\n\nINSPIRATION\n\nSemenya said she drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela, who stood by her during the 2009 scandal, when she endured what she described as \"invasive scrutiny of the most intimate and private details of my being\".\n\nAhead of the Olympics, IAAF president Sebastian Coe has already rallied to her defence.\n\n\"I don't like to see any athlete in any discipline under sensitive situations being demonised, we are talking about human beings here,\" he said.\n\nSemenya was born in the poor northern village of Ga-Masehlong and is a sports science student at North-West University in Potchefstroom.\n\nShe married her long-time partner Violet Raseboya in December last year.\n\n\"It feels good to be back on track. I've been through a lot,\" she told the Sunday Times in a rare interview given in April.\n\n\"Now I'm back with a bang... The main target is to go to Rio and win a gold medal.\" - AFP.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n1:55.33\n\nCaster Semenya set a new personal best of 1min 55.33sec in the women's 800m at Monaco's Diamond League meet last Friday. It is also the best time this year. The world record is 1:53.28, set by Czech Jarmila Kratochvílova in 1983.\n\nsport\n\nOlympics\n\nathletics\n\nSEMENYA\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSalary Insights in Singapore - Where Do You Stand?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b525bc52a0671850419c2a65a3fccb4b539b1fb2476e94fd37f71af24184859b/NP_20160718_SEM18_1327340.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It wasn't that big. It wasn't like a 20-inch, 'Win a T-shirt' if you finish it type of thing. It wasn't anything like that.\"\n\nJohnston, who is ranked at a career-high of 104 in the world, also explained the origin of a nickname that has stuck since the age of 12.\n\n\"From my hair on my head. I grow it out it grows curly,\" he added.\n\n\"And my mate just went, 'Look at your hair. It's like a big bit of beef,' and called me a \"Beefhead\". That was it. It's been shortened to beef.\"\n\nJohnston, from Barnet in London, plays the card game Top Trumps with his five-year-old niece Summer before competing to help him relax.\n\nOn his Twitter feed @BeefGolf, he posted a video of her on Friday night calling his beard \"lumpy\".\n\nWith the chance of a first top-10 Major finish, the familiar routine would probably have been be in order again on Saturday night.\n\n\"Maybe, yeah. It could be game time again,\" Johnston said, after the end of his third round.\n\n\"I read her a few books last night before I went to bed. I think she was up a bit later than me. So we'll see. We'll see.\"\n\nSince Tiger Woods burst onto the scene in the 1990s, golf has seen players focus far more on fitness and strength than before, but Johnston's rise suggests that is not the only way to be successful.\n\n\"I have no idea, you want to pick me up?\", he quipped, after being asked how much he weighs.\n\n\"I don't know, man. About 16 stone (100kg), I reckon. I don't know. I need to start (to) shed a stone.\"\n\nFans have flocked to social media to express their support for Johnston, with some users pointing out the facial similarity in appearance to the character 'Taaj' from British sitcom, \"Come Fly With Me\".\n\nOne tweet claimed Johnston is \"the greatest thing to happen to golf\", while another said: \"can the media finally stop hyping Mcilroy as the one to watch. Beeeeeffffff!\"\n\nAs unlikely as it sounds right now, for the man who said that he couldn't \"wait to get hammered\" after his maiden European Tour title in Spain earlier this year, a Claret Jug could cause quite some celebration. - AFP.\n\nsport\n\nGolf\n\nANDREW JOHNSON\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/80f09287d2c6e495e0ae25d6d4834d27c998998d6ca611c9bf64241591532b6a/NP_20160718_BEEF18_1327390.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CULT FIGURE: Fans have flocked to social media to express their support for Andrew Johnson (above).", "caption": "CULT FIGURE: Fans have flocked to social media to express their support for Andrew Johnson (above)."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

In the conditions I've faced this week I felt like I handled them pretty well,\" said Northern Irishman, McIlroy.\n\n\"I leave with my head held high and go on to Baltusrol.\"\n\nThe final Major the year, the US PGA Championship, will be held at Baltusrol in New Jersey beginning on July 28, an earlier start than usual because of the Rio Olympics.\n\nTwo of McIlroy's four Major wins have come at the PGA, in 2012 at Kiawah Island and at Valhalla in 2014.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nGolf\n\nsport\n\nbritish open\n\nHenrik Stenson\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 22, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nWoods shows 'progress' after car crash\n\nOct 24, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nMatsuyama thrilled after win in Japan\n\nOct 11, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSouth Korean golfer Ko Jin-young breaks Tiger Woods' bogey-free record\n\nOct 5, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAsian Tour resumes next month, S'pore to host two events\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d8c766c215bb26eeb160c88f165f234d679b8a9d560dd1c7d989c5dad01c6413/NP_20160718_STENSON_1327560.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

We know what Chris is capable of, and the last two years, losing him after the All-Star break both years in a row, you just never know what you have or what you could have done, from that standpoint, as a team.\"\n\nRiley said he hasn't spoken with Wade since he decided to leave the Heat.\n\nRiley has been working on an e-mail to send Wade at some point, and he expects that when they see each other again, a warm embrace will be involved. - AFP.\n\nBasketball\n\nNBA\n\nDwyane Wade\n\nPAT RILEY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 8, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nLeBron stars as Lakers beat Celtics\n\nDec 1, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSuns beat Warriors for 17th straight win\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nJokic's return sees Nuggets end losing run\n\nNov 29, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nCurry stars ahead of clash with Suns\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d2ffc07d76f3cf36a8b70f7433f6db3ecc123cd26de05283ba33d603c5cdc512/NP_20160718_RILEY18_1327389.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/603f938bbd80a8b6db42dd542d4a675ac0f3942bb10545b165453e1b5cb9f626/mi_pioneerjc_220222.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "After cardiac arrest, Jurong Pioneer JC basketballer Xu bounces back for A-levels", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

So, it's incredible that Chelsea finished 10th in the table.\n\n\"When you have great players with great talent like Hazard in the team, the expectations are very high.\n\n\"Also, when the season before you have won the title and Hazard was named the Best Player in the league.\n\n\"It's important for us to recover Hazard in the best condition: technique, tactical, physical, overall and with the good mentality.\"\n\n- PA Sport.\n\nepl\n\nchelsea\n\nAntonio Conte\n\nenglish premier league\n\neden hazard\n\nLionel messi\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBuilding Wealth at Every Age: Essential Strategies for Your 20s, 30s, 40s & Beyond\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/86f2dac18b8c407449c8cd1e23e4c0b9ce019cbf40161fddc7098ae7f8015fb3/2025-07-03T123529Z135787455RC20FFALWMCVRTRMADP3SOCCER-LIVERPOOL-PORTUGAL-DIOGO-JOTA.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d6944355322b7c2193bdfbc371774a98b2dd368649ad11fe1aba3f6feb8994ea/file80c61lb8a2pi3ykpuc9.jpg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Tickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It's easy to blame the man in possession - often Wayne Rooney - but there weren't passing options for him to knock the ball into.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"There's an overhead camera and I think it would be pretty damning for that game. That was the most disappointing thing for me to see.\n\n\"That's the thing about Sam - he's always made the best use of the players available.\"\n\nThis is the second time the FA have come calling for Allardyce, after he was also in the running to take over from Sven-Goran Eriksson in 2006, losing out to Steve McClaren.\n\nTen years on and having saved Sunderland from relegation, the 61-year-old is odds-on favourite to finally land his dream job.\n\n\"He got West Ham back into the top flight and made Sunderland stronger mentally and defensively,\" said Brooking.\n\n\"Combine that with the technical ability of these England players and I think you have a decent mix.

He was lying third on six under.\n\nWorld No. 1 Jason Day was once again left to lament his struggles on the back nine at Royal Troon.\n\nThe Australian had come to Scotland as one the favourites but has never really got himself into contention.\n\nYesterday, a level-par round of 71 left him stuck at one over for the championship and effectively ended any hopes he had of contending for the Claret Jug today. And yet Day had started superbly, with four birdies and no dropped shots on the front nine.\n\nBut his back nine could not have contrasted more starkly, with no birdies and four bogeys including one at the last.\n\nSTRUGGLE\n\nTwice Major winner Jordan Spieth suggested the critics were being \"unfair\" to him and urged everyone to be less negative about his performances after returning a one-over 72.\n\nThe young American enjoyed a remarkable season last year, landing the US Masters and US Open crowns as he surged to the top of the world rankings.\n\nThe golfing gods have not been so kind to Spieth this year, though he did win the Tournament of Champions in Hawaii in January and the Colonial Invitational in his native Texas in May.\n\nThe 22-year-old suffered a late meltdown at the Masters in April, squandering a five-shot lead over the closing nine holes.\n\n\"It's been tough given I think it's been a solid year and I think had last year not happened I'd be having a lot of positive questions,\" Spieth said after finishing with a five-over tally of 218.\n\nThailand's veteran Thongchai Jaidee moved up 31 spots to 27th after shooting a two-under 69 for a 214 total.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nbritish open\n\nPhil Mickelson\n\nHenrik Stenson\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 18, 2016, 10:01pm\n\n'I couldn't do much more'\n\nJul 18, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nStenson's major taste\n\nJul 17, 2016, 10:01pm\n\nMagnificent Stenson\n\nJul 16, 2016, 10:01pm\n\nAn's aim\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBest High-Interest Savings Accounts in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/59bf380d718684e78b6429ccfda4e17ccc32b1a395c98c5009e6dbcfcd980693/NP_20160717_OPEN17_1327024.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Phil Mickelson.", "caption": "Phil Mickelson."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/385c4f95a65279730b8507e66f5385ca29f65d492b5dd6845ed06fe8d4dd932f/NP_20160719_STENSON19_1328405.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "A Swede major", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4b3794a60f6abd130b072360778f03e094b135580fa3f5ec259812c60f78536c/NP_20160719_PHIL19_1328240.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "'I couldn't do much more'", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He may be distracted by his surroundings and lose his focus. When I see him, I’d like to tell him to keep his emotions in check.\" - Ahn Jae Hyung on what he will tell his son Byeong Hun (above) ahead of the Olympics\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJul 16, 2016, 10:01pm\n\nAn's aim\n\nSouth Korean golfer hopes to emulate parents' feat at Seoul Olympics\n\nShare this article\n\nSouth Korean golfer An Byeong Hun is hoping he can win an Olympic medal on the sport's return to the Games next month and emulate what his parents managed in table tennis.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who first gave notice of his talent by becoming the youngest golfer to win the US amateur title in 2009, says achieving that goal will not be easy despite so many top players missing from the field in Rio de Janerio, Brazil.\n\nAmong those giving the Games a miss, which has placed the sport's future at the quadrennial sporting extravaganza in peril, are the top four in the world - Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy.\n\nAn, speaking after he made the cut at two under at the British Open at Royal Troon on Friday, said he will push to the back of his mind what his paddler parents achieved at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.\n\nHis father Ahn Jae Hyung, now the head coach of the South Korean men's table tennis team, and his Chinese mother Jiao Zhimin won the men's doubles bronze and the women's singles bronze and doubles silver respectively.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\nLoh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities\n\n5\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Oh, that will be pretty big,\" said An, when asked how much it would mean to win a gold medal.\n\n\"There are a lot of good players playing. Although some people pulled out, it still got the best field in the world, I think. Like I said, it's a normal US PGA Tour event, I'm thinking of it that way.\n\n\"Going down and playing in a limited field. But a win is a win and a medal is a bonus.\n\n\"But I hope I can get a medal by trying to play like a regular PGA Tour. I don't want to put extra pressure on myself.\"\n\nBACKING\n\nAn's parents, who have been very supportive of his career with Ahn moving with him to the United States when he was a student while his mother earned money in China to pay the expenses, will be travelling with him to Brazil.\n\nHowever, if he had hoped for some advice on how to prepare for the Olympics, then An would have been disappointed.\n\n\"All we talked about is whether I got my flu shot or immunisation shots. We didn't really talk about anything else,\" said An, who won the BMW PGA Championship on the European Tour last year.\n\nDespite the lack of chat about the Games, An said that competing at the Olympics as they did is special.\n\n\"I have a chance to play in the Olympics and they played too,\" said An. \"That's definitely more special than any other guy because my parents played in the Olympics.\n\n\"That's what makes it more special, definitely.\"\n\nUnlike An, some high-profile golfers failed to make the cut at Troon.\n\nWorld No. 14 Louis Oosthuizen, 17th-ranked Hideki Matsuyama and No. 27 Shane Lowry were among them.\n\nFormer champions Ernie Els, Justin Leonard, Todd Hamilton, Mark Calcavecchia, John Daly and Ben Curtis also failed to make the weekend.\n\nSouth African Oosthuizen, who won golf's oldest Major at St Andrews in 2010 and recorded a hole-in-one at the short 14th on Thursday, crashed to a 12-over 83 in the second round.\n\nThe cut was at four-over 146, a score that was also too good for US trio Jimmy Walker, Billy Horschel and Scott Piercy, Britons Paul Casey and Matt Fitzpatrick, Dutchman Joost Luiten, Victor Dubuisson of France, Dane Thorbjorn Olesen and New Zealander Danny Lee.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nOlympics\n\nbritish open\n\nAn Byeong Hun\n\ntable tennis\n\nRio\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 11:34pm\n\nEx-swimmer Mark Chay set to become new SNOC secretary-general\n\nFeb 2, 2025, 12:27am\n\nJason Teh just one match from ending badminton title drought\n\nDec 4, 2024, 06:12am\n\nSingapore's first Olympic medallist Tan Howe Liang dies aged 91\n\nNov 11, 2024, 10:59pm\n\nKoen Pang and Izaac Quek qualify for World Table Tennis Finals\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - How SMEs Can Optimize Cash Flow & Financial Stability\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/573c60eb4082c8bc4a4f7e151f3c2223604e701993069219e1c710c319a0cdf7/NP_20160717_EXITS17_1326818.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "\"He has never been to a multisport competition with so many other athletes.

I think he can handle more ground,\" said Dragon, who was saddling only her sixth winner for the season.\n\n\"I really thought he would fade but he kicked again, which was a very good sign. We know he has good gate speed and it was always the plan to go forward, but we didn't expect the other horse to come alongside him.\n\n\"It was not an easy race but he showed plenty of courage to win, and Troy also showed some muscle.\"\n\nSee, who rode the Coats Choice three-year-old at his first race, said he went into Friday's race with a reasonable dose of confidence, but by the 600m mark, it had already worn thin.\n\n\"John didn't give us an easy time. Even though my horse was travelling okay, I was not so confident coming to the bend,\" said the Singaporean apprentice jockey, who has now drawn to within only one win shy of current leader MM Firdaus.\n\n\"Even though he rolled off, he still had enough petrol left in the tank to get the win.\n\n\"Here, I have to say he had an issue with one of his right teeth.

She was allegedly strangled by her brother.\n\nShe was admired by many of the country's youth for her willingness to break social taboos, but she was also condemned and reviled by those more traditional.\n\nHer murder happened near the city of Multan, Punjab, police said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 29, 2023, 12:34am\n\nMistaken cutting of power caused Nepal plane crash that killed 72\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Qandeel Baloch has been killed. She was strangled to death by her brother. Apparently it was an incident of honour killing,\" Mr Sultan Azam, a senior police officer in Multan, told AFP.\n\nPolice were informed by her family that the killing had taken place on Friday night.\n\n\"The brother was also there last night, and the family told us that he strangled her to death,\" Mr Azhar Akram, another senior police officer in Multan, told AFP.\n\nPolice said Ms Baloch's brother is on the run.\n\nMs Baloch, a single mother and model, shot to fame in Pakistan in 2014 after a video of her pouting at the camera went viral.\n\nKnown for her liberal views and forthrightness, Ms Baloch, who posed with mullahs and in plunging dresses for selfies, was frequently subjected to misogynist abuse online.\n\nShe had reportedly spoken of leaving Pakistan after the Hari Raya holidays, fearing for her safety.\n\nThe police said she was threatened by her family, who wanted her to quit modelling and cease her provocative appearances on social media.\n\nHer brother had been threatening her over her Facebook posts and videos, added the police.\n\nSECURITY\n\nThree weeks ago, Ms Baloch had written to the interior minister, the director general of the Federal Investigation Authority, and other officials asking them to provide security for her, Pakistan newspaper Dawn reported.\n\nShe had said that her life was in danger, that she was being threatened via calls, and that she did not have security measures installed in her home, the newspaper said.\n\nNews of her murder trended on social media in Pakistan, with liberal users calling for action over her killing. But others condemned her relentless self-promotion.\n\nTwitter user JiaAli wrote: \"Someone had to do it. She was a disgrace.\"\n\nBut Facebook user Zaair Hussain said: \"RIP Qandeel Baloch. You made us laugh, and you made us applaud... I think history will remember you as a provocateur, a living exhibit, a larger than life role - just as you would want to be remembered.\"\n\nPakistani filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, whose documentary A Girl In The River: The Price of Forgiveness won an Oscar earlier this year, told AFP that the murder would make women feel less safe.\n\nMs Obaid-Chinoy said: \"I really feel that no woman is safe in this country until we start making examples of people, until we start sending men who kill women to jail, unless we literally say there will be no more killing, and those who dare will spend the rest of their lives behind bars.\"\n\nHer film was hailed by Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who in February vowed to push through anti-honour killing legislation.\n\nBut no action has been taken since then, despite a fresh wave of attacks on women that have been condemned by activists.\n\nSaid Ms Obaid-Chinoy: \"Not only does the bill need to go through, but the cases of honour killings all need to be expedited, and we start sending people to jail.\n\n\"Activists have screamed themselves hoarse.

Because this sector is producing fewer jobs, and manufacturing has become more automated,\" said the 62-year-old Speaker of Parliament.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, the unionist-turned-politician, spoke to The New Paper on Tuesday about jobs and the economy, and her thoughts about the changes to the elected presidency.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 23, 2025, 12:04am\n\nPuan Noor Aishah a kind, remarkable woman, say Singapore leaders\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe number of layoffs this year is expected to top last year's, when 13,440 workers lost their jobs, Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say told Parliament last month.\n\nThe reasons have been well-documented - disruptions in several industries and jobs evolving faster than workers can be retrained for them.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, concern over job security is starting to creep in among her constituents at Marsiling-Yew Tee, Madam Halimah said.\n\n\"I've seen cases of people losing their jobs, retrenchments... This is something we really need to monitor.\n\n\"Most, I find, are able to manage on their own in terms of getting an alternative job.\n\n\"What they do need is temporary support when they have no income to tide them over,\" she said.\n\nIn her 33 years in the labour movement, Madam Halimah has seen many cycles of retrenchment.\n\nCRISIS\n\nShe said: \"I cannot forget those years, especially the crisis we had in 2008 and 2009.\n\n\"I really understand where they are coming from. I really empathise with them.\n\n\"They are not just a digit because retrenchments, loss of jobs, affect them personally, very poignantly.\"\n\nThe silver lining in the gloomy economic outlook is that there are jobs available, and Singapore has proactive labour market policies to help those who are retrenched.\n\nThey include job-matching through Workforce Singapore, looking for jobs through the revised Jobs Bank, and reskilling under the SkillsFuture initiative.\n\nMadam Halimah said: \"This form of technological disruption has been going on for a while, except the pace will hasten and it will continue.\"\n\nFirst female president? No comment for now\n\nBy\n\nFoo Jie Ying\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Foo Jie Ying\n\nShe has been touted as someone who could make history by becoming Singapore's first female president. But Madam Halimah Yacob, 62, simply laughed when the topic was brought up.\n\n\"I think it is still a long way off,\" she said, referring to the next presidential election (PE), which is expected to be held by next August. She is now focused on her two roles: Speaker of Parliament and Member of Parliament for Marsiling-Yew Tee.\n\nThe next PE will be reserved for Malay candidates - a mechanism triggered when a candidate of a certain race has not been a president for five consecutive terms. This has been criticised by some as tokenism. But Madam Halimah disagreed.\n\n\"When you say it is tokenism, it means that it is symbolic, it is perfunctory. The point is, all candidates, regardless of an open or reserved election, will have to qualify.\"\n\nIn a time when multi-racialism is being tested around the world, she urged sceptics to look at the changes in the context of preserving multi-racialism, one of Singapore's strengths.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said the Government has no specific candidate in mind. He told Malaysian news agency Bernama on Monday: \"There is no shortlist. It depends who comes forward. It is not for the Government to arrange. It is for the candidates to come forward.\"\n\nMadam Halimah ticks all the boxes of the eligibility criteria for public sector candidates.\n\nPolitical pundits see her as the front runner partly due to her popularity on the ground.\n\nShe became the first Malay female MP in 2001, then minister of state in 2011. Two years later, she became the first female Speaker. As a veteran unionist, volunteer and politician, she won over many with her dedication to single mothers, low-income families, the elderly and the disabled.\n\nBut when asked if she has considered running in the PE, she said cautiously: \"At this moment, I would not want to comment... To me, it doesn't matter what capacity you serve in.\n\n\"The most important thing is that you're serving from your heart, and that you're also serving the people and Singapore.\"\n\nHalimah Yacob on her mum\n\nBy\n\nFoo Jie Ying\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Foo Jie Ying\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Speaker, she shared snippets from her school days, and memories of her mother.\n\nTRADE-OFFS\n\nShe has missed many family moments because of her job.\n\nBefore she knew it, her five children - aged 25 to 34 - were grown up.\n\nOn Polling Day last year, her mother died while she was doing her rounds.\n\n\"I wanted to go see her after I had made my rounds, but I couldn't even complete the rounds and she left. I was fortunate that the day before was Cooling Day, so I got to spend the whole day with her...\n\n\"There were times when I felt like I should have spent a lot more time with her, especially when she had dementia,\" said Madam Halimah, quietly.\n\nTime is a big trade-off that a politician has to be prepared for.\n\n\"Those moments are things you can never recover, but you accept that it's part and parcel of your responsibility,\" she said.\n\nLESSONS FROM MUM\n\nIt has been slightly over a year since her mother's death, but memories still bring tears to her eyes, Madam Halimah said.\n\n\"Especially when you're in quiet moments, when you confront the reality. She lived with me for so many years. I remember her sitting on a particular sofa. She would be watching TV... Then there are moments like Hari Raya, and you know she's not there.\n\n\"You cannot forget someone who's had a tremendous influence on you, but I think life has to go on.\"\n\nThe most enduring advice Madam Halimah got from her mother was never to borrow, and to live within your own means.\n\nWhen the Speaker moved into a flat with her husband, it took the couple eight months of scrimping and saving before they could afford their first sofa set.\n\nMadam Halimah also lives by her mother's motto: if you don't get up before the sun rises, then you're lazy.\n\nIt is partly why the 62-year-old starts her day at 5am every day.\n\n\"I think I've grown up never sleeping very late into the day. I can never sleep when the sun is already out and when it's bright and shining into your face,\" she said.\n\nSTUDENT DAYS\n\nAs a student, Madam Halimah Yacob was guilty of falling asleep in class, and not completing her homework.\n\nShuttling between school and her mother's food stall to help out took a toll on her, and she struggled to stay awake in class.\n\n\"I was sitting at the back so I could look out of the window, daydream, and sleep,\" she said with a chuckle.\n\nIt took a teacher who told her she could do much better in class to wake her up.\n\n\"I supposed I bucked up then, but I think I also felt I owed my mother something.\n\n\"She worked so hard, the last thing she wanted to see is another failure. She deserved better,\" said Madam Halimah.\n\nINTERRUPTING MPs\n\nIf there is a line Madam Halimah says frequently in her role as Speaker of Parliament, it has to be: \"Please keep your follow-up questions crisp and short.\"\n\n\"I have to do it,\" she said with a laugh before explaining that she had make sure the 1 ½-hour question time is used efficiently.\n\n\"If I can't even clear 15 parliamentary questions (PQ)... Not that I must clear 15, but the point is, I'm denying other MPs whose questions come later of a chance for their questions to be asked if we are bogged down by just a few PQs.\n\n\"It's a sad thing (if) those members do not get a chance to ask their questions.\"\n\nTo this end, she watches the timer like a hawk and interrupts once the MP's time to speak is up.\n\n\"By and large, I must say members have been extremely cooperative and supportive, so we can get a lot of business done on sitting days.

This is what to expect from the day-absorbing, wildly engrossing 15th edition of the classic series.\n\nShare this article\n\nOne moment you're leaping from cover to cover as you evade a fire-breathing demon.\n\nThe next, you are pushing a broken down car along a desert road as the soul standard Stand By Me floats through the air.\n\nMoments later, you are deemed bankrupt and sent to take out clusters of scorpion-like monsters in order to repay a debt.\n\nWelcome to Final Fantasy XV - or FFXV for short.\n\nYes, that's 15 Finals, which could cause trading standards to raise an eyebrow.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2016, 02:54pm\n\n8 apps to help you kill time during Chinese New Year\n\nAnd this has been a highly-anticipated instalment, one decade in the making.\n\nFinally, Square Enix's latest sprawling brainchild is finally hitting stores today (Nov 29).\n\nThis reporter (and for full disclosure, an ardent fan of the series) visited the Sony Interactive Entertainment office last week to try out the game on the Playstation 4.\n\nNow this is the part that can lose the casual observer, but bear with it.\n\nFFXV is set in the fictional world of Eos, where you control Prince Noctis Lucis Caelum, heir to the Kingdom of Lucis, as you travel with three companions - Gladiolus Amicitia, Ignis Scientia and Prompto Argentum. They should give a prize to anyone able to pronounce those name perfectly on first go - or at all.\n\nYou and your trio of unpronouncables journey to meet your bride-to-be. A classic case of get the girl, kill the baddies?\n\nWell, things go hideously wrong during the journey as Noctis learns that his father - the king - is killed, sending the world into turmoil.\n\nSo Noctis and his friends have to travel through war-torn Eos, allowing you, the player, to experience an stunning open-world environment where you can play at your own pace.\n\nEXPLORATION\n\nThe is the game equivalent of a free-and-easy holiday. Choose to either blitz through the main storyline or take your time by indulging in the side quests. Or even go sightseeing in the majestically vast world where monsters roam.\n\nEither way, the pain of travelling from one end to another is made smoother and simpler by Noctis' car, The Regalia.\n\nYou can drive the car yourself or get Ignis to do it - allowing you (the player not the character) to take a much-needed toilet or snack break.\n\nJust be careful about wandering during the night as daemons can suddenly spawn and are ridiculously powerful. (This refers to you the character, not real life).\n\nBATTLE SYSTEM\n\nCombat now resembles closer to hack-and-slash games such as Devil May Cry. However, charging into battle furiously mashing your controller buttons will not get you far.Unlike its previous editions, FFXV's battles - using its Active Cross Battle system - will be real time, and you enter battles instantaneously without transition screens.\n\nThere's a degree of strategy to be employed.\n\nFor example, take advantage of Noctis' special ability - the warp strike - which allows him to teleport short distances and strike your foe.\n\nThis means that in battle, you could teleport to higher ground before warping behind an enemy to inflict more damage.\n\nWhile you only control Noctis during most of the game, in battle, you can combine with his teammates to execute special combos.\n\nYou will be ranked for your offence, defence and stealth performances after each fight.\n\nThe higher the grade, the more ability points (AP) you earn to level up. Speaking of which...\n\nLEVELLING UP\n\nThis is done via an ability tree - Something fans of FFXIII will be familiar with - using AP accumulated from battles, conversations and actions.\n\nWhile each character has his own skill tree, all of your team's AP is stored collectively, but be sure to even out the distribution.\n\nMAGIC\n\nFinal Fantasy isn't complete without the magical elements.\n\nThis time, magic has to be harvested and stored in a flask before it can be equipped on a character as a spell.\n\nSpell-crafting can be quite interesting as you mix different elements, and even add items, to make them more powerful.\n\nSIDE QUESTS\n\nFFXV also features a plethora of side quests that allow you to spend even more time in this unreal world, rather than the real one where you have to get up in the morning.\n\nAnd there are plenty of opportunities, not always sign-posted. Just a casual stroll around the first chapter opened up various monster hunts and even fishing (yes, literally fishing).\n\nIt can be as easy as talking to various non-player characters. So it can pay to be sociable.\n\nTHROWBACK\n\nThe Final Fantasy series is renowned for its throwbacks to previous editions, appealing to its long-time fans.\n\nFamiliar names, such as Cid, and the giant chicken-like Chocobos are part of FFXV.\n\nTaking a cue from the Grand Theft Auto series, each station on your car's stereo allows you to hear a different FF soundtrack.\n\nOn this excursion through Eos, the track J-E-N-O-V-A from FFVII was on heavy repeat.\n\nWRITER'S VERDICT\n\nThe game starts slowly, or at least I did. It took almost three hours to complete the first of 15 chapters. But it gets better as you go on.\n\nWhile initially sceptical of the characters, with their gladiator-like names and K-pop boyband looks, I soon appreciated the team's dynamic.\n\nThe revamped battle system will have you thinking on your feet - and then thinking again. It requires you to always have a plan because you can forget about getting by with mindless button mashing here.\n\nMost importantly, it's impossible not to be amazed by the scale of Eos and what lies beyond the horizon for Noctis and gang.\n\nA game to lose yourself in and book time off work for.\n\nRATING:\n\n9/10\n\nAVAILABLE ON:\n\nPlaystation 4, Xbox One\n\nPRICE:\n\n$84.90 on the Playstation Store\n\nBy\n\nRonald Loh\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Ronald Loh\n\nFinal Fantasy\n\ngaming\n\nComputer game\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3e980310e52c4a5bdd9e784eb5c515863ece8c631de7d362ce10cb60ad17f6ac/final_fntasy_xv_screen7.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8dc22358b6c2fc5c64f34a29e73b50ed5090309d8dd001eb4ee04513f7fae38a/01f2e262.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "8 apps to help you kill time during Chinese New Year", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cc69b956d58f71fb9c4c44c1a834c8228ba1686385b8f7e9b295e2520cf05ea8/final_fantasy_xv_still006.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/640596af3439334970af2e3a5c7bafe49eecddbb0c8b70ad4296085713e4b835/final_fantasy_xv_still003.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0a8ac3ab2ea4e1bfb538a83d18387009066b1afcf1807ac8eaa85d483e36fa9/final_fantasy_xv_still004.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dee0c07ea5bef985bd42f757853818ac83ad5e6a5c2d2d0f01416a3449da0c55/final_fantasy_xv_still005.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/07d37f057a63ec6192ffb0511118066a36c146795e87b0ddba6c6ab8592cafdf/final_fantasy_xv_jp_en_ver._front.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Currently, many companies are now trading at about 0.5 times book or lower, with a few exceptions.\n\nAt current levels, however, we believe that most of the negatives have been priced in, and downside risk is now less than a year before - the challenge lies in 1) picking companies with the ability to ride the downturn; and 2) identifying the inflection point in which a sustainable recovery would begin. As such, it is not surprising to see distressed funds being set up to scoop some bargains when the time is right.\n\nWhen, then, is the right time? There are different sub-sectors in the broader oil and gas industry, and when you recover depends on where you are on the value chain.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 9, 2025, 03:34am\n\nFriends toil at nasi padang stall, find ways to attract customers amid rising costs\n\nMore related stories\n\nOur sense is that should there be a sustained recovery in oil prices, exploration and production companies stand to benefit first as they are regarded as more direct proxies of the oil price.\n\nThe drillers and vessel charterers could then be next in line, as well as the service providers.\n\nAsset fabricators (the yards), that depend on new order flows, could take a longer time to see earnings recovery, as their clients first have to regain confidence in the market before ordering new assets from them.\n\nMeanwhile, the downstream players are still doing relatively well amid the doom and gloom in the broader industry.\n\nEZION HOLDINGS | BUY\n\nTARGET PRICE: $0.42\n\nNOV 22 CLOSE: $0.34\n\nMaybank Kim Eng Research, Nov 30\n\nInvestors appeared to be looking for reasons to build exposure to the oil-service sector. Unsurprisingly, their concerns revolved around: 1) whether the worst is over; 2) asset-write-down potential; 3) balance-sheet sustainability; and 4) cashflows. We continue to believe that Ezion will be an early beneficiary in the oil cycle, after oil producers.\n\nWhile the sector is still struggling, Ezion observed that its clients are now clearer on their extraction and production road maps. This helps Ezion tailor its assets to suit their requirements, raising the sustainability of future asset deployment. Ezion has mapped out three paths for itself to navigate the downturn.\n\nIt will: 1) continue to diversify into windfarm installation; 2) convert assets to mobile offshore production units to serve clients' longer-term extraction needs; and 3) review its capex to ensure value addition. It also highlighted plans by the Singapore Government to provide financial aid to oil and gas companies.\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

{"article_url": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/business/sti-rises-above-2900-mixed-session", "site_title": "STI rises above 2,900 in mixed session", "publish_date": "2016-11-30T22:00:00", "content": "This article is more than 12 months old\n\nNov 30, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSTI rises above 2,900 in mixed session\n\nBanks contribute almost half of the index's 24.9-point jump; advance-decline score at 227 to 222 as oil prices dampens sentiment\n\nShare this article\n\nAN overnight rise on Wall Street and probable month-ending window-dressing of certain key blue chips - or \"portfolio rebalancing\", if you prefer - yesterday helped push the Straits Times Index (STI) up 24.88 points to 2,904.02, taking it 22 points or 0.8 per cent into the black for 2016.\n\nYesterday also saw the latest Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index rebalancing come into effect.\n\nFor the MSCI Singapore Index, Sats was added while Noble Group and Sembcorp Marine were deleted. However, both were then included in the MSCI Singapore Small Cap Index. Noble crashed $0.013 or 7.6 per cent to $0.159 on massive volume of 1.23 billion, and Sembcorp Marine closed with an $0.085 or 5.7 per cent loss at $1.395 on volume of 85.4 million.\n\nA steep slide in oil prices, however, dampened sentiment somewhat, and this was reflected in an advance-decline score of 227 to 222 which suggested that the index's gains were narrowly focused and that the broader market did not follow.\n\nA check of the index's movers showed that rises in the three banks were instrumental in sending the STI above 2016's starting level of 2,882, their combined contribution amounting to almost 12 points.\n\nThanks to the heightened activity in blue chips and the selling of Noble, turnover came to 2.9 billion units worth $2.6 billion, the highest daily total for the year.\n\nBanks' outperformance has come mainly because of expectations of higher interest rates, starting with the US where a rate hike is virtually certain at this month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. In the federal funds futures market, the probability of a rate hike is now 100 per cent.\n\nAs for Singtel, Macquarie Warrants (MW) noted that while the stock is currently outperforming the STI, its performance in 2016 has lagged that of the STI in the second half of the year.\n\n\"Note, the STI is up 2.4 per cent in the last six months, Singtel shares are down for the same percentage,\" said MW.\n\n\"The latter, which peaked in July 2016, had tumbled as much as 16.7 per cent, while the STI had fallen only 5.2 per cent over the same period.\"\n\nMW also reported that \"investors in Singapore have been accumulating Singtel call warrants since the start of the month, when the stock came under pressure and fell more than 7 per cent in three weeks due to... news about increased competition\".\n\nState Street Corporation said its global investor confidence index (ICI) fell 0.3 point to 98.9 from October's revised reading of 99.2 and that the decline in sentiment was driven by a 4.6-point decrease in the Asian ICI to 116.1 and a 2.6-point decline in the European ICI to 86.5. The North American ICI rose slightly from 95.6 to 95.7\n\nMs Jessica Donohue, executive vice-president and chief innovation officer, State Street Global Exchange, said in a press release that the setbacks in the ICI last month were felt most strongly by Asian-based institutional investors.\n\n\"Trump's victory has clearly exacerbated anti-globalisation jitters. Moreover, confidence in Europe further declined to the mid-eighties, a relatively low level, as the UK's exit from the European Union and Italian political risk remain a source of major concerns,\" said Ms Donohue.\n\nAs for oil prices, the 4 per cent plunge on Tuesday to around US$44 (S$63) per barrel came after reports indicated opposition from Iran and Iraq towards production cuts, casting doubt that an agreement could be reached at a key meeting yesterday.\n\nThis article appears in The Business Times today.

It has also fallen to US$1.25 from US$1.49.\n\nCHEAPEST CITY\n\nAs a result, London became the cheapest city for luxury goods shopping in dollar terms, according to a study by Deloitte.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 17, 2022, 12:00pm\n\n'How's Brexit going?'

And we can afford to eat and drink outside. That was not possible years ago,\" she added.\n\nMr Denis Sagajevs, who works in Shinola, a shop selling watches and leather accessories, said: \"We're an American brand. Our products are designed and assembled in the US. But with the weakening of the pound, it actually happens to be cheaper for American tourists to buy an American product in London.\"\n\nShops are now adjusting their advertising and sales tactics to the new consumer behaviour.\n\nThe manager of a luxury men's clothes shop said that, before the vote, European tourists were couples who bought just a few things.\n\n\"Now, there are groups of friends who rush in.

In politics, kill or be killed. We are at war,\" Mr Khairy said when opening the youth assembly.\n\nDr Mahathir and Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin - sacked as Mr Najib's deputy - have formed a new opposition party as they continue to push for the premier to resign over allegations that US$700 million (S$998 million) found in his personal accounts came from sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad.\n\nMr Najib has insisted the money was a political donation from the Saudi royal family.\n\nHe has to face polls only in August 2018, but there is speculation that elections will be called next year after new electoral boundaries were revealed in September, and cooperation between Umno and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia keeps sowing discord among opposition parties.\n\nRights of all races will be safe,  says Umno VP\n\nThe rights of all Malaysians, regardless of race or religion, will be protected.\n\nUmno vice-president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said the party will remain committed to this, reported The Star. The party's de facto number two was making his maiden speech at the 14th Umno general assembly.\n\nHe noted that many urban voters - the majority of them non-Malays - had rejected Umno and Barisan Nasional in the last general election.\n\nHe said: \"Yet Umno and its component parties in the ruling coalition will continue to fight for all races and religions under its power-sharing concept.\n\n\"As the saying goes, in times of hardship, Umno shares the difficulties. And in good times, Umno also enjoys the benefits along with others.\n\n\"Umno protects non-Malays under the principle that we are all under one roof, one country. Umno is not racist.\"\n\nDr Ahmad Zahid also said Umno had a proven track record of demonstrating its commitment to power-sharing among the races under Barisan.\n\n\"There is no need to be worried about the spirit of brotherhood of Umno. Let us all be committed to fighting and defending Barisan at the next general election,\" he said.\n\nShannon Teoh\n\nTrinna Leong\n\nmalaysia\n\nNajib Razak\n\nMahathir Mohamad\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/007ce43457440c7890f4612261dc71a59ca73feb4dff2f5f91fbbfbe8b31b943/NP_20161201_PARTY01_1455740.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Najib Razak (at the podium) has to face polls only in August 2018, but there is speculation that elections will be called next year.

{"article_url": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/views/singaporeans-deserve-right-choose", "site_title": "Singaporeans deserve the right to choose", "publish_date": "2016-11-30T22:00:00", "content": "This article is more than 12 months old\n\nNov 30, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSingaporeans deserve the right to choose\n\nRule that allows full suite of life insurance products to be sold online could be a game changer\n\nShare this article\n\nThe recent announcement by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) that it will soon allow insurers to offer the full suite of life insurance products to be sold online, without advice, is a defining moment for Singapore's insurance industry.\n\nI believe that by giving Singaporeans a choice over how they buy their life insurance, we have the opportunity, over the next three to five years, to change the industry for the better.\n\nThis will raise standards overall, encouraging the entire industry, including insurance agents, to provide further value-add to meet consumer demands.\n\nLESSONS FROM THE PAST\n\nNot everyone shares my enthusiasm.\n\nOne argument is that, unlike investment products, insurance is too complicated to be sold online. This seems misplaced and worse, misunderstands the challenge we must meet.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 16, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nMAS looking at legal tender limit for coins\n\nMore related stories\n\nSurely, if individuals can make informed decisions about asset prices, yields, currency fluctuations and so on, they're more than equipped to judge what cover they need to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n\nThat said, the comparison is apt. A few years ago, traditional stockbrokers argued that finance was too complex for private investors to manage themselves.\n\nHowever, new online portfolio management tools created a simplified experience that investors adopted in droves, displacing many of the old-fashioned brokerage firms.\n\nAnother example is from the package holiday industry, which wanted to maintain the status quo.\n\nMuch of the complexity in the insurance market today has been created by the industry itself.\n\nThey argued that the supposed complexity of arranging flights, ground transportation, hotels and tours required human intervention.\n\nIt then discovered, as companies such as booking.com and Expedia quickly grew, that people preferred to do it themselves.\n\nALLOW PEOPLE TO CONSIDER, WITHOUT CONCERN\n\nMuch of the complexity in the insurance market today has been created by the industry itself.\n\nWhile most insurers offer information about what each of their products offer, few allow consumers to go through an online experience that enables them to understand which policy is right for them, instead, guiding people towards meeting an agent.\n\nIn a world where we can manage almost everything using our mobile phone, this highlights the fear of change that many insurers have.\n\nInstead of embracing change, they are trying to protect their current business model.\n\nIn fact, according to research we commissioned earlier this year, the main reason people used agents was to take care of the complicated paperwork.\n\nThis shouldn't be the case and it's the industry's duty to respond to MAS' initiative and make it simple.\n\nIt should be straightforward to select the cover you require and purchase with a simple click, without worrying about being caught out by an exclusion hidden in the terms and conditions.\n\nSINGAPORE HAS A LEADING OPPORTUNITY\n\nSingapore is not the first market to allow life insurance products to be sold directly online. Australia, the United Kingdom, China, India and Malaysia are already doing so.\n\nBut the permission to sell online hasn't translated to major market share for this channel in those countries yet.\n\nThe two primary reasons are a lack of awareness at the consumer end and the quality of customer experience on most of those websites.\n\nSingapore has a real opportunity to make up for lost time by learning from these international experiences and combining that learning with the advanced technology and know-how that the Republic excels at. Our market research, conducted in August, shows the appetite for online insurance already exists.\n\nA good 90 per cent of Singaporeans are comfortable accessing and purchasing insurance online.\n\nWith good-quality offerings and a simple customer experience, that latent demand can be converted to tangible results over the next few years.\n\nTECHNOLOGY OPENS THE DOOR TO PERSONALISATION\n\nUsing new advanced tools such as robo-advisers, there is potential to introduce new bespoke life policies that are entirely customisable to each individual's needs, curated in real time in active response to a customer's questions.\n\nThis will allow consumers to make proper considered decisions on their insurance needs without the pressure of a face-to-face meeting.\n\nIt also far exceeds what is possible in a traditional meeting with an adviser and actively changes the conversation from \"which insurance policy should I choose\" to the creation of a policy that is personal to me.\n\nSAFEGUARDS A WIN-WIN FOR EVERYBODY\n\nWe are fortunate that we have a government which actively introduces new initiatives and stimulus measures such as its Direct Purchase Insurance (DPI) initiative, which pushes the industry forward in an independent, non-partisan way.\n\nMAS' MoneySense and CompareFirst websites are excellent initiatives and the industry should champion the introduction of simple tools that allow people to calculate the cover they need, including an assessment of the existing cover that they have in place.\n\nWe should also welcome the proposed initiatives to ensure people don't inadvertently end up leaving themselves under-insured or paying too much for cover they don't need.\n\nThis puts consumers at risk and leaves the industry open to allegations of offering poor value.\n\nI see a bright, value-added and direct future for the insurance industry that will benefit everyone in Singapore.\n\nThe smart combination of clever government-led initiatives, alongside an industry that is ready to innovate, will change Singapore for the better.\n\nIt will also help further reinforce our nation's position as a leading global centre of financial services innovation.

Working in Singapore seems to have given them a sense of responsibility, and the initiative to get what they want for themselves.\"\n\nMyanmar\n\nSingapore\n\nTRADING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 7, 2025, 12:02pm\n\nSCDF rescuers deployed to quake-hit Myanmar to come home on April 8\n\nApr 5, 2025, 12:41am\n\nSingapore sends second wave of aid to quake-hit Myanmar\n\nApr 2, 2025, 01:30am\n\n'We won't give up': S'pore's Operation Lionheart presses on in Myanmar\n\nMar 30, 2025, 11:53pm\n\nS'pore firms in Myanmar, Thailand report staff safe after quake\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ff45ddc103aadb5c703caf117f2788249168253616177927f2c87e60c75f8c0d/np_20161201_talk01-her_1455998.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ms Aung San Suu Kyi and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana yesterday.

The speedster impressed when winning his trial on Tuesday morning.\n\nRidden by Gerard Mosse, the son of Exceed And Excel claimed the lead after travelling 100m and never gave it back, winning by one-and-a-quarter lengths.\n\nNoted for his early speed, the eight-time winner was always going too well for his rivals and, as the highest rated horse in the trial, he won in a canter.\n\nA five-year-old with eight wins from 27 starts, Sebas is nearing the half-million dollars in earnings and could seal the deal with a win on Sunday.\n\nIs it beyond his reach? We don't think so. After all, when not stubborn behind the gates, he has always relished these sharp sprints and his last win was over the flying 1,000m.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 03:08pm\n\nRace card for Feb 20\n\nMore related stories\n\nThat day in July, he toyed with his rivals, made every post a winning one to take the race by two lengths.\n\nSince then, he hasn't been idle and in his four trials, including this most recent one, he has put in three \"wins\".\n\nSo forget that last start in late September when he beat just two home. He was a bad boy that day, raised a sweat behind the gates and lost the race there.\n\nSent back to the trials by the stewards, Sebas was at his best behaviour on Tuesday morning and, provided he carries it over to Sunday's race, we should see him lead his rivals on a merry chase.\n\nSo watch for the swagger from Sebas. He looks in the pink of condition and should end his season on a winning note in the Kranji Stakes A event over the Polytrack 1,100m in Race 7.\n\nTRIAL 1 ORT\n\n1 Justice Light (M Nunes)\n\n2 Chronos (N Juglall)\n\n3 Golden Thunder (D David)\n\n4 Country Quack (D Beasley)\n\n5 Tarzan\n\nMargins and time: Ns, 5¼, 8¾, 3 (1min 02.97sec).\n\nTRIAL 2 TEST\n\n1 Sebas (G Mosse)\n\n2 Pint Sized Prince\n\n3 Frances (A da Silva)\n\n4 Lady Iffraaj (R Zawari)\n\n5 King Roulette (WS Chan)\n\nMargins and time: 1¼, 11¾, 4¼, 3¾ (1:01.69).\n\nTRIAL 3 TEST\n\n1 Order Of The Sun (B Woodworth)\n\n2 Emperor Max (M Rodd)\n\n3 Golden Brilliant (T See)\n\n4 Exceed Express (M Nunes)\n\n5 Bourbon Goldman (K A'Isisuhairi)\n\n6 Sun Scraper (CC Wong)\n\n7 Lake Huka (G Boss)\n\nMargins and time: 2¾, 1, ½, hd, 1, 1¼ (1:00.79).\n\nTRIAL 4 TEST\n\n1 Major Advancement (Y Salim)\n\n2 Hot Gold (B Vorster)\n\n3 Cote De Nuits (Nunes)\n\n4 My Reach (I Azhar)\n\n5 Nessun Dorma (Wong)\n\n6 Alamak Boy (A Munro)\n\n7 Jet Striker (CK Ng)\n\nMargins and time: 1½, ½, 1¾, 3¾, 2¼, 13¾ (1:01.87).\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nRacing\n\nSingapore\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 18, 2025, 05:17pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 19\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 02:32pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 18\n\nFeb 16, 2025, 03:27pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 17\n\nFeb 15, 2025, 01:46pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 16\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/06efe71f284a8a6ee449e146fc38f8f7057fa8672fa72c0916318545050d88a6/racing.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Race card for Feb 20", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1ecd7eacdf5654e84e1b2d48da6b9c9a5969e8ec1a183849b063723cff838125/racing1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for Feb 19", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It has been fun,\" Woods said.\n\nWoods seemed a man alone during much of his career's success and after his infamous sex scandal, but has kindled new friendships from a new generation of US PGA Tour players, those he inspired rather than dominated.\n\n\"It's amazing to see the outpouring of support from our side. He has meant so much to all of us. He has inspired all of us, touched all of us in different ways,\" Watson said.\n\nWatson summed up the feelings of many golf fans who dream of Woods' glory era but just want to see him play, in the same way that Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player were loved long past their peak.\n\n\"Just let us watch you for four days,\" Watson said.\n\n\"I don't care what the score is.

Because, come Sunday, it's going to be Rocket Man Day at the Kranji racecourse when we say thank you and a happy retirement in South Africa to a true champion.\n\nOkay, it won't be a teary affair. That's for more sober stuff. What's planned for Sunday is a farewell party - complete with juicy carrots - for the greatest racehorse ever to grace our shores.\n\nLike when Joseph Schooling won that Olympic gold medal some months ago, Rocket Man did the same for Singapore.\n\nHe put us on the world racing map.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 03:08pm\n\nRace card for Feb 20\n\nMore related stories\n\nSo, some will say: \"He's only a horse.\" Yes. But that win at the 2011 Golden Shaheen in Dubai, an international Group 1 race, didn't come cheaply.\n\nRocket Man is the best horse I have ever had the pleasure and the honour of training. When it comes to temperament, ability and that zest to win, Rocket Man has no equal. He's everything a trainer can dream of having in his yard. Trainer Patrick Shaw, on Rocket Man\n\nLike Schooling did in Rio, he had to beat the best - which he did.\n\nI remember interviewing Rocket Man's trainer, Patrick Shaw after that victory. I had always held that man in awe. He, with the poise of a president. Yet, there he was, glowing and gushing like a proud parent.\n\nCome to think of it, I shouldn't have expected anything less.\n\nWhat Rocket Man did in Dubai and in a racing career which spanned just four years from 2008 is the stuff of legends.\n\nHe won all there was to win - 20 races from 27 starts and collected almost $7 million in stake money, a Singapore record. And, if not floored by injury, he would have wanted more.\n\nIndeed, to see him was to love him.\n\nOn raceday, the Rocket Man show began long before the starting gates flew opened. He was a star and, it looked like he knew it.\n\nSo, we used to see that little dance of his whenever the cheers from the grandstand reached those twitching years. He was all strut and style and, oh, how we lapped it up.\n\nIf he had just two legs, like us mere mortals, he would be like John Travolta swinging that can of paint in that epic scene from the movie Saturday Night Fever. You saw those moves and you remembered it forever.\n\nHe gave the sport, theatre.\n\nSo, come Sunday when, after the sixth race, he will be trotted out to a place he knows all too well - the winner's enclosure - be sure to raise a mighty cheer. Watch for that dance and the spring in his steps.\n\nBecause that's the last you will get to see of a horse whose feats will, surely, stand the test of time.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nRacing\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 18, 2025, 05:17pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 19\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 02:32pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 18\n\nFeb 16, 2025, 03:27pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 17\n\nFeb 15, 2025, 01:46pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 16\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/46810aa47e52de2efae6c37cac6a8cea66d4848830ae8a11e94bae7b59d49dbd/np_20161201_rocketman01_1455659.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Rocket Man making Singapore proud by being the country’s first International Group 1 winner when he captured the Dubai Golden Shaheen with jockey Felix Coetzee astride in March 2011.
