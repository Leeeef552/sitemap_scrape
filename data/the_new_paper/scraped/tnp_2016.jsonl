Chinese newspaper Global Times reported that moviegoers in Beijing's Chaoyang district organised a protest demanding refunds after catching the film in 3D.\n\nThe film was shot in 2D and released in its original format elsewhere. But the paper said only eight of Beijing's 149 cinemas, and nine of Shanghai's 174 cinemas, were offering screenings of the 2D version.\n\nUniversal Pictures' Beijing office said on microblogging platform Sina Weibo that it is working with local distributors to arrange more 2D screenings to serve the audience's \"diversified moviegoing needs\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\nDepp-Heard divorce drama continues\n\nThe war is apparently not over between US actor Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard.\n\nThe 30-year-old US actress had announced that she would be donating the entire divorce settlement of US$7 million (S$9.4 million) to the American Civil Liberties Union and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles.\n\nBut Depp, 53, decided to cut out the middleman and donate the money directly to the charities in a series of instalments.\n\nHeard's team slammed his payment plan, saying in a statement: \"If Johnny wishes to change the settlement agreement, we must insist that he honour the full amount by donating US$14 million to charity, which, after accounting for his tax deduction, is equal to his US$7 million payment obligation to Amber.\n\n\"We would also insist that the full amount be paid immediately and not drawn out over many years.\"\n\nSeagal meets Belarus president\n\nUS actor Steven Seagal rubbed shoulders with Mr Alexander Lukashenko, the controversial president of Belarus, last Wednesday.\n\nSeagal even ate one of Mr Lukashenko's home-grown carrots in the latter's garden.\n\nPresidential press footage showed Mr Lukashenko picking up a long carrot, quickly peeling it and handing it to the 64-year-old martial arts star.\n\nSeagal was in Belarus for discussions with game developer Wargaming, which is famed for its World of Tanks video game.\n\nIt was not the first time Mr Lukashenko hosted a celebrity in his home near Minsk.\n\nFrench actor Gerard Depardieu was his guest for the harvest meal last year.\n\nParker stops being ambassador for EpiPen maker\n\nUS actress Sarah Jessica Parker ended her role as a spokesman for Mylan, the manufacturer of EpiPen, after the company hiked the price of the allergy injector to more than US$500 (S$676).\n\nIt was a more than 400 per cent increase since it released the product in 2007.\n\nParker, 51, became its paid spokesman after using the emergency device on her son, 13-year-old James Wilkie, when she realised he was severely allergic to peanuts.\n\nShe wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday: \"I'm left disappointed, saddened and deeply concerned by Mylan's actions.\n\n\"I do not condone this decision and I have ended my relationship with Mylan as a direct result of it.\"\n\nUsually I cringe through the (film's) premiere and hate everything I do.

(\n\nSee other\n\n)\n\nKEEN ON SPEED\n\nOn her decision to join the show, Dela Merced, who is also a model and a TV personality, said: \"Anything to do with speed, I'm in.\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm more than happy... to share my expertise. It's a great honour.\"\n\nThis expertise stems from a lifelong love affair with cars.\n\nShe \"grew up with cars\" as she helped to clean the vehicles at her father's second-hand dealership when she was a child.\n\nShe also had three older brothers who loved video games and introduced her to the racing video game Moto Roader.\n\n\"I fell in love with (racing) when I was a kid because of that game,\" Dela Merced recalled. \"(In) my first year of high school, I told my family that as soon as I hit 18, I'm going to race.\"\n\nDela Merced received \"an old, beat-up\" 1980's Toyota Starlet on her 18th birthday and became set on a career in motorsports.\n\nInitially, her family was not supportive because of the danger and competitiveness of racing, but her father allowed her to participate in his place at the Porsche World Roadshow, one of the very first professional driving events she was exposed to.\n\n\"It was supposed to be a one-time affair, but they saw potential in the way that I drove,\" she said.\n\nAlthough the desire to break gender stereotypes was not the reason she joined Celebrity Car Wars, she hopes her and fellow Filipino racecar driver Michele Bumgarner's involvement as coaches will inspire girls with an interest in motorsports.\n\n\"I'm sure that they are a lot more females around the globe who want to be racecar drivers, and when they see (Celebrity Car Wars), I hope they realise that they can,\" she said.\n\n\"It would be great to hear and see, months later, (women) actually doing it.\"\n\nThe whole stigma that women cannot drive was still rampant in the Philippines, so there was double the pressure and effort on my part to prove that I belonged.\n\n- Professional racecar driver Gaby Dela Merced\n\ntelevision\n\nCars\n\nDriving\n\nShare this

I love it,\" said the 28-year-old Kerber, who defeated Williams in the Australian Open final in January for her maiden Grand Slam title.\n\n\"Let's see what happens in the next two weeks.\"\n\nKerber is right to be cautious, having suffered in the past for allowing herself to get tied up in knots by predictions and permutations.\n\nAt the WTA Championships in Singapore last year, she needed to take just one set off Lucie Safarova to make the semi-finals of the lucrative season-ender.\n\nInstead, she got so distracted by the \"ifs\", \"whats\" and \"maybes\", that she was eliminated after being defeated in straight sets.\n\n\"I will not put too much pressure on this. If the day will come when I reach No. 1, that would be amazing,\" said the German.\n\nMATURITY\n\n\"I learned a lot of things the last year, especially with the Singapore thing. So I will try to enjoy every moment right now because it's one of the best seasons of my career.\"\n\nMuguruza, the world No. 3, has an outside chance of taking the top spot.\n\nBut the 22-year-old Spaniard, who made her Grand Slam breakthrough after beating Williams in the final of this year's French Open, has time on her side. She is 12 years younger than Williams.\n\nWhen the American first made No. 1 back in 2002, Muguruza was just eight.\n\n\"I feel the discussion (over the world No. 1 ranking) is much louder,\" said the Venezuela-born player.\n\n\"There are a couple of players that if they do really well and whatever the situations are, they can reach No. 1. So that creates a little bit of juicy comment.\"\n\nThe discussion is louder also because of the calibre of the players involved - both Kerber and Muguruza are now Grand Slam winners.\n\nOver the last decade, however, there were several women who became the top-ranked player without winning a Major either at the time or since.\n\nJelena Jankovic (18 weeks in total in 2008 and 2009), Dinara Safina (26 weeks in two 2009 spells) and Caroline Wozniacki (two periods stretching over 2010/11 and 2011/12, totalling 67 weeks).\n\nAll three women made the finals at Majors, went to No. 1 but never cracked a Grand Slam title.\n\nJankovic was runner-up at the 2008 US Open, Safina made the finals of the 2008 Australian Open and 2008 and 2009 French Opens.\n\nWozniacki was twice a finalist in New York - in 2009 and 2014.\n\nSix defeats in total - Williams was responsible for three of them. - AFP.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/79d0d7ba5e004606af7491b7ec92717f492e3b7073a1c5909c6a3b2bac123483/NP_20160829_WOMTEN29_1369495.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "UNDER SIEGE: Angelique Kerber and Garbine Muguruza will be Serena Williams (above) biggest threats at the US Open.", "caption": "UNDER SIEGE: Angelique Kerber and Garbine Muguruza will be Serena Williams (above) biggest threats at the US Open."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It's a slightly different mentality to maybe when you're younger and you feel like you have a bit more time on your side,\" said Murray.\n\nMurray has played in all of the first three finals of the Majors in 2016, losing to world No. 1 Djokovic in Melbourne and Paris before defeating Milos Raonic in straight sets in the Wimbledon final.\n\nMurray's consistency on the tour in recent weeks is in stark contrast to the roller-coaster fortunes of reigning champion Djokovic.\n\nAfter he won a maiden French Open to complete the career Grand Slam, all talk was of the Serb going on to retain his Wimbledon and US Open titles and clinch a calendar Grand Slam.\n\nThe expectations proved too heavy a burden when the 12-time Major winner was dumped out of Wimbledon in the third round for his earliest loss at a Major in seven years.\n\nA shock first-round defeat at the Olympics by Juan Martin del Potro and a withdrawal from Cincinnati with a wrist injury suggested all is not well with the 2011 and 2015 US Open winner.\n\n\"I am not 100 per cent.

I saw his will to work and improve, and find a good shape very quickly. I can also say that his performance can still improve.\n\nTITLE CHALLENGE\n\n\"But I'm pleased with his commitment and workrate - and the same goes for all the players. The attitude is good and I like this.\"\n\nHazard's performance in Chelsea's latest win hints at good things to come for the Blues, who are hoping to challenge for the title this season despite the huge amounts of money spent by rivals such as Manchester United and Manchester City.\n\nConte, who came straight to Stamford Bridge after guiding Italy to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016, has totally transformed the atmosphere in west London - and getting the best out of Hazard could be the key to future success.\n\n\"I'm pleased for him, but also for Pedro as a winger too,\" said Conte, who brought the former Barcelona wide man on against Burnley and saw him set up the third goal a minute from time.\n\n\"These are players with great talent, fantastic in one versus one. When you have these players with great talent, it's good for me to put them in the best condition to excite with this talent.\n\n\"It's a pity that now there is this international break. After three wins, I wanted to continue playing games. But we have to stop.\n\n\"Starting the season with three league wins and one in the cup is good for the confidence of the players, the fans, for the club, for me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Burnley manager Sean Dyche knows he needs to move quickly in a very difficult transfer market to prevent his side losing heavily at places like Stamford Bridge in future.\n\n\"It's tough,\" he said.\n\n\"That's the reality of where we're at as a club. It's a tough market. I'm hearing that from managers across the board.

In the second half he dropped physically. But of course we need him.\n\n\"I think what we have seen from him today is what we want from him. To give assists but as well to score goals.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nSep 9, 2022, 11:08am\n\nEnglish Premier League fixtures postponed after Queen Elizabeth's death\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"So I'm very happy that he scored today because that's what he has to add to his game.\n\n\"We paid a heavy price in our first game (the 4-3 defeat by Liverpool) because we were not ready.\n\n\"Now Mesut is nearly there, not completely, but he just goes again. For us, the break is not welcome.\"\n\nThe pressure had been on Wenger and his side heading into the weekend after perfect starts from both Manchester clubs had left them playing catch-up.\n\nThis, then, was just the performance and outcome required heading into the international break.\n\n\"I believe we shot ourselves in the foot in first game and were under huge pressure. We had two difficult away games (against Leicester City and Watford) but today I believe we had a good solid performance,\" Wenger said.\n\n\"We had a good cushion at half-time. At the moment we are not completely there physically and you could see that in the second half.\"\n\nNEW ARRIVALS\n\nThe imminent arrivals of defender Shkodran Mustafi from Valencia and striker Lucas Perez from Deportivo La Coruna, both of whom Wenger confirmed had passed medicals, should go a step towards placating fans left frustrated by their sluggish start.\n\n\"I think they should go through, both of them,\" he said.\n\n\"They've had medicals and we have to finish the paperwork. I don't know exactly when we'll announce it, but I think we'll announce it in the middle of the week.\"  - AFP.\n\nenglish premier league\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 23, 2021, 03:35pm\n\nHolland not counting on van Dijk for Euros\n\nMar 23, 2021, 03:11pm\n\nThiago laments emotional difficulty of pandemic football\n\nMar 10, 2021, 04:22pm\n\nMourinho looking to mark career milestone with trophy for Spurs\n\nMar 9, 2021, 09:56am\n\nChelsea's mean defence is down to trust and courage: Tuchel\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/432c63c2c98fee4fcad98b0e32440688d578198bc1972704a183b7c30f80dc5b/NP_20160829_ARS29_1369572.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6432b67dd00690b82eaf11d27c5f42a592228f6a564c4b4d552a61210421b81d/dw-football-qe2-220909.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "English Premier League fixtures postponed after Queen Elizabeth's death", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5de22c0d94ccaaa9c5aab6910a26b058bbe4700b6c649266195497f929b10221/vvd24.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Holland not counting on van Dijk for Euros", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Some had joined the security agencies when Singapore and Malaysia were riddled with communist assassins.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1956, there were more than 20 incidents of communist gunmen shooting, stabbing and even lobbing grenades at police officers, Voluntary Special Constables and detectives - many of whom were hurt and killed.\n\nThese men donned their uniforms during those turbulent years.\n\nMany of the 13 men on that Feb 9, 1974, Japan Airlines flight to Kuwait had seen frontline action prior.\n\nRetired Lieutenant-Colonel Clarence Tan Kim Peng served with several units including the Malaysian Special Operations Force during Konfrontasi (1963-1966).\n\nSuperintendent S. Rajagopal of the counter terrorism unit, Internal Security Department (ISD), was trained to take the bullet while protecting Singapore's first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew from communist assassins (1959-1960).\n\nAnd the men continued to be involved in major operations, away from prying eyes and never for self-glorification.\n\nISD deputy director Seah Wai Toh was involved in negotiating the surrender of four armed Vietnamese who had hijacked an Air Vietnam flight in 1977.\n\nMr Saraj Din, also of ISD, was involved in the 1991 SQ117 operations in which four Pakistani hijackers seized a Singapore Airlines plane.\n\nUstaz Abu Bakar, who was a Syariah Court official in 1974, was involved in the rehabilitation of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorists here.\n\nSo much of the discourse of Singapore is wrapped around its position as an economic miracle.\n\nBut without men and women like the 13 in 1974, there would be no security. Without security, there would be no economic miracle.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Was resolved and life is going on like everything else.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal insisted yesterday morning that they have no intention of loosening their grip on power despite the sport's \"Big Four\" slipping into the twilight of their careers.\n\nMurray, Nadal, Djokovic and Roger Federer have accounted for 46 of the last 53 Majors among them.\n\nThe physical cracks are starting to show - Djokovic and Nadal have been bothered by wrist problems in recent weeks while 35-year-old Federer has shut down his 2016 season due to a knee injury.\n\nBut Murray, described by top-10 rival Kei Nishikori as \"Ironman\" for his battling run to the Olympic Games gold medal in Rio, says that at 29 years old, he is using his age as a motivating factor.\n\n\"I'd imagine I'd be playing at this level for three, four more years, max,\" said Murray, the holder of three Grand Slam titles.\n\n\"It's not easy to do that. I hope I'm still playing like this when I'm 38 years old, but it's pretty unlikely.\n\n\"I want to make the most of every tournament I play in and try and win and achieve as much as I can the next few years.\"\n\nNadal, a year older than both Djokovic and Murray at 30, has endured a catalogue of injury woes throughout his career, but went on a marathon run at the Olympics where he lost in the semi-finals of the singles but won gold in the men's doubles.\n\n\"The 'Big Four' are getting older. But still Novak is No. 1, Andy No. 2,\" said 14-time Grand Slam champion Nadal.\n\n\"It's obvious that we will not be here forever, but I think I can play to the level I had before my injury for the next three, four years.\"\n\nDjokovic believes that he remains at the peak of his powers despite a shock third-round loss at Wimbledon.\n\n\"I'm 29 and believe that I'm at a peak of my abilities as a tennis player,\" said the Serb.\n\n\"I'll try to keep that peak as consistent and enduring as much as possible.\"\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nTennis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 02:25am\n\nChinese tennis player Peng Shuai denies making accusation of sexual assault\n\nFeb 4, 2022, 08:01am\n\nBarca official resigns after calling Spanish tennis star Nadal an 'enemy of the state'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nDance your WiFi troubles away with StarHub Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b2939108a54d3cc0e941dff11fe7a9a52a996839db59a4e9ce506506332d441e/federer.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Federer bids emotional farewell to tennis at Laver Cup", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b33f7573f28d39ddab2516b5cc97ac9b727167a778a61651942e1ca8f8be39e3/ac_serena1_010922.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Serena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I think I just am more relaxed, for sure.\"\n\nWilliams, 34, said her shoulder issues surfaced the day after the Wimbledon final, where she beat Angelique Kerber of Germany to win her 22nd Grand Slam singles title to match Steffi Graf for most in the Open era.\n\nThe hard-serving American has played only seven tournaments this year, with a third-round exit from the Rio Olympic singles and a first-round elimination from the Rio doubles with sister Venus her only tournament action since Wimbledon.\n\n\"I think usually I prefer to play more coming into the final Grand Slam of the year, but there is nothing we can do about it. You just have to make the best of every single opportunity. That's all I can do now,\" she said.\n\nWith Kerber, who beat Williams in the final of the Australian Open, threatening to leapfrog her into the world No. 1 spot at last week's Western & Southern Open, the American asked for a Cincinnati wildcard but, after practising there, decided she could not compete.\n\nThe German fell in the final to Karolina Pliskova, allowing Williams to hold the top spot through the Open and extend her streak to 186 weeks at No. 1, equalling Graf for the longest continuous reign.\n\nFirst up for Williams in New York will be Russian left-hander Ekaterina Makarova, who has lost four of five matches to the American but beat her at the 2012 Australian Open.\n\n\"I'm okay with it,\" Williams said about the draw.\n\n\"I try to look at it, we all always have tough matches. \"She's a big fighter.

Until now, of course, results help.\"\n\nThe 45-year-old added that new signing Claudio Bravo will not be rushed straight into the starting 11 for their Premier League clash with West Ham tonight.\n\nThe Chile international completed a £13.75-million ($24.5m) move from Barcelona to City earlier this week and was expected to be immediately installed as Guardiola's new No. 1.\n\nNOT READY\n\nBut the Spaniard, who has so far preferred Willy Caballero to Joe Hart in the Premier League, does not think the 33-year-old Bravo is ready for action yet.\n\nIt is therefore likely that Caballero will play, even though England international Hart was restored to the starting line-up for Thursday's Champions League play-off victory over Steaua Bucharest.\n\nGuardiola said of Bravo: \"He's fit, but he's not going to play this weekend.\"\n\nThe manager, however, made clear he feels the new signing fits the bill in terms of the ball-playing goalkeeper he is looking for, with Hart's distribution being his perceived weakness.\n\nThe City boss said of Bravo: \"He's a goalkeeper with a lot of experience in Spain and with the (Chile) national team.\n\n\"His experience, to anticipate situations not in the box and in front of the box, being good in the build-up play and quick under the posts - he is a good player for us.\"\n\nThe Chilean, meanwhile, said that his new boss and his footballing philosophy are infectious.\n\n\"I think when the best manager in the world explains a project to you, it makes you motivated to see football differently.

It reflects a serious and fair solution for European club football.\n\n\"I am particularly pleased with the fact that the European football community remains united moving forward.\"\n\nUefa has been without a president since last December when Frenchman Michel Platini was banned for eight years by global football body Fifa for ethics violations, later reduced to four on appeal by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nUefa will hold an election to find a replacement for Platini in Athens on Sept 16.\n\nMichael van Praag, Angel Maria Villar and Aleksandar Ceferin, the heads of the Dutch, Spanish and Slovenian federations respectively, are the three candidates.\n\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo won the Uefa Best Player in Europe Award on Thursday after winning both last season's Champions League and Euro 2016 with Portugal.\n\nRonaldo, 31, received the accolade for the second time in his career, after finishing ahead of Real teammate Gareth Bale and Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann.\n\n\"I'm obviously delighted to receive this award. It's been an incredible season, but the two other players deserve it as well,\" said Ronaldo, who also won the prize in 2013-14.\n\nRonaldo struck the winning spot-kick as Real claimed a record 11th European Cup title, beating city rivals Atletico on penalties in May, before leading his country to Euro 2016 glory.\n\nRonaldo scored three goals en route to the final of the tournament to equal Platini's record of nine goals in the European Championship Finals.\n\nThe award was voted for by journalists from each of Uefa's 55 member associations. - Wire Services.\n\nSILVERWARE: Cristiano Ronaldo is Uefa's Best Player in Europe after lifting the Champions League trophy (above) with Real Madrid and winning Euro 2016 with Portugal.

When they met in this fixture in the 2014/15 season, they drew 1-1. In their last five meetings, Chelsea have led at the interval.\n\nCan try: Chelsea on 1/2 Goal\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE v BOURNEMOUTH\n\nLast season, the Eagles were dismal at home - winning six from 19.\n\nBut the same goes for the Cherries. They, too, won only six times while on the road. Last season, 32 of Bournemouth's matches had goals at the break. In all, 22 of them ended EVEN.

Seven of their last 10 meetings ended with one goal at the interval.\n\nCan try: Everton 1-0 at the break\n\nLEICESTER v SWANSEA\n\nLast season, the wily Foxes scored seven goals against the Swans - without reply.

The Black Cats, on the other hand, were disappointing when on the road, winning just three from their 19 away games.\n\nOn last season's stats, EVEN seems the way to go. Their last three meetings saw them level at the break.\n\nCan try: THREE on Total Goals\n\nHULL v MAN UNITED\n\nThe head-to-head stats say the Tigers cannot win. However, when the two teams last met in May 2015, Hull held on to a 0-0 draw.\n\nWorth noting that last season, the Red Devils won just seven of 19 when playing away and EVEN seemed to be the call in Man United matches. So far this season, it's been Even-Even.\n\nCan try: Man United on the 1x2\n\nWEST BROM v MIDDLESBROUGH\n\nThe last time these two teams clashed was in the Championship of the 2009/10 season.\n\nThat season, the Baggies won 5-0 (away) and 2-0 (home). Only once in their last 10 meetings has it been 0-0 at the interval. The last time Boro beat West Brom was in 2006.\n\nCan try: EVEN on Even-Odd option\n\nMAN CITY v WEST HAM\n\nOnly twice in their last 10 meetings have they marched off all square.\n\nLast season, Man City lost just five from 19 matches at home while the Hammers also lost five of 19 when playing away.

I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm saying it's very difficult.\n\n\"We have a decision completely made about (Paul) Pogba, (Ander) Herrera, (Morgan) Schneiderlin, (Marouane) Fellaini and Michael Carrick (Schweinsteiger's fellow central midfielders).\n\n\"We have five players for two positions. It's very difficult that an opportunity will arrive.\"\n\nAfter reports emerged of ex-Bayern man Schweinsteiger, a World Cup winner with Germany, being made to train with United's reserves by his new manager Mourinho, Rummenigge was quoted earlier this month as saying he could \"hardly believe\" such treatment, labelling it \"a lack of respect for a worthy player\".\n\nAnd Mourinho said yesterday: \"I thought after I read some quotes from people at Bayern Munich that they would run to Manchester to bring him (Schweinsteiger) back, but no, that did not happen.\n\n\"I am quite surprised that Mr Rummennigge is not here now to take him back.\"\n\nSchweinsteiger has two years left on his United contract and, in terms of the prospect of him staying on at United despite not playing, Mourinho said: \"I cannot answer for him. It's his life. It's his career.\n\n\"He has a contract with Man United and has the right to make that decision to stay.\n\n\"That's not a problem for us. Football is made of decisions. I did that all my career.\n\n\"Bastian is not speaking a lot. He gave this last statement, which he is completely free to do in an objective and polite way like he did. There are no problems at all.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hull's caretaker boss Mike Phelan is not expecting any new signings to boost his threadbare squad before tomorrow morning's (Singapore time) game against Man United despite \"a few fees\" being agreed.\n\n\"We've agreed a few fees but haven't got into discussions yet down the line as to what else it's going to cost us on top of that,\" he said.\n\n\"We need as many as we can get. We talked a few weeks ago about maybe six, now that may be more, it may be less. We just have to pursue our interests and see if we can do those deals.\"\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nepl\n\nManchester United\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e063cad2e2a0fd55f70b7eb997d95ce9631ea9f5a00942d8f56354cfe12d876b/NP_20160827_UNITED27_1368408.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jose Mourinho.", "caption": "Jose Mourinho."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

She was banned for 30 days in 2015 after an incident at one of the national team's training camps.\n\n\"Taking into consideration the past incidents involving Hope, as well as the private conversations we've had requiring her to conduct herself in a manner befitting a US National Team member, US Soccer determined this is the appropriate disciplinary action.\"\n\nSolo labelled Sweden \"cowards\" after the world champion Americans' bid for a fourth straight Olympic gold ended in quarter-final defeat.\n\n\"We played a bunch of cowards,\" Solo said.\n\n\"The better team did not win today. I strongly believe that. I don't think they're going to make it far in the tournament.\"\n\nSolo made the comments because she felt the Swedes, who finished runners-up to gold medallists Germany, were playing too defensively.\n\nThe defeat was the Americans' first in 15 games at the Olympics and only their third in Games history, having won four golds and a silver since women's football was introduced to the Olympic programme.\n\nUS Soccer said in the news release that Solo won't be eligible to try out for the national team again until next February. - AFP.\n\nFootball\n\nRio Olympics\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Money Market Funds in Singapore for Smarter Cash Management\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5198791845f97e5be8e7b33691b240f021d6adcf5205cbdb22a365a2e6f46340/NP_20160826_HOPE26_1367106.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It's been really good.\"\n\nMurray has played in all of the first three finals of the Majors in 2016, losing to world No. 1 Djokovic in Melbourne and Paris before putting Milos Raonic, one of the sport's widely-hyped new generation, in his place in a straight-set spanking in the Wimbledon final.\n\nThe only worry for Murray is his relatively mediocre record in New York in the years since his first win - runs to the quarter-finals in 2013 and 2014 were followed by a fourth-round exit to Kevin Anderson of South Africa 12 months ago. - AFP.\n\nTennis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 02:25am\n\nChinese tennis player Peng Shuai denies making accusation of sexual assault\n\nFeb 4, 2022, 08:01am\n\nBarca official resigns after calling Spanish tennis star Nadal an 'enemy of the state'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nRECOMMENDATION", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b2939108a54d3cc0e941dff11fe7a9a52a996839db59a4e9ce506506332d441e/federer.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Federer bids emotional farewell to tennis at Laver Cup", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b33f7573f28d39ddab2516b5cc97ac9b727167a778a61651942e1ca8f8be39e3/ac_serena1_010922.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Serena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

We showed quality, we showed the right spirit, we showed character. I am proud of what they have done and how they fought,\" said Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic.\n\nBoro manager Karanka was annoyed at seeing his side crash out to a side from a lower league.\n\nHe said: \"I'm disappointed because I said before the game this trophy is very important for the club.\n\n\"I have to apologise to our crowd because they came here midweek and it's an important trophy for this club, we respect this trophy a lot. So this has been difficult.\"\n\nKaranka made six changes for the tie, but does not believe his selection can be blamed for the result.\n\n\"They (Fulham) made 10 changes, so it's not a good explanation,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes you think the game is going to be easy because the other team play with 10 different players and you score the first goal. That was the biggest mistake.\n\n\"We thought we were better than the other team, we relaxed on the pitch. This kind of attitude reminds me of the past.\"\n\nMiddlesbrough's disappointment was made worse by injuries to two left backs - Fabio da Silva and George Friend - which leaves Karanka with a problem ahead of Sunday's trip to West Brom.\n\nIt could force the manager into the transfer market, but he insists he will not make any knee-jerk decisions.\n\nHe said: \"I don't know if I'll bring in one or two or three. But I won't say today because we lost the game we need five players. It's the same as I said two weeks ago.\" - Wire Services.\n\nOTHER RESULTS\n\nMorecambe 1 Bournemouth 2\n\nSunderland 1 Shrewsbury 0\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/474b6fbc2e079a80f6e542373b0bfce6bfdeeb2c1617d03460b2f7885ec3dbe3/NP_20160826_BURN26_1367003.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "OUT THEY GO: David Nugent's (top, in blue) goal for Middlesbrough is not enough to stop his side tumbling out of the League Cup, a fate also suffered by Burnley, after Accrington Stanley's Matthew Pearson scores the winner in extra time.", "caption": "OUT THEY GO: David Nugent's (top, in blue) goal for Middlesbrough is not enough to stop his side tumbling out of the League Cup, a fate also suffered by Burnley, after Accrington Stanley's Matthew Pearson scores the winner in extra time."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

If successful, 80 to 100 units will be rolled out in the near future at \"cool zones\" within four of Mandai Park Holdings' wildlife parks: the Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park.\n\nThe cool zones include areas such as ticketing counters and restaurants, said Mandai Park Holdings' group chief executive officer Mike Barclay.\n\nWhile a timeline for the roll-out and cost has not been determined, Mr Gareth Tang, the project's engineering lead and general manager for Innosparks, said that cost-effectiveness is key for cooling large outdoor spaces.\n\nAn Airbitat unit costs $2.50 a day to run, while an air-con unit with a similar capacity costs about $12.50, said Mr Tang.\n\nSingapore\n\nSingapore Zoo\n\nanimals\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e4097cd49a13108451f2614e3b7070d4394880dd539f3d6bab9afa7ecbfa6b26/NP_20160826_NWZOO26_1367103.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "REFRESHING: (Above) Steffi Teo, 8, and her brother Leroy, 6, enjoying the cool air from the Airbitat Smart Cooler.

article is more than 12 months old\n\nAug 25, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nM'sia to table marriage law amendments\n\nShare this article\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced yesterday that amendments to the marriage law would be tabled in the next Parliament session, possibly ending years of disputes over parenting rights between divorced Muslims and non-Muslim spouses.\n\nHe said the amendment would be founded on the principle of fairness for all so that couples can settle their marriage issues in civil court and move on with their lives.\n\nHe added that there was a need to address loopholes in the law or any overlapping ones in existing laws.\n\n\"The amendment of this Act will provide an opportunity for partners to resolve the issue of civil marriage in the civil courts, thus enabling them to continue their life like other couples to marry non-Muslims,\" Malaysian media reported Mr Najib as saying.\n\n\"At the same time, the clash between the Civil Court and Syariah Court arising from conversion to Islam by one of the spouses may be removed and the legislative gaps and duplication of the provisions within the existing law may be resolved.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul

parenting rights after well-known court cases of  unilateral conversion also highlighted issues of child support and custody.\n\nMr Najib said the amendments would \"maintain the principle of plurality\" besides upholding the rule of Islam.\n\nIn 2009, the Malaysian cabinet decided to bar unilateral conversion of children, but the proposed amendments were shelved from being tabled in Parliament after intervention by the Conference of Rulers.\n\nmalaysia\n\nNajib Razak\n\nIslam\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia

He was 92.\n\nIn the presence of his family, Mr Nathan was also given the highest honour accorded to a leader: The Singapore flag draped over the casket.\n\nVigil guards, comprising four uniformed officers, stood at the corners of the casket with their heads bowed, backs turned away and ceremonial sword inverted - a special mark of respect.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 27, 2025, 12:11am\n\nWho's that man acting as President Tharman at NDP rehearsals?

He had taken the bus and arrived at 7am to say \"goodbye to a humble leader\".\n\nAnother was Madam Rohani Dukiran, 48, who postponed her dialysis treatment to the afternoon \"so that I can pay respects to a man who was genuinely concerned for ordinary Singaporeans like my children and me\".\n\nMadam Rohani, who suffers from kidney failure, said she met Mr Nathan twice.\n\nThe first meeting was in 2004, when her children, who were in the West View Primary School brass band, won gold at the Singapore Youth Festival and were invited to play at the Istana.\n\nThe next and last meeting was in 2009, when Mr Nathan helped cook briyani at the Charity Briyani Project at the President's Challenge.\n\nA BOW AND A PRAYER\n\nIn the main hall yesterday, people from all walks of life shuffled through, stopping to bow  and say a prayer.

We had prepared for the match well and we knew what to do out there, but we didn't do the right things.\n\n\"Nor did they create chances but they scored early from a free-kick out wide.\n\n\"We didn't play well and we got two red cards. We gave everything even when we were down to nine men. Then we conceded a second and it was game over.\"\n\nBut for Porto's Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas, it was a memorable match.\n\nIt gave him a chance to play in the Champions League for a remarkable 18th consecutive season.\n\nFormer Manchester United star Ryan Giggs is the only player to have achieved the feat before his retirement in 2014.\n\nCasillas, 35, tweeted after the game: \"Victory in Rome and qualification for the Champions League, great team!!!\"\n\nHe added: \"I've been in the Champions League for many years now and it's important to be in Europe's biggest competition. We've got big ambitions.\"\n\nCasillas lifted the Champions League trophy three times during his 16 seasons at Real Madrid.\n\nThe Spain international made his debut in the competition in September 1999 against Olympiakos.  - Wire Services.\n\nsport\n\nFootball\n\nChampions League\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThese 5 S-REITs Are Outperforming in 2025 - Here’s Why\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ba3e044f74df0e8640c1ef178ee60bb327aca38e31f710a74e7d93e2404f75c3/NP_20160825_CHAMPS25_1366003.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "DOWN AND OUT: Roma captain Danielle de Rossi (above) is given the marching orders.", "caption": "DOWN AND OUT: Roma captain Danielle de Rossi (above) is given the marching orders."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

One of the sniffers suddenly stopped and went back to a spot.\n\nThat was where the digging would start, but former firefighter Daniela Romanato, who was helping out with the rescue operation, did not hold out much hope.\n\n\"The dogs are trained to search and indicate trapped people.\n\n\"One has indicated there is someone underneath the rubble here, but no barking means the person is most likely dead,\" she said.\n\n\"We're sending a smaller dog in to see if it can get closer to the person, but it's very unlikely we're talking about survivors under here.\"\n\nSEARCH\n\nMr Bordo's brother Domenico looked on as the search progressed.\n\nHe said: \"We live quite far away, but felt the quake. We rushed to get news from the television and as soon as we saw it was here, we called my sister, but she didn't answer.\n\n\"I feared the worst and was right. I don't see how she could have survived under there.\"\n\nIn Accumoli, photographer Emiliano Grillotti said he saw over 15 people digging with their bare hands to save a family of four, according to La Repubblica.\n\nThis latest disaster was Italy's most powerful earthquake since 2009, when some 300 people died in and around the city of L'Aquila, just to the south of the area hit yesterday.\n\nMs Lina Mercantini of Ceselli, Umbria, told Reuters: \"It was so strong. It seemed the bed was walking across the room by itself with us on it.\"\n\nThe shocks were strong enough to wake residents of central Rome, some 150km away.\n\nThe worst damage was suffered by Pescara del Tronto, a hamlet near Arquata in the Marche region which \"just completely disintegrated\", according to mayor Aleandro Petrucci.\n\nMr Tommaso della Longa, a Red Cross spokesman, said the town of Amatrice, which was at the epicentre of the quake, has been \"almost completely destroyed\".\n\nEARTHQUAKES\n\nItaly\n\ndisaster\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 10, 2025, 06:39am\n\nSingapore Red Cross commits another $550,000 worth of supplies for Myanmar quake aid\n\nApr 5, 2025, 12:41am\n\nSingapore sends second wave of aid to quake-hit Myanmar\n\nApr 2, 2025, 01:30am\n\n'We won't give up': S'pore's Operation Lionheart presses on in Myanmar\n\nApr 1, 2025, 07:41am\n\nEarthquake tremors don't deter S'porean influencer from completing facelift in bangkok\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b952f92606be34b34d833eb030a0ef65cc8d89a7bbf2728ab7a11cafc32e6129/NP_20160825_QUAKE25_1366093.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CATASTROPHE: Buildings were reduced to dusty piles of masonry in communities close to the epicentre of the quake.

Especially for the fans who don't deserve to see us losing like that.\n\n\"They were very warm and they didn't deserve that performance.\n\n\"Until we scored, we were in control. We created about seven or eight chances and, as soon as we got ahead, we completely changed the way we played.\n\n\"I need to change this mentality of the players when we go ahead. I'm very angry because we can't see the danger of teams when we go ahead.\n\n\"The moment we go ahead, we should continue to play well, but we couldn't see the danger and got complacent.\n\n\"Instead of becoming stronger and working harder, we changed our attitude completely. I don't think I made too many changes, we were creating chances regardless.\n\n\"It was the same team in the second half, so I don't think it's a fair assessment to say I made too many changes. The fans are right to be upset, they deserved better.\n\n\"The players are fit enough. Even though all players get tired in extra time, perhaps they were mentally tired a bit.\"\n\nGillingham boss Justin Edinburgh, though, hailed the result as the best of his 10-year managerial career.\n\nHe said: \"In the end, we deserved it. We had to ride our luck a little bit in the first half.\n\n\"When we missed the penalty, I thought we missed our chance but we showed great courage and spirit to keep going.\n\nCHARACTER\n\n\"For Dack to come back from the penalty miss shows the character of the man.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can keep hold of him. We're not in a position to sell but, if he does want to leave, we'll get the right fee that his talents demand.\n\n\"It's a proud moment for the club to come to a Premier League team with international stars and win. The level of fitness from my players was quite extraordinary.\n\n\"It's a credit to the players that they continued to press late on when Watford looked a bit jaded. It's without a doubt the biggest win of my managerial career and it's great for the club.\n\n\"We know that we had to fight harder and run harder than we usually do.

They've had a couple of opportunities and the two goals are poor goals from our point of view.\n\n\"If we had come here and didn't open them up and didn't play well, then you can slaughter us, but we did that.\n\n\"We've not hit the back of the net and that's what you have to do.

They were banned from football for eight years in December.\n\nA Fifa appeals committee cut those penalties to six years in February, just before Blatter's successor, Gianni Infantino, was elected as Fifa's new president.\n\nBlatter's hopes for redemption at CAS are likely hampered by Platini's failed appeal at the Lausanne-based court.\n\nIn a May ruling, CAS judges said they were \"not convinced\" that the $2m payment was legitimate.\n\nThey did, however, reduce the suspension against the former European football chief to four years. Throughout the protracted saga, both Blatter and Platini have insisted the payment was part of a legitimate oral contract.\n\nArguments at CAS are expected to last one day, although a decision may take several weeks. - AFP.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

They set aside 'safety budgets' to cover the enforcement fines.\"\n\nAnother factor, he said, was workers' health.\n\nIn the last three years, a third of work fatalities involved workers with existing medical conditions such as heart disease and hypertension that were aggravated by work, resulting in accidents.\n\nHe also stressed the growing need to redesign jobs for elderly workers, observing that 18 per cent of the accidents in the first half of this year involved workers aged 55 and older.\n\nHe called for a more \"progressive and pervasive culture\" to be inculcated in WSH here.\n\nWorkplace Accident\n\nSingapore\n\nLim Swee Say\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 29, 2022, 08:39am\n\nRifle Range workplace death: Victim was to be married in Sept\n\nNov 29, 2022, 10:36am\n\nTwo more workplace deaths, with one falling into the sea and another falling from height\n\nOct 17, 2021, 10:50pm\n\nCleaner dies in Punggol HDB trash compactor\n\nOct 8, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nMan falls through rubbish chute in Bukit Merah\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f94f5e5209f3e80d8a01dc49753ff5f4b20321b3c715ab55ad74c0b17dc7e6cf/FOR-FB.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Container falls on forklift at Pasir Panjang Terminal, man taken to hospital", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/473338adbeae0501db22142420eea0c05d3e87632ee53e3f4df916ab6f66b58c/20221229433435211545e7ad-7b1c-4df0-b47d-68e39286e7ed_0.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Rifle Range workplace death: Victim was to be married in Sept", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

And it came early.\n\nNguyen opened Red Lantern in Sydney in 2001 when he was just 23 years old. The Vietnamese restaurant, with branches in Sydney and Brisbane, has won many awards.\n\nHe has plans to take Red Lantern to Hong Kong and Vietnam.\n\nLOVE FOR FOOD\n\nAll this wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for his love for street food.\n\n\"Street food has always been fascinating to me as it's the real food of the country that you're travelling in.\n\n\"Sitting or standing there on the street and eating, you really get a sense of where you are, and you get to converse and meet the locals and get a sense of the real history behind the country,\" said Nguyen.\n\nHe spoke of how he would take back these food memories and then tweak the recipes a little for his restaurant menu.\n\n\"The street food vendors have been cooking for generations and generations, so they've really got the flavours right.\n\n\"I'd take street food dishes from all over Asia and use Wagyu beef, Kurobuta pork or organic vegetables, and bring (the dish) up to more of a restaurant experience.\"\n\nNguyen's family, refugees from Vietnam, settled in Sydney's Cabramatta suburb, where \"a lot of the Vietnamese community or the Vietnamese boat people lived\".\n\n\"Living (there), you could be living in Saigon, so I grew up (amid) a very strong Vietnamese culture. So when I travel (around) Asia or back to Vietnam, I really feel like I'm at home.\"\n\nNguyen hopes to be able to come to Singapore for his next series, as \"Singapore's food culture is very vibrant and diverse\".\n\n\"I can go to Singapore and feel like I'm in three or four different countries at once... it's such a melting pot of Asian cultures.\"\n\nBy\n\nJoanne Soh\n\nRead articles by Joanne Soh\n\nmakan\n\nVietnam\n\nhawker\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 7, 2025, 09:00am\n\nWill Uncle Roger eventually show Singaporeans what 'proper' fried rice is?\n\nSep 11, 2024, 07:22am\n\nUncle Roger slammed for 'poor' joke at his new restaurant\n\nAug 27, 2024, 06:01am\n\nFrom dishwasher to chef, Prince prepares meals fit for a king\n\nJul 5, 2024, 03:37am\n\nMakan ideas for that get-together of foodies\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/73c32b7e19ab4c0d25d83738591a209f59100c19f347c68446ae7bd2df137204/np_20160824_jsluke24-f1m_1363444.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "FOODIE: Vietnamese-Australian chef and restaurateur Luke Nguyen on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City for the TV series Luke Nguyen’s Street Food Asia.

Yet a last-minute scramble meant that venues and a new metro line to the Olympic Park were ready in time.\n\nSecurity fears, which prompted the deployment of 85,000 police and security staff for the Games, were also proven wrong - there were no major attacks of the kind seen recently in Europe.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 25, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSolo handed six-month ban\n\nMore related stories\n\nYet, in terms of the long-term benefits to residents and the image of Rio to the outside world, the Games could have been so much more.\n\n\"If we're content to call the absence of catastrophe an Olympic success, then I suppose it was a success but, if that is the case, we are setting the bar too low,\" said Jules Boykoff, a professor at Pacific University in Oregon and author of a book on the political history of the Games.\n\n\"From the point of view of the lives of ordinary people in Rio, it was not a successful Games. It was a massively missed opportunity.\"\n\nIn 2009, when a triumphant Brazil won the right to host the Games by a landslide at an IOC meeting in Copenhagen, a tearful President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said it would seal Brazil's entry into the club of \"first-class\" nations.\n\n\"The world has recognised that the time has come for Brazil!\" Lula said, predicting the Games would showcase the nation's improved governance and booming economic growth.\n\nSeven years later, the Games arrived at just the wrong moment for Brazil. Its economy has been ravaged by a commodities collapse, while a corruption scandal has ensnared the construction firms building infrastructure for the Games and swept Lula's leftist Workers Party from power.\n\nThe run-up to the Games, an unrivalled moment to showcase Brazil's most picturesque city, was dominated instead by headlines over the impeachment of Lula's successor, Dilma Rousseff, the spread of Zika, and resurgent crime levels in the city's slums due to rising unemployment and under-funded police.\n\nISSUES\n\nThe enduring images of the Games will be not just the great sporting achievements - from US swimmer Michael Phelps' 28th Olympic medal to Usain Bolt's historic sprint \"triple-triple\" - but also the organisational problems, empty seats and crime.\n\n\"The country put its image at risk in bidding for the Games and the risk did not work out because it became brutally obvious Brazil has not resolved its problems,\" said Christopher Gaffney, an Olympic expert and geographer at the University of Zurich, who lived in Rio until last year.\n\nRio's mayor Eduardo Paes accepts that, while progress was made, the Games fell far short of their target in tackling environmental issues like water pollution.\n\nRoughly half the city's sewage still flows untreated into Guanabara bay.\n\nA Reuters study showed that pledges on reducing air pollution were also missed.\n\nCampaigners railed against the relocation of tens of thousands of people to build infrastructure for the Games.\n\nThe decision to focus new transportation routes on the wealthier Western districts, where the Olympic Park was built, meant they would do little to curb the long daily commutes of the poor from Rio's sprawling northern slums.\n\nThe sight of the Maracana Stadium brightly illuminated for the closing ceremony, while a power cut plunged neighbouring streets into darkness epitomised the lopsided benefits of the games.\n\nHIGHER TARIFF\n\nLocal media has reported that electricity tariffs will need to be raised to cover the cost of lighting the Games.\n\nOne major uncertainty is the size of the final bill for the Games, in the midst of the country's deepest economic recession since the 1930s.\n\nThe government has already said it will need to put in more public money to balance the books, yet it is resisting calls to make the Games' accounts public.\n\nMany observers expect the official US$12 billion ($16b) price tag to be exceeded.\n\nFor many in Brazil, the Games will be remembered as a success for one moment - when footballer Neymar clinched the gold medal with the final penalty of the match against Germany.\n\nYet residents like Luciana Cabral, a 25-year-old advertising student, said the Games appeared to have done little to improve the everyday life of ordinary people in Rio.\n\n\"On top of that, we still don't know what the real cost of the infrastructure will be, so we have to wait and see,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't want to say the whole thing was a failure, but there were a lot of things that weren't done well.\" -

It was the 21st straight month of declining inflation.\n\nThis has been the longest stretch of negative inflation seen here since 1977.\n\nOverall consumer prices fell 0.7 per cent last month from July last year, data released yesterday by the Statistics Department showed.\n\nThe decline was slightly higher than economists' forecasts of a 0.5 per cent decrease and the same as the decline in June, The Straits Times reported.\n\nPrivate road transport costs, which includes cars, slid 4.4 per cent year-on-year. The cost of fuel and utilities also fell 8.9 per cent compared with the same month a year ago.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 07:51am\n\n$10 million Toto results to be announced on July 17\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut prices elsewhere in the economy continued to edge upwards.\n\nFood prices rose 2.1 per cent in July compared with the same month a year ago, while the cost of household durables and services increased 3.2 per cent.\n\nCore inflation, which strips out accommodation and private road transport costs to better gauge everyday expenses, was up 1 per cent.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore expects core inflation to pick up gradually over the course of the year, partly because oil prices are expected to be slightly higher in this half of the year compared with the first half.\n\nThe disinflationary effects of Budget measures and other one-off programmes will also ease as time goes by. These measures include medical subsidies under the Pioneer Generation Package, the reduction in the concessionary foreign domestic worker levy, and the abolition of national examination fees for Singaporeans implemented last year.\n\nSingapore\n\nEconomy\n\nBusiness\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3dffca45ca3e48aaf4294aa8e7321533eba807763558babf8bbf0e5a61cfea83/2021101813429777892e2423-c629-486b-a96b-22bba40bd71e.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "$10 million Toto results to be announced on July 17", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/20a80f56aaa212cb613c5994295493e8e42f5a22f114bf3961c2d3d0b98ed1f7/egg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Passers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Another proposed change is allowing public schools to reproduce and share content on student portals for teaching purposes.

One evening, it had about 30 players, mostly in their teens and 20s.\n\n\"It just shows how little data there is about Iran on the Internet,\" said Shayan, 15, complaining about the lack of features in Tehran.\n\nSome people have travelled from the town of Karaj, 30km west of Tehran, to play here, added Shayan.\n\nMeanwhile, Islamic leaders in Malaysia said Muslims should avoid playing the game as it was harmful and could \"lead to gambling\".\n\nThe game went live yesterday.\n\nSenior religious official Zulkifli Mohamad al-Bakri said the city's Islamic Legal Consultative Committee had taken into consideration top scholars' opinions on the cartoon creatures.\n\n\"Pokemon Go and all the Pokemon characters should be avoided as it can bring harm,\" he was quoted as saying by the national news agency Bernama.\n\n\"The game promoted a search for power and deities with certain powers, which could lead to gambling.\"\n\nIRAN\n\npokemon\n\npolice\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nFeb 10, 2025, 11:59pm\n\nS'pore to deport Iranian woman, Malaysian husband deemed to be threat to national security\n\nAug 2, 2024, 09:34am\n\nSIA, Scoot flights avoid Iranian airspace again\n\nFeb 13, 2024, 08:17am\n\nCentenarian to compete in World Aquatics Masters C'ships\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bd7cf2404970574cd84d7df3f699fe0cc9277b8fc2e501c0b1b5238911db8bec/np_20160808_go08_1349015.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "TRAINERS: Iranians playing Pokemon Go in Tehran’s Mellat Park last week.

Animals that are used to human contact would also be easier to manage under the programme.\n\nThe marine mammals will be sent to a 15,000ha bay, which will protect the manatees from marine traffic by way of a no-entry zone.\n\nThe future offspring from the initial 15 manatees will be reintroduced to the wild to repopulate the region.\n\nAccording to National Geographic, there are three species of manatees, all of which are threatened by extinction.\n\nBecause they are large and slow-moving marine mammals, they are often easy targets for hunters who kill them for their oil and hides.\n\nThey are also vulnerable to being hit by boats and getting caught in carelessly discarded fishing nets.\n\nSingapore\n\nanimals\n\nEnvironment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7a969b9f4f954283379b896316cebbb66907efaeac09b50199ac981b4d917e74/np_20160808_nwmanatee08_1349147.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "FAREWELL: Mrs Laurence Beau, deputy head of mission at the Embassy of France, and Mandai Park Holdings group CEO Mike Barclay, feeding a manatee yesterday.

one of three professional boxers competing in the Olympics for the first time in its long history - wagged his finger in the air and shook his head in disbelief and was later seen remonstrating with boxing officials.\n\nAs part of moves to boost its popularity, especially in the United States, Olympic boxing has allowed in the pros, dropped headguards for men and ditched the punch-counting method to decide fights.\n\nBut, if the AIBA, the governing body, hoped it would result in fewer controversies, it may have to think again.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\nLoh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities\n\nMore related stories\n\nNjikam, 32, said that he felt he won at least two of the rounds and some observers agreed.\n\n\"I told them that I came from far away for this competition and I am professional,\" he said, when asked what he had been saying animatedly to boxing officials just outside the venue, as his family looked on.\n\n\"I took too much time to enter the fight in the first round, because I wanted to know what he was going to do.\n\n\"But the second and third rounds, I put on the pressure and I hit him with more punches than he hit me with, so I'm very unhappy with the decision -

Where does Folha get this dumb idea from? They messed up badly,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe Olympic organising committee told AFP in a statement only that \"there is no robbery\", declining to explain further.\n\nBut in a new twist on Monday, a Globo newspaper columnist Lauro Jardim reported that the controversial scene was being axed.\n\nHe said directors had meant to have the scene show a street vendor running up to Ms Bundchen to sell her a bikini.\n\n\"On paper, it was perfect. At the rehearsal yesterday, however, it didn't work,\" the columnist wrote.\n\n\"It gave the impression to those watching that it was about an assault.

This makes Australia seem more religious than it really is,\" said the foundation's president, Ms Kylie Sturgess, who's encouraging people \"to be counted as what they are\".\n\nShe told AFP: \"Our attitude is, well here's an opportunity to have a say on the census; pop down what you are. Maybe 'no religion' suits you, maybe you are someone who has drifted away from the church.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 25, 2025, 09:01am\n\nS'porean charged in Australia with importing 40kg of meth, cocaine into Sydney\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"But unfortunately 'Jedi' is just not an option on the census.\"\n\nThe joke arose years ago when an e-mail campaign wrongly claimed that if 8,000 people put themselves down as Jedi, it would have to be officially recognised as a religion.\n\nAt the 2001 Australian census, more than 70,500 people listed their faith as \"Jedi knight\" or something similar, which would indicate the country had nearly as many believers in the Force as it had members of the Salvation Army.\n\nOTHER COUNTRIES\n\n\"Whether or not people took the claim seriously, it was the start of a reporting phenomenon that gained speed internationally,\" the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said in 2013, adding that New Zealand, Canada, England and Wales subsequently reported large Jedi contingents.\n\nMs Sturgess admitted she has put down Jedi as a \"bit of a laugh\" in the past.\n\n\"But the fact is that the ABS just doesn't count it, they consider it 'not defined',\" she said, adding \"the joke is kinda getting a bit old\".\n\nAustralian statisticians could instead follow Britain's example. In the 2001 England and Wales census, 390,000 people, or 0.7 per cent of the population, entered their religion as \"Jedi\" but they were included among the atheists.\n\nOr they could embrace non-traditional movements as New Zealand did last year when it recognised pastafarians - who wear colanders on their heads, revere pirates and believe the world was created by a giant deity made of spaghetti.\n\nAustralia\n\nreligion\n\nStar Wars\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 22, 2025, 06:11am\n\nAustralian-American woman to become first Singapore-born to travel into space\n\nFeb 22, 2025, 12:14am\n\nAustralian caught with banned items tries to flee S'pore with someone else's passport\n\nDec 11, 2024, 04:04am\n\nS'pore man, 27, remains in custody in Australia for alleged murder\n\nNov 14, 2024, 10:48pm\n\nNew camp for SAF soldiers on Exercise Wallaby in Australia now operational\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c8359826b90f0c4bfb11a11925a936e3fcfa3f9a93556b4be5034bb9f35ee5c1/aidrug250225.jpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "S'porean charged in Australia with importing 40kg of meth, cocaine into Sydney", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f9df3d708781828e2d106633be0d9ea724bb67cdbb93992bea172926e3ecfd1a/Screenshot%202025-02-22%20at%202.09.15%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=318", "alt_text": "Australian-American woman to become first Singapore-born to travel into space", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I mean, look at our faces. Many people say we have the same one.\n\n\"If I have to pick one swimming idol, it will have to be my older sister, who was the first in our family to qualify for the Olympics in 2008 when she was 16.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\nLoh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"She has always been my biggest inspiration. She showed me that anything is possible. As long as you dare to dream it, you can reach it if you try.\"\n\nThe early mornings of waking up at 4.45am and ploughing through seven hours of swimming and gymwork (across three sessions) a day, five times a week, covering up to 60km in the pool is not something that every person empathises with.\n\nBut the Quahs are thankful they have each other.\n\nZheng Wen added: \"Having a familiar face away from home helps and the support my older sister provides me so far away from home is really important to me.\n\n\"That kind of understanding comes only from someone who's also involved in the sport. It's really important that we support each other and push each other to the next level.\n\n\"I have to attribute a lot of my success to family support and the advice my sisters have given me. It's been really invaluable.\"\n\nThis would be Ting Wen's second Olympics after her debut at Beijing 2008. Having missed out on London 2012 through injury, the 23-year-old will be swimming the 100m butterfly in this edition.\n\nGOAL\n\nShe said: \"It was a goal of ours to be able to represent Singapore at an Olympics together and we missed that in 2012, so it's great to be able to do that this year.\n\n\"It's one thing to be able to represent Singapore on the highest level; it's another to do that with someone who has been with you throughout the journey, whom you can trust and share everything with.\n\n\"We are a very small team, but there's no one I'd rather be here and be competing with than Zheng.\"\n\nWhile the duo's pedigree has been proven - they have won a total of 20 gold medals at the SEA Games and seven at the Asian Youth Games - it is Zheng Wen who is proving he can blossom into a world-beater with three silvers and five bronzes across four stops of last year's Fina World Cup series.\n\nIt has been a remarkable rise for a swimmer who had doubts after \"always losing to my compatriots\" before he won his first SEA Games gold medal in the 400m individual medley as a 15-year-old at Indonesia 2011, which convinced him that he has a future in the sport.\n\nAnd, even then, it took plenty of sacrifices and hard work for him to emerge from the bottom of the pool - at London 2012, he was placed 33rd out of 37 swimmers in the 400m IM and was last out of 35 swimmers for the 200m backstroke - and talk about fighting for a final.\n\nZheng Wen said: \"I may not have beaten Chad le Clos or Viktor Bromer but, having raced against them and running them close at the World Cup, I find that I'm not being scared of the occasion and it's awesome.\n\n\"The aim for Rio is to make the semi-finals or a final.

We may disagree how we get there, but we all work towards the same goal of protecting clean athletes.\n\n\"Despite these discrepancies, we agree we must not allow such a situation to happen again.\"\n\nBach also said the doping system needed a complete restructure.\n\n\"Engagement and not isolation is the key to build a more robust anti-doping system,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian swimmers Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev have been cleared to compete at the Rio Olympics, their representatives said yesterday, though there was no official confirmation.\n\nNO CONFIRMATION\n\nWorld swimming's governing body Fina, the Russian swimming federation and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) have not confirmed that Lobintsev and Morozov will in fact be competing in Rio.\n\nA ruling by CAS was expected this morning (Singapore time).\n\nBut speaking to Interfax news agency, Lobintsev's agent, Andrei Mitkov said: \"I can confirm that Lobintsev and Morozov are being allowed to compete in the Games.\n\n\"We will meet with IOC representatives to discuss the outcome for this situation.\"\n\nLawyer Artyom Patsev, who represents the swimmers, told TASS news agency that they had received the green light from Fina to compete in Rio.\n\nMorozov, 24, and Lobintsev, 27, have called on the CAS to declare \"invalid and unenforceable\" an IOC order for federations to exclude athletes implicated in the investigation into Russia's state-run doping system.\n\nThey were among seven Russians banned by Fina last month.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nRio Olympics\n\nRussia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSchooling offered free flights on AirAsia\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nFree flights for Schooling, other Asean Olympic winners\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nCampbell reveals hernia injury\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRio 2016: Boos or boost for Brazil?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - Unlock Growth with Smarter Cash Strategies\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/57b88c70cf9cc93309e92a0a78df6e26efdddd226828f6522d9546ec147c7ae8/NP_20160803_IOC03_1344105.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS!

We just paid HK$6 ($1.04) per hour to play at a bay,\" she said.\n\nLater, Chan was talent-spotted by officials of Hong Kong's junior golfer development programme, who sent her to compete in youth events overseas.\n\nWith limited access to the financial hub's expensive golf clubs, she earned a scholarship to attend university in the United States, where she trains.\n\n\"When I was younger, there was not much opportunity for me to practise in real ranges. This is my weakness, so I need to work harder,\" she said.\n\nChan will face the world's best in Rio, including Lydia Ko from New Zealand and South Korea's Park InBee.\n\nShe hopes to finish in the top 40, but said her main aim was just to \"learn\" from the professionals around her.\n\n\"There are 57 professionals. To enter the Olympics as an amateur is already a difficult thing.

I'm fine and feeling really good, great, and really looking forward to racing,\" she said.\n\nEven so, Kromowidjojo said, she doesn't consider herself the favourite to defend her titles, with Cate Campbell topping the times this year in both events - and with a world record of 52.06 seconds to boot in the 100m free.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 3, 2025, 12:38am\n\n100 days to go: S'pore's swimmers gear up for World Aquatics Championships\n\nMore related stories\n\nKromowidjojo is right behind the elder Campbell sister in the 50m world rankings, but it's Bronte Campbell who owns the second-fastest 100m time of 2016, with Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom third-quickest this season.\n\n\"I don't consider myself the favourite,\" Kromowidjojo said.\n\n\"Cate Campbell, her little sister and Sarah Sjostrom are really strong swimmers, but I'm sure I'm going to fight for the gold medals.\"\n\nKromowidjojo reflected on the fame her London triumphs had brought, which, she said, \"completely changed my life\".\n\n\"Of course I'd already achieved some success before then but, after London, the madness began,\" she said.\n\n\"People in Holland and the media went really crazy.

article is more than 12 months old\n\nAug 2, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nNo live broadcast on Youtube for S'pore\n\nShare this article\n\nAn online report circulated widely on social media over the last two days on Sports24hour.com said that Singapore is one of 64 countries which can catch the Olympics live on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) YouTube channel.\n\nBut Olympics broadcast rights holder Dentsu have dashed the hopes of Singaporeans hoping to watch the sporting action as it happens, saying that the report is inaccurate.\n\nA Dentsu spokesman told The Straits Times yesterday: \"There will be no live streaming on YouTube.\n\n\"Therefore we are encouraging Mediacorp to take up the option to add live television coverage.\"\n\nHe added that any website which streams content illegally would be directed by the IOC and Dentsu to shut down the stream.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\nLoh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities\n\nMore related stories\n\nLast month, The New Paper reported that Singapore will not be able to watch the Olympics live.\n\nIt was reported that local broadcasters made a bid of around US$2 million ($2.67m) to the IOC for the TV rights for Rio 2016, only to be told to go through Dentsu, who last year won Olympic broadcast rights for 22 Asian countries from 2018 to 2024.\n\nIt is understood that the broadcasters baulked at the estimated US$6m price tag Dentsu offered for free-to-air \"live\" TV rights, fearing that it will set a precedent for even bigger price jumps for future Summer Olympics.\n\nInstead, free-to-air broadcaster Mediacorp has secured a deal worth about US$2m for delayed telecasts, daily highlights and feed from the Olympic news channel for between 10 and 12 hours daily.\n\nMediacorp is the only broadcaster in Singapore to offer any form of television coverage of the Games.\n\n- SAZALI ABDUL AZI\n\nZ\n\nOlympics\n\nmedia\n\nSingapore\n\nShare this

It was his fourth defeat in a major final with Argentina.\n\n\"I'm optimistic about Messi,\" Bauza was quoted as saying in the Argentine daily La Nacion.\n\n\"I hope the chat with him will help for him to carry on in the national team.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I want to explain to Messi what my (tactical) idea is. The least of my worries is his position on the pitch. There's no need to convince Messi of anything, the plan is to talk about football.\"\n\nBauza, 58, takes on the job after a strong season at Brazilian club Sao Paulo, which he coached to the semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores.\n\n\"We hope he will have the success we all need,\" said Armando Perez, the president of a committee named by Fifa to whip things into shape at the crisis-plagued Argentine Football Association (AFA).\n\nThe new coach faces the stigma of being the default choice. A string of potential coaches including Diego Simeone of Atletico Madrid, Jorge Sampaoli of Sevilla and Mauricio Pochettino of Tottenham Hotspur reportedly declined the job.\n\n\"We were in talks with a lot of people... Mr Bauza is the best,\" said Perez.\n\nBauza, who will sign his contract in Buenos Aires on Friday, has only a couple of weeks to decide on his squad for qualifiers at home to Uruguay and away to Venezuela in the first week of next month.\n\n\"There isn't much time. My first squad won't have many changes, but I want to talk with five or six of the leading players,\" Bauza said, no doubt referring to the likes of Javier Mascherano, Angel di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain.\n\nHe also opened the door for Carlos Tevez, overlooked by Martino since a World Cup qualifier against Paraguay in Asuncion last October where he won his 76th cap.\n\n\"I'm thinking of Tevez as I am about other players... Tevez is a player good enough for the national team,\" Bauza said.\n\nNOT DEFENSIVE-MINDED\n\nBauza has won two Copa Libertadores - one in 2014 with Pope Francis' favourite team, San Lorenzo, the other in 2008 with Ecuadoran side LDU Quito.\n\nA former central defender, he rejected a tag as a defensive coach, saying: \"I'm one of those who think that all (the team) have to defend. Football today is like that.\n\n\"You can defend in your opponents' half if the pressure is high (up the field), but it's easier when you have players of the quality of the Argentina team. The options they offer you are many.\"\n\nArgentina are third in the 10-nation South American World Cup qualifying group with 11 points from six matches, two points behind leading pair Uruguay and Ecuador.\n\nThe top four teams after 18 matches go through to the Russia Finals, while the fifth-placed team goes into an intercontinental play-off for one more berth. - AFP.\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f187a2b09182854dd1a9dec0819789dad8d6c0c4c7e21d4f10d5a0bb18f571d7/NP_20160803_ARG03_1343893.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "WINNER: Argentina's new coach Edgardo Bauza has won the Copa Libertadores with San Lorenzo in 2014 and with Ecuadoran side LDU Quito in 2008.", "caption": "WINNER: Argentina's new coach Edgardo Bauza has won the Copa Libertadores with San Lorenzo in 2014 and with Ecuadoran side LDU Quito in 2008."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It's more than half the team. It was a gamble and it didn't pay off,\" Rooney told the Daily Mail yesterday.\n\n\"We had lost momentum from the Slovakia game and tournament football is about confidence. You get that from winning.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We didn't play great in the friendlies, but we won. So you try to build, even from before the tournament, but we couldn't get that consistency once it began.\n\n\"It was Roy's decision to make changes against Slovakia and either way, the team he put out should have been able to win.\n\n\"But, right or wrong, I wanted to play and I can't deny that.\"\n\nRooney came on as a substitute against Slovakia, but the 30-year-old insisted that Hodgson, who stepped down immediately after the Iceland debacle, should have retained the team that defeated Wales in the previous fixture.\n\n\"When I came on against Slovakia, it was difficult to change the game, impossible really. I was running around just trying to get the energy back into the team,\" he said.\n\n\"Watching, I felt we lacked aggression - in the running, in the passing, we didn't have the tempo, so that's what I was trying to create.\"\n\nKANE'S CORNER DUTY\n\nRooney also revealed that it was his decision to stop Harry Kane from taking corners at Euro 2016.\n\nKane took all six corners in the opening game of England's ill-fated campaign against Russia in Marseille.\n\nHodgson was heavily criticised for employing last season's 25-goal top English Premier League scorer in this way and Rooney has now said he intervened in the matter.\n\nAsked in an interview with the Daily Mail if it was his decision to relieve Kane of corner duty, Rooney simply replied: \"Yes.\"\n\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer was among those to criticise Hodgson at the time, saying Kane was \"well within his rights\" to tell the manager that he should be in the penalty area on the end of corners rather than taking them.\n\nShearer said Rooney and Adam Lallana were better suited to the role, and now Kane's club manager Mauricio Pochettino has expressed his surprise at Hodgson's call in France.\n\n\"I don't want to criticise,\" Tottenham boss Pochettino told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"But Harry is a top scorer, so why is he taking free-kicks or corners if his skill is to score? You need him to stay in the box, not outside.\"\n\nRooney, meanwhile, said that he will continue playing for England for at least two more years - whether he is captain or not.\n\nNew England boss Sam Allardyce has remained tight-lipped over the Manchester United player's future as the Three Lions skipper since his appointment.\n\nAllardyce has said he will reveal his decision when the squad meet up for their World Cup qualifier against Slovakia next month.\n\nHowever, Rooney has no intention of considering his international future for another two years, even if Allardyce hands the armband to someone else.\n\nHe said: \"I'll carry on until the World Cup in 2018 and then I might have a decision to make.\n\n\"But, for the next two years, captain or not captain, I'll turn up and be available to play if I am wanted.\"\n\nRooney added: \"I've spoken to him (Allardyce). Not at length about how we're going to play or my role, but he seems very excited about the job and he'll have his own way of doing it.\n\n\"I don't think it would be fair to expect him to make a decision on the captaincy now.\n\n\"So I'll wait and see what he thinks. He'll want to see the group, work with us all and then make his decision.\"\n\n- PA Sport.\n\nFootball\n\nEuro 2016\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cd088de8172347c7f65e3d0cb3c040ed9513eb762cd46cf3933b12cb7643f399/NP_20160802_ROON02_1343029.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "STEPPING IN: England captain Wayne Rooney (No. 10) has revealed that it was his decision to stop Harry Kane from taking corners at Euro 2016, not Roy Hodgson.", "caption": "STEPPING IN: England captain Wayne Rooney (No. 10) has revealed that it was his decision to stop Harry Kane from taking corners at Euro 2016, not Roy Hodgson."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Being nicer to herself and learning how to smile on the greens.\n\nThat is how the 20-year-old became the first golfer from her country to lift a Major title after winning the Women's British Open at Woburn Golf Club yesterday morning (Singapore time).\n\nShe finished three strokes clear of South Korea's Lee Mirim and American Mo Martin with a 16-under total of 272.\n\nAt the same tournament last year, Ariya failed to qualify for the final two rounds for the 10th consecutive tournament.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt wasn't supposed to pan out this way for a player destined for stardom.\n\nAt 11, Ariya became the youngest player to qualify for an LPGA event.\n\nWhen she turned pro in 2012, she was ranked No. 2 in the world amateur rankings, behind only current world No. 1 Lydia Ko.\n\nBut, a year later, Ariya suffered a shoulder injury while chasing her sister Moriya, a fellow LPGA Tour player, and trying to spray water on her before an event.\n\nAfter her win yesterday, the player nicknamed \"May\", said: \"Everything in the past was good for me because I learned from it, especially when I missed 10 cuts in a row.\n\nPATIENT\n\n\"I know how to come back, I know how to be patient.\n\n\"Everybody is going to have bad times in their life and I think I have had that already.\"\n\nThe bad times were so brutal that the world No. 2 was scared to hit the ball. Then Ariya had an attitude adjustment and learned how to be nice to herself.\n\nAt the KPMG Women's PGA Championship in June, she said: \"Right now, I am really happy; no matter what the result (of a shot), I'm just very happy with it.\n\n\"The only thing I have to do, is I have to be nice to myself, and not complain about every single shot.\"\n\nThe Thai had every right to complain when she finished fourth in the year's first Major - the ANA Inspiration - after leading by two shots with three holes to play.\n\nInstead, she turned to her swing coach Gary Gilchrist and golf coaches Lynn Marriott and Pia Nilsson.\n\nThey concluded that under pressure, the world No. 2 sped up her routine, leading to more tension and tightness in her body.\n\nHer coaching team tried several \"triggers\" to control her game before arriving at the solution - smiling.\n\n\"May is so cute, her big smile is obvious,\" Nilsson said.\n\n\"Really, though, it's not about the smile. It's about how she feels inside that's important. When we tried the smile, she said, 'That's me'.\"\n\nSaid Ariya: \"I'm pretty sure I learned a lot from that (the ANA Inspiration) because when I feel nervous now, I know what to do.\n\n\"The last few holes here I tried to be patient and to commit to my shots.\"\n\nA month after the ANA Inspiration in April, which Ko won, the Thai became the first player on the LPGA Tour to get her first three wins in consecutive events.\n\nSaid Ko: \"I think it's been amazing. We all know she's a great player, so it's always good to see her doing so well. And especially with her being such a nice person, too.\"\n\nTour veteran Christina Kim added: \"She's going to be unstoppable... She's only scratched the surface of what she could become.\"\n\nWhat she became yesterday morning was the winner of one of golf's most prestigious trophies.\n\nDescribing the pre-shot routine that has helped her turn multiple missed cuts into a Major moment, Ariya said: \"I really want to try to feel relaxed and I feel like what is going to make me happy is to smile.\"\n\nIn Woburn, it proved to be a winning smile. - Wire Services.\n\nAriya shows us all you can go through tough times in life, but you can come back.\n\n- Swing coach Gary Gilchrist on his charge Ariya Jutanugarn\n\nsport\n\nGolf\n\nthailand\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nFind the Best Fixed Deposit Rates\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0cc2cc6ea1966f83931d15aed8996100e8ed59a93d73958306a10e0032fecf25/NP_20160802_ARIYA02_1343088.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ariya Jutanugarn.", "caption": "Ariya Jutanugarn."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The US needs no more neanderthal input to this already disgraceful election,\" read one tweet.\n\n\"I am appalled and outraged\" by the cover photo, read another tweet, adding: \"Misogyny is misogyny.\"\n\nSeveral other tweets decried the \"attempts to shame\" Mrs Trump.\n\nSome wondered how conservative evangelical Christians would react, while others wondered if Mr Murdoch, who also holds conservative views, had turned against Mr Trump.\n\nMrs Trump met Mr Trump in 1998, and became the real estate tycoon's third wife in 2005.\n\nunited states\n\ndonald trump\n\nPOLITICIANS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 30, 2025, 07:03am\n\nSingaporeans travelling to US advised to check latest entry requirements and comply: MFA\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nS'poreans looking to pursue studies in US can still submit visa applications: US Embassy\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:02am\n\nConfused, nervous, told to 'wait for updates': Singapore students at Harvard react to US ban\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/10a654700c579f9af06bcf7ebb4f8f9c561811e1ec682c73b5f03b27b6e548d8/NP_20160802_WIN02_1342845.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "TALK OF THE TOWN: Mr Donald Trump and his third wife Melania.", "caption": "TALK OF THE TOWN: Mr Donald Trump and his third wife Melania."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2a46ea4106ae0b5a959297e2272ab889bd6dddb391db51ad4f6af0a57114f0fe/434203950.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Anxious Harvard-bound Singaporeans press ahead with plans, even as some still do not have visas", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9ba22c7c80eb08300f3647c2c23e6f1c131b8935c8cdec5b82ad49e78f8d3eda/LYNXMPEL4E0LU-1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Singaporeans travelling to US advised to check latest entry requirements and comply: MFA", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

A man in my train carriage also picked up the emergency phone and tried calling, but there was no response.\n\n\"The train's speed was quite fast and it also did not slow down as it usually does at corners.\"\n\nMs Bong said the two-carriage train, which contained about 20 passengers, ended up stopping just before the platform at Phoenix station after another commuter used her mobile phone to call a number listed in the train.\n\nAn SMRT staff member subsequently arrived and forced open the train's door, before driving the train to the platform where everyone alighted safely, she added.\n\nMs Bong, who lives in Choa Chu Kang, said she takes the BPLRT every day, but that this was her first time encountering such an incident.\n\nIn her Facebook post, Ms Bong questioned why the train's emergency button and phone were not working.\n\nSMRT said Ms Bong was probably referring to the train's emergency halt request button, which can only be activated when a train comes to a complete stop at a station, which prevents it from moving off again.\n\nThe BPLRT Operations Control Centre (OCC) also received separate alerts from commuters through the station intercom, the train's emergency phone and through the OCC hotline, it added.\n\nFURTHER CHECKS\n\nSMRT explained that the OCC had imposed a \"speed code restriction\", which allowed the train to stop before Phoenix station.\n\nWhile Ms Bong said that she felt that the train had been moving quite fast, SMRT confirmed that it did not exceed 55kmh during the incident.\n\nBPLRT trains typically operate at between 30kmh and 55kmh.\n\n\"The train was later withdrawn to the depot for further checks. All equipment in the train, including the emergency phone, are checked before the train is put into service each day,\" it said in its statement.\n\n\"We would like to reassure all commuters that our staff will not hesitate to take immediate action as safety is our top priority.\" - The Straits Times Online\n\nWhen the train did not stop at Jelapang, we tried pressing the emergency button, but it was not working.

I am ashamed of him,\" Harting said.\n\n\"I have often expressed my disappointment in Bach, but this is a new dimension of disappointment.\"\n\nHarting has never been afraid to make a stand.\n\nIn 2014, the German had himself removed from the list of candidates for World Athlete of the Year, in protest against the nomination of US sprinter Justin Gatlin, who has twice been banned from athletics over positive drug tests.\n\nInjury saw him miss the entire 2015 season with injury and he has struggled with knee and shoulder problems this season.\n\nHe says he is no longer the favourite, with Poland's Piotr Malachowski arriving in Rio as the world champion - a state of affairs Harting enjoys.\n\n\"In 2012, I was at a totally different, much higher level. I have to accept that,\" Harting told SID, an AFP subsidiary.\n\n\"I am no longer the hunted, now I'm the hunter - I like that.\n\n\"The other boys haven't seen me on the big stage for a while, I'm a factor they can't control, that is my advantage.\n\n\"I'll give it my all and have never had the thought 'what if?', that just costs energy.\"\n\nHarting loves a challenge and thrives on pressure.\n\nWhen the 2009 world championships were held at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, which he regards as his home turf, he was in his element.\n\nHis long-time rival Malachowski threw 68.77m with his opening throw and extended his lead to 69.15m on his fifth and penultimate throw.\n\nEnter Harting, who saved his best for last by launching a personal best of 69.43m to win the gold with his final throw.\n\nHarting's shirt did not stand a chance as he ripped it to shreds in euphoric celebration and the Berlin crowd lapped it up.\n\nHaving finished fourth at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Harting got a monkey off his back by winning the 2012 Olympic title which he says made him a \"complete athlete\".\n\nBut four years on and past 30, the German knows this is likely to be his last crack at another Olympic medal.\n\n\"Life will go one without a gold medal,\" he said.\n\n\"The pressure to perform before London was terrible. I have always said the last six weeks of training are always my strongest, we'll see whether it will be enough.\n\n\"Of course, I want to win gold, but I had it once and I know how quickly the medal loses its shine.\"\n\n- AFP.\n\nRio Olympics\n\nathletics\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSchooling offered free flights on AirAsia\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nFree flights for Schooling, other Asean Olympic winners\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nCampbell reveals hernia injury\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRio 2016: Boos or boost for Brazil?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nUNIQLO\n\nNew diverse jeans everyone’s wearing, from slim to wide fits\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5aa5549542dca26539490b4a6d0b02fb70b3deff4cef1b2560f01ac3b00a9f9a/NP_20160802_HART02_1342966.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Robert Harting", "caption": "Robert Harting"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I trust people will realise the difficult situation we are in. We did our best to address the situation in a way to protect clean athletes.\"\n\nThree IOC executive members have been named to make a final decision on which Russian athletes will compete in Rio once the individual federations have made their lists.\n\nThe IOC said the Russian team will be finalised before Friday's opening ceremony at the Rio Olympic stadium.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said yesterday that international sport will be heading on the \"road to nowhere\" unless doping sanctions are applied in the same way to all countries.\n\n\"The (anti-doping) system needs to be equally integrated and a unique system in all countries of the world,\" Mutko told Russian media.\n\n\"If we can achieve this, then the fight against doping will have some kind of final effect.\n\n\"If the system will work one way in a given country, and we will have to fulfil others' requirements, then that's a road to nowhere.\"\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nRio Olympics\n\nRussia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSchooling offered free flights on AirAsia\n\nAug 24, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nFree flights for Schooling, other Asean Olympic winners\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nCampbell reveals hernia injury\n\nAug 23, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRio 2016: Boos or boost for Brazil?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nChina Market Revival - Here’s Why It Matters\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a29cdb7e10a3975cb4b1261facbb5a54bb4276683cc6122cb9ece986fb09e6c6/NP_20160802_RUSSIA02_1343105.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

A special thank you to the fans - you make this such a great event.\"\n\nThe Briton took the chequered flag less than two seconds ahead of the German, who had lined up on pole position at the Hungaroring but lost out to Hamilton at the start in the key moment of the race.\n\nHamilton now leads Rosberg by six points after 11 of the season's 21 races. The Briton has won five of the last six races, including the last three.\n\nOVERTAKING SCHUMI\n\nUntil yesterday, he had shared the record for Hungary GP wins with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher.\n\n\"I grew up watching Michael, so to have a similar number, and now one more than he had here, is incredible,\" said Hamilton.\n\nAustralian Daniel Ricciardo finished third for Red Bull after pushing the Mercedes pair hard enough at one point for the champions to tell Hamilton to pick up the pace.\n\nFerrari's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, also a previous winner in Hungary, finished fourth after sounding off over the team radio about slower cars holding him up as he lapped them.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen held off Ferrari's feisty Kimi Raikkonen for fifth. The Finn had started 14th but a long first stint saw him challenging the Dutchman.\n\nThe battle between the pair provided a moment of excitement in an otherwise uneventful race, with Raikkonen clipping the back of Verstappen's car and damaging his front wing in an attempt to pass the 18-year-old.\n\nFernando Alonso was the sole-surviving McLaren in seventh.\n\nMcLaren's hopes of a strong result on the back of their best qualifying performance since renewing their engine partnership with Honda were dashed early on, with Jenson Button falling down the order with hydraulics problems.\n\nThe 2009 world champion also collected a drive-through penalty for a breach of radio rules before finally retiring late in the race.\n\nRosberg, who has also won five races this year, will have the chance to seize back the lead in his home German Grand Prix.\n\nHOCKENHEIM NEXT\n\nThe race at Hockenheim, absent from last year's calendar, takes place this weekend.\n\n\"It was all down to the start in the end,\" said Rosberg, of yesterday's race.\n\n\"From then on, I was trying to put all the pressure on Lewis but it's not possible to pass at this track.\n\n\"To have the next race coming up very quickly sounds good, at my home race... it's going to be awesome.\" - Reuters.\n\nHUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX (Top 5)\n\n1.

Both times they led 2-0 at the interval.\n\nLast term, Leicester lost just once when playing at King Power Stadium. As for the Swans, they won just four from 19 while on the road.\n\nCan try: Swansea at +1.5 Goals\n\nSOUTHAMPTON v SUNDERLAND\n\nLast season, the Saints were strong at St Mary's, losing just five from 19. The Black Cats, on the other hand, were disappointing when on the road, winning just three from their 19 away games.\n\nOn last season's stats, EVEN seems the way to go. Their last three meetings saw them level at the break.\n\nCan try: THREE on Total Goals\n\nHULL v MAN UNITED\n\nThe head-to-head stats say the Tigers cannot win. However, when the two teams last met in May 2015, Hull held on to a 0-0 draw.\n\nWorth noting that last season, the Red Devils won just seven of 19 when playing away and EVEN seemed to be the call in Man United matches. So far this season, it's been Even-Even.\n\nCan try: Man United on the 1x2\n\nWEST BROM v MIDDLESBROUGH\n\nThe last time these two teams clashed was in the Championship of the 2009/10 season.\n\nThat season, the Baggies won 5-0 (away) and 2-0 (home). Only once in their last 10 meetings has it been 0-0 at the interval. The last time Boro beat West Brom was in 2006.\n\nCan try: EVEN on Even-Odd option\n\nMAN CITY v WEST HAM\n\nOnly twice in their last 10 meetings have they marched off all square.\n\nLast season, Man City lost just five from 19 matches at home while the Hammers also lost five of 19 when playing away. OVER 2.5 seems to be the way to go in matches involving these two teams. This season, both of City's matches ended ODD.\n\nCan try: OVER 2.5 on Over/Under option\n\nenglish premier league\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 23, 2021, 03:35pm\n\nHolland not counting on van Dijk for Euros\n\nMar 23, 2021, 03:11pm\n\nThiago laments emotional difficulty of pandemic football\n\nMar 10, 2021, 04:22pm\n\nMourinho looking to mark career milestone with trophy for Spurs\n\nMar 9, 2021, 09:56am\n\nChelsea's mean defence is down to trust and courage: Tuchel\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e1b5e6d59c16d33d904c9b1aac05385b82b649d8783a9cfda7dbfb8f997a86ea/NP_20160827_BMTEAMS27_1368098.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CATALYST: Arsenal's wizard Mesut Oezil (above) is in line for his first start this season, after making a substitute appearance in the 0-0 draw with Leicester.", "caption": "CATALYST: Arsenal's wizard Mesut Oezil (above) is in line for his first start this season, after making a substitute appearance in the 0-0 draw with Leicester."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6432b67dd00690b82eaf11d27c5f42a592228f6a564c4b4d552a61210421b81d/dw-football-qe2-220909.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "English Premier League fixtures postponed after Queen Elizabeth's death", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5de22c0d94ccaaa9c5aab6910a26b058bbe4700b6c649266195497f929b10221/vvd24.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Holland not counting on van Dijk for Euros", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

What a day! The traffic was difficult to navigate, but it was an amazing race. A special thank you to the fans - you make this such a great event.\"\n\nThe Briton took the chequered flag less than two seconds ahead of the German, who had lined up on pole position at the Hungaroring but lost out to Hamilton at the start in the key moment of the race.\n\nHamilton now leads Rosberg by six points after 11 of the season's 21 races. The Briton has won five of the last six races, including the last three.\n\nOVERTAKING SCHUMI\n\nUntil yesterday, he had shared the record for Hungary GP wins with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher.\n\n\"I grew up watching Michael, so to have a similar number, and now one more than he had here, is incredible,\" said Hamilton.\n\nAustralian Daniel Ricciardo finished third for Red Bull after pushing the Mercedes pair hard enough at one point for the champions to tell Hamilton to pick up the pace.\n\nFerrari's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, also a previous winner in Hungary, finished fourth after sounding off over the team radio about slower cars holding him up as he lapped them.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen held off Ferrari's feisty Kimi Raikkonen for fifth. The Finn had started 14th but a long first stint saw him challenging the Dutchman.\n\nThe battle between the pair provided a moment of excitement in an otherwise uneventful race, with Raikkonen clipping the back of Verstappen's car and damaging his front wing in an attempt to pass the 18-year-old.\n\nFernando Alonso was the sole-surviving McLaren in seventh.\n\nMcLaren's hopes of a strong result on the back of their best qualifying performance since renewing their engine partnership with Honda were dashed early on, with Jenson Button falling down the order with hydraulics problems.\n\nThe 2009 world champion also collected a drive-through penalty for a breach of radio rules before finally retiring late in the race.\n\nRosberg, who has also won five races this year, will have the chance to seize back the lead in his home German Grand Prix.\n\nHOCKENHEIM NEXT\n\nThe race at Hockenheim, absent from last year's calendar, takes place this weekend.\n\n\"It was all down to the start in the end,\" said Rosberg, of yesterday's race.\n\n\"From then on, I was trying to put all the pressure on Lewis but it's not possible to pass at this track.\n\n\"To have the next race coming up very quickly sounds good, at my home race... it's going to be awesome.\" - Reuters.\n\nHUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX (Top 5)\n\n1.

At the end of the day, Russians are not the only sportsmen or women who have been found doping.\"\n\nThe stunning allegations about Russian cheating forced the IOC to take aggressive action without the luxury of time, Bach explained.\n\nRussian athletes \"have to assume a collective responsibility\" for operating in such a corrupt system, he said.\n\nBut, rather than implementing an outright ban on the whole country, the IOC wanted to send \"a message of encouragement to the clean Russian athletes to show that they are clean\".\n\n\"It's fine to talk about collective responsibility,\" Bach said, \"but... You have to be able to look in the eyes of every athlete concerned.\"\n\nAsked how he would respond to critics accusing the IOC of treating Russia too softly, Bach said \"read the decision\", stressing that the ROC was being treated more harshly than every other national Olympic committee. - Wire Services.\n\nIt is a specific challenge for our sportsmen but I am absolutely sure that the majority of the Russian team will meet the criteria.\n\n- Russia sports minister Vitaly Mutko, who believes most of the country's athletes will meet IOC's strict criteria to compete at next month's Rio Olympics\n\nOlympics\n\nINTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE\n\nIOC\n\npresident\n\nThomas Bach\n\nRussia\n\nRIO GAMES\n\nRUSSIAN OLYMPIC COMMITTEE\n\nROC\n\ngymnast\n\nALIYA MUSTAFINA\n\ndiver\n\nILYA ZAKHAROV\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 11:34pm\n\nEx-swimmer Mark Chay set to become new SNOC secretary-general\n\nFeb 2, 2025, 12:27am\n\nJason Teh just one match from ending badminton title drought\n\nDec 4, 2024, 06:12am\n\nSingapore's first Olympic medallist Tan Howe Liang dies aged 91\n\nNov 11, 2024, 10:59pm\n\nKoen Pang and Izaac Quek qualify for World Table Tennis Finals\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/52ee3bd195ffac90f71130737e6bab7b115c83b1eeb634def2efee644adce1bd/NP_20160725_RUSSIA25_1334642.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "RACE AGAINST TIME: London 2012 gold medallists, gymnast Aliya Mustafina (above) and diver Ilya Zakharov, have to be passed \"fit\" by the respective international federations to have a chance of being in the 2016 Russian Olympic team.", "caption": "RACE AGAINST TIME: London 2012 gold medallists, gymnast Aliya Mustafina (above) and diver Ilya Zakharov, have to be passed \"fit\" by the respective international federations to have a chance of being in the 2016 Russian Olympic team."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/78bf94264510b2d01346c457f6e7e659ab973208ea51fe4278d2e89b570a0381/20250526739592073z6a4121a.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Loh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a1a3c7ed610c7e4e9061a80364c3db132f4768b716ef5d89ed7c51732a276c44/dlswim16.66a955ae.Attachment.024714.jpg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ex-swimmer Mark Chay set to become new SNOC secretary-general", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But when you play with other people you strengthen your weaknesses.\n\n\"And since we've come back together we've become a lot more rounded.\"\n\nThey will bid to burnish Britain's solid record in Olympic mixed doubles, which includes Simon Archer and Joanne Goode's bronze at the 2000 Sydney Games and Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson's silver in Athens in 2004.\n\nHaving battled for three years to get to Rio, the idea of letting off steam with a medal around their necks is a tickling one for the couple.\n\n\"It'd be a great holiday after winning a medal, I'd go on a one-month bender,\" Gabby laughs.\n\n\"Straight to Vegas!\" adds Chris.\n\n- Reuters.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n7th\n\nChris and Gabby Adcock are the seventh seeds for the mixed doubles at the Rio Olympics.\n\nsport\n\nRio Olympics\n\nGABBY ADCOCK\n\nCHRIS ADCOCK\n\nbadminton\n\nmixed doubles\n\nGreat Britain\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4740c3002535b4a9d0b055efd516aa55c51de418d83a4d29eac7c33030171ce4/NP_20160725_BAD25_1334583.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chris (left) and Gabby Adcock (right).", "caption": "Chris (left) and Gabby Adcock (right)."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Malaysian athletes have mounted the Olympic podium six times, but never climbed to the top.\n\nLee meant for London to be his Olympic swansong but, three months shy of his 34th birthday, he will contest his fourth Games where fans will hope for another battle royal with arch-rival Lin.\n\n\"(Gold) is not only my dream, but also the dream of all Malaysians,\" Lee told Malaysian media recently.\n\n\"I have to make the best preparation as this is my last Olympics.\"\n\nHis reputation has been stained after he failed a drug test at the 2014 world championships.\n\nHe was provisionally suspended in November of that year and faced a potentially career-ending ban after testing positive for dexamethasone, a widely administered anti-inflammatory used to treat asthma and altitude sickness.\n\nYet the following April, the Badminton World Federation (BWF) controversially handed him a back-dated eight-month ban that allowed him to return to competition a few days after the judgment, convinced by Lee's claim that he had taken the substance inadvertently and had no intention to cheat.\n\nLee's ranking plummeted outside the top 100 while sidelined, but he has fought back hard over the past year and reclaimed the No. 1 spot from Chinese world champion Chen Long with victory at the Indonesian Open in June.\n\nLee's Indonesian coach Hendrawan and the Badminton Association of Malaysia have largely kept the shuttler sheltered from the Games hype and also been cagey about the player's fitness after he missed tournaments in Australia and Taiwan last month due to a buttock injury.\n\nBut Lee will be front and centre at Rio as Malaysia's flag-bearer at the opening ceremony.\n\nFrom there, he has \"nowhere to hide\", Hendrawan admitted.\n\n- Reuters.\n\nOlympics\n\nbadminton\n\nworld No. 1\n\nLee Chong Wei\n\nmalaysia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 11:34pm\n\nEx-swimmer Mark Chay set to become new SNOC secretary-general\n\nFeb 2, 2025, 12:27am\n\nJason Teh just one match from ending badminton title drought\n\nDec 4, 2024, 06:12am\n\nSingapore's first Olympic medallist Tan Howe Liang dies aged 91\n\nNov 11, 2024, 10:59pm\n\nKoen Pang and Izaac Quek qualify for World Table Tennis Finals\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e847c8977bf30dd65f7171da5c48455eaf03d9e8fff2b68c5ef81084293283a4/NP_20160725_LEE25_1334570.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Lee Chong Wei.", "caption": "Lee Chong Wei."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/78bf94264510b2d01346c457f6e7e659ab973208ea51fe4278d2e89b570a0381/20250526739592073z6a4121a.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Loh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a1a3c7ed610c7e4e9061a80364c3db132f4768b716ef5d89ed7c51732a276c44/dlswim16.66a955ae.Attachment.024714.jpg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ex-swimmer Mark Chay set to become new SNOC secretary-general", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Why should we not shake hands? No reason why. He will want to win, I will want to win. That's all.\"\n\nMourinho sang from the same hymn sheet.\n\nWhen asked if he would offer his hand to Guardiola, he replied: \"Of course, I will shake his hand. Why wouldn't I?\"\n\n\"We worked together for three years (at Barcelona), we were opponents but we are professionals.\n\n\"I don't see why I wouldn't shake his hand.\"\n\nIt is the pitch in Beijing that is of more concern on both their minds.\n\nHeavy rainfall over the past week has damaged the playing surface at the Bird's Nest.\n\nIn a bid to prevent damaging the pitch further, City and United agreed to train at the nearby Olympic Sports Centre yesterday.\n\nAn International Champions Cup spokesman said the surface would be \"fine\", but Guardiola's concerns were understandable.\n\n\"We didn't see the pitch but there is a lot of water in the last days, so we understand it's not in a good condition, but okay we're going to adapt and adjust,\" the City boss said.\n\n\"It's our second game of preparation. The most important thing is that the players are not going to be injured.\n\n\"We know the humidity for the training is not ideal but we also know that it's so important to come here to know the people and to play a good two games against amazing teams like United and Dortmund.\n\n\"We don't want to expend too much energy in training because of the humidity but we stay here, we play, and then go back to Manchester for two more weeks of preparation before the first official game.\"\n\nGuardiola and midfielder Fernandinho were given towels during a sweltering press conference that offered little respite from the heat and humidity.\n\nVincent Kompany was among those training yesterday morning, albeit away from his teammates as the City captain looks to bounce back from a difficult run of injuries.\n\nGuardiola confirmed the Belgium defender, 30, will not play tonight, but could be ready for their Aug 13 season-opener against Sunderland.\n\n\"The most important thing is for Vincent to get fit,\" he said.\n\n\"If it's for Sunderland, perfect.

But differences exist once you look beyond their spoked wheels.\n\nOn the cafe racer-styled Thruxton R, you'll zero in on the elongated fuel tank, a throwback to the past when brave men went racing wearing only half-shell helmets and knee-high leather boots.\n\nThe inverted gold forks and dual Ohlins rear shocks add a touch of modernity and bling.\n\nThe T120 sports a huge semi-circular grab rail and front dual disc brakes attached to a big wheel hub, which are a welcome addition.\n\nIts fuel tank badge is now sleeker and smaller.\n\nERGONOMICS\n\nMy 1.78m-tall frame agrees with the T120's upright riding posture because my hands fall naturally onto the handlebars and my feet rest on pegs as if I'm sitting on an office chair.\n\nI was expecting the one-seater Thruxton R to be a torture instrument given its racer-boy styling.\n\nSurprisingly, there was no weight bearing on my wrists simply because the Thruxton R isn't designed like a modern, nose-down sports bike.\n\nIt has an unbelievably slim waistline as you grip your knees against the fuel tank.\n\nPOWER & HANDLING\n\nBoth six-speed Triumphs sport bigger 1,200cc engines.\n\nI recall the older 900cc Triumphs lacked the top speed and that extra gear to run with the bigger boys on highways.\n\nThe 2016 Thruxton R churns a maximum power close to 100hp and spits out 112Nm of torque.\n\nIts \"High Power\" engine towers over its predecessor as it produces 62 per cent more torque and 41 per cent more horsepower.\n\nThe T120 \"High Torque\" engine boasts similar improvements.\n\nWhat this means is that you won't be the last one pulling away from traffic stops.\n\nStill, the Triumphs' power output is mild compared with other naked motorcycles with similar engine capacities which hover in the 150hp region.\n\nBut what the gentleman's bike lacks in power and torque, it makes up in the handling department.\n\nBoth low-revving Triumphs are predictable to ride and comfortable.\n\nWhile the T120 may be a little slower-steering and has softer suspension than the Thruxton R, it now stops quicker thanks to dual disc brakes at the front.\n\nThe sportier Thruxton does every thing better given its powerful, radially-mounted front Brembo brakes, fully adjustable suspension and sticky Pirelli tyres.\n\nWhat can be irritating about the Thruxton R is the glare from the tilted dual clocks and chromed top yoke when the sun is directly overhead.\n\nAlso, the rear-view mirrors need to be bigger to see traffic behind you.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nIn essence, the Triumphs are modern bikes made to look simple and retro.\n\nBoth have rain and road riding modes - the Thruxton R has an extra \"sport\" mode which allows instant power delivery and more punch.\n\nTraction control and anti-lock brakes are standard. While the speedometer and rev-counter are analogue, there are digital gauges for fuel consumption, distance travelled and selected ride modes.\n\nVERDICT\n\nIf you're a confident gentleman who's not bothered about breakneck speeds or gut-punching torque, either of the Triumphs would suit you. Both feature timeless designs that are making a comeback.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nMAKE & MODEL\n\nTriumph Bonneville T120 and Thruxton R\n\nCAPACITY\n\nBoth 1,200cc\n\nENGINE\n\nBoth water-cooled, parallel-twin cylinder\n\nTRANSMISSION\n\n6-speed\n\nMACHINE PRICE\n\nT120: $22,500,\n\nThruxton R: $27,000.\n\nFor more information, call Mah Pte Ltd at 6295-6393.\n\nBy\n\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Zaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nbiker\n\nREVIEWS\n\nmotorcycle\n\nTRIUMPH T120 AND THRUXTON R\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nBiker Boy: Quick fix at Harley-Davidson's revamped workshop\n\nSep 17, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nGiving F1 a two-wheel boost\n\nSep 3, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nHe once raced 2 weeks after breaking ankle\n\nAug 20, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRight gear, right habits, stay safe\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/03e9d801936e4a319652385d0427c324b0fe5e893d3d9f9292e48ac26c5ae2dc/NP_20160724_BIKER24-NOE_1333156.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Triumph Bonneville T120.", "caption": "Triumph Bonneville T120."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/091528e9c5f0e31e8abe9236bce9b8579849c22c9f6694d77d2dcfc581a528d3/NP_20161203_BIKER03_1457186.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "How to ride out the tough times", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1d601f0617d9c4059771f6a8d90d63ff2d29ff40e714af0b918ed3577f9333bd/NP_20161030_BIKER30-G17_1425327.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Biker Boy: Quick fix at Harley-Davidson's revamped workshop", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I was disappointed, especially in Justin Gatlin.\"\n\nGatlin, 34, who took silver behind Bolt at last year's world championships in the 100m and 200m, has been one of Bolt's most consistent rivals in recent years.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the US Olympic trials in Eugene earlier this month, Gatlin said he was in no doubt that Bolt would be fit to run at the Olympics, which begin on Aug 5.\n\n\"At the end of the day, when you command a certain power in track and field, sometimes you can exercise it,\" he said, alluding to preferential treatment for Bolt.\n\n\"That's what's happening right now - he's injured, he has a medical pass, that's what his country does.\"\n\nBolt (right) looked like he has work to do if he is to complete the famed triple-triple in Rio.\n\nHe was short of sharpness in every aspect in the 200m race yesterday morning.\n\nHis usual late surge was absent and he had to battle all the way to the line for a time of 19.89, considerably shy of American LaShawn Merritt's season-leading 19.74.\n\nPanama's Edward Alonso was second in 20.04, with Briton Adam Gemili third in 20.07.\n\nBolt, who turns 30 next month, travels to Rio in search of a third successive gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay.\n\n\"I tried to hold my form. I'm not fully in shape, I need more work, but I will be fine,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm feeling good and happy I could run and finish the race without any injuries.\" - Wire Services.\n\nsport\n\nOlympics\n\nathletics\n\nBOLT\n\nGATLIN\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0616c3720f95ac11a7245bdc13ad29643f4b9976ed003089e5ec9a2493d8da5f/NP_20160724_BOLT24_1333746.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

now it is patriotism, increasing the prestige of the authorities inside the country.\"\n\nATTACK\n\nThat may go some way also to explaining the reactions by Russian officials and a large swathe of the population to the latest scandal, which saw Russia accused of state-run doping that included the samples of cheating athletes swopped for clean ones in Sochi.\n\nUkraine, Syria and now doping: for many in Russia, it is just the latest attack by the West.\n\nRather than focus their ire on the officials accused of systematic cheating, Russians have tended to lash out at the allegations as just the latest move in a broader political campaign to damage the country.\n\nWith ties with the West already at their lowest ebb since the collapse of the Soviet Union over the crisis in Ukraine, Putin has also drawn parallels with the Cold War-era confrontation in sport.\n\n\"Recent events, the difficult atmosphere around international sports and the Olympic movement, unfortunately stir analogies with the 1980s,\" Putin warned this week, citing the boycotts of the 1980 Games in Moscow and 1984 competition in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Now we are witnessing a dangerous return to political interference in sport.\"\n\nOthers, however, argue that the political meddling in sport is coming mainly from the Russian authorities - and desperation for success lies behind the current doping scandal.\n\nA report released by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) this week detailing the \"state-dictated\" system to hide drug-test failures said it was put in place after a dismal showing at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\n\"It was decided that this could not happen at Sochi and the plan to ensure lots of medal winners was concocted\" by the sports ministry, the report cited whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov as saying.\n\nRussia went on to top the medals table in Sochi - another source of enormous national pride for Putin and many Russians.\n\nOnly now have the extraordinary lengths they went to get there been revealed.\n\nWhile Putin has furiously denied that there is any state-run doping programme in Russia, analyst Kalachev said that the Kremlin's thirst for victory was likely fuelling the cheating.\n\n\"Some here like to say that Putin's ideal is the GDR (former Communist East Germany),\" Kalachev said, pointing to the country where the Kremlin leader served as a KGB officer and which ran a notorious doping campaign.\n\n\"The successes of the GDR in sport relied heavily on doping.

Long tipped as a potential No. 1, but yet to take the plunge.\n\n2 ROY KEANE\n\nPrevious jobs in charge of Sunderland and Ipswich ended disappointingly, but potential was shown and has remained involved in the game with backroom roles at Aston Villa and with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nHard to guess how he might dovetail with the unpredictable Allam family.\n\n3 STEVE McCLAREN\n\nDebate remains over whether he is more of a coach than a manager, but the former England boss had enjoyed good times with Middlesbrough and FC Twente as well as less distinguished stints with the national team, Derby and Newcastle. Hull is also close to his York roots and he may find a Premier League job hard to turn down regardless of the circumstances.\n\n4 RYAN GIGGS\n\nNow looking for a managerial post after three years learning the trade under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. After almost 30 years as player and coach at United, his first job away from Old Trafford will be keenly watched.\n\n5 KARL ROBINSON\n\nThe highly-rated manager of MK Dons has seemed destined for bigger things for some time, although he has so far resisted the temptation to leave.\n\nAfter six years in Milton Keynes and being unable to prevent relegation from the Championship, the time could be now.\n\n6 NEIL WARNOCK\n\nThe much-travelled veteran could hardly be a long-term choice, but he is consistently linked with jobs in the Yorkshire area and appears to relish awkward challenges like this one.

Above all, we have to make the people and the whole country proud.\n\n\"While my main focus will be on the senior team and getting positive results, I want to add my influence to the great work being done across the development teams at St George's Park - a facility I have used with my previous clubs.\n\n\"I know we have talented, committed players and it is time for us to deliver.\"FA chief executive Martin Glenn, who headed a unanimous selection panel alongside acting chairman David Gill and technical director Dan Ashworth, said: \"Sam Allardyce is the right man for the England job.\"His excellent managerial credentials, including his ability to realise the potential of players and teams, develop a strong team ethos and embrace modern methods that enhance performance, made him the outstanding choice.\"\n\nAllardyce will face the media at St George's Park, where he will be based, tomorrow morning with his first match taking place against unnamed opponents at Wembley on Sept 1.\n\nWayne Rooney, Hodgson's captain for the past two years, welcomed the news from Manchester United's pre-season tour of China and vowed to remain available for national duty.\n\nSkipper Rooney, his country's all-time leading goalscorer, was part of a Three Lions side humiliated by Iceland at Euro 2016 and suggestions followed that he may retire from the international stage.\n\nBut the Manchester United forward, who turns 31 in October, is keen to continue and is relishing the chance to work with Allardyce.\n\nSpeaking on United's pre-season tour of China, Rooney told various newspapers: \"Yeah, I think it's a good appointment for England.\n\n\"He will probably bring a different way of playing to England and, hopefully, it's a good way and we can be successful under him.\n\n\"I only know him through teams he has managed. I have seen him a few times off the pitch, but it's like everyone, I know him through the teams in the Premier League.\n\n\"Am I going to carry on? Of course. It was asked of me after the Euros but, yes, I'll be there.\"\n\n- PA Sport.\n\n\"I wish him well and now he can focus to win the next World Cup. I believe you have the players in England to do well. Recently he has done well at Sunderland from a very, very bad position. He has a capacity to get the best out of his teams. His teams are always difficult to beat, yes.

But they had a little problem physically and mentally.\"\n\nIndeed, the local boys started strongly but faded as the second half wore on and they failed to carve out clear chances.\n\nStriker Amiruldin Asraf came within centimetres of opening the scoring after just nine minutes when his superb effort from 20 metres looked destined for the top corner, only for Iran goalkeeper Nima Mirzazad to pull off a finger-tip save at full stretch.\n\nIran then had a golden opportunity to take the lead in the 18th minute when Singapore skipper Shahrin Saberin played a weak backpass intended for his goalkeeper Zharfan Rohaizad but it went straight into Reza Karamollachaab's path. The Iran striker's effort was deflected over by Zharfan.\n\nThere was no denying the Middle East side in the 31st minute when the Singapore defence played themselves into trouble, allowing Mehdikhani to dribble across the box before firing home a low shot past Zharfan.\n\nIn the second half, Iran had a number of good chances to put the game to bed, but were foiled by poor finishing and, on one occasion, the woodwork.\n\nSingapore's best chance of an equaliser came in the 80th minute, when the ball was played into Amiruldin in the box.\n\nBut the striker could not get a shot away, and instead set up teammate Adam Swandi, whose effort was blocked by an Iranian defender.\n\nPost-game, an exhausted Adam said: \"I felt the team performance was quite good.\n\n\"It was our spirit that gave us a chance. At the start of the game, we had some chances, but luck wasn't on our side.\"\n\nAdded captain Shahrin: \"Tonight, everyone was hungrier than in Teheran.\n\n\"Maybe it is because those games were just friendlies, and our mindset then was just to test ourselves against one of the top teams in Asia.\n\n\"But now, we know we can compete against the likes of Iran... the most important thing is to get our mentality right.\"\n\nSingapore coach Tardy agreed with Peiravani's assessment that his team played much better than three months ago, but said they could still do more.\n\n\"Yes, especially with the fighting spirit of the players,\" said the Frenchman. \"In the first half, we played well, but again conceded a stupid goal.\n\n\"We played a good game but we missed a few things, such as (executing) technical ability under pressure, but what we can keep is the spirit of the boys.\n\n\"Everyone showed they wanted to prove something, that they are proud to play this kind of game for the country.\n\n\"They wanted to finish by winning but unfortunately we didn't, so the players are disappointed.\"\n\nTHIRD-PLACE PLAY-OFF\n\nUzbekistan 4 Hong Kong 0\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nFootball\n\nUNDER 21\n\nSINGAPORE U21\n\nIRAN U21\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/44b240c3fad79f9762870f1836733f53cf6a17d4f20ce559ffa6b4f5be698ad9/NP_20160724_SZSOC24-1ZP_1333801.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "YOUNG GUNS: Singapore striker Amiruldin Asraf (centre) giving a spirited display against the fancied Iranians.", "caption": "YOUNG GUNS: Singapore striker Amiruldin Asraf (centre) giving a spirited display against the fancied Iranians."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Rusyaidi who? Joshua who? Amiruldin who?\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nIndeed, not many give Richard Tardy's charges a chance at the SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur in 13 months' time.\n\nBut, as their performances against Hong Kong and Iran in the International Challenge Cup showed, these boys have enough fight in them.\n\nNo one expected them to thump Hong Kong 5-0 in the first game.\n\nBut, powered by a sparkling performance by TNP-Dollah Kassim Award winner Joshua Pereira, 19, they did just that.\n\nNo one - not even the Iran coach, who had beaten Tardy's team twice in March - expected them to give the Asian powerhouses such a close fight in the final yesterday. But they did.\n\nOne can point to the fact the Iranians were made up mostly of Under-19 players.\n\nBut, did you know Singapore's starting 11 last night had two 17-year-olds in midfielder Hami Syahin and winger Haiqal Pashia?\n\nIn fact, only four players in the team were above the age of 19.\n\nEvery Iranian player was bigger and taller than the Singapore players, but the local boys still gave as good as they got.\n\nThere is clearly potential to be tapped on.\n\nCONFIDENT\n\nHami showed a confidence that belied his tender age and diminutive build (he stands at just 1.66m), even attempting a shot from the halfway line last night, which dropped a few metres wide of goal.\n\nStriker Amiruldin Asraf, 19, plays for S.League side Home United's reserve team, but the son of former national striker Nordin Khalil perhaps did enough in these two games to show Home coach Philippe Aw he could be ready for the first team.\n\nBut the players need more tests against teams like Iran, and in competitions such as these, to get better.\n\nAdam, who Tardy says has enough skill to be a \"technical leader\" for the team, ran his socks off, and started making stray passes in the final 10 minutes. He was exhausted.\n\nIn fact, with about 15 minutes to go, Tardy was maniacally screaming from his touchline, cajoling his players to make runs and move.\n\nThe minds were willing, but the flesh was weak.\n\nThat's why the Football Association of Singapore needs to make sure this group of boys continue to play against the top teams in the continent as much as possible over the next year, if they hope to pull off a surprise in KL.\n\nAs Iran coach Amirhossein Peiravani said: \"Singapore need to work on their mental side...

CHERYL YING (yinghqc@sph.com.sg) asks two engineers what they love about their job\n\nShare this article\n\nForget the One Ring from the Lord Of The Rings books. Mr Edward Tiong has something cooler. He and his partner are the creators of the Sesame Ring.\n\nWhile studying at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), they noticed that it was a hassle to whip out their student matriculation card every time they had to enter a venue.\n\n\"We looked at the technology inside the card and shrunk it down to something that we could easily wear on our fingers,\" says the 27-year-old who graduated last year with a degree in engineering systems and design.\n\nAnd so the Sesame Ring was born. The ring is now used in SUTD and was also adapted into a wristband that is used by several start-ups here.\n\nEven the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in the US took a liking to the ring and gave him the rights to develop and sell this wearable technology for its metro system.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 21, 2025, 06:51am\n\n'Too fat cannot, too skinny cannot': Employer asks for applicant's full-body photo\n\nMore related stories\n\nPATENT\n\nMr Tiong and his partner have a provisional patent for the Sesame Ring. He hopes to eventually adapt this technology completely into a mobile device, so that people can get around with just with their mobile phones.\n\nCreations such as the Sesame Ring prove that concepts learnt in engineering can be applied to real life. Mr Tiong believes that as an engineer, there is always space to innovate and be creative.\n\n\"Engineers by training are the ones who are able to step into the most (number of) industries after they graduate,\" he says.\n\nHe shared his experience in exploration and discovery at the Singapore Science Festival's National Engineers Dayyesterday.\n\nHe says it all started when he fixed his own PlayStation console.\n\nMr Tiong says: \"I realised that if you are daring enough to poke around and explore, you'll find interesting gems. Problems don't look that complicated once you start working on them, and it can be just a very simple solution like clicking things into place.\"\n\nBy\n\nCheryl Ying\n\nRead articles by Cheryl Ying\n\njobs\n\nSingapore\n\nTechnology\n\nengineer\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 22, 2025, 02:54am\n\nEx-offender starts café to offer others job, community, acceptance\n\nJan 2, 2025, 11:56pm\n\nRepeatedly bitten but never shy\n\nNov 12, 2024, 01:27am\n\nSecurity guard, 70, scammed into paying $5,000 for teaching job in Laos\n\nOct 29, 2024, 03:13am\n\nS'pore employment rate up in Q3 2024, retrenchments down\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6a424a2646956f1634fa16859d77d16e8813fb640910ab24b194eb13b695ccd8/NP_20160724_CYENGINEER_1333627.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Edward Tiong (above)", "caption": "Mr Edward Tiong (above)"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2d88a44bcc0318c1c0505922b0557e720e81600cf720bf7a53bda5f1533f33cb/hire_0.png?w=150", "alt_text": "'Too fat cannot, too skinny cannot': Employer asks for applicant's full-body photo", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ff8a255aed6c1126a09d8d68c8295e6e3d671940e7aca2cc8473f6e64461defa/22a6f039c61c0edadcdf5e71fa6652df45f0df3303477f6e1f64924a6381443c.png?w=318", "alt_text": "Ex-offender starts café to offer others job, community, acceptance", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

If any new credible evidence emerges, the three countries will continue to work together to analyse the evidence.\"\n\nHe also said cost was not a factor in deciding to suspend the search.\n\nHe noted that all data and information collected from the search would be released to the public, but that \"this needs time for compiling\".\n\nMeanwhile, various media reported yesterday that the plane's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, conducted a simulation of a similar path just weeks prior, using an elaborate home-built flight simulator to steer himself over the Strait of Malacca and into the remote southern Indian ocean - a course with striking resemblance to the route MH370 is believed to have taken.\n\nThe finding, which casts a shadow of suspicion over the 53-year-old pilot, was first published Friday by New York magazine, which obtained a confidential document from Malaysian police investigating the incident.\n\nAccording to the document, the FBI recovered deleted data points from the flight simulator on Zaharie's hard drive. \"We found a flight path that leads to the Southern Indian Ocean, among the numerous other flight paths charted on the flight simulator, that could be of interest,\" the document said.\n\nmalaysia\n\nmalaysia airlines\n\nMH370\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18eb560a13fda40eee3df589c84bcd6062a3c2b8374d9d3f1eccc808100d7021/NP_20160724_PLANE24-9S4_1333768.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CLOSING: The search will be suspended if the aircraft is not discovered after the search zone is completely scoured.", "caption": "CLOSING: The search will be suspended if the aircraft is not discovered after the search zone is completely scoured."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ad66bd2a3f3636a95fce240f004f94e2b834d9cf9917fd4792d04d4fb9ec20b7/VEP.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Singaporean drivers beware: VEP fines have started", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9440467cfa4430cdf4dc361e70f98f190aafdfd03c05e753e47166cc5c948627/FW1486550KL2326062025MAHKAMAHAMPANG-ChooKiong.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But no, I'm already 34, and I will choose my family,\" Isinbayeva said.\n\nThe two-time Olympic champion said that she planned to launch a legal appeal.\n\n\"There is some point in lodging an appeal as an individual to complain against the CAS decision,\" she said.\n\n\"If this is upheld, to go further to the international court of human rights, to prove there that I was not involved (in doping).\n\n\"For me, it will be a question of principle and it's already not in any way linked to participating in the Games in Rio, since there won't be time for that to happen,\" she said.\n\nCLINGING ON\n\nSports minister Vitaly Mutko, who has clung on despite the scandal, said Moscow now hopes the IOC will defer to individual international sporting federations to decide whether other Russian squads can compete.\n\nThe CAS ruling has been the focus of Olympic attention since an independent World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) report this week said Russia ran a \"state-dictated fail-safe system\" of drug cheating in 30 sports at the 2014 Sochi Games and other major events.\n\nBut Russia has found support from some international sports bodies, with the International Judo Federation (IJF) insisting all clean athletes should be allowed to take part in Rio.\n\n\"We hope that by allowing participation of Russian athletes in Rio 2016, we will send out a positive message to all the young people who deserve to be given examples of friendship instead of examples of Cold War,\" said IJF president Marius Vizer.\n\nIndividual Russian federations said they were now looking nervously ahead for the IOC to make its next move.\n\n\"We're all in suspense waiting for the IOC decision,\" wrestling federation president Mikhail Mamiashvili told AFP. \"I hope that the common sense and personal responsibility of those who will take the decision will prevail.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the IOC announced yesterday that 45 athletes have failed dope tests after their samples from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2012 London Games were re-analysed.\n\nThe results are from a second wave of re-tests and take the total number of athletes who tested positive for prohibited substances to 98, the IOC added in a statement.\n\nOf the 45 failed tests announced yesterday, 30 were from Beijing, including 23 medallists, and 15 were from London.\n\nThe IOC did not say if any of the London athletes had won medals.\n\n\"The new re-analysis once again shows the commitment of the IOC in the fight against doping,\" IOC president Bach said.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nsport\n\nOlympics\n\nRussia\n\ndoping\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1ec5b9d02e8e4c3fc5e4887a48886e10e6dd711479a625907537a777e132f29c/NP_20160723_RUS23_1332769.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "\"If the International Olympic Committee refuses to allow Russian competitors to go to the Olympics, I don’t see any point any more in continuing training.\" -

article is more than 12 months old\n\nJul 22, 2016, 10:02pm\n\nBruce quits Hull: reports\n\nShare this article\n\nSteve Bruce has resigned as manager of Hull City, according to reports.\n\nBruce, 55, led Hull to promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in May, but has reportedly quit following a meeting with the club's owners and did not take training yesterday morning.\n\nThe former Sunderland, Wigan and Birmingham boss, appointed at the KC Stadium in June 2012, was interviewed for the England job on Monday, but the Football Association announced Sam Allardyce as Roy Hodgson's successor yesterday.\n\nBruce, whose offer to resign in 2014 following the club's relegation was turned down, revealed he was unsure of his future after the Tigers' play-off triumph over Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nHull chairman Assem Allam, who missed the trip to Wembley after undergoing surgery, has been in takeover talks with two American consortiums and the club announced this week that those had been put on hold to allow them to prepare for life back in the top flight.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut no major new signings have been made with the start of the new season just three weeks away.\n\nBruce is understood to have sought assurances from the Allam family over the club's future, while his frustrations over lack of player recruitment have grown with goalkeeper Allan McGregor, Michael Dawson, Moses Odubajo and his son, Alex, all ruled out through long-term injuries.\n\nAllam first put the club up for sale in 2014 after the FA rejected his bid to change their name to Hull Tigers and, due to ill health, has delegated the day-to-day running of the club to his son and vice-chairman Ehab.\n\nSUCCESSFUL\n\nBruce signed a new three-year contract in March 2015 and is the most successful manager in Hull's history, twice winning promotion to the Premier League with the club and guiding them to their first FA Cup final appearance in 2014 when they lost to Arsenal.\n\nHis coaching career began with brief assignments at Sheffield United, Huddersfield, Wigan and Crystal Palace, but he put a reputation for itchy feet behind him during a largely successful six-year stay at Birmingham, whom he also led to the Premier League on two occasions.\n\nHe went on to manage Wigan again and then Sunderland, who sacked him in November 2011, before he was appointed as Nick Barmby's successor at Hull in June 2012.\n\n- PA Sport.\n\nsport\n\nFootball\n\nSteve Bruce\n\nengland\n\nShare

We came in second last year, which was disappointing. But we're on the right track.\"\n\nArsenal, who face Lens in their first pre-season friendly this morning (Singapore time) before flying for two matches in the United States, now have the financial muscle to compete for the biggest names following years of being beaten to the punch as they continued to pay off their move to the Emirates Stadium.\n\nYOUNG TALENT\n\nBut Gazidis insists they will continue with their policy of believing in their young talent and do not operate to a model that would see them match the money being spent by rivals with wealthy backers.\n\n\"We're making progress in what is a fiercely competitive world, against competitors that have the capability to spend far more money than we do,\" he said.\n\n\"We're doing it by being very, very disciplined; spending money where we believe it makes a difference, but also giving young players a chance and believing in ourselves and our values.\"\n\nArsenal have signed young Japan striker Takuma Asano as well as Xhaka but, given the belief in the current squad, there may be no further additions to Wenger's attacking options despite a long-term injury to Danny Welbeck and both Olivier Giroud and Sanchez set to miss the start of the season following international exertions.\n\nYesterday, Arsenal confirmed the signing of England Under-21 defender Rob Holding from League One side Bolton. The 20-year-old came through the ranks at Bolton before breaking into the first team 12 months ago and immediately went on to establish himself in the side.\n\nBolton finished bottom of the Championship as they dropped down to the third tier but that did not stop Holding picking up the club's Player of the Season award.\n\nThe versatile defender was their third summer acquisition, but both the fee and the length of the contract were undisclosed.\n\n- PA Sport.\n\nsport\n\nFootball\n\nenglish premier league\n\nepl\n\narsenal\n\ntitle\n\ntransfer\n\nIvan Gazidis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c236ae4f6c8a1d753933587cc3971fe3325643117cef39b7906d2bdd0a9f4ca7/NP_20160723_ARS23_1332967.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "INVINCIBLES: Arsenal's class of 2003/04 (left) were the last Gunners team to win the Premier League.", "caption": "INVINCIBLES: Arsenal's class of 2003/04 (left) were the last Gunners team to win the Premier League."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

meaning it was manned at the end - and made it beyond the area marked out by calculations from satellite images.\n\nHe said: \"If it was manned, it could glide for a long way.\n\n\"You could glide it for further than our search area is, so I believe the logical conclusion will be, well, maybe, that is the other scenario.\"\n\nDoubts that the search teams are looking in the right place will fuel calls for all data to be made publicly available so that academics and rival companies can pursue an \"open source\" solution - a collaborative public answer to the airline industry's greatest mystery.\n\nFugro's controlled glide hypothesis is also the first time officials have lent some support to contested theories that someone was in control during the flight's final moments.\n\nmalaysia\n\nMH370\n\nAustralia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ab99ebb26c3c31bd5e9f441d1e4334c7e6afd15b969dd65ae8ded71ed1f15e1e/NP_20160722_SEARCH22_1331935.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "DEBRIS: This undated handout photo released by the Australia Transport Safety Bureau on Wednesday shows Malaysian and Australian investigators examining a piece of aircraft debris found on Pemba Island off the coast of Tanzania.", "caption": "DEBRIS: This undated handout photo released by the Australia Transport Safety Bureau on Wednesday shows Malaysian and Australian investigators examining a piece of aircraft debris found on Pemba Island off the coast of Tanzania."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ad66bd2a3f3636a95fce240f004f94e2b834d9cf9917fd4792d04d4fb9ec20b7/VEP.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Singaporean drivers beware: VEP fines have started", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9440467cfa4430cdf4dc361e70f98f190aafdfd03c05e753e47166cc5c948627/FW1486550KL2326062025MAHKAMAHAMPANG-ChooKiong.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Why not?\n\n\"If you take a team from the lower part of the table, you have to adapt what you want to do.\n\n\"You have to defend and be organised or you will go down.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"So I think it depends on the situation, whether you have a top team, a middle team or a bottom team.\n\n\"Many times Sam has managed a team that have been struggling for survival and he has done the job.\"\n\nAllardyce himself has previously claimed that he would have landed a job at one of the Premier League's bigger teams if he was a foreigner, adding that he would win trophies galore if he managed one of England or Europe's bigger clubs.\n\nFormer England midfielder Jamie Redknapp called criticisms of his playing style \"cliche\".\n\nCLICHE\n\nHe wrote in his Daily Mail column: \"His 'way of playing' is a cliche. I've played against his teams and they could play too.\n\n\"Sure, if you wanted to fight, they would fight but, if you played, they would try to match you.\n\n\"He made the most of his players and adapted his style to their strengths.\"\n\nSir Alex Ferguson, meanwhile, opined that the English FA's prospective decision to go for a homegrown candidate is the right one.\n\nHe said: \"(Allardyce is) certainly the top Englishman. You can search the world for a top manager, but it was right to appoint an Englishman.\"\n\nEven former critic Mourinho believes the 61-year-old is ready for the \"big one\".\n\nSaid the Manchester United boss: \"I think he's the right person. I think he is a good choice...\n\n\"I think Sam never had the big chance at the highest level - lots of experiences in the Premier League but never that big one.\n\n\"And now he has the big one, so I think he is more than ready.\n\n\"I think he is a good motivator, I think he can create a good team spirit with his players.\"\n\nBeing a master motivator is one of Allardyce's strong suits, according to former player Kevin Davies.\n\nDescribing his former Bolton Wanderers boss, he told talkSPORT: \"He makes you think, 'Yeah, I really want to play for this guy'.\n\n\"I think he's done that with a lot of players. That's why we had success at Bolton, because of what he gave you individually - he could sit you down and motivate you as an individual - and he could do that in team meetings as well...\n\n\"He's an expert at that.\"\n\nAllardyce's former No. 2 Phil Brown added that England's humbling Euro 2016 Round-of-16 defeat by Iceland wouldn't have happened had his old boss been in charge.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: \"The game against Iceland, I thought we looked devoid of ideas, it looked as if we did not have a game plan.\n\n\"Sam would never go into a game without a game plan and certainly a change of plan, if something went wrong.\"\n\nIn addition to having a coherent strategy, Redknapp believes the new England boss needs to adjust the attitude of his charges.\n\nHe said: \"Allardyce's in-tray: stop England playing like they are scared, stop the players looking as if tournaments are a chore delaying their holidays, stop the paranoia...\n\n\"Being manager of England is not a difficult job, but I think a lot of people have made it look difficult recently.\n\n\"There is talk of the job being a poisoned chalice and a bad time to take over. I couldn't disagree more.\n\n\"I am convinced we have good players and he will love the idea of getting his hands on John Stones, Marcus Rashford, Dele Alli, Harry Kane, Eric Dier and Ross Barkley.\" - Wire Services.\n\nHe's very organised, so it will be a very organised team...

I felt I had to show Singapore what my true ability was,\" said Chadwick, who arrived in Singapore yesterday week, along with his wife and two-year-old daughter and was seen at the Kranji meeting the following night.\n\n\"I'm always looking to go somewhere during the past few off-seasons, and I've always wanted to come and ride here, but couldn't for various reasons, mostly because I always had things to do,\" he said.\n\n\"I went to UK in 2012 and won the Silver Saddle at the Shergar Cup. I was in the Rest Of The World Team with Yutaka Take and Aaron Gryder, finished second three times before winning the last race on Mince.\n\n\"I ended up staying longer there and eventually rode three winners from 20 rides, which was pretty good.\n\n\"But I felt this year was the right time to come to Singapore even if at first, I also had the Australian option, but the bonus is the nicer weather in Singapore.\"\n\nChadwick, who honed his craft in New South Wales, could have gone Down Under to return to his old school, but was glad he ticked the Singapore box.\n\n\"I know there are a lot more expat riders here now, but I relish the challenge. I'm here to try my best and hopefully I can make a fist of it,\" said Chadwick, who was at his first day of trackwork on Tuesday.\n\n\"I am thankful to the Singapore Turf Club for the chance they have given me. My philosophy is if you keep working hard, the results will come.\n\n\"I will be riding for some Hong Kong owners and also for the Lucky Stable. For a first week, I've been booked for five rides on Friday and four rides on Sunday, which is not too bad.\n\nFITNESS\n\n\"I don't know all the rides, but I know I've got a few for Leticia Dragon and two for Leslie Khoo (Sing Roulette and Man Of Power). It's quite a good start.\"\n\nChadwick, who can ride at around 51.5kg, is keen to get as much support as possible during his brief passage as, to him, his fitness can only improve with more rides.\n\n\"I need to get my fitness back, especially with the muscle in my right leg,\" said Chadwick, who also spent part of his childhood in Singapore, where his parents were stationed for a while.\n\n\"My right leg is already my weak leg as I was born with a dislocated patella and that is exactly where I hurt myself in a barrier accident.\n\n\"I had to go for major knee reconstruction which was quite complex as my doctors had to make sure they did not make the other muscle in my thigh worse.\n\n\"That's why I missed out most of the last season and only started riding back in February.\n\n\"It was hard to get back into it, especially with Joao Moreira and Zac Purton getting the pick of the rides, but luckily John Size put me on a winner and it's picked up since.\n\n\"It's only towards the end of the season in the last 10 meetings that I started to ride more winners, mainly for Tony Cruz. I did get a personal trainer to improve on my fitness as he can really pinpoint which area I need to work on, but I was still not 100% happy with my fitness, especially with the lack of muscle around my thigh, hamstring and quads.\n\n\"I was off so long, for almost half the season. It's taken me two months to get my fitness back and I didn't want to lose it even more during the break and that's why I wanted to keep riding.\n\n\"The next five weeks in Singapore will be all about keeping fit, both mentally and physically, and hopefully I can also ride a lot of winners.\"\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nFind the Best Fixed Deposit Rates\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e66377f314963577184d6c3847189d427a4064f8672244ba009c6837a6c2b693/np_20160722_chadwick22_1331083.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "RIGHT TIME: Hong Kong jockey Matthew Chadwick relishes the challenge against the top-quality expat riders at Kranji and the warmer weather is a bonus.

The restrictions had previously included the pit lane.\n\n- AFP.\n\nformula one\n\nNEW RULES\n\nradio\n\nhungarian grand prix\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 4, 2024, 02:02am\n\nHPL asks to halt trading ahead of Ong Beng Seng's court session\n\nOct 3, 2024, 11:31pm\n\nProperty tycoon Ong Beng Seng to be charged on Oct 4\n\nSep 20, 2024, 11:13am\n\nF1 rakes in big bucks but not everyone benefits from it\n\nSep 17, 2024, 07:10am\n\nLive screening of Singapore Grand Prix at 5 community hubs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThe Underrated Strategy That Keeps Your Investments on Track\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fbf0e71511ad779bd5449320ac0216011fea703a9f20744d83b34a86218646fc/file7yxn5uaybr61ipt2vur2.jpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Christian Ho crowned 2024 Eurocup-3 champion", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2f36cf6c81a2fa041f76dd1f524c6e700d509d8196801eef1d1b303ee33737a6/obs11120copy.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "HPL asks to halt trading ahead of Ong Beng Seng's court session", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

In 2014, he pledged allegiance to ISIS and earlier this year, the US placed him on a list of global terrorists.\n\n\"The group is obviously weakened now that we got the leader,\" national police chief Tito Karnavian told reporters, as he confirmed the militant's death.\n\nEXTREMISTS\n\nHe said the country's extremists had wanted to transform the Poso district, where Santoso and his followers were based, into a \"safe haven\" and a regional power base.\n\n\"With this group broken, the hope for a base there is gone,\" he added.\n\nAfter Indonesia suffered a string of extremist attacks in the early 2000s, including the 2002 Bali bombings which killed more than 200, the authorities launched a crackdown that weakened the most dangerous networks.\n\nBut Santoso's group remained a thorn in the side of the government, with the long-haired, gun-toting militant regularly appearing in videos urging extremists to launch attacks.\n\nThe picture has changed recently, with other cells now considered a greater threat - Santoso was not believed to have played a role in an ISIS-claimed attack in Jakarta in January that left four attackers and four civilians dead.\n\nSantoso also attracted militants from abroad, with several members of China's mostly Muslim Uighur minority travelling to Indonesia to join his group.\n\nUnfortunately, security experts believe Santoso's death would not undermine support for ISIS in Indonesia, Reuters reported.\n\nindonesia\n\nISIS\n\nattack\n\nSANTOSO\n\nOPERATION TINOMBALA\n\nPOSO\n\ngunfire\n\nhunt\n\nsecurity forces\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 05:17am\n\nSIA, Scoot flights from Changi Airport to Bali among dozens cancelled after Indonesia volcano eruption\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nMan to be charged for buying KrisFlyer accounts illegally to use air miles on purchases\n\nMar 8, 2025, 11:47pm\n\nIndonesian man allegedly flashes at air stewardess on Singapore-bound flight\n\nJan 25, 2025, 01:00am\n\nCPIB arrests businessman wanted in Indonesia for alleged corruption\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8d726e343d071177a9567c23c9b7aed57820c3598b9ef2b7ca7635c86ea3fad4/NP_20160720_DEAD20_1329504.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "VIOLENT END: (Above) Santoso (head covered), who was shot dead, with his confidant Basri.

The appointment of Jose Mourinho is a fantastic appointment.\n\n\"We are all as a group of players excited by it and the signings that we have made have been fantastic.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can have a good start to the season and be successful at the end of it.\"\n\nUnited get their campaign underway at Bournemouth on Aug 14, by which point Rooney's role within Mourinho's new-look team should have become clearer.\n\nHow best to utilise the 30-year-old is a question made all the more intriguing by the United boss saying he has no intention of playing the skipper in a deeper midfield role like predecessor van Gaal or former England manager Roy Hodgson.\n\nThe summer acquisitions of Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan have increased the competition for places in attack and Rooney knows how many eyes will be on him.\n\n\"You always feel pressure when you play for Manchester United,\" the captain said.\n\n\"It's one of, if not the, biggest football club in the world and it is a pleasure to have played for them for them for so long.\n\n\"Always you feel like you've got to prove yourself each season and it's a joy to play for them so, of course, there's pressure, there's pressure to be successful.\"\n\nRooney's first media appearance since England's embarrassing Euro 2016 exit to Iceland came during a peculiar and wide-ranging press conference with United's global partner Gulf Oil International.\n\nIt was taken in good humour, though, as was a question about how the captain was finding it working under former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss Mourinho.\n\n\"Well, I've had only one day before we come out,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"But it was a very good day, a good training session.\n\n\"But you have to look at the teams he has been at before and the success he has brought to those teams, which we're hoping and we believe that he can bring that success to us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Man United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has not travelled for United's clash against Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai tomorrow amid reports that a world-record offer for Pogba has been rejected.\n\nNO UNITED START\n\nThe 23-year-old departed Old Trafford four years ago having failed to make a single first-team start, racking up a mere seven appearances in all competitions.\n\nPogba subsequently flourished and has transformed into one of the world's best midfielders, shining during a medal-laden period with Serie A champions Juventus.\n\nNow, though, a return to United could be on the cards and the Guardian reports a transfer package worth £100 million ($178m) has been turned down by the Turin giants.\n\nThe newspaper says Juventus want a basic £100m plus £8m add-ons for a player who is also attracting interest from Real Madrid, with head coach Zinedine Zidane an admirer of the midfielder.\n\nHowever, United are the bookmakers' favourites to sign Pogba and Woodward was conspicuous by his absence when the team landed in Shanghai yesterday.\n\nWoodward is hoping to add Pogba to the summer arrivals of Bailly, Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan, the last two are clients of Pogba's agent Mino Raiola.\n\nReports in Italy suggest the player has told Juventus he wants to leave, having last week publicly stated his happiness at the club.\n\nIt is understood Woodward could head to China for the second friendly against Manchester City in Beijing on Monday.\n\n-

However, when the two teams last met in May 2015, Hull held on to a 0-0 draw.\n\nWorth noting that last season, the Red Devils won just seven of 19 when playing away and EVEN seemed to be the call in Man United matches.

What a day! The traffic was difficult to navigate, but it was an amazing race. A special thank you to the fans - you make this such a great event.\"\n\nThe Briton took the chequered flag less than two seconds ahead of the German, who had lined up on pole position at the Hungaroring but lost out to Hamilton at the start in the key moment of the race.\n\nHamilton now leads Rosberg by six points after 11 of the season's 21 races. The Briton has won five of the last six races, including the last three.\n\nOVERTAKING SCHUMI\n\nUntil yesterday, he had shared the record for Hungary GP wins with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher.\n\n\"I grew up watching Michael, so to have a similar number, and now one more than he had here, is incredible,\" said Hamilton.\n\nAustralian Daniel Ricciardo finished third for Red Bull after pushing the Mercedes pair hard enough at one point for the champions to tell Hamilton to pick up the pace.\n\nFerrari's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, also a previous winner in Hungary, finished fourth after sounding off over the team radio about slower cars holding him up as he lapped them.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen held off Ferrari's feisty Kimi Raikkonen for fifth. The Finn had started 14th but a long first stint saw him challenging the Dutchman.\n\nThe battle between the pair provided a moment of excitement in an otherwise uneventful race, with Raikkonen clipping the back of Verstappen's car and damaging his front wing in an attempt to pass the 18-year-old.\n\nFernando Alonso was the sole-surviving McLaren in seventh.\n\nMcLaren's hopes of a strong result on the back of their best qualifying performance since renewing their engine partnership with Honda were dashed early on, with Jenson Button falling down the order with hydraulics problems.\n\nThe 2009 world champion also collected a drive-through penalty for a breach of radio rules before finally retiring late in the race.\n\nRosberg, who has also won five races this year, will have the chance to seize back the lead in his home German Grand Prix.\n\nHOCKENHEIM NEXT\n\nThe race at Hockenheim, absent from last year's calendar, takes place this weekend.\n\n\"It was all down to the start in the end,\" said Rosberg, of yesterday's race.\n\n\"From then on, I was trying to put all the pressure on Lewis but it's not possible to pass at this track.\n\n\"To have the next race coming up very quickly sounds good, at my home race... it's going to be awesome.\" - Reuters.\n\nHUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX (Top 5)\n\n1.

But one lapse saw them failing to make the final, losing 1-0 to Hong Kah Secondary School.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\nDefending champions Hong Kah found just one crack in Siglap's defence and, from that, they poached the winning goal.\n\nHong Kah's Shahrulnizam Mazlan capitalised on the only big chance.\n\nHe sped past the centre backs and beat goalkeeper Yeo Wen Bin for the killer goal in the 65th minute.\n\nSiglap were stunned, but they refused to lie down.\n\nThey kept the pressure up and had a chance to take the game into extra-time but were denied by a goal-line save by Hong Kah skipper Muhammad Nurdanial.\n\nSaid Nurdanial: \"I knew that he was going to for the far post and, thankfully, I managed to get there in time.\"\n\nSiglap were crestfallen. But their head coach Fabio Fantecelle, 42, tried to lift their spirits.\n\n\"It's very heartening to see my boys give of their best and come so far in the tournament,\" he said. \"My boys worked really hard today, and played well against an experienced and strong side like Hong Kah.\"\n\nIn an earlier match, Tanjong Katong beat St Gabriel's Secondary 4-1 to secure their spot in the final.\n\nTanjong Katong's Muhammad Syafiq scored the opener in the second minute and found the net again in the 23rd while Banbury Lee got the third eight minutes from the break after a diagonal cross left the opposing goalkeeper rooted.\n\nHaiqal Assyiddiq went on to seal the deal with a fourth in the 45th minute before St Gabriel's grabbed a consolation goal six minutes later.\n\nThe final wll be played at the Jalan Besar Stadium at 4.40pm on Wednesday.\n\nSt Gabriel's face Siglap for the third-placed play-off at 3pm.\n\nBy\n\nHaresh Kumar Ramani\n\nRead articles by Haresh Kumar Ramani\n\nsport\n\nSCHOOLS SPORTS\n\nSiglap\n\nTANJONG KATONG SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nST GABRIEL SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nHONGKAH SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6964493b20a4d4b56a82b3c4800c6e5661716dfc0dc83fc18404b333204dc917/NP_20160723_HKSOC23_1333081.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "ON TO THE FINAL: Shahrulnizam Mazlan (left) celebrating with teammate Mohammad Nizam after scoring the only goal for Hong Kah Secondary School to send them to the National Schools' B Division final.  ", "caption": "ON TO THE FINAL: Shahrulnizam Mazlan (left) celebrating with teammate Mohammad Nizam after scoring the only goal for Hong Kah Secondary School to send them to the National Schools' B Division final."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It does not cause stomach bloating or discomfort.\n\nThis is an important factor that ensures I drink sufficiently and comfortably.\n\nIt also contains carbohydrates to refuel my working muscles and helps promote muscle recovery, which is critical in a marathon.\n\nIt keeps me hydrated and gives me something to look forward to when the going gets tough.\n\nTrain hard and drink smart as you plan to race!\n\nSingapore national marathoner Soh Rui Yong was talking to Sazali Abdul Aziz.\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nsport\n\nSoh Rui Yong\n\nMarathon\n\nH-TWO-O\n\nRUN\n\nHYDRATE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/15572552d9348789e05c0585473a8de6bf72be15500a2f1a38fad5edc0a46909/NP_20160721_SZSOH21_1330309.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "DRINK UP: Marathoner Soh Rui Yong (left) drinks H-TWO-O for his long runs. ", "caption": "DRINK UP: Marathoner Soh Rui Yong (left) drinks H-TWO-O for his long runs."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The appointment of Jose Mourinho is a fantastic appointment.\n\n\"We are all as a group of players excited by it and the signings that we have made have been fantastic.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can have a good start to the season and be successful at the end of it.\"\n\nUnited get their campaign underway at Bournemouth on Aug 14, by which point Rooney's role within Mourinho's new-look team should have become clearer.\n\nHow best to utilise the 30-year-old is a question made all the more intriguing by the United boss saying he has no intention of playing the skipper in a deeper midfield role like predecessor van Gaal or former England manager Roy Hodgson.\n\nThe summer acquisitions of Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan have increased the competition for places in attack and Rooney knows how many eyes will be on him.\n\n\"You always feel pressure when you play for Manchester United,\" the captain said.\n\n\"It's one of, if not the, biggest football club in the world and it is a pleasure to have played for them for them for so long.\n\n\"Always you feel like you've got to prove yourself each season and it's a joy to play for them so, of course, there's pressure, there's pressure to be successful.\"\n\nRooney's first media appearance since England's embarrassing Euro 2016 exit to Iceland came during a peculiar and wide-ranging press conference with United's global partner Gulf Oil International.\n\nIt was taken in good humour, though, as was a question about how the captain was finding it working under former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss Mourinho.\n\n\"Well, I've had only one day before we come out,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"But it was a very good day, a good training session.\n\n\"But you have to look at the teams he has been at before and the success he has brought to those teams, which we're hoping and we believe that he can bring that success to us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Man United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has not travelled for United's clash against Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai tomorrow amid reports that a world-record offer for Pogba has been rejected.\n\nNO UNITED START\n\nThe 23-year-old departed Old Trafford four years ago having failed to make a single first-team start, racking up a mere seven appearances in all competitions.\n\nPogba subsequently flourished and has transformed into one of the world's best midfielders, shining during a medal-laden period with Serie A champions Juventus.\n\nNow, though, a return to United could be on the cards and the Guardian reports a transfer package worth £100 million ($178m) has been turned down by the Turin giants.\n\nThe newspaper says Juventus want a basic £100m plus £8m add-ons for a player who is also attracting interest from Real Madrid, with head coach Zinedine Zidane an admirer of the midfielder.\n\nHowever, United are the bookmakers' favourites to sign Pogba and Woodward was conspicuous by his absence when the team landed in Shanghai yesterday.\n\nWoodward is hoping to add Pogba to the summer arrivals of Bailly, Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan, the last two are clients of Pogba's agent Mino Raiola.\n\nReports in Italy suggest the player has told Juventus he wants to leave, having last week publicly stated his happiness at the club.\n\nIt is understood Woodward could head to China for the second friendly against Manchester City in Beijing on Monday.\n\n-

These shareholders will have to hold at least 75 per cent of the value of SMRT shares held by all shareholders present at the meeting.\n\nSingapore\n\nsmrt\n\nBusiness\n\nTEMASEK HOLDINGS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nTrendingResults\n\nWhat’s my car worth?

Among these, the capacity for destruction rather than creation knows no bounds.\n\nIt could have been so different, had man worked together to erase the ills of the world much earlier.\n\nI feel the 1970s was when the negativity set in, with many looking inwards to satisfy one's own selfish desires.\n\nThis is where the seeds of discontent were sown.\n\nThe deadly sin of greed took on frightening proportions.\n\nIt is a pity, as we had a chance to start over and not repeat the same mistakes after the two World Wars.\n\nBut we have learnt little, it would seem.\n\nAnd this is being taken advantage of by those who serve their own lust for wealth, power or glory.\n\nIt is clear that it is not some unseen hand at work, or evil prophecy of impending doom, but rather our own actions that have brought us to this point.\n\nSingapore\n\npolitics\n\nterrorism\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\n12\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\n5\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\n1\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\n4\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nTrendingResults\n\nWhat’s my car worth?

The pictures have been circulating online and have enraged environmentalists.\n\nConservation research group Danau Girang Field Centre director Benoît Goossens, who posted on its Facebook page, said it was incomprehensible to think that such an act was allowed to be carried out there, Malay Mail Online reported.\n\nThe photos were supposedly taken on July 16, reports said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 4, 2024, 09:00pm\n\nSurvivors of 2015 Sabah quake want to summit Mt Kinabalu\n\nMore related stories\n\nAsked if state authorities were aware of the killing, Mr Masidi said: \"What difference does it make when there is no law against it?\n\n\"The photos speaks volumes of what I and many other Sabahans have been advocating for the last five years.\"\n\nHe added that he had given his thoughts on the problems many times in the past.\n\nCRAZY\n\nDr Goossens said: \"The massacre has to stop. It is crazy to think that it is happening a few miles from the best diving spots where divers go to see sharks.\n\n\"I think Sabah should make a stand and put sharks under special protection in Sabah's waters and enforce it.\n\n\"Sharks attract divers from all over the world to Sabah, it is a huge tourism industry bringing millions to the state. Sabah needs to get its own law, ban shark killing and finning, and enforce the law in its waters.\"\n\nFollowing reports of an 80 per cent decline of sharks in its waters, the state has been pushing for the federal government to ban shark hunting and finning by amending its Fisheries Act.\n\nBut its three-year proposal was dismissed, claiming that shark hunting was not a huge business in the state.\n\nThe Sabah Shark Protection Association said a law banning shark hunting was just as important as having sanctuaries, The Star reported.\n\nIts chairman Aderick Chong added that without such laws, shark hunting would continue.\n\nMalaysia is currently the world's ninth-largest shark producer.\n\nConservation organisation Traffic reported that more than 231 tonnes of sharks were caught in Malaysia between 2002 and 2011, accounting for 2.9 per cent of the total globally-reported shark catch.\n\nFisheries statistics also showed a decreasing amount of sharks being caught each year since 2003, indicating a decline in its population.\n\nMr Masidi has since said that the state will enforce its own shark sanctuary through its marine parks soon.\n\nThe Tun Sakaran marine park in Semporna, Tunku Abdul Rahman marine park fronting the state capital and the proposed Tun Mustapha marine park in Kudat would be declared shark sanctuaries.\n\nThe three parks total about 2 million hectares and is home to about 80 per cent of the state's shark population.\n\nThe Tun Mustapha marine park is set to be launched on Sunday.\n\nsabah\n\nsea\n\nFISH DEATHS\n\nSHARK FINNING\n\nMabul\n\nDIVING SPOTS\n\nTourism\n\nhunting\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 17, 2023, 10:16am\n\n8 people fall for Sabah tour package scam, losing thousands\n\nFeb 21, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nJoie spurred on by tragedy\n\nFeb 6, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nBoat owner pleads not guilty to sinking incident in Sabah\n\nJan 31, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nSurvivors huddled to stay alive in cold waters\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a58ae66eecaafbd8623b4ce9a8d0331e72eb4844a1e923441905531781f56fd8/NP_20160720_SHARK20_1329599.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "HUNTED: More than 231 tonnes of sharks were caught in Malaysia between 2002 and 2011.", "caption": "HUNTED: More than 231 tonnes of sharks were caught in Malaysia between 2002 and 2011."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/717d4112d94e39f3189babf54019355824edc12c33428734c231b3b6a34bb33b/screenshot_2024-08-04_at_1.13.52_pm.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Survivors of 2015 Sabah quake want to summit Mt Kinabalu", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f006a6f23eb8940f262f36522197346b5fb82d98e6a2dd3a8380402ae1628f7f/travelscam.jpeg?w=318", "alt_text": "8 people fall for Sabah tour package scam, losing thousands", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It's the PGA in a week's time (at Baltusrol) and then the Olympics.

It was great to get that win there.\"\n\nHis success on the fairways of Troon was a far cry from the time four years ago when Stenson had slumped to 230th in the world rankings.\n\nAdd in the loss of millions of dollars in disgraced financier Allen Stanford's Ponzi scheme in 2009, as well as some serious health problems - including one caused by a parasite picked up on holiday - and Stenson's recovery is all the more remarkable.\n\n\"The second slump in my career was nothing compared to the one I had in the early 2000s,\" he added.\n\n\"I managed to put my game together with a lot of hard work and a lot of help from my team and support from my family, friends and everyone else.\n\n\"If I didn't believe, I wouldn't be sitting here.

Following victory at the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, the glorious spell was broken by poor results at Brazil 2014 and Euro 2016. Del Bosque decided to step down after Spain's exit from the Euros but, prior to officially leaving his post, the manager met with Fifa.com to give his verdict on his time in charge of the European giants.\n\nShare this article\n\nNow that your eight-year spell as Spain coach has drawn to a close, what's your verdict on your time in charge?\n\nDEL BOSQUE:\n\nThere's been a bit of everything. We've had the opportunity to win a lot of things, but we've also suffered defeats. That's sport.\n\nBut I leave with a clear conscience and the feeling of having fulfilled my duty to Spanish football.\n\nDo you have any regrets?\n\nNo, to be honest, I don't. I'm not saying that I'm leaving having completed every task I was set, because we knew that was impossible.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\nTo have won another World Cup and another Euro would have been virtually impossible. I go with a feeling of not leaving any loose ends.\n\nWe were able to continue the great work we inherited from Luis Aragones in 2008, and the national squad we leave behind is one that can and should be viewed with optimism.\n\nYou have always shown a lot of gratitude for the job that Aragones did. Can you explain to us what you inherited from him and what legacy you leave for your successor?\n\nWe inherited a style of play and a pathway that was laid out. But, after that, each coach has to guide the team in his own way, depending on his background, character and personality.\n\nNo two coaches are the same but, at that moment in time, in 2008, the path was very well laid out for us.\n\nNow, too, I think the team are moving in the right direction, with the proviso that whoever comes in will need to bring in those players that merit inclusion, just as we did.\n\nIt must have been a privilege to be Spain head coach, given the generation of footballers at your disposal, but what was the main downside of the job?\n\nIt's when you have to make decisions trying to pick the best (players) and you might not get it right, because the margins involved are so tight.\n\nSo, yes, I'd include that in the negative box, that sometimes when choosing players we might have wronged some of them, though not through any sense of malice at all.\n\nWhen it comes to assembling any successful team, the players' talent and the coach's guidance go hand-in-hand. Percentage-wise, how much influence would you attribute to each of these two factors?\n\nThe main thing is to have good \"raw material\" at your disposal and then comes the coach's good judgment and sense of balance.\n\nThere are two areas where a coach needs to have an impact. (Firstly), when the squad are together, he should be a good leader and foster a friendly atmosphere within the group.\n\nAnd, secondly, he should provide the tools to help them become a great \"team\" in every sense of the word.\n\nSpain achieved success playing with a very characteristic style but, after what happened at Brazil 2014 and Euro 2016, this has come up for debate. Should this style be non-negotiable, as Xavi Hernandez often says?\n\nThat's a decision for the new coach and I don't think I should have any say at all.\n\nI'm keeping out of it. Whoever comes in will decide and will get it right.\n\nDo you have any advice for your successor?\n\nNo, no, no, not at all. Each one of us sees football in a different way and what seems right to me might not be shared by the next in charge.\n\nThe next coach must be given absolute freedom to shape things as he sees fit.\n\nI don't feel persecuted, that would be unfair. There is a group who want Spain to lose. They're the minority, because the rest are fantastic. But they're waiting for the smallest thing, to cut off your head. Now that Spain aren't winning, they appear more frequently. Fortunately, they are very few.\n\n- Outgoing Spain coach Vicente del Bosque, on the criticism he has received\n\nsport\n\nFootball\n\nEuro\n\nSpain\n\nDEL BOSQUE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cd971acb242f9e17c6d435465fa5bb08655c16ecde116ab451a51a10de788051/NP_20160720_DEL20_1329463.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Vicente del Bosque.", "caption": "Vicente del Bosque."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Women fighters will still wear them.\n\nMost in the fight game support the ditching of headwear, after the Aiba said extensive studies found that there were actually fewer concussions without headguards.\n\nCritics say there are likely to be more cuts as a result and, with so many fights packed into a fortnight, competitors will have little time for those wounds to heal between bouts.\n\nThat means there could be plenty of blood. And that is not all.\n\nThe deeply unpopular punch-counting system of scoring - which has thrown up numerous controversies over the years - has also been ditched to again bring Olympic boxing closer in line with professional bouts.\n\n10-POINT MUST SYSTEM\n\nNow ringside judges will use the \"10-point must system\", with the fighter that wins the round getting 10 points and the other between six and nine. For example, a 10-9 round means that it was close.\n\nThe United States, Cuba and Britain are the most successful countries and some of the world's finest boxers launched their careers at the Olympics.\n\nA certain Cassius Clay - later to call himself Muhammad Ali - won gold at the Rome Olympics in 1960.\n\nOther notable Olympic boxers who went on to stardom include Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Sugar Ray Leonard, Evander Holyfield, Oscar de la Hoya, Lennox Lewis and Floyd Mayweather.\n\nThe latest is Anthony Joshua, Britain's heavyweight champion from 2012, who is unbeaten as a pro and ploughing his way through the division.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of fighters who were brilliant Olympians but flopped as pros - think the widely ridiculed Audley \"A-Force\" Harrison, Britain's 2000 gold medallist.\n\nOlympic boxing will span almost the entire two weeks in Rio and 13 categories, with three weight classes for women and 10 for men.\n\nIt is just the second time in Olympic history that women will take part.\n\nSince its inclusion in the Olympic programme in 1904, boxing has been staged at every edition of the Games, except in 1912 in Stockholm because Swedish law did not allow the sport. - AFP.\n\nsport\n\nRio Olympics\n\nboxing\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nUNIQLO\n\nNew diverse jeans everyone’s wearing, from slim to wide fits\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/11b87230345ab526e88524baec8d00204ce1bf1e01a761e5bcc2656b772f0061/NP_20160720_BOX20A_1329401.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "RIO BOUND: Joe Joyce (above) will represent Britain in the ­super-heavyweight division at the Olympics next month.", "caption": "RIO BOUND: Joe Joyce (above) will represent Britain in the ­super-heavyweight division at the Olympics next month."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

That's probably why it's disappointing in that I don't have a point where I can look back and say, I should have done that or had I only done this,\" Mickelson admitted.\n\n\"I played a bogey-free round of 65 on the final round of a Major, usually that's good enough to do it and I got beat.\"\n\nMickelson's round featured four birdies as well as an eagle at the par-five fourth hole. It was a fourth consecutive under-par effort for him in often challenging conditions on Scotland's west coast.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTiger Woods moots part-time return\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe had started with a 63 to equal the lowest ever round in a Major, but Stenson repeated that feat on Sunday with 10 birdies on his way to lifting the Claret Jug.\n\n\"It's disappointing to come in second, but I'm happy for Henrik,\" Mickelson said.\n\n\"We've been friends for some time. I've always thought that he is one of the best ball-strikers in the game and that Major championships are perfectly suited for him.\n\n\"I knew that he would ultimately come through and win. I'm happy that he did. I'm disappointed that it was at my expense.\"\n\nCATCHING THE LIP\n\nMickelson had started the day one shot behind Stenson, but a birdie at the first combined with a bogey by his opponent saw the two swop places.\n\nStenson recovered from that, but the two were neck and neck before the Swede birdied the short 14th.\n\nHe then produced a stunning putt for another birdie at 15 and, at the long 16th, Mickelson saw an eagle putt stop dead on the edge of the hole.\n\n\"I really thought that was going to go in,\" he said.\n\n\"But it seems there have been a couple of putts like that this week.

who will now both be invested in expanding playing opportunities in Asia and the rest of the globe.\n\nThe two Tours will have a new joint office in Singapore, but will retain their own separate identity in terms of brand and logo, and will be managed by their own individual boards.\n\n\"Following successful discussions over the past year to develop our joint vision, we are delighted to announce this 'Strategic Alliance',\" Keith Pelley, chief executive of the European Tour, said.\n\n\"We have enjoyed a very strong and prosperous relationship with the Asian Tour over the past 17 years, and this formalises that partnership, representing an exciting new era in our association.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTiger Woods moots part-time return\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Malaysian Open in 1999 was the first co-sanctioned Tour between the two organisations, which have since conducted 95 such tournaments.\n\nPLAYER CONCERNS\n\nTalks on the expected union appeared to be in trouble in December when Asian Tour chief executive Mike Kerr resigned for unspecified reasons, following player concerns about limited opportunities on the combined circuit.\n\nIn December, after Kerr's departure, the old Asian Tour board of directors, including former European Tour chief Ken Schofield, was ousted.\n\nFour Asian businessmen were voted in as non-playing directors, three board player members were also removed and Kyi Hla Han was promoted from chairman to \"interim Tour Commissioner\".\n\nLast year's Asian Tour featured only 12 stand-alone events with many more co-sanctioned with larger circuits such as the European, US PGA and Japan Tours, who all boast fuller schedules and bigger prize money.\n\n\"This is a positive step forward in our desire to further grow professional golf in Asia and around the world,\" Han said.\n\n\"We are also confident a greater collaboration between the Asian Tour and European Tour will deliver a stronger product to our partners and appeal to new sponsors to get involved with the game.\n\n\"The future looks very exciting for the Asian Tour and European Tour.\"\n\n- Reuters.\n\nGolf\n\nAsian Tour\n\nEuropean

There were photos showing some of them stripped to their underpants and handcuffed on the floors of police buses and a sports hall.\n\nSeveral thousand prosecutors and judges have also been

was underway to purge the civil service.\n\nTurkey blames the failed coup on Fethullah Gulen, a cleric based in the US, who has a wide following in Turkey but denies any involvement.\n\nAnkara has demanded Washington hand him over.\n\nWashington says it is prepared to extradite him but only if Turkey provides evidence linking him to crime.\n\nREJECTED\n\nPM Yildirim rejected that demand.\n\n\"We would be disappointed if our friends told us to present proof even though members of the assassin organisation are trying to destroy an elected government under the directions of that person,\" he said.\n\n\"At this stage, there could even be a questioning of our friendship.\"\n\nMr Yildirim said 232 people were killed in Friday night's violence, 208 of them civilians, police and

So that thing, you know, it's not part of me.\"\n\nSemenya's full health records have never been made public, but her case triggered a debate in sport over hyperandrogenism, a condition involving overproduction of male sex hormones.\n\nLast year, regulations were suspended that required women athletes to take testosterone-lowering medication if their levels were above a legal mark.\n\nThe ruling ended much of the uncertainty over Semenya's right to run, even if some of her competitors still feel she holds an unfair natural advantage.\n\nSemenya has put in some startling track times in recent months.\n\nShe scored a golden hat-trick at the African championships, winning the 1,500m and 800m titles and anchoring the 4x400m relay to first place.\n\nIn April, she became the first person to take triple gold in the 400m, 800m and 1,500m races - all in a single day at the South African national championships in Stellenbosch.\n\nSemenya had also run the fastest 800m times in the world this year, posting 1min 56.64sec twice, in Rome and Rabat, before clocking 1:55.33 at Monaco's Diamond League last Friday.\n\n\"She's a clear favourite for an Olympic gold medal,\" said Hezekiel Sepeng, athletics manager with Athletics South Africa.\n\nINSPIRATION\n\nSemenya said she drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela, who stood by her during the 2009 scandal, when she endured what she described as \"invasive scrutiny of the most intimate and private details of my being\".\n\nAhead of the Olympics, IAAF president Sebastian Coe has already rallied to her defence.\n\n\"I don't like to see any athlete in any discipline under sensitive situations being demonised, we are talking about human beings here,\" he said.\n\nSemenya was born in the poor northern village of Ga-Masehlong and is a sports science student at North-West University in Potchefstroom.\n\nShe married her long-time partner Violet Raseboya in December last year.\n\n\"It feels good to be back on track. I've been through a lot,\" she told the Sunday Times in a rare interview given in April.\n\n\"Now I'm back with a bang... The main target is to go to Rio and win a gold medal.\" - AFP.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n1:55.33\n\nCaster Semenya set a new personal best of 1min 55.33sec in the women's 800m at Monaco's Diamond League meet last Friday. It is also the best time this year. The world record is 1:53.28, set by Czech Jarmila Kratochvílova in 1983.\n\nsport\n\nOlympics\n\nathletics\n\nSEMENYA\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSalary Insights in Singapore - Where Do You Stand?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b525bc52a0671850419c2a65a3fccb4b539b1fb2476e94fd37f71af24184859b/NP_20160718_SEM18_1327340.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It wasn't that big. It wasn't like a 20-inch, 'Win a T-shirt' if you finish it type of thing. It wasn't anything like that.\"\n\nJohnston, who is ranked at a career-high of 104 in the world, also explained the origin of a nickname that has stuck since the age of 12.\n\n\"From my hair on my head. I grow it out it grows curly,\" he added.\n\n\"And my mate just went, 'Look at your hair. It's like a big bit of beef,' and called me a \"Beefhead\". That was it. It's been shortened to beef.\"\n\nJohnston, from Barnet in London, plays the card game Top Trumps with his five-year-old niece Summer before competing to help him relax.\n\nOn his Twitter feed @BeefGolf, he posted a video of her on Friday night calling his beard \"lumpy\".\n\nWith the chance of a first top-10 Major finish, the familiar routine would probably have been be in order again on Saturday night.\n\n\"Maybe, yeah. It could be game time again,\" Johnston said, after the end of his third round.\n\n\"I read her a few books last night before I went to bed. I think she was up a bit later than me. So we'll see. We'll see.\"\n\nSince Tiger Woods burst onto the scene in the 1990s, golf has seen players focus far more on fitness and strength than before, but Johnston's rise suggests that is not the only way to be successful.\n\n\"I have no idea, you want to pick me up?\", he quipped, after being asked how much he weighs.\n\n\"I don't know, man. About 16 stone (100kg), I reckon. I don't know. I need to start (to) shed a stone.\"\n\nFans have flocked to social media to express their support for Johnston, with some users pointing out the facial similarity in appearance to the character 'Taaj' from British sitcom, \"Come Fly With Me\".\n\nOne tweet claimed Johnston is \"the greatest thing to happen to golf\", while another said: \"can the media finally stop hyping Mcilroy as the one to watch. Beeeeeffffff!\"\n\nAs unlikely as it sounds right now, for the man who said that he couldn't \"wait to get hammered\" after his maiden European Tour title in Spain earlier this year, a Claret Jug could cause quite some celebration. - AFP.\n\nsport\n\nGolf\n\nANDREW JOHNSON\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/80f09287d2c6e495e0ae25d6d4834d27c998998d6ca611c9bf64241591532b6a/NP_20160718_BEEF18_1327390.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CULT FIGURE: Fans have flocked to social media to express their support for Andrew Johnson (above).", "caption": "CULT FIGURE: Fans have flocked to social media to express their support for Andrew Johnson (above)."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

In the conditions I've faced this week I felt like I handled them pretty well,\" said Northern Irishman, McIlroy.\n\n\"I leave with my head held high and go on to Baltusrol.\"\n\nThe final Major the year, the US PGA Championship, will be held at Baltusrol in New Jersey beginning on July 28, an earlier start than usual because of the Rio Olympics.\n\nTwo of McIlroy's four Major wins have come at the PGA, in 2012 at Kiawah Island and at Valhalla in 2014.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nGolf\n\nsport\n\nbritish open\n\nHenrik Stenson\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 22, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nWoods shows 'progress' after car crash\n\nOct 24, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nMatsuyama thrilled after win in Japan\n\nOct 11, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSouth Korean golfer Ko Jin-young breaks Tiger Woods' bogey-free record\n\nOct 5, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAsian Tour resumes next month, S'pore to host two events\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d8c766c215bb26eeb160c88f165f234d679b8a9d560dd1c7d989c5dad01c6413/NP_20160718_STENSON_1327560.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

We know what Chris is capable of, and the last two years, losing him after the All-Star break both years in a row, you just never know what you have or what you could have done, from that standpoint, as a team.\"\n\nRiley said he hasn't spoken with Wade since he decided to leave the Heat.\n\nRiley has been working on an e-mail to send Wade at some point, and he expects that when they see each other again, a warm embrace will be involved. - AFP.\n\nBasketball\n\nNBA\n\nDwyane Wade\n\nPAT RILEY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 8, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nLeBron stars as Lakers beat Celtics\n\nDec 1, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSuns beat Warriors for 17th straight win\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nJokic's return sees Nuggets end losing run\n\nNov 29, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nCurry stars ahead of clash with Suns\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d2ffc07d76f3cf36a8b70f7433f6db3ecc123cd26de05283ba33d603c5cdc512/NP_20160718_RILEY18_1327389.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/603f938bbd80a8b6db42dd542d4a675ac0f3942bb10545b165453e1b5cb9f626/mi_pioneerjc_220222.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "After cardiac arrest, Jurong Pioneer JC basketballer Xu bounces back for A-levels", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

So, it's incredible that Chelsea finished 10th in the table.\n\n\"When you have great players with great talent like Hazard in the team, the expectations are very high.\n\n\"Also, when the season before you have won the title and Hazard was named the Best Player in the league.\n\n\"It's important for us to recover Hazard in the best condition: technique, tactical, physical, overall and with the good mentality.\"\n\n- PA Sport.\n\nepl\n\nchelsea\n\nAntonio Conte\n\nenglish premier league\n\neden hazard\n\nLionel messi\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBuilding Wealth at Every Age: Essential Strategies for Your 20s, 30s, 40s & Beyond\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/86f2dac18b8c407449c8cd1e23e4c0b9ce019cbf40161fddc7098ae7f8015fb3/2025-07-03T123529Z135787455RC20FFALWMCVRTRMADP3SOCCER-LIVERPOOL-PORTUGAL-DIOGO-JOTA.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d6944355322b7c2193bdfbc371774a98b2dd368649ad11fe1aba3f6feb8994ea/file80c61lb8a2pi3ykpuc9.jpg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Tickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It's easy to blame the man in possession - often Wayne Rooney - but there weren't passing options for him to knock the ball into.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"There's an overhead camera and I think it would be pretty damning for that game. That was the most disappointing thing for me to see.\n\n\"That's the thing about Sam - he's always made the best use of the players available.\"\n\nThis is the second time the FA have come calling for Allardyce, after he was also in the running to take over from Sven-Goran Eriksson in 2006, losing out to Steve McClaren.\n\nTen years on and having saved Sunderland from relegation, the 61-year-old is odds-on favourite to finally land his dream job.\n\n\"He got West Ham back into the top flight and made Sunderland stronger mentally and defensively,\" said Brooking.\n\n\"Combine that with the technical ability of these England players and I think you have a decent mix.

He was lying third on six under.\n\nWorld No. 1 Jason Day was once again left to lament his struggles on the back nine at Royal Troon.\n\nThe Australian had come to Scotland as one the favourites but has never really got himself into contention.\n\nYesterday, a level-par round of 71 left him stuck at one over for the championship and effectively ended any hopes he had of contending for the Claret Jug today. And yet Day had started superbly, with four birdies and no dropped shots on the front nine.\n\nBut his back nine could not have contrasted more starkly, with no birdies and four bogeys including one at the last.\n\nSTRUGGLE\n\nTwice Major winner Jordan Spieth suggested the critics were being \"unfair\" to him and urged everyone to be less negative about his performances after returning a one-over 72.\n\nThe young American enjoyed a remarkable season last year, landing the US Masters and US Open crowns as he surged to the top of the world rankings.\n\nThe golfing gods have not been so kind to Spieth this year, though he did win the Tournament of Champions in Hawaii in January and the Colonial Invitational in his native Texas in May.\n\nThe 22-year-old suffered a late meltdown at the Masters in April, squandering a five-shot lead over the closing nine holes.\n\n\"It's been tough given I think it's been a solid year and I think had last year not happened I'd be having a lot of positive questions,\" Spieth said after finishing with a five-over tally of 218.\n\nThailand's veteran Thongchai Jaidee moved up 31 spots to 27th after shooting a two-under 69 for a 214 total.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nbritish open\n\nPhil Mickelson\n\nHenrik Stenson\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 18, 2016, 10:01pm\n\n'I couldn't do much more'\n\nJul 18, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nStenson's major taste\n\nJul 17, 2016, 10:01pm\n\nMagnificent Stenson\n\nJul 16, 2016, 10:01pm\n\nAn's aim\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBest High-Interest Savings Accounts in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/59bf380d718684e78b6429ccfda4e17ccc32b1a395c98c5009e6dbcfcd980693/NP_20160717_OPEN17_1327024.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Phil Mickelson.", "caption": "Phil Mickelson."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/385c4f95a65279730b8507e66f5385ca29f65d492b5dd6845ed06fe8d4dd932f/NP_20160719_STENSON19_1328405.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "A Swede major", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4b3794a60f6abd130b072360778f03e094b135580fa3f5ec259812c60f78536c/NP_20160719_PHIL19_1328240.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "'I couldn't do much more'", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He may be distracted by his surroundings and lose his focus. When I see him, I’d like to tell him to keep his emotions in check.\" - Ahn Jae Hyung on what he will tell his son Byeong Hun (above) ahead of the Olympics\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJul 16, 2016, 10:01pm\n\nAn's aim\n\nSouth Korean golfer hopes to emulate parents' feat at Seoul Olympics\n\nShare this article\n\nSouth Korean golfer An Byeong Hun is hoping he can win an Olympic medal on the sport's return to the Games next month and emulate what his parents managed in table tennis.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who first gave notice of his talent by becoming the youngest golfer to win the US amateur title in 2009, says achieving that goal will not be easy despite so many top players missing from the field in Rio de Janerio, Brazil.\n\nAmong those giving the Games a miss, which has placed the sport's future at the quadrennial sporting extravaganza in peril, are the top four in the world - Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy.\n\nAn, speaking after he made the cut at two under at the British Open at Royal Troon on Friday, said he will push to the back of his mind what his paddler parents achieved at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.\n\nHis father Ahn Jae Hyung, now the head coach of the South Korean men's table tennis team, and his Chinese mother Jiao Zhimin won the men's doubles bronze and the women's singles bronze and doubles silver respectively.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\nLoh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities\n\n5\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Oh, that will be pretty big,\" said An, when asked how much it would mean to win a gold medal.\n\n\"There are a lot of good players playing. Although some people pulled out, it still got the best field in the world, I think. Like I said, it's a normal US PGA Tour event, I'm thinking of it that way.\n\n\"Going down and playing in a limited field. But a win is a win and a medal is a bonus.\n\n\"But I hope I can get a medal by trying to play like a regular PGA Tour. I don't want to put extra pressure on myself.\"\n\nBACKING\n\nAn's parents, who have been very supportive of his career with Ahn moving with him to the United States when he was a student while his mother earned money in China to pay the expenses, will be travelling with him to Brazil.\n\nHowever, if he had hoped for some advice on how to prepare for the Olympics, then An would have been disappointed.\n\n\"All we talked about is whether I got my flu shot or immunisation shots. We didn't really talk about anything else,\" said An, who won the BMW PGA Championship on the European Tour last year.\n\nDespite the lack of chat about the Games, An said that competing at the Olympics as they did is special.\n\n\"I have a chance to play in the Olympics and they played too,\" said An. \"That's definitely more special than any other guy because my parents played in the Olympics.\n\n\"That's what makes it more special, definitely.\"\n\nUnlike An, some high-profile golfers failed to make the cut at Troon.\n\nWorld No. 14 Louis Oosthuizen, 17th-ranked Hideki Matsuyama and No. 27 Shane Lowry were among them.\n\nFormer champions Ernie Els, Justin Leonard, Todd Hamilton, Mark Calcavecchia, John Daly and Ben Curtis also failed to make the weekend.\n\nSouth African Oosthuizen, who won golf's oldest Major at St Andrews in 2010 and recorded a hole-in-one at the short 14th on Thursday, crashed to a 12-over 83 in the second round.\n\nThe cut was at four-over 146, a score that was also too good for US trio Jimmy Walker, Billy Horschel and Scott Piercy, Britons Paul Casey and Matt Fitzpatrick, Dutchman Joost Luiten, Victor Dubuisson of France, Dane Thorbjorn Olesen and New Zealander Danny Lee.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nOlympics\n\nbritish open\n\nAn Byeong Hun\n\ntable tennis\n\nRio\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 11:34pm\n\nEx-swimmer Mark Chay set to become new SNOC secretary-general\n\nFeb 2, 2025, 12:27am\n\nJason Teh just one match from ending badminton title drought\n\nDec 4, 2024, 06:12am\n\nSingapore's first Olympic medallist Tan Howe Liang dies aged 91\n\nNov 11, 2024, 10:59pm\n\nKoen Pang and Izaac Quek qualify for World Table Tennis Finals\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - How SMEs Can Optimize Cash Flow & Financial Stability\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/573c60eb4082c8bc4a4f7e151f3c2223604e701993069219e1c710c319a0cdf7/NP_20160717_EXITS17_1326818.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "\"He has never been to a multisport competition with so many other athletes.

I think he can handle more ground,\" said Dragon, who was saddling only her sixth winner for the season.\n\n\"I really thought he would fade but he kicked again, which was a very good sign. We know he has good gate speed and it was always the plan to go forward, but we didn't expect the other horse to come alongside him.\n\n\"It was not an easy race but he showed plenty of courage to win, and Troy also showed some muscle.\"\n\nSee, who rode the Coats Choice three-year-old at his first race, said he went into Friday's race with a reasonable dose of confidence, but by the 600m mark, it had already worn thin.\n\n\"John didn't give us an easy time. Even though my horse was travelling okay, I was not so confident coming to the bend,\" said the Singaporean apprentice jockey, who has now drawn to within only one win shy of current leader MM Firdaus.\n\n\"Even though he rolled off, he still had enough petrol left in the tank to get the win.\n\n\"Here, I have to say he had an issue with one of his right teeth.

She was allegedly strangled by her brother.\n\nShe was admired by many of the country's youth for her willingness to break social taboos, but she was also condemned and reviled by those more traditional.\n\nHer murder happened near the city of Multan, Punjab, police said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 29, 2023, 12:34am\n\nMistaken cutting of power caused Nepal plane crash that killed 72\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Qandeel Baloch has been killed. She was strangled to death by her brother. Apparently it was an incident of honour killing,\" Mr Sultan Azam, a senior police officer in Multan, told AFP.\n\nPolice were informed by her family that the killing had taken place on Friday night.\n\n\"The brother was also there last night, and the family told us that he strangled her to death,\" Mr Azhar Akram, another senior police officer in Multan, told AFP.\n\nPolice said Ms Baloch's brother is on the run.\n\nMs Baloch, a single mother and model, shot to fame in Pakistan in 2014 after a video of her pouting at the camera went viral.\n\nKnown for her liberal views and forthrightness, Ms Baloch, who posed with mullahs and in plunging dresses for selfies, was frequently subjected to misogynist abuse online.\n\nShe had reportedly spoken of leaving Pakistan after the Hari Raya holidays, fearing for her safety.\n\nThe police said she was threatened by her family, who wanted her to quit modelling and cease her provocative appearances on social media.\n\nHer brother had been threatening her over her Facebook posts and videos, added the police.\n\nSECURITY\n\nThree weeks ago, Ms Baloch had written to the interior minister, the director general of the Federal Investigation Authority, and other officials asking them to provide security for her, Pakistan newspaper Dawn reported.\n\nShe had said that her life was in danger, that she was being threatened via calls, and that she did not have security measures installed in her home, the newspaper said.\n\nNews of her murder trended on social media in Pakistan, with liberal users calling for action over her killing. But others condemned her relentless self-promotion.\n\nTwitter user JiaAli wrote: \"Someone had to do it. She was a disgrace.\"\n\nBut Facebook user Zaair Hussain said: \"RIP Qandeel Baloch. You made us laugh, and you made us applaud... I think history will remember you as a provocateur, a living exhibit, a larger than life role - just as you would want to be remembered.\"\n\nPakistani filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, whose documentary A Girl In The River: The Price of Forgiveness won an Oscar earlier this year, told AFP that the murder would make women feel less safe.\n\nMs Obaid-Chinoy said: \"I really feel that no woman is safe in this country until we start making examples of people, until we start sending men who kill women to jail, unless we literally say there will be no more killing, and those who dare will spend the rest of their lives behind bars.\"\n\nHer film was hailed by Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who in February vowed to push through anti-honour killing legislation.\n\nBut no action has been taken since then, despite a fresh wave of attacks on women that have been condemned by activists.\n\nSaid Ms Obaid-Chinoy: \"Not only does the bill need to go through, but the cases of honour killings all need to be expedited, and we start sending people to jail.\n\n\"Activists have screamed themselves hoarse.

Because this sector is producing fewer jobs, and manufacturing has become more automated,\" said the 62-year-old Speaker of Parliament.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, the unionist-turned-politician, spoke to The New Paper on Tuesday about jobs and the economy, and her thoughts about the changes to the elected presidency.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 23, 2025, 12:04am\n\nPuan Noor Aishah a kind, remarkable woman, say Singapore leaders\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe number of layoffs this year is expected to top last year's, when 13,440 workers lost their jobs, Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say told Parliament last month.\n\nThe reasons have been well-documented - disruptions in several industries and jobs evolving faster than workers can be retrained for them.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, concern over job security is starting to creep in among her constituents at Marsiling-Yew Tee, Madam Halimah said.\n\n\"I've seen cases of people losing their jobs, retrenchments... This is something we really need to monitor.\n\n\"Most, I find, are able to manage on their own in terms of getting an alternative job.\n\n\"What they do need is temporary support when they have no income to tide them over,\" she said.\n\nIn her 33 years in the labour movement, Madam Halimah has seen many cycles of retrenchment.\n\nCRISIS\n\nShe said: \"I cannot forget those years, especially the crisis we had in 2008 and 2009.\n\n\"I really understand where they are coming from. I really empathise with them.\n\n\"They are not just a digit because retrenchments, loss of jobs, affect them personally, very poignantly.\"\n\nThe silver lining in the gloomy economic outlook is that there are jobs available, and Singapore has proactive labour market policies to help those who are retrenched.\n\nThey include job-matching through Workforce Singapore, looking for jobs through the revised Jobs Bank, and reskilling under the SkillsFuture initiative.\n\nMadam Halimah said: \"This form of technological disruption has been going on for a while, except the pace will hasten and it will continue.\"\n\nFirst female president? No comment for now\n\nBy\n\nFoo Jie Ying\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Foo Jie Ying\n\nShe has been touted as someone who could make history by becoming Singapore's first female president. But Madam Halimah Yacob, 62, simply laughed when the topic was brought up.\n\n\"I think it is still a long way off,\" she said, referring to the next presidential election (PE), which is expected to be held by next August. She is now focused on her two roles: Speaker of Parliament and Member of Parliament for Marsiling-Yew Tee.\n\nThe next PE will be reserved for Malay candidates - a mechanism triggered when a candidate of a certain race has not been a president for five consecutive terms. This has been criticised by some as tokenism. But Madam Halimah disagreed.\n\n\"When you say it is tokenism, it means that it is symbolic, it is perfunctory. The point is, all candidates, regardless of an open or reserved election, will have to qualify.\"\n\nIn a time when multi-racialism is being tested around the world, she urged sceptics to look at the changes in the context of preserving multi-racialism, one of Singapore's strengths.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said the Government has no specific candidate in mind. He told Malaysian news agency Bernama on Monday: \"There is no shortlist. It depends who comes forward. It is not for the Government to arrange. It is for the candidates to come forward.\"\n\nMadam Halimah ticks all the boxes of the eligibility criteria for public sector candidates.\n\nPolitical pundits see her as the front runner partly due to her popularity on the ground.\n\nShe became the first Malay female MP in 2001, then minister of state in 2011. Two years later, she became the first female Speaker. As a veteran unionist, volunteer and politician, she won over many with her dedication to single mothers, low-income families, the elderly and the disabled.\n\nBut when asked if she has considered running in the PE, she said cautiously: \"At this moment, I would not want to comment... To me, it doesn't matter what capacity you serve in.\n\n\"The most important thing is that you're serving from your heart, and that you're also serving the people and Singapore.\"\n\nHalimah Yacob on her mum\n\nBy\n\nFoo Jie Ying\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Foo Jie Ying\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Speaker, she shared snippets from her school days, and memories of her mother.\n\nTRADE-OFFS\n\nShe has missed many family moments because of her job.\n\nBefore she knew it, her five children - aged 25 to 34 - were grown up.\n\nOn Polling Day last year, her mother died while she was doing her rounds.\n\n\"I wanted to go see her after I had made my rounds, but I couldn't even complete the rounds and she left. I was fortunate that the day before was Cooling Day, so I got to spend the whole day with her...\n\n\"There were times when I felt like I should have spent a lot more time with her, especially when she had dementia,\" said Madam Halimah, quietly.\n\nTime is a big trade-off that a politician has to be prepared for.\n\n\"Those moments are things you can never recover, but you accept that it's part and parcel of your responsibility,\" she said.\n\nLESSONS FROM MUM\n\nIt has been slightly over a year since her mother's death, but memories still bring tears to her eyes, Madam Halimah said.\n\n\"Especially when you're in quiet moments, when you confront the reality. She lived with me for so many years. I remember her sitting on a particular sofa. She would be watching TV... Then there are moments like Hari Raya, and you know she's not there.\n\n\"You cannot forget someone who's had a tremendous influence on you, but I think life has to go on.\"\n\nThe most enduring advice Madam Halimah got from her mother was never to borrow, and to live within your own means.\n\nWhen the Speaker moved into a flat with her husband, it took the couple eight months of scrimping and saving before they could afford their first sofa set.\n\nMadam Halimah also lives by her mother's motto: if you don't get up before the sun rises, then you're lazy.\n\nIt is partly why the 62-year-old starts her day at 5am every day.\n\n\"I think I've grown up never sleeping very late into the day. I can never sleep when the sun is already out and when it's bright and shining into your face,\" she said.\n\nSTUDENT DAYS\n\nAs a student, Madam Halimah Yacob was guilty of falling asleep in class, and not completing her homework.\n\nShuttling between school and her mother's food stall to help out took a toll on her, and she struggled to stay awake in class.\n\n\"I was sitting at the back so I could look out of the window, daydream, and sleep,\" she said with a chuckle.\n\nIt took a teacher who told her she could do much better in class to wake her up.\n\n\"I supposed I bucked up then, but I think I also felt I owed my mother something.\n\n\"She worked so hard, the last thing she wanted to see is another failure. She deserved better,\" said Madam Halimah.\n\nINTERRUPTING MPs\n\nIf there is a line Madam Halimah says frequently in her role as Speaker of Parliament, it has to be: \"Please keep your follow-up questions crisp and short.\"\n\n\"I have to do it,\" she said with a laugh before explaining that she had make sure the 1 ½-hour question time is used efficiently.\n\n\"If I can't even clear 15 parliamentary questions (PQ)... Not that I must clear 15, but the point is, I'm denying other MPs whose questions come later of a chance for their questions to be asked if we are bogged down by just a few PQs.\n\n\"It's a sad thing (if) those members do not get a chance to ask their questions.\"\n\nTo this end, she watches the timer like a hawk and interrupts once the MP's time to speak is up.\n\n\"By and large, I must say members have been extremely cooperative and supportive, so we can get a lot of business done on sitting days.

This is what to expect from the day-absorbing, wildly engrossing 15th edition of the classic series.\n\nShare this article\n\nOne moment you're leaping from cover to cover as you evade a fire-breathing demon.\n\nThe next, you are pushing a broken down car along a desert road as the soul standard Stand By Me floats through the air.\n\nMoments later, you are deemed bankrupt and sent to take out clusters of scorpion-like monsters in order to repay a debt.\n\nWelcome to Final Fantasy XV - or FFXV for short.\n\nYes, that's 15 Finals, which could cause trading standards to raise an eyebrow.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2016, 02:54pm\n\n8 apps to help you kill time during Chinese New Year\n\nAnd this has been a highly-anticipated instalment, one decade in the making.\n\nFinally, Square Enix's latest sprawling brainchild is finally hitting stores today (Nov 29).\n\nThis reporter (and for full disclosure, an ardent fan of the series) visited the Sony Interactive Entertainment office last week to try out the game on the Playstation 4.\n\nNow this is the part that can lose the casual observer, but bear with it.\n\nFFXV is set in the fictional world of Eos, where you control Prince Noctis Lucis Caelum, heir to the Kingdom of Lucis, as you travel with three companions - Gladiolus Amicitia, Ignis Scientia and Prompto Argentum. They should give a prize to anyone able to pronounce those name perfectly on first go - or at all.\n\nYou and your trio of unpronouncables journey to meet your bride-to-be. A classic case of get the girl, kill the baddies?\n\nWell, things go hideously wrong during the journey as Noctis learns that his father - the king - is killed, sending the world into turmoil.\n\nSo Noctis and his friends have to travel through war-torn Eos, allowing you, the player, to experience an stunning open-world environment where you can play at your own pace.\n\nEXPLORATION\n\nThe is the game equivalent of a free-and-easy holiday. Choose to either blitz through the main storyline or take your time by indulging in the side quests. Or even go sightseeing in the majestically vast world where monsters roam.\n\nEither way, the pain of travelling from one end to another is made smoother and simpler by Noctis' car, The Regalia.\n\nYou can drive the car yourself or get Ignis to do it - allowing you (the player not the character) to take a much-needed toilet or snack break.\n\nJust be careful about wandering during the night as daemons can suddenly spawn and are ridiculously powerful. (This refers to you the character, not real life).\n\nBATTLE SYSTEM\n\nCombat now resembles closer to hack-and-slash games such as Devil May Cry. However, charging into battle furiously mashing your controller buttons will not get you far.Unlike its previous editions, FFXV's battles - using its Active Cross Battle system - will be real time, and you enter battles instantaneously without transition screens.\n\nThere's a degree of strategy to be employed.\n\nFor example, take advantage of Noctis' special ability - the warp strike - which allows him to teleport short distances and strike your foe.\n\nThis means that in battle, you could teleport to higher ground before warping behind an enemy to inflict more damage.\n\nWhile you only control Noctis during most of the game, in battle, you can combine with his teammates to execute special combos.\n\nYou will be ranked for your offence, defence and stealth performances after each fight.\n\nThe higher the grade, the more ability points (AP) you earn to level up. Speaking of which...\n\nLEVELLING UP\n\nThis is done via an ability tree - Something fans of FFXIII will be familiar with - using AP accumulated from battles, conversations and actions.\n\nWhile each character has his own skill tree, all of your team's AP is stored collectively, but be sure to even out the distribution.\n\nMAGIC\n\nFinal Fantasy isn't complete without the magical elements.\n\nThis time, magic has to be harvested and stored in a flask before it can be equipped on a character as a spell.\n\nSpell-crafting can be quite interesting as you mix different elements, and even add items, to make them more powerful.\n\nSIDE QUESTS\n\nFFXV also features a plethora of side quests that allow you to spend even more time in this unreal world, rather than the real one where you have to get up in the morning.\n\nAnd there are plenty of opportunities, not always sign-posted. Just a casual stroll around the first chapter opened up various monster hunts and even fishing (yes, literally fishing).\n\nIt can be as easy as talking to various non-player characters. So it can pay to be sociable.\n\nTHROWBACK\n\nThe Final Fantasy series is renowned for its throwbacks to previous editions, appealing to its long-time fans.\n\nFamiliar names, such as Cid, and the giant chicken-like Chocobos are part of FFXV.\n\nTaking a cue from the Grand Theft Auto series, each station on your car's stereo allows you to hear a different FF soundtrack.\n\nOn this excursion through Eos, the track J-E-N-O-V-A from FFVII was on heavy repeat.\n\nWRITER'S VERDICT\n\nThe game starts slowly, or at least I did. It took almost three hours to complete the first of 15 chapters. But it gets better as you go on.\n\nWhile initially sceptical of the characters, with their gladiator-like names and K-pop boyband looks, I soon appreciated the team's dynamic.\n\nThe revamped battle system will have you thinking on your feet - and then thinking again. It requires you to always have a plan because you can forget about getting by with mindless button mashing here.\n\nMost importantly, it's impossible not to be amazed by the scale of Eos and what lies beyond the horizon for Noctis and gang.\n\nA game to lose yourself in and book time off work for.\n\nRATING:\n\n9/10\n\nAVAILABLE ON:\n\nPlaystation 4, Xbox One\n\nPRICE:\n\n$84.90 on the Playstation Store\n\nBy\n\nRonald Loh\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Ronald Loh\n\nFinal Fantasy\n\ngaming\n\nComputer game\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3e980310e52c4a5bdd9e784eb5c515863ece8c631de7d362ce10cb60ad17f6ac/final_fntasy_xv_screen7.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8dc22358b6c2fc5c64f34a29e73b50ed5090309d8dd001eb4ee04513f7fae38a/01f2e262.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "8 apps to help you kill time during Chinese New Year", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cc69b956d58f71fb9c4c44c1a834c8228ba1686385b8f7e9b295e2520cf05ea8/final_fantasy_xv_still006.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/640596af3439334970af2e3a5c7bafe49eecddbb0c8b70ad4296085713e4b835/final_fantasy_xv_still003.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0a8ac3ab2ea4e1bfb538a83d18387009066b1afcf1807ac8eaa85d483e36fa9/final_fantasy_xv_still004.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dee0c07ea5bef985bd42f757853818ac83ad5e6a5c2d2d0f01416a3449da0c55/final_fantasy_xv_still005.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/07d37f057a63ec6192ffb0511118066a36c146795e87b0ddba6c6ab8592cafdf/final_fantasy_xv_jp_en_ver._front.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Currently, many companies are now trading at about 0.5 times book or lower, with a few exceptions.\n\nAt current levels, however, we believe that most of the negatives have been priced in, and downside risk is now less than a year before - the challenge lies in 1) picking companies with the ability to ride the downturn; and 2) identifying the inflection point in which a sustainable recovery would begin. As such, it is not surprising to see distressed funds being set up to scoop some bargains when the time is right.\n\nWhen, then, is the right time? There are different sub-sectors in the broader oil and gas industry, and when you recover depends on where you are on the value chain.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 9, 2025, 03:34am\n\nFriends toil at nasi padang stall, find ways to attract customers amid rising costs\n\nMore related stories\n\nOur sense is that should there be a sustained recovery in oil prices, exploration and production companies stand to benefit first as they are regarded as more direct proxies of the oil price.\n\nThe drillers and vessel charterers could then be next in line, as well as the service providers.\n\nAsset fabricators (the yards), that depend on new order flows, could take a longer time to see earnings recovery, as their clients first have to regain confidence in the market before ordering new assets from them.\n\nMeanwhile, the downstream players are still doing relatively well amid the doom and gloom in the broader industry.\n\nEZION HOLDINGS | BUY\n\nTARGET PRICE: $0.42\n\nNOV 22 CLOSE: $0.34\n\nMaybank Kim Eng Research, Nov 30\n\nInvestors appeared to be looking for reasons to build exposure to the oil-service sector. Unsurprisingly, their concerns revolved around: 1) whether the worst is over; 2) asset-write-down potential; 3) balance-sheet sustainability; and 4) cashflows. We continue to believe that Ezion will be an early beneficiary in the oil cycle, after oil producers.\n\nWhile the sector is still struggling, Ezion observed that its clients are now clearer on their extraction and production road maps. This helps Ezion tailor its assets to suit their requirements, raising the sustainability of future asset deployment. Ezion has mapped out three paths for itself to navigate the downturn.\n\nIt will: 1) continue to diversify into windfarm installation; 2) convert assets to mobile offshore production units to serve clients' longer-term extraction needs; and 3) review its capex to ensure value addition. It also highlighted plans by the Singapore Government to provide financial aid to oil and gas companies.\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

{"article_url": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/business/sti-rises-above-2900-mixed-session", "site_title": "STI rises above 2,900 in mixed session", "publish_date": "2016-11-30T22:00:00", "content": "This article is more than 12 months old\n\nNov 30, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSTI rises above 2,900 in mixed session\n\nBanks contribute almost half of the index's 24.9-point jump; advance-decline score at 227 to 222 as oil prices dampens sentiment\n\nShare this article\n\nAN overnight rise on Wall Street and probable month-ending window-dressing of certain key blue chips - or \"portfolio rebalancing\", if you prefer - yesterday helped push the Straits Times Index (STI) up 24.88 points to 2,904.02, taking it 22 points or 0.8 per cent into the black for 2016.\n\nYesterday also saw the latest Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index rebalancing come into effect.\n\nFor the MSCI Singapore Index, Sats was added while Noble Group and Sembcorp Marine were deleted. However, both were then included in the MSCI Singapore Small Cap Index. Noble crashed $0.013 or 7.6 per cent to $0.159 on massive volume of 1.23 billion, and Sembcorp Marine closed with an $0.085 or 5.7 per cent loss at $1.395 on volume of 85.4 million.\n\nA steep slide in oil prices, however, dampened sentiment somewhat, and this was reflected in an advance-decline score of 227 to 222 which suggested that the index's gains were narrowly focused and that the broader market did not follow.\n\nA check of the index's movers showed that rises in the three banks were instrumental in sending the STI above 2016's starting level of 2,882, their combined contribution amounting to almost 12 points.\n\nThanks to the heightened activity in blue chips and the selling of Noble, turnover came to 2.9 billion units worth $2.6 billion, the highest daily total for the year.\n\nBanks' outperformance has come mainly because of expectations of higher interest rates, starting with the US where a rate hike is virtually certain at this month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. In the federal funds futures market, the probability of a rate hike is now 100 per cent.\n\nAs for Singtel, Macquarie Warrants (MW) noted that while the stock is currently outperforming the STI, its performance in 2016 has lagged that of the STI in the second half of the year.\n\n\"Note, the STI is up 2.4 per cent in the last six months, Singtel shares are down for the same percentage,\" said MW.\n\n\"The latter, which peaked in July 2016, had tumbled as much as 16.7 per cent, while the STI had fallen only 5.2 per cent over the same period.\"\n\nMW also reported that \"investors in Singapore have been accumulating Singtel call warrants since the start of the month, when the stock came under pressure and fell more than 7 per cent in three weeks due to... news about increased competition\".\n\nState Street Corporation said its global investor confidence index (ICI) fell 0.3 point to 98.9 from October's revised reading of 99.2 and that the decline in sentiment was driven by a 4.6-point decrease in the Asian ICI to 116.1 and a 2.6-point decline in the European ICI to 86.5. The North American ICI rose slightly from 95.6 to 95.7\n\nMs Jessica Donohue, executive vice-president and chief innovation officer, State Street Global Exchange, said in a press release that the setbacks in the ICI last month were felt most strongly by Asian-based institutional investors.\n\n\"Trump's victory has clearly exacerbated anti-globalisation jitters. Moreover, confidence in Europe further declined to the mid-eighties, a relatively low level, as the UK's exit from the European Union and Italian political risk remain a source of major concerns,\" said Ms Donohue.\n\nAs for oil prices, the 4 per cent plunge on Tuesday to around US$44 (S$63) per barrel came after reports indicated opposition from Iran and Iraq towards production cuts, casting doubt that an agreement could be reached at a key meeting yesterday.\n\nThis article appears in The Business Times today.

It has also fallen to US$1.25 from US$1.49.\n\nCHEAPEST CITY\n\nAs a result, London became the cheapest city for luxury goods shopping in dollar terms, according to a study by Deloitte.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 17, 2022, 12:00pm\n\n'How's Brexit going?'

And we can afford to eat and drink outside. That was not possible years ago,\" she added.\n\nMr Denis Sagajevs, who works in Shinola, a shop selling watches and leather accessories, said: \"We're an American brand. Our products are designed and assembled in the US. But with the weakening of the pound, it actually happens to be cheaper for American tourists to buy an American product in London.\"\n\nShops are now adjusting their advertising and sales tactics to the new consumer behaviour.\n\nThe manager of a luxury men's clothes shop said that, before the vote, European tourists were couples who bought just a few things.\n\n\"Now, there are groups of friends who rush in.

In politics, kill or be killed. We are at war,\" Mr Khairy said when opening the youth assembly.\n\nDr Mahathir and Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin - sacked as Mr Najib's deputy - have formed a new opposition party as they continue to push for the premier to resign over allegations that US$700 million (S$998 million) found in his personal accounts came from sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad.\n\nMr Najib has insisted the money was a political donation from the Saudi royal family.\n\nHe has to face polls only in August 2018, but there is speculation that elections will be called next year after new electoral boundaries were revealed in September, and cooperation between Umno and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia keeps sowing discord among opposition parties.\n\nRights of all races will be safe,  says Umno VP\n\nThe rights of all Malaysians, regardless of race or religion, will be protected.\n\nUmno vice-president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said the party will remain committed to this, reported The Star. The party's de facto number two was making his maiden speech at the 14th Umno general assembly.\n\nHe noted that many urban voters - the majority of them non-Malays - had rejected Umno and Barisan Nasional in the last general election.\n\nHe said: \"Yet Umno and its component parties in the ruling coalition will continue to fight for all races and religions under its power-sharing concept.\n\n\"As the saying goes, in times of hardship, Umno shares the difficulties. And in good times, Umno also enjoys the benefits along with others.\n\n\"Umno protects non-Malays under the principle that we are all under one roof, one country. Umno is not racist.\"\n\nDr Ahmad Zahid also said Umno had a proven track record of demonstrating its commitment to power-sharing among the races under Barisan.\n\n\"There is no need to be worried about the spirit of brotherhood of Umno. Let us all be committed to fighting and defending Barisan at the next general election,\" he said.\n\nShannon Teoh\n\nTrinna Leong\n\nmalaysia\n\nNajib Razak\n\nMahathir Mohamad\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/007ce43457440c7890f4612261dc71a59ca73feb4dff2f5f91fbbfbe8b31b943/NP_20161201_PARTY01_1455740.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Najib Razak (at the podium) has to face polls only in August 2018, but there is speculation that elections will be called next year.

{"article_url": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/views/singaporeans-deserve-right-choose", "site_title": "Singaporeans deserve the right to choose", "publish_date": "2016-11-30T22:00:00", "content": "This article is more than 12 months old\n\nNov 30, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSingaporeans deserve the right to choose\n\nRule that allows full suite of life insurance products to be sold online could be a game changer\n\nShare this article\n\nThe recent announcement by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) that it will soon allow insurers to offer the full suite of life insurance products to be sold online, without advice, is a defining moment for Singapore's insurance industry.\n\nI believe that by giving Singaporeans a choice over how they buy their life insurance, we have the opportunity, over the next three to five years, to change the industry for the better.\n\nThis will raise standards overall, encouraging the entire industry, including insurance agents, to provide further value-add to meet consumer demands.\n\nLESSONS FROM THE PAST\n\nNot everyone shares my enthusiasm.\n\nOne argument is that, unlike investment products, insurance is too complicated to be sold online. This seems misplaced and worse, misunderstands the challenge we must meet.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 16, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nMAS looking at legal tender limit for coins\n\nMore related stories\n\nSurely, if individuals can make informed decisions about asset prices, yields, currency fluctuations and so on, they're more than equipped to judge what cover they need to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n\nThat said, the comparison is apt. A few years ago, traditional stockbrokers argued that finance was too complex for private investors to manage themselves.\n\nHowever, new online portfolio management tools created a simplified experience that investors adopted in droves, displacing many of the old-fashioned brokerage firms.\n\nAnother example is from the package holiday industry, which wanted to maintain the status quo.\n\nMuch of the complexity in the insurance market today has been created by the industry itself.\n\nThey argued that the supposed complexity of arranging flights, ground transportation, hotels and tours required human intervention.\n\nIt then discovered, as companies such as booking.com and Expedia quickly grew, that people preferred to do it themselves.\n\nALLOW PEOPLE TO CONSIDER, WITHOUT CONCERN\n\nMuch of the complexity in the insurance market today has been created by the industry itself.\n\nWhile most insurers offer information about what each of their products offer, few allow consumers to go through an online experience that enables them to understand which policy is right for them, instead, guiding people towards meeting an agent.\n\nIn a world where we can manage almost everything using our mobile phone, this highlights the fear of change that many insurers have.\n\nInstead of embracing change, they are trying to protect their current business model.\n\nIn fact, according to research we commissioned earlier this year, the main reason people used agents was to take care of the complicated paperwork.\n\nThis shouldn't be the case and it's the industry's duty to respond to MAS' initiative and make it simple.\n\nIt should be straightforward to select the cover you require and purchase with a simple click, without worrying about being caught out by an exclusion hidden in the terms and conditions.\n\nSINGAPORE HAS A LEADING OPPORTUNITY\n\nSingapore is not the first market to allow life insurance products to be sold directly online. Australia, the United Kingdom, China, India and Malaysia are already doing so.\n\nBut the permission to sell online hasn't translated to major market share for this channel in those countries yet.\n\nThe two primary reasons are a lack of awareness at the consumer end and the quality of customer experience on most of those websites.\n\nSingapore has a real opportunity to make up for lost time by learning from these international experiences and combining that learning with the advanced technology and know-how that the Republic excels at. Our market research, conducted in August, shows the appetite for online insurance already exists.\n\nA good 90 per cent of Singaporeans are comfortable accessing and purchasing insurance online.\n\nWith good-quality offerings and a simple customer experience, that latent demand can be converted to tangible results over the next few years.\n\nTECHNOLOGY OPENS THE DOOR TO PERSONALISATION\n\nUsing new advanced tools such as robo-advisers, there is potential to introduce new bespoke life policies that are entirely customisable to each individual's needs, curated in real time in active response to a customer's questions.\n\nThis will allow consumers to make proper considered decisions on their insurance needs without the pressure of a face-to-face meeting.\n\nIt also far exceeds what is possible in a traditional meeting with an adviser and actively changes the conversation from \"which insurance policy should I choose\" to the creation of a policy that is personal to me.\n\nSAFEGUARDS A WIN-WIN FOR EVERYBODY\n\nWe are fortunate that we have a government which actively introduces new initiatives and stimulus measures such as its Direct Purchase Insurance (DPI) initiative, which pushes the industry forward in an independent, non-partisan way.\n\nMAS' MoneySense and CompareFirst websites are excellent initiatives and the industry should champion the introduction of simple tools that allow people to calculate the cover they need, including an assessment of the existing cover that they have in place.\n\nWe should also welcome the proposed initiatives to ensure people don't inadvertently end up leaving themselves under-insured or paying too much for cover they don't need.\n\nThis puts consumers at risk and leaves the industry open to allegations of offering poor value.\n\nI see a bright, value-added and direct future for the insurance industry that will benefit everyone in Singapore.\n\nThe smart combination of clever government-led initiatives, alongside an industry that is ready to innovate, will change Singapore for the better.\n\nIt will also help further reinforce our nation's position as a leading global centre of financial services innovation.

Working in Singapore seems to have given them a sense of responsibility, and the initiative to get what they want for themselves.\"\n\nMyanmar\n\nSingapore\n\nTRADING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 7, 2025, 12:02pm\n\nSCDF rescuers deployed to quake-hit Myanmar to come home on April 8\n\nApr 5, 2025, 12:41am\n\nSingapore sends second wave of aid to quake-hit Myanmar\n\nApr 2, 2025, 01:30am\n\n'We won't give up': S'pore's Operation Lionheart presses on in Myanmar\n\nMar 30, 2025, 11:53pm\n\nS'pore firms in Myanmar, Thailand report staff safe after quake\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ff45ddc103aadb5c703caf117f2788249168253616177927f2c87e60c75f8c0d/np_20161201_talk01-her_1455998.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ms Aung San Suu Kyi and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana yesterday.

The speedster impressed when winning his trial on Tuesday morning.\n\nRidden by Gerard Mosse, the son of Exceed And Excel claimed the lead after travelling 100m and never gave it back, winning by one-and-a-quarter lengths.\n\nNoted for his early speed, the eight-time winner was always going too well for his rivals and, as the highest rated horse in the trial, he won in a canter.\n\nA five-year-old with eight wins from 27 starts, Sebas is nearing the half-million dollars in earnings and could seal the deal with a win on Sunday.\n\nIs it beyond his reach? We don't think so. After all, when not stubborn behind the gates, he has always relished these sharp sprints and his last win was over the flying 1,000m.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 03:08pm\n\nRace card for Feb 20\n\nMore related stories\n\nThat day in July, he toyed with his rivals, made every post a winning one to take the race by two lengths.\n\nSince then, he hasn't been idle and in his four trials, including this most recent one, he has put in three \"wins\".\n\nSo forget that last start in late September when he beat just two home. He was a bad boy that day, raised a sweat behind the gates and lost the race there.\n\nSent back to the trials by the stewards, Sebas was at his best behaviour on Tuesday morning and, provided he carries it over to Sunday's race, we should see him lead his rivals on a merry chase.\n\nSo watch for the swagger from Sebas. He looks in the pink of condition and should end his season on a winning note in the Kranji Stakes A event over the Polytrack 1,100m in Race 7.\n\nTRIAL 1 ORT\n\n1 Justice Light (M Nunes)\n\n2 Chronos (N Juglall)\n\n3 Golden Thunder (D David)\n\n4 Country Quack (D Beasley)\n\n5 Tarzan\n\nMargins and time: Ns, 5¼, 8¾, 3 (1min 02.97sec).\n\nTRIAL 2 TEST\n\n1 Sebas (G Mosse)\n\n2 Pint Sized Prince\n\n3 Frances (A da Silva)\n\n4 Lady Iffraaj (R Zawari)\n\n5 King Roulette (WS Chan)\n\nMargins and time: 1¼, 11¾, 4¼, 3¾ (1:01.69).\n\nTRIAL 3 TEST\n\n1 Order Of The Sun (B Woodworth)\n\n2 Emperor Max (M Rodd)\n\n3 Golden Brilliant (T See)\n\n4 Exceed Express (M Nunes)\n\n5 Bourbon Goldman (K A'Isisuhairi)\n\n6 Sun Scraper (CC Wong)\n\n7 Lake Huka (G Boss)\n\nMargins and time: 2¾, 1, ½, hd, 1, 1¼ (1:00.79).\n\nTRIAL 4 TEST\n\n1 Major Advancement (Y Salim)\n\n2 Hot Gold (B Vorster)\n\n3 Cote De Nuits (Nunes)\n\n4 My Reach (I Azhar)\n\n5 Nessun Dorma (Wong)\n\n6 Alamak Boy (A Munro)\n\n7 Jet Striker (CK Ng)\n\nMargins and time: 1½, ½, 1¾, 3¾, 2¼, 13¾ (1:01.87).\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nRacing\n\nSingapore\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 18, 2025, 05:17pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 19\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 02:32pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 18\n\nFeb 16, 2025, 03:27pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 17\n\nFeb 15, 2025, 01:46pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 16\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/06efe71f284a8a6ee449e146fc38f8f7057fa8672fa72c0916318545050d88a6/racing.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Race card for Feb 20", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1ecd7eacdf5654e84e1b2d48da6b9c9a5969e8ec1a183849b063723cff838125/racing1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for Feb 19", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It has been fun,\" Woods said.\n\nWoods seemed a man alone during much of his career's success and after his infamous sex scandal, but has kindled new friendships from a new generation of US PGA Tour players, those he inspired rather than dominated.\n\n\"It's amazing to see the outpouring of support from our side. He has meant so much to all of us. He has inspired all of us, touched all of us in different ways,\" Watson said.\n\nWatson summed up the feelings of many golf fans who dream of Woods' glory era but just want to see him play, in the same way that Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player were loved long past their peak.\n\n\"Just let us watch you for four days,\" Watson said.\n\n\"I don't care what the score is.

Because, come Sunday, it's going to be Rocket Man Day at the Kranji racecourse when we say thank you and a happy retirement in South Africa to a true champion.\n\nOkay, it won't be a teary affair. That's for more sober stuff. What's planned for Sunday is a farewell party - complete with juicy carrots - for the greatest racehorse ever to grace our shores.\n\nLike when Joseph Schooling won that Olympic gold medal some months ago, Rocket Man did the same for Singapore.\n\nHe put us on the world racing map.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 03:08pm\n\nRace card for Feb 20\n\nMore related stories\n\nSo, some will say: \"He's only a horse.\" Yes. But that win at the 2011 Golden Shaheen in Dubai, an international Group 1 race, didn't come cheaply.\n\nRocket Man is the best horse I have ever had the pleasure and the honour of training. When it comes to temperament, ability and that zest to win, Rocket Man has no equal. He's everything a trainer can dream of having in his yard. Trainer Patrick Shaw, on Rocket Man\n\nLike Schooling did in Rio, he had to beat the best - which he did.\n\nI remember interviewing Rocket Man's trainer, Patrick Shaw after that victory. I had always held that man in awe. He, with the poise of a president. Yet, there he was, glowing and gushing like a proud parent.\n\nCome to think of it, I shouldn't have expected anything less.\n\nWhat Rocket Man did in Dubai and in a racing career which spanned just four years from 2008 is the stuff of legends.\n\nHe won all there was to win - 20 races from 27 starts and collected almost $7 million in stake money, a Singapore record. And, if not floored by injury, he would have wanted more.\n\nIndeed, to see him was to love him.\n\nOn raceday, the Rocket Man show began long before the starting gates flew opened. He was a star and, it looked like he knew it.\n\nSo, we used to see that little dance of his whenever the cheers from the grandstand reached those twitching years. He was all strut and style and, oh, how we lapped it up.\n\nIf he had just two legs, like us mere mortals, he would be like John Travolta swinging that can of paint in that epic scene from the movie Saturday Night Fever. You saw those moves and you remembered it forever.\n\nHe gave the sport, theatre.\n\nSo, come Sunday when, after the sixth race, he will be trotted out to a place he knows all too well - the winner's enclosure - be sure to raise a mighty cheer. Watch for that dance and the spring in his steps.\n\nBecause that's the last you will get to see of a horse whose feats will, surely, stand the test of time.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nRacing\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 18, 2025, 05:17pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 19\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 02:32pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 18\n\nFeb 16, 2025, 03:27pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 17\n\nFeb 15, 2025, 01:46pm\n\nRace cards for Feb 16\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/46810aa47e52de2efae6c37cac6a8cea66d4848830ae8a11e94bae7b59d49dbd/np_20161201_rocketman01_1455659.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Rocket Man making Singapore proud by being the country’s first International Group 1 winner when he captured the Dubai Golden Shaheen with jockey Felix Coetzee astride in March 2011.

Last season, in two matches, the Gunners put seven goals into the back of the Hornets' net, without reply. A must-win for Wenger.\n\nCan try: Gunners to clear 1/2 Goal\n\nTOTTENHAM v LIVERPOOL\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nSep 9, 2022, 11:08am\n\nEnglish Premier League fixtures postponed after Queen Elizabeth's death\n\nMore related stories\n\nThey shared the points in their two meetings last season.\n\nLiverpool will relish this fixture. You have to go back to 2012 to find the last time Spurs beat them. They were level at the break (0-0, 0-0, 1-1) in their last three meetings.\n\nCan try: Draw-Draw on  HT-FT option\n\nCHELSEA v BURNLEY\n\nBelieve it or not, Chelsea are given only a 31 per cent chance of winning this.\n\nBut you have to go back to 1973 to find the last time Burnley beat Chelsea. When they met in this fixture in the 2014/15 season, they drew 1-1. In their last five meetings, Chelsea have led at the interval.\n\nCan try: Chelsea on 1/2 Goal\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE v BOURNEMOUTH\n\nLast season, the Eagles were dismal at home - winning six from 19.\n\nBut the same goes for the Cherries. They, too, won only six times while on the road. Last season, 32 of Bournemouth's matches had goals at the break. In all, 22 of them ended EVEN. Palace failed to score in 14 games.\n\nCan try: Draw on 1x2\n\nEVERTON v STOKE\n\nLast season, Everton were dismal at Goodison Park, winning just six from 19 home games. Last season, both kept 10 clean sheets.\n\nThey played a seven-goal thriller when they last met in this fixture. Seven of their last 10 meetings ended with one goal at the interval.\n\nCan try: Everton 1-0 at the break\n\nLEICESTER v SWANSEA\n\nLast season, the wily Foxes scored seven goals against the Swans - without reply. Both times they led 2-0 at the interval.\n\nLast term, Leicester lost just once when playing at King Power Stadium. As for the Swans, they won just four from 19 while on the road.\n\nCan try: Swansea at +1.5 Goals\n\nSOUTHAMPTON v SUNDERLAND\n\nLast season, the Saints were strong at St Mary's, losing just five from 19. The Black Cats, on the other hand, were disappointing when on the road, winning just three from their 19 away games.\n\nOn last season's stats, EVEN seems the way to go. Their last three meetings saw them level at the break.\n\nCan try: THREE on Total Goals\n\nHULL v MAN UNITED\n\nThe head-to-head stats say the Tigers cannot win. However, when the two teams last met in May 2015, Hull held on to a 0-0 draw.\n\nWorth noting that last season, the Red Devils won just seven of 19 when playing away and EVEN seemed to be the call in Man United matches.

Only once in their last 10 meetings has it been 0-0 at the interval. The last time Boro beat West Brom was in 2006.\n\nCan try: EVEN on Even-Odd option\n\nMAN CITY v WEST HAM\n\nOnly twice in their last 10 meetings have they marched off all square.\n\nLast season, Man City lost just five from 19 matches at home while the Hammers also lost five of 19 when playing away.

This season, both of City's matches ended ODD.\n\nCan try: OVER 2.5 on Over/Under option\n\nenglish premier league\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 23, 2021, 03:35pm\n\nHolland not counting on van Dijk for Euros\n\nMar 23, 2021, 03:11pm\n\nThiago laments emotional difficulty of pandemic football\n\nMar 10, 2021, 04:22pm\n\nMourinho looking to mark career milestone with trophy for Spurs\n\nMar 9, 2021, 09:56am\n\nChelsea's mean defence is down to trust and courage: Tuchel\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e1b5e6d59c16d33d904c9b1aac05385b82b649d8783a9cfda7dbfb8f997a86ea/NP_20160827_BMTEAMS27_1368098.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CATALYST: Arsenal's wizard Mesut Oezil (above) is in line for his first start this season, after making a substitute appearance in the 0-0 draw with Leicester.", "caption": "CATALYST: Arsenal's wizard Mesut Oezil (above) is in line for his first start this season, after making a substitute appearance in the 0-0 draw with Leicester."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6432b67dd00690b82eaf11d27c5f42a592228f6a564c4b4d552a61210421b81d/dw-football-qe2-220909.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "English Premier League fixtures postponed after Queen Elizabeth's death", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5de22c0d94ccaaa9c5aab6910a26b058bbe4700b6c649266195497f929b10221/vvd24.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Holland not counting on van Dijk for Euros", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

What a day! The traffic was difficult to navigate, but it was an amazing race. A special thank you to the fans - you make this such a great event.\"\n\nThe Briton took the chequered flag less than two seconds ahead of the German, who had lined up on pole position at the Hungaroring but lost out to Hamilton at the start in the key moment of the race.\n\nHamilton now leads Rosberg by six points after 11 of the season's 21 races. The Briton has won five of the last six races, including the last three.\n\nOVERTAKING SCHUMI\n\nUntil yesterday, he had shared the record for Hungary GP wins with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher.\n\n\"I grew up watching Michael, so to have a similar number, and now one more than he had here, is incredible,\" said Hamilton.\n\nAustralian Daniel Ricciardo finished third for Red Bull after pushing the Mercedes pair hard enough at one point for the champions to tell Hamilton to pick up the pace.\n\nFerrari's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, also a previous winner in Hungary, finished fourth after sounding off over the team radio about slower cars holding him up as he lapped them.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen held off Ferrari's feisty Kimi Raikkonen for fifth. The Finn had started 14th but a long first stint saw him challenging the Dutchman.\n\nThe battle between the pair provided a moment of excitement in an otherwise uneventful race, with Raikkonen clipping the back of Verstappen's car and damaging his front wing in an attempt to pass the 18-year-old.\n\nFernando Alonso was the sole-surviving McLaren in seventh.\n\nMcLaren's hopes of a strong result on the back of their best qualifying performance since renewing their engine partnership with Honda were dashed early on, with Jenson Button falling down the order with hydraulics problems.\n\nThe 2009 world champion also collected a drive-through penalty for a breach of radio rules before finally retiring late in the race.\n\nRosberg, who has also won five races this year, will have the chance to seize back the lead in his home German Grand Prix.\n\nHOCKENHEIM NEXT\n\nThe race at Hockenheim, absent from last year's calendar, takes place this weekend.\n\n\"It was all down to the start in the end,\" said Rosberg, of yesterday's race.\n\n\"From then on, I was trying to put all the pressure on Lewis but it's not possible to pass at this track.\n\n\"To have the next race coming up very quickly sounds good, at my home race... it's going to be awesome.\" - Reuters.\n\nHUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX (Top 5)\n\n1.

But one lapse saw them failing to make the final, losing 1-0 to Hong Kah Secondary School.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 21, 2020, 03:38pm\n\nOur Tampines Hub gets IOC honour\n\nMore related stories\n\nDefending champions Hong Kah found just one crack in Siglap's defence and, from that, they poached the winning goal.\n\nHong Kah's Shahrulnizam Mazlan capitalised on the only big chance.\n\nHe sped past the centre backs and beat goalkeeper Yeo Wen Bin for the killer goal in the 65th minute.\n\nSiglap were stunned, but they refused to lie down.\n\nThey kept the pressure up and had a chance to take the game into extra-time but were denied by a goal-line save by Hong Kah skipper Muhammad Nurdanial.\n\nSaid Nurdanial: \"I knew that he was going to for the far post and, thankfully, I managed to get there in time.\"\n\nSiglap were crestfallen. But their head coach Fabio Fantecelle, 42, tried to lift their spirits.\n\n\"It's very heartening to see my boys give of their best and come so far in the tournament,\" he said. \"My boys worked really hard today, and played well against an experienced and strong side like Hong Kah.\"\n\nIn an earlier match, Tanjong Katong beat St Gabriel's Secondary 4-1 to secure their spot in the final.\n\nTanjong Katong's Muhammad Syafiq scored the opener in the second minute and found the net again in the 23rd while Banbury Lee got the third eight minutes from the break after a diagonal cross left the opposing goalkeeper rooted.\n\nHaiqal Assyiddiq went on to seal the deal with a fourth in the 45th minute before St Gabriel's grabbed a consolation goal six minutes later.\n\nThe final wll be played at the Jalan Besar Stadium at 4.40pm on Wednesday.\n\nSt Gabriel's face Siglap for the third-placed play-off at 3pm.\n\nBy\n\nHaresh Kumar Ramani\n\nRead articles by Haresh Kumar Ramani\n\nsport\n\nSCHOOLS SPORTS\n\nSiglap\n\nTANJONG KATONG SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nST GABRIEL SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nHONGKAH SECONDARY SCHOOL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6964493b20a4d4b56a82b3c4800c6e5661716dfc0dc83fc18404b333204dc917/NP_20160723_HKSOC23_1333081.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "ON TO THE FINAL: Shahrulnizam Mazlan (left) celebrating with teammate Mohammad Nizam after scoring the only goal for Hong Kah Secondary School to send them to the National Schools' B Division final.  ", "caption": "ON TO THE FINAL: Shahrulnizam Mazlan (left) celebrating with teammate Mohammad Nizam after scoring the only goal for Hong Kah Secondary School to send them to the National Schools' B Division final."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It does not cause stomach bloating or discomfort.\n\nThis is an important factor that ensures I drink sufficiently and comfortably.\n\nIt also contains carbohydrates to refuel my working muscles and helps promote muscle recovery, which is critical in a marathon.\n\nIt keeps me hydrated and gives me something to look forward to when the going gets tough.\n\nTrain hard and drink smart as you plan to race!\n\nSingapore national marathoner Soh Rui Yong was talking to Sazali Abdul Aziz.\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nsport\n\nSoh Rui Yong\n\nMarathon\n\nH-TWO-O\n\nRUN\n\nHYDRATE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 29, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nThe big push for netball\n\nOct 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nRetirement on the horizon for Yeo\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTCJ Challenge Trophy reaches out to needy kids\n\nAug 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nOscar pips Veerman in play-off\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nFree WiFi 7 router, installation & more with 3Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/15572552d9348789e05c0585473a8de6bf72be15500a2f1a38fad5edc0a46909/NP_20160721_SZSOH21_1330309.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "DRINK UP: Marathoner Soh Rui Yong (left) drinks H-TWO-O for his long runs. ", "caption": "DRINK UP: Marathoner Soh Rui Yong (left) drinks H-TWO-O for his long runs."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e3d3d39e2d6b689035ceeb6c4ef5b650ed5b91a5b5a7df6a9575c65651b93bd9/hub22.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Our Tampines Hub gets IOC honour", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/714478e485f9bb1346dd15d6e43a3c1e42b288249f551edba833c5cccf02f899/mgnetball16c.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "The big push for netball", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The appointment of Jose Mourinho is a fantastic appointment.\n\n\"We are all as a group of players excited by it and the signings that we have made have been fantastic.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can have a good start to the season and be successful at the end of it.\"\n\nUnited get their campaign underway at Bournemouth on Aug 14, by which point Rooney's role within Mourinho's new-look team should have become clearer.\n\nHow best to utilise the 30-year-old is a question made all the more intriguing by the United boss saying he has no intention of playing the skipper in a deeper midfield role like predecessor van Gaal or former England manager Roy Hodgson.\n\nThe summer acquisitions of Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan have increased the competition for places in attack and Rooney knows how many eyes will be on him.\n\n\"You always feel pressure when you play for Manchester United,\" the captain said.\n\n\"It's one of, if not the, biggest football club in the world and it is a pleasure to have played for them for them for so long.\n\n\"Always you feel like you've got to prove yourself each season and it's a joy to play for them so, of course, there's pressure, there's pressure to be successful.\"\n\nRooney's first media appearance since England's embarrassing Euro 2016 exit to Iceland came during a peculiar and wide-ranging press conference with United's global partner Gulf Oil International.\n\nIt was taken in good humour, though, as was a question about how the captain was finding it working under former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss Mourinho.\n\n\"Well, I've had only one day before we come out,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"But it was a very good day, a good training session.\n\n\"But you have to look at the teams he has been at before and the success he has brought to those teams, which we're hoping and we believe that he can bring that success to us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Man United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has not travelled for United's clash against Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai tomorrow amid reports that a world-record offer for Pogba has been rejected.\n\nNO UNITED START\n\nThe 23-year-old departed Old Trafford four years ago having failed to make a single first-team start, racking up a mere seven appearances in all competitions.\n\nPogba subsequently flourished and has transformed into one of the world's best midfielders, shining during a medal-laden period with Serie A champions Juventus.\n\nNow, though, a return to United could be on the cards and the Guardian reports a transfer package worth £100 million ($178m) has been turned down by the Turin giants.\n\nThe newspaper says Juventus want a basic £100m plus £8m add-ons for a player who is also attracting interest from Real Madrid, with head coach Zinedine Zidane an admirer of the midfielder.\n\nHowever, United are the bookmakers' favourites to sign Pogba and Woodward was conspicuous by his absence when the team landed in Shanghai yesterday.\n\nWoodward is hoping to add Pogba to the summer arrivals of Bailly, Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan, the last two are clients of Pogba's agent Mino Raiola.\n\nReports in Italy suggest the player has told Juventus he wants to leave, having last week publicly stated his happiness at the club.\n\nIt is understood Woodward could head to China for the second friendly against Manchester City in Beijing on Monday.\n\n-

I've always thought that he is one of the best ball-strikers in the game and that Major championships are perfectly suited for him.\n\n\"I knew that he would ultimately come through and win. I'm happy that he did. I'm disappointed that it was at my expense.\"\n\nCATCHING THE LIP\n\nMickelson had started the day one shot behind Stenson, but a birdie at the first combined with a bogey by his opponent saw the two swop places.\n\nStenson recovered from that, but the two were neck and neck before the Swede birdied the short 14th.\n\nHe then produced a stunning putt for another birdie at 15 and, at the long 16th, Mickelson saw an eagle putt stop dead on the edge of the hole.\n\n\"I really thought that was going to go in,\" he said.\n\n\"But it seems there have been a couple of putts like that this week. I've made a bunch, too, but it seems a couple of critical ones caught the lip.\"\n\nOne such effort was his birdie putt at the 18th on Thursday that just refused to drop, agonisingly denying him the first ever round of 62 in a Major.\n\nMickelson, 46, remains on five Major titles, including one in The Open at Muirfield in 2013 when he beat Stenson to the trophy.\n\nBut this was another near-miss to add to so many that have come before - he has now been a runner-up at 11 Majors.\n\n\"You know, it's not like I have decades left of opportunities to win Majors, so each one means a lot to me. And I put in my best performance today. Played close to flawless golf and was beat.\"\n\nNext up, he heads back to the United States for the PGA Championship beginning on July 28 at Baltusrol in New Jersey, the venue where he won the PGA back in 2005.\n\n\"I'll try to look at the positives and take that into Baltusrol and keep my game sharp over the next week or two as opposed to going home and taking some time off,\" he said. - AFP.\n\nGolf\n\nHenrik Stenson\n\nPhil Mickelson\n\nbritish open\n\nROYAL TROON\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 22, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nWoods shows 'progress' after car crash\n\nOct 24, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nMatsuyama thrilled after win in Japan\n\nOct 11, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSouth Korean golfer Ko Jin-young breaks Tiger Woods' bogey-free record\n\nOct 5, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAsian Tour resumes next month, S'pore to host two events\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4b3794a60f6abd130b072360778f03e094b135580fa3f5ec259812c60f78536c/NP_20160719_PHIL19_1328240.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "SO CLOSE,  YET SO FAR:  Phil Mickelson was a whisker away from winning the Claret Jug and, instead, has now finished runner-up on 11 occasions at the Majors.", "caption": "SO CLOSE,  YET SO FAR:  Phil Mickelson was a whisker away from winning the Claret Jug and, instead, has now finished runner-up on 11 occasions at the Majors."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

San Antonio slipped to 14-4 after the loss.\n\nIn New Orleans, Anthony Davis maintained his prolific start to the season with 41 points as the Pelicans dismantled the Los Angeles Lakers 105-88.\n\nDavis also plucked 16 rebounds as the Pelicans snapped a two-game losing streak with their fifth straight home victory at the Smoothie King Center.\n\nThe win saw the Pelicans improve to 7-12 while the Lakers fell to 9-10. - AFP.\n\nOTHER RESULTS\n\nUtah Jazz 120 Houston Rockets 101\n\nBrooklyn Nets 127  Los Angeles Clippers 122 (OT)\n\nCharlotte Hornets 89  Detroit Pistons 112.\n\nNBA\n\nBasketball\n\nsports\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 20, 2023, 08:38am\n\nNBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar pokes fun at 'great fall' that broke his hip\n\nJul 13, 2023, 08:56am\n\nLA Lakers star LeBron James says no intention of retiring yet\n\nJun 21, 2023, 05:46am\n\nAll eyes on 'game-changer' Wembanyama at NBA Draft\n\nJun 16, 2023, 11:32am\n\nConor McGregor accused of sexual assault at NBA game\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nStream, game & surf with all-inclusive 10Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3b5e99031e49a03f2a0d9f1e79163e42000131945e21cbadd72beddb3187cbd6/NP_20161201_NBA01_1455867.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Iman Shumpert (above, right) and his Cleveland Cavaliers teammates struggled to deal with Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo (left).

The glory days of the Malaysia Cup coincided with the growth of the newspaper in the 80s and 90s, propelling it to the status of \"Singapore's Soccer Paper\"\n\nShare this article\n\nFittingly, the top story of the very first issue - on July 26, 1988 - was how Singapore's favourite footballing son Fandi Ahmad would be brought back to local football.\n\nMatch reports, exclusive stories and scoops involving the Malaysian League followed thick and fast.\n\nFrom annual Malaysia Cup pull-out spreads to breaking news on the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) crackdown on match-fixing, TNP published it all; proving we were the ultimate source of information on the tournament and the country's most loved team.\n\nMr R. Jegathesan, TNP's chief sub-editor (Sports) during the late 1980s and early 1990s, explained the conscious decision to target the Malaysia Cup as the centrepiece of the paper's sports coverage.\n\nGOLDEN DAYS: An ecstatic Fandi lifting the Malaysia Cup in 1994.\n\nHe said: \"Football was our main fare, and the Malaysia Cup inevitably became key to our coverage. With the popularity of the Cup among Singapore's masses, it was inevitable that we latched on to it to make the paper a compulsory afternoon read.\"\n\nPACKED\n\nEven during a regular league fixture, the old National Stadium would pack in 55,000 fans who would cheer on the Lions, yell expletives at the referee and jeer the opposition.\n\nWhat made the paper's coverage of the tournament unique, said Mr Jegathesan, was the \"no holds barred\" approach from the sports writers.\n\nOne of the breaking football stories TNP published exclusively in the early years was when V. Sundramoorthy was assaulted in Johor the day before a match.\n\nThe Singapore star, who was playing for Kedah at the time, was attacked by three men with hockey sticks outside his team hotel.\n\nInjuries to his legs ruled him out of Kedah's match against Johor the day after. Although the assailants were never found, TNP revealed through sources that it was likely to have been bookies who did not want him to play in the match. It was the first reported case of Malaysia Cup violence off the field.\n\nPerhaps the paper's biggest story on the Malaysia Cup was whenour reporter, through a series of stories in 1992 and 1993, urged the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) to investigate match-fixing in Singapore.\n\nJUBILATION: Members of the triumphant Singapore team in 1994.\n\nWhen Singapore lost the 1993 Malaysia Cup final to Kedah 2-0, he speculated on match-fixing once again, prompting the CPIB to step in.\n\nThe bureau launched a probe in August 1994 and subsequently charged footballers Michal Vana and Abbas Saad - both foreign stars in the Lions team that year - with accepting bribes.\n\nThe CPIB later credited TNP for \"helping Singapore clean up its soccer scene\".\n\nSingapore were relegated from the Malaysian top tier for the first time ever at the end of 1992. TNP pulled no punches towards the end of that season, often stating, unreservedly, that the Lions \"deserved to play in Division Two\".\n\nPROMOTION\n\nThe Dream Team achieved promotion back to the Semi-Pro League in 1993, but lost in the Malaysia Cup final. A year later, the Lions lifted the Cup in Shah Alam, defeating Pahang 4-0 in the final on Dec 17.\n\nTNP spared no pages in the build-up to the match and in documenting the glory.\n\nCommentaries and exclusive interviews with the players continued well after the final - all the way to February 1995 when Singapore pulled out of the Malaysian competition after 30 years. The withdrawal ushered in the era of the S-League, launched in 1996.\n\nFifteen years later, the Football Association of Singapore announced their return to the Malaysian competition - now known as the Malaysian Super League - with a new team named the LionsXII.\n\nTNP launched a 15-day \"M-League Countdown\" on Dec 26, 2011, which featured profiles of each LionsXII player every day.\n\nFans who collected the paper's countdown logos over two weeks won grandstand tickets to Singapore's historic opening clash against Kelantan on Jan 10, 2012.\n\nThey also received a special gift pack that contained limited-edition scarves, a guide to the M-League, complete with season fixtures, and a special poster of Singapore's greatest Malaysia Cup team.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nEnjoy free installation & more with 10Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5a100315dfc84d84acaa0b19bebc40d0cb8b355b012ed5274e685e3f241379f1/np_20161130_fandi2830_714513797.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "JUBILATION: Members of the triumphant Singapore team in 1994.", "caption": "JUBILATION: Members of the triumphant Singapore team in 1994."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/90c1e639a2436e8f7258037186da761d5b969d81437f44c6dfe4a5f9e4acd63e/np_20161130_fandi300_214547802.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ab80e3461519d72de48e109bb453c7e34e86af8b9bb103207d3bf812d2332d3e/np_20161130_fandi2830_714513797.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Fans are more loyal than customers... fans will come dressed in costumes, colour their faces and wanting to part of the whole atmosphere,\" he said.\n\n\"They are committed to wanting to support you, year in, year out.\"\n\nVarious initiatives, such as encouraging fans of the different teams to sit together, and to dress up creatively, have been introduced, while fringe activities have been moved from the OCBC Square to the concourse of the 55,000-seater stadium.\n\nWhile Low foresees that the global economic situation affecting the event's search for sponsorships, he said the major sponsors have been locked in on multi-year deals.\n\nLow's bullish outlook on the Singapore event mirrors the growth of the sport globally, following the commercial success of the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England, as well as the return of rugby - in the form of Sevens - at the Olympic Games in Rio in August.\n\nWith the revenue generated from the World Cup last year, World Rugby is expected to invest some £245.8m ($437.8m) in growing the sport in the coming years, which is 22 per cent more than the investment between 2013 and this year.\n\nEXPANSION\n\nWorld Rugby's head of commercial, broadcast and marketing Murray Barnett said that the international body is also looking at expanding the 10-city World Rugby Sevens Series.\n\nAmong the moves on the drawing board is adding more Asian stops, besides the two in Singapore and Hong Kong currently, said the 46-year-old Briton.\n\nAlso, other than the 16 teams, a second-tier competition is also being considered, with a promotion-relegation system in place.\n\nThe Sevens game, Barnett said, will be the \"growth engine\" of the sport globally because of its simplified rules, compared to the 15s version.\n\nBut, he added: \"I don't see that (expansion) happening in the next one or two years. But there will come a time when we will work out a way in which the squads are big enough, and where the transportation and management of players are sufficient such that we are able to add new places on the schedule.\n\n\"I am sure there will be a big Asian expansion.\"\n\nWe want fans of rugby. Fans are more loyal than customers... fans will come dressed in costumes, colour their faces and wanting to part of the whole atmosphere.\n\n- Rugby Singapore chairman Low Teo Ping\n\nBy\n\nLim Say Heng\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Lim Say Heng\n\nRugby\n\nSingapore\n\nsports\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 14, 2023, 06:24am\n\nAll Blacks great Sonny Bill Williams calls Eddie Jones a 'disgrace'\n\nNov 28, 2023, 08:50am\n\nSingapore rugby player Liyana Ong set for Irish adventure\n\nSep 8, 2023, 01:54pm\n\nWorld Cup awaits New Zealand haka and French response\n\nAug 22, 2023, 02:55pm\n\n'Heart-stopping' win as ACS (I) beat St Andrew's 36-34 in C Division rugby final\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nEnjoy all-inclusive 5Gbps Broadband with WiFi 7 router & more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/47c23d0bc709fc643aa028ca74e0b97ba1993965d5d3b9a0c8ce8351584b30a1/NP_20161130_SHRUG30_1454895.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "SUPPORT: The diehard fans who added colour to the Singapore Sevens this year are what impressed Low Teo Ping (above right), who took World Rugby's Murray Barnett (left) on a tour of the National Stadium yesterday.", "caption": "SUPPORT: The diehard fans who added colour to the Singapore Sevens this year are what impressed Low Teo Ping (above right), who took World Rugby's Murray Barnett (left) on a tour of the National Stadium yesterday.

If I care, I'm nervous.\n\n\"And it's good to be that way.\n\n\"To have that nervous energy and channel it into aggression, into focus, concentration, that's good stuff.\n\n\"If I wasn't nervous, that would mean I didn't care.\n\nFLAT\n\n\"I don't want to be out there flat. I want to be out here so bad - and now I am.\"\n\nUS Open champion Rose was impressed with what he saw of Woods during a nine-hole practice round in Albany while playing alongside baseball legends Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez.\n\nThe Englishman showed just how tame Tiger has become with some of his rivals by sharing a selfie taken with the former world No. 1.\n\n\"I hit it good today,' said Woods after the practice round.\n\nRose agreed.\n\n\"We've played today in a 32 kmh plus breeze and it's quite an unforgiving wind, but the quality of Tiger's play has been pretty good,\" said Rose, who won gold at the Rio Olympics.\n\nBrian Wacker of Golf Digest was one of a select few journalists who were able to follow Woods' round and he reported that the American was able to outdrive Rose \"more than once\".\n\n\"If (Tiger) wanted to test his game, then these conditions, given as tough as they are, are a good test,\" added Rose.\n\n\"He's clearly driven the ball very, very well.\"\n\nWoods has not played on the US PGA Tour since Aug 2015, having undergone surgeries in September and October of that year due to ongoing back problems.\n\nThe greatest player of his generation and arguably of all time, he has not won a tournament since 2013 and his title drought in the Major championships dates back to 2008.\n\nWoods, who has fallen to 898th in the world, said it had been a wise decision not to rush his return.\n\n\"The competitor inside me wanted to go so badly and was itching to go. I thought if I only have a few shots, it's good enough to get it around,\" he said.\n\n\"But what's the point in rushing back when I've waited over a year to begin with? I've waited this long, it's not going to hurt to wait just this much longer.\"\n\nWoods will make his return to competitive golf at High Noon alongside Patrick Reed.\n\nPairings for the 18-man invitational Hero World Challenge were released on Monday and Woods will be the second to play in the sixth group out.\n\nIt will be the first time Woods has played in the event owned by his charity foundation since it moved last year to the Bahamas and the Albany resort's par-72, 7,267-yard Ernie Els-designed course.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nWe've played today in a 32 kmh plus breeze and it's quite an unforgiving wind, but the quality of Tiger's play has been pretty good.\n\n- Justin Rose on Tiger Woods\n\ntiger woods\n\nGolf\n\nsports\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 2, 2024, 03:04am\n\nTiger Woods eyes playing three majors in next three months\n\nApr 15, 2024, 02:46am\n\nWoods fails to conjure Masters magic in final round\n\nApr 12, 2024, 02:23am\n\nWoods clears first Masters hurdle, now faces ultimate test\n\nFeb 16, 2024, 01:51am\n\nBack spasms take toll on Tiger Woods on PGA Tour return\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nEnjoy all-inclusive 5Gbps Broadband with WiFi 7 router & more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f356bb7e09fa391553ea387a4184ce3e4523426faaf4dbea5d08bebb46ee5cdc/NP_20161130_TIGER30_1454940.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "LOOK WHO'S BACK: Olympic gold medallist Justin Rose (above) takes a shot of Tiger Woods in action ahead of his comeback at the Hero World Challenge.", "caption": "LOOK WHO'S BACK: Olympic gold medallist Justin Rose (above) takes a shot of Tiger Woods in action ahead of his comeback at the Hero World Challenge.

The two stories had totally different endings, but the fighting spirit of these the children did not go unnoticed\n\nShare this article\n\nAmong the hundreds of children and their heartwrenching tales we have featured in the last 28 years, these two stood out.\n\nThey are the storries of Bryan Liu and Charmaine Lim - remarkable kids with an unparalleled zest for life. They fought their insurmountable odds with a smile and a cheerful spirit.\n\nBryan didn't have kidneys.\n\nCharmaine had advanced neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer which strikes the adrenal glands in infants and children.\n\nThe New Paper exclusively chronicled their struggles.\n\nOur reports helped Bryan get a new kidney through an altruistic donor - somebody who is not related to the recipient via family links.\n\nCHEERFUL SPIRIT: Bryan Liu and Charmaine Lim: Two tales which struck an emotional chord with our readers and inspired them to help in any way they could.\n\nOur reports helped raise $500,000 for Charmaine in just three weeks to seek a potentially life-saving procedure in New York.\n\nBut she eventually succumbed to her terminal illness in October 2011 at the age of six.\n\nTwo different endings, but with the same beginning - in The New Paper.\n\nWe first highlighted Bryan's condition in June 2010. He was born with one kidney, which was small and had abnormal tissues. When he was two, it failed.\n\nHis mother, Madam Serene Ng, 39, donated one of her kidneys, but that, too, failed because a rare viral condition and had to be removed in 2009.\n\nAfter our article was published, 25 readers wanted to donate their kidneys, but, unfortunately, there was no match.\n\nThat was when Mr Lin Dilun, 28, stepped up.\n\nThe TNP report inspired him, a total stranger, to donate one of his kidneys to Bryan.\n\nIn July 2012, one of his kidneys was removed in a four-hour operation at the National University Hospital. Thus Bryan became the youngest recipient of a kidney donated by an altruistic living donor in Singapore.\n\nSaid Madam Ng: \"Without TNP, I don't think we would have got a donor for him. He will still be doing dialysis and I don't know whether he'll be here today.\"\n\nFIGHT TO THE END\n\nCharmaine was not that lucky. But she fought till the very end, succumbing to what her mother called \"the monster\".\n\nHer battle lasted 2 1/2 years. During that time, she underwent 17 cycles of chemotherapy, took 11 types of chemotherapy drugs and spent many days in hospitals.\n\nThe mother, Ms Cynthia Lim, a 33-year-old financial planner and single mum who also has a son, was glad she shared the story of her daughter with The New Paper and the rest of Singapore when she was up against unbeatable odds.\n\nWhen Charmaine was diagnosed in February 2009, Ms Lim quit her job to care for her.\n\nShe maintained a blog - Feisty Princess Charmaine - that documented the girl's battle.\n\nThat's when The New Paper picked it up and featured the little girl's struggle in June 2009.\n\nAt that time, Ms Lim was desperate to raise money for an alternative treatment which was available only at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre.\n\nTreatment there would double her chances of survival, but it came at a very steep price - about $500,000. TNP's readers once again came forward to help.\n\nStar footballers like Fandi Ahmad and Rafi Ali chipped in for a charity match, local musicians performed at a fund-raising concert in Charmaine's name. Popular online forums and Facebook groups chipped in, too.\n\nSingaporeans donated generously and the target was met in three weeks.\n\nUnfortunately, the little girl began losing the battle - she developed resistance to the key drug. The cancer spread rapidly.\n\nWith life ebbing away, she could hardly talk, she had trouble breathing.\n\nTwo years after her death, Ms Lim admitted to TNP in an interview that it's still \"difficult\" to answer questions on how she is coping.\n\nShe said: \"There will be days and moments it comes back and hits you, you never know when, you just have to ride out.\"\n\nBut, on another level, Charmaine's life, and death, opened up a new world for the mother - strangers have become friends.\n\nShe added: \"I would not have experienced the compassion and kindness in humanity without Charmaine and what happened to her. I feel very privileged and honoured.\"\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of StarHub with 3Gbps Broadband deal\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7abb5be520de15a970be2652f6448c12a1f10fdb9200d11c93cbba534ff804d7/np_20161130_smallboy_0152818.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CHEERFUL SPIRIT: Bryan Liu (above) and Charmaine Lim: Two tales which struck an emotional chord with our readers and inspired them to help in any way they could.", "caption": "CHEERFUL SPIRIT: Bryan Liu (above) and Charmaine Lim: Two tales which struck an emotional chord with our readers and inspired them to help in any way they could."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

His body was not found\n\nShare this article\n\nThe body of a hero lies deep beneath the Nicoll Highway Station.\n\nIt's the body of Mr Heng Yeow Pheow - dubbed Hero Heng by The New Paper - the selfless Singaporean foreman who died so that his fellow workers could live.\n\nOn April 20, 2004, tunnelling work to expand the MRT railway system led to a massive cave-in at the Circle Line worksite in what became known as the Nicoll Highway collapse, one of the worst construction accidents in Singapore's history.\n\nBesides Mr Heng, those who died were 44-year-old Malaysian crane operator Vadivil Nadeson, 37-year-old construction worker Liu Rong Quan from China, and Singaporean site inspector John Tan, 56.\n\nTNP was instrumental in uncovering the human dimension amid the physical devastation.\n\nPERSISTENT\n\nIt was only after our persistent reporters tracked down a survivor in a dormitory in Kallang that details of Mr Heng's noble act at the time of the disaster came to light.\n\nMr Heng, then 40, was employed by Kori Construction, a sub-contractor for the Circle Line project.\n\nHe could've made a run for it when the temporary supporting walls at their worksite 30m underground started toppling around them.\n\nBut he stayed behind to make sure his eight trapped co-workers - who were mostly Thais - escaped to safety ahead of him.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr Heng didn't make it out in time. Even more tragically, his body was the only one that was never recovered.\n\nStill, a funeral ceremony was held for Mr Heng and hundreds of people turned up to pay their last respects.\n\nHe left behind his widow, Madam Poa Beng Hong, now 46, and two children, Daniel and Joann, now 20 and 18 respectively.\n\nThe Medal of Valour, the nation's top honour usually given to uniformed services personnel who demonstrate extreme courage in performing their duties, was awarded to him posthumously.\n\nIt now hangs on the living room wall of their four-room flat in Tampines, which is also adorned with many framed family photos.\n\nPICTURES\n\nOur interview conducted in April 2013 at their home, almost a decade after the tragedy, was punctuated with sobbing from both mother and daughter, while Daniel choked back tears.\n\nMadam Poa told TNP in Mandarin: \"Our walls are filled with pictures of him and us, reminding me that he is always with us.\n\n\"Some people would choose to stow away all these things, but I choose not to do that because I can't just leave the situation as it is.\n\n\"I have not seen his body (so) it's not so easy to just give up on it.\"\n\nShe added tearfully: \"In this case, it's still a mystery. His wallet isn't there. There is nothing left of him. He is left inside... It's hard to admit that he is no longer here. It's impossible to accept.\"\n\nEven Mr Heng's \"hero\" status is cold comfort to her.\n\n\"So what if he has this nickname? It doesn't mean anything to us... It's like having a four-legged table and you suddenly lose one leg...\"\n\nIn October 2007, in a High Court hearing, the family was awarded $380,000 in compensation and $30,000 in legal costs by the three construction firms involved.\n\nMore than $630,000 was also raised through public donations.\n\nMadam Poa has received about $2,500 monthly from a trust fund that former Tampines GRC MP Irene Ng had set up for her using public donations.\n\nThe sum rose to $3,600 last year and $4,500 this year, taking into account the higher education expenses of her children. The trust fund will run out in 2019.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBuilding Wealth at Every Age: Essential Strategies for Your 20s, 30s, 40s & Beyond\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fc1a8f99cf88e22df9acceb18cf60d22df82216492cab4a3cd80ff54a2a96d99/np_20161130_collapse2_015568.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "HERO: More than three days after the cave-in at Nicoll Highway, rescuers were forced to call off the search for Mr Heng.

Our coverage included gripping details from scores of witnesses, and exclusive sequence pictures and video footage of the incident. The reports were picked up around the world\n\nShare this article\n\nIt was the most terrifying incident since the Singapore Zoo opened more than 40 years ago.\n\nThe day - Nov 13, 2008 - will remain etched in memory forever.\n\nMalaysian contract worker Nordin Montong died after climbing into the white tiger exhibit and was attacked by its three inhabitants, a male named Omar and two females, Jippie and Winnie.\n\nThe then 32-year-old cleaner had deliberately jumped into the moat that separated the tigers from visitors. He then waded towards the creatures and was subsequently mauled to death - in full view of shocked onlookers who at first thought it was all a show.\n\nThe New Paper got right on top of the shocking incident and stayed ahead of the competition, to the extent of winning a Society of Publishers in Asia (Sopa) award for Excellence in the Reporting, Breaking News Category in 2009.\n\nThe New Paper's Page 1\n\nOur coverage included gripping details from scores of witnesses, and exclusive sequence pictures and video footage of the incident.\n\nWe went the extra mile in providing a human dimension to the tragic tale.\n\n\"Getting the video, to me, was pivotal. It was really a case of being at the right place, at the right time,\" then-TNP correspondent Desmond Ng, 40, recalled in March 2013.\n\nRanking it as one of his most memorable stories, he knew he had \"a major scoop\" on his hands. Mr Ng, who rushed to the venue right after the incident, said he trained his eye on those who were leaving the zoo.\n\n\"It pays to keep your ears peeled, and I overhead a bunch of students discussing the video at the next table.\n\n\"I quickly bundled them into my car and sped to the newsroom to show our editors the video. The adrenaline rush was out of this world.\"\n\nMalaysian Nordin Montong.\n\nThe grisly attack was filmed from the white tiger exhibit's viewing gallery by then 16-year-old student Mohammad Khairul Nizam Zainal, who handed the footage over.\n\nThe four-minute video clip showed the captive-bred big cats looking on curiously at the man who had intruded into their territory.\n\nCROUCHED\n\nThe tigers pawed and bit Mr Nordin as he crouched in a foetal position with a pail over his head.\n\nRealising he was at the mercy of the massive predators, he was heard repeating in Malay: \"If you want to kill me, go ahead. Forgive me. God is almighty.\"\n\nMr Nordin had 90 external injuries from top to toe, in addition to fractures of the skull, neck and ribs.\n\nA verdict of suicide was recorded by State Coroner Victor Yeo in 2009.\n\nAs such, no workmen's compensation was required by law to be paid to Mr Nordin's family.\n\nBut Sun City Maintenance, the cleaning company that hired him, bore the $3,000 funeral and transport expenses.\n\nSTRANGE BEHAVIOUR\n\nJust minutes before the tragedy, Mr Nordin reportedly exhibited strange behaviour.\n\nHe told colleagues at the zoo that they would not see him again as he would \"no longer be here\".\n\nHe also threw his Malaysian driving licence and staff meal vouchers into a crocodile enclosure.\n\nFormer TNP correspondent Teh Jen Lee, contacted his family and travelled to Kuching, Sarawak, for the funeral on Nov 15, 2008.\n\nIt was then that his sisters had asked to view the video footage of Mr Nordin's last moments, to see how their beloved brother ended up in the jaws of a tiger.\n\nMr Nordin's passing has had such a lasting impact on the family that the sisters have declined to be interviewed any more.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nDance your WiFi troubles away with all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cbb1745240f682fac8dfb0bb59cd69c0069590882fa6ff52bccbfbec2322d626/NP_20161130_NORDIN28-MAP_1445855.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Video grab showing Mr Nordin crouched in a foetal position with a pail over his head.", "caption": "Video grab showing Mr Nordin crouched in a foetal position with a pail over his head."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

TNP featured her in a heartrending front-page plea for love, in one of our many stories of extraordinary people\n\nShare this article\n\nSUFFERING IN SILENCE: Madam Lee\n\nFor most of her life, Ms Maria Lee Kwai How knew only pain.\n\nLike the physical pain of suffering from acute neurofibromatosis, a disfiguring and incurable non-infectious genetic disorder.\n\nCommonly known as Elephant Man's disease, it causes skin tissues to grow out of control.\n\nMs Lee was shunned by society. It's perhaps not hard to understand why.\n\nLumps of spongy flesh of various sizes ravaged her entire body, from the top of her head to the soles of her feet, making her look much bigger than her petite 1.5m frame.\n\nThose on her hands were so big that whenever she raised them, it was like lifting weights.\n\nHer eyelids, heavy with tissue, almost hid her eyes and her mouth could only be seen when she opened it to eat or talk.\n\nHer nostrils were nearly blocked by the growths, which made breathing and speaking difficult.\n\nMs Lee died peacefully in her sleep in September 1994. The official cause of death was bronchopneumonia.\n\nShe was 73.\n\nThe New Paper learnt of her plight in 1992, when her story first appeared in an issue of local community service organisation Lions Club Of Singapore's magazine, Roar.\n\nThe fragile old lady's purgatory of loneliness and seclusion was further highlighted in TNP in a heartrending front-page plea for love and acceptance.\n\nMany readers were moved by her tragic story and contacted TNP, offering friendship and financial help.\n\nShe was normal at birth, but when she turned 18 the disease first appeared. At that time, she lived with her mother - who was from China - in a one-room flat in Chinatown.\n\nShe hardly ventured out of her home, but whenever she did, it would be under the cover of a long-sleeved hooded robe.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nWhen her mother died, she moved to a one-room flat in York Hill in 1975 and was looked after by an elderly man, Mr Khun Sook. They both lived on social welfare assistance.\n\nThe turning point came in 1990, the year Mr Khun Sook died.\n\nEven though she became helpless and alone, she refused to be put in an old folks home as most of its facilities are communal.\n\nEventually, nuns from local Catholic charity home Little Sisters Of The Poor took Ms Lee in, and she spent her remaining years there till her death in 1994. During this time, she became more open and relaxed.\n\nAlthough Ms Lee's features were barely distinguishable, everyone who knew her remembered her smile - as well as the cheerful, friendly soul.\n\nOne of them was Madam Yvonne Yuen, a Lions Club Of Singapore (City) member and one of the volunteers who cared for Ms Lee and visited her at least once a week.\n\nThe 60-year-old recalled to TNP in March 2013: \"Maria's case is definitely the worst I've seen (in terms of skin diseases). She never really talked about her condition because there was nothing to say about it...\n\n\"We never heard her whine or complain about her condition. She really took it in her stride.\"\n\nAbout 300 people attended Ms Lee's funeral, held at the Church of St Bernadette, after which her body was cremated.\n\nOf her passing, Madam Yuen said: \"In her final days, (the area around) her eyes got really droopy - to the extent where we couldn't see her eyes any more. A few of her lumps even burst and we had to nurse and help dress her.\n\n\"But even when she was sick, she would always try to speak to us. She always felt blessed and thankful for the help and the friends that she had.\"\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/623010578e7fa33faaefb337b8b0ed7dc876cf7cb0866ee7161024436506cb6c/np_20161130_oldwoman1_2232818.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "SUFFERING IN SILENCE: Madam Lee", "caption": "SUFFERING IN SILENCE: Madam Lee"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Ng Wan Ching, a former TNP reporter then on honeymoon in London tracked him down to his home in Prague, and an explosive interview followed\n\nShare this article\n\nThe odds were stacked against her. Ms Ng Wan Ching had no knowledge of local football and faced several other obstacles.\n\nBut the former parliament, health and features writer with The New Paper pushed ahead with the help of her husband and scored big in late October 1994.\n\nThe prize: an exclusive interview with former footballer Michal Vana in his hometown Prague, months after he was arrested and charged with corruption.\n\nVana, who was playing for Singapore in the then-Malaysian Premier League, had fled the country while on bail, but was later spotted in his native Czech Republic, leading to Ms Ng's abrupt assignment.\n\nThe Vana saga had started two months before that, when the striker, then 31, was arrested - along with referee T. Rajamanickam - by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau on Aug 12, 1994.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nEven as Vana's arrest came as a shock to a football-mad country then, an even bigger bombshell was to follow.\n\nHe was declared a no-show in court, and an arrest warrant was issued.\n\nMr V Supramaniam, Vana's bailor, had even gone to the player's Bayshore Park condominium apartment to search for him that day, but to no avail. The businessman's $500,000 was later forfeited.\n\nIn the meantime, two former TNP reporters Yaw Yan Chong and Ganesh Rajaram approached Mr Daniel Kummermann, then a foreign desk correspondent of the Lidové Noviny, one of the Czech Republic's leading newspapers, to locate Vana.\n\nThe paper's Jaroslav Beranek then tracked Vana down and interviewed him in his Prague apartment. The newspaper carried the interview on Oct 19, with a grateful Mr Kummermann informing TNP a day later.\n\nTNP then ran the explosive story - Mr Beranek had spotted Vana and his children Marek and Lucy at the Benesov Stadium watching his former team, Svarc Benesov, play Liberec.\n\nMr Beranek later persuaded Vana to give an interview in the latter's home. Vana said he left Singapore on a boat \"across the straits\" to an unnamed second country.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Ng was being activated despite being on her honeymoon.\n\nShe and her husband managed to get tickets and visa. They first flew to Berlin and then took a train to Prague.\n\nAfter settling down in their hotel, the couple took off in a taxi for Vana's home in U Dekanky, a middle-class suburb in the Prague 4 district.\n\nShe said: \"I knew nothing about Prague and they had just opened up (after the Cold War era).\n\n\"The apartment block was quite scary... It was so dark there - the street lights weren't that bright, everything looked very dark and there were dogs barking.\"\n\nEXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS: Footballer Abbas Saad (left) with teammate Michal Vana in a 1994 file photo. THE NEW PAPER OCT 21, 1994\n\nAs no one responded when they knocked on Vana's door on the third floor, the couple spoke to his neighbour and gave her their contact details to pass on to Vana.\n\nMs Ng said: \"We then left, never expecting him to call us back.\"\n\nBut he did, and Ms Ng persuaded the \"friendly but hesitant\" man to meet her at a hotel. He agreed.\n\nIt turned out to be a two-hour interview, where a \"cocky\" Vana portrayed himself as the naive victim and evaded some of Ms Ng's tough questions.\n\nHe told her that the Singapore Government could not touch him and claimed that his sick father might not have seen him again if he had gone to jail in Singapore.\n\nHe also claimed that he took the money for his sporting goods business and didn't know that the money was from a bookie.\n\nHe also said: \"My friend, who works in the Austrian Football Association, had come to Singapore to try to sign me to play for an Austrian club.\n\n\"He waited for me in a country close to Singapore and lent me his passport. I travelled on his passport... My friend does not look like me at all, but no one noticed.\"\n\nOnce in Vienna, Austria, he mailed the passport back to his friend.\n\nVana was so relaxed during the interview that he posed for a picture after the interview with Ms Ng, putting his arm around her.\n\nThe apartment block was quite scary... It was so dark there - the street lights weren't that bright, everything looked very dark and there were dogs barking.\n\n- Ms Ng Wan Ching\n\nFootball\n\ns.league\n\npolice\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Money Market Funds in Singapore for Smarter Cash Management\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/318f772b08e17014a5c261af2714af903bba6ff147556287bf0d804fd6f94b20/NP_20161130_VANA28_1445508.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS: Footballer Abbas Saad (left) with teammate Michal Vana in a 1994 file photo.", "caption": "EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS: Footballer Abbas Saad (left) with teammate Michal Vana in a 1994 file photo.

One year at Liverpool, we lost to Manchester City on Boxing Day and were 12th in the league, everyone was writing us off and we still won it.\n\n\"So to start picking a winner now is really hard. But, of the candidates, Chelsea look scary to me.\n\nHARD TO BEAT\n\n\"They don't have to have all of the ball to win games.\n\n\"Liverpool do, Manchester City do, Arsenal do. Chelsea play in a pragmatic way, they are hard to beat.\n\n\"They all seem to know what they are doing now and Diego Costa and Eden Hazard are a real threat. But it could change dramatically in the next month.\"\n\nReds manager Juergen Klopp fired up the Anfield crowd to inspire his men to beat an ultra-defensive Sunderland last weekend, and Souness is a big fan of the German.\n\n\"I think he's the perfect fit for that club,\" he said. \"He's a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and he's at a very emotional football club. I think it's working beautifully right now.\"\n\nKlopp insisted that his team can handle the absence of Coutinho.\n\nThe Reds' forward line has already been affected by the loss of Danny Ings to a season-ending knee injury, while Daniel Sturridge has a niggling calf problem.\n\nAdam Lallana, Liverpool's other successful creative force this season, is still not fit after a groin injury sustained on England duty, but Klopp is confident they can cope and refuses to look for excuses.\n\n\"Phil Coutinho is a really good football player, so if we cannot use him for the next few days or weeks, each team in the world would feel it,\" he said.\n\n\"But it is no excuse for anything. As good as he is, he does not decide games by himself, although it sometimes looks like this.\n\n\"It is a team performance we create and he is a very important part of this team, absolutely.\n\n\"Of course, we can handle it. If he is not in, you have to show - and we will show.\"\n\nLike Klopp, former Liverpool striker Ian Rush believes the Reds are not a one-man team and can deal with the absence of Coutinho.\n\n\"Coutinho is a big loss, but the way we've been playing this year has been absolutely fantastic and it's not just about Coutinho,\" Rush, who scored 346 goals for Liverpool, told TalkSport.\n\n\"(Roberto) Firmino has come good, he was absolutely fantastic on Saturday, Lallana is coming back from injury and we have a good all-round squad for scoring goals.\"\n\nORIGI OPENER\n\nDivock Origi replaced Coutinho against Sunderland, before opening the scoring at Anfield as Liverpool stretched their unbeaten run to 14 matches.\n\nRush believes the absence of Coutinho and Sturridge has presented the Belgian with a golden opportunity to stake his claim.\n\n\"Origi has to take his chance when it comes,\" said Rush. \"When you get a chance, you have to take it - you only get so many chances.

It's about the world championship so you can understand that he wanted to try whatever it was possible to do.\n\n\"He did a really good job of it, he did it perfectly because I had no chance to try to overtake him.\"\n\nAsked if he would have done the same in Hamilton's position, Rosberg told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"That's too hypothetical, so there's no point in going into that.\n\n\"We can just drop the whole discussion. There's no point discussing this topic any more. It's done and it's in the past.\"\n\nThe rivalry between the teammates defined the season, with Hamilton winning 10 races and Rosberg nine.\n\nTheir relationship was put to the test, and Rosberg said he remains respectful of Hamilton, having been close to the British driver since they were teenagers.\n\n\"Lewis is an amazing driver, he's one of the best of all-time. It's always tough to beat him,\" said Rosberg, who arrived in Kuala Lumpur yesterday for a Petronas event.\n\n\"We have the base respect because we were really good friends back in the day. That's always remained, that respect, so that for sure helps even though it's difficult because we're within the same team fighting each other. It's a very intense environment and not easy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Red Bull chief Christian Horner has accused Mercedes team chief Wolff of naivety for attempting to control the outcome of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and, with it, the drivers' world championship.\n\nHe said that it was always obvious that outgoing champion Hamilton would have to \"back up\" Rosberg to foil the German's title bid.\n\nEXPECTED\n\nHorner said he \"would not have expected him to do anything different\".\n\nHorner said: \"With where they were at, it was just down to those two guys.\n\n\"So it was only ever going to be that kind of battle between the two of them.\n\n\"Congratulations to Nico... He has driven a great season this year. He is a very worthy world champion, but it was naive to think that there would be any different approach to this race with what was at stake.\"\n\nAsked how he felt the race was handled by Mercedes, Horner added: \"We know that Toto likes to control most things in the paddock, including other teams' drivers... so you could not expect any different.\n\n\"They are racing for a world championship, the drivers' world championship.\n\n\"There are only two guys in it and they are both in the same car...\n\n\"For Lewis, winning the race was never going to be enough for him and he drove a tactical race. He didn't do anything dirty.\n\n\"He drove a tactical race. He didn't do anything against the rules and I think it would be unfair to criticise Lewis for the way he drove.\"\n\nHamilton's gamesmanship was questioned by his employers after he twice rejected team instructions to speed up as Rosberg came under threat from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.\n\nWolff said: \"It's very simple: Anarchy does not work in any team and in any company.\n\n\"A precedent has been set. Undermining a structure in public means you are putting yourself before the team.\" - Wire Services.\n\nFormula 1\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 16, 2023, 02:23pm\n\nF1 drivers prep to work late shift in Las Vegas\n\nSep 15, 2023, 06:11am\n\n'It was like a dream': Fan spots Lewis Hamilton at Promenade ahead of S'pore Grand Prix\n\nMar 20, 2023, 12:46am\n\n'I've never seen a car so fast', says Hamilton of Red Bull\n\nNov 19, 2022, 03:44am\n\nF1 launches new all-female racing series\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nUS-China Tariff Truce: What It Means for Markets and Your Investment Strategy\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1327ff85d23580523f108e2cdd419fcc6a5dad37df502737f349b1b1600ee34e/NP_20161130_LEWIS30_1454858.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "There’s no point discussing this topic any more.

It catapulted TNP onto the global stage of investigative reporting\n\nShare this article\n\nThe ever-unfolding kelong saga, which points an accusing finger at Singapore as a hub for global football match-fixing, was the longest-running story to date in The New Paper.\n\nSince September 2010, TNP published hundreds of stories linking Singaporeans to allegedly fixed matches worldwide.\n\nLike it or not, TNP became synonymous with match-fixing expose, having made a global impact with our kelong (Malay slang for match-fixing) reports.\n\nWhen Europol announced in February 2013 that 680 football matches worldwide had been fixed with strong roots to a Singapore-based syndicate, TNP once again was pushed into the limelight.\n\nBIG FISH: (Above) Dan Tan's rivalry with Wilson Raj was exposed on the world stage. PHOTO: COURTESY OF WILSON RAJ PERUMAL\n\nOver a two-week period, TNP was mentioned in as many as 300 online news sites, blogs, radio and TV stations like BBC, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, ESPN, Yahoo News, Reuters, AFP and AP.\n\nOur journey started when award-winning reporter Zaihan Mohd Yusof was first tasked in September 2010 to investigate a \"Singapore hand\" behind a fixed international friendly played between Bahrain and a fake Togo national side.\n\nProlific match-fixers like Wilson Raj Perumal and alleged Singaporean kingpin Dan Tan Seet Eng, have had their rivalry publicly exposed on the world stage.\n\nWe were the first to break the news of Wilson Raj's arrest in Finland for bribery and possession of a fake passport in late February 2011.\n\nWORLD EXCLUSIVE\n\nAbout a month later, Singapore's global links to match rigging became evident in a TNP world exclusive, when Mr Chris Eaton - then world football governing body Fifa's security head - said Singapore had \"an academy of match-fixing\".\n\nOut of 60 football associations across the globe who had issues with match-fixing in 2011, 26 had complained that their matches were manipulated by Singaporeans.\n\nThe kelong underworld would have gone unnoticed if not for Wilson Raj's testimony to European investigators. He ratted on his accomplices.\n\nHis series of letters to TNP in mid-2011 were equally damning as he had named several Singaporeans, including Mr Tan, who had betrayed him, and matches his syndicate had fixed.\n\nMr Tan, on the other hand, has been under the international media glare since December 2011. The Italian government has accused him of masterminding more than 30 fixed matches in Serie A and B.\n\nIn early March 2013, the Singaporean authorities sent an investigation team to Interpol headquarters in France to study evidence against him.\n\nTNP was lucky to score the only known interview with Mr Tan in August 2011.\n\nHe had then claimed his innocence - his bad blood with Wilson Raj was over a business dispute worth $100,000, he had told TNP.\n\nCloser home, the scourge of match-fixing was very evident.\n\nIn August 2012, two Malaysians, ex-national footballer Thanasegar S. Sinnaiah, 38, and part-time referee Shokri Nor, 47, absconded after being charged with conspiring to rig Singapore's LionsXII's Malaysian Super League match against Sarawak FA here in May that year.\n\nKINGPIN: Convicted match-fixer Wilson Raj Perumal. The kelong underworld would have gone unnoticed if not for his testimony to European investigators. PHOTO: COURTESY OF WILSON RAJ PERUMAL\n\nMore than a week before they were supposed to appear in court, we were tipped off that they had fled, despite their passports being impounded.\n\nAbout eight months later, we found Shokri living with his family in Sungai Petani, Kedah. He declined to speak to us.\n\nEqually explosive was the revelation in early March 2013 that at least one match in the Asean Football Federation Suzuki Cup, which Singapore have won for a record four times, was rigged.\n\nAn investigator had alerted TNP that the Malaysia versus Laos match, which Malaysia had won 4-1, had been fixed, as indicated by Sportradar, a betting analysis watchdog.\n\nWithout generous tip-offs by newsmakers and investigators, many more links to match-fixers might not have been unearthed.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nRecession-Proof Investments to Know in 2025\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d9f96dbf1c556835b649343cab6b4b6a9f50b52358f4b8e679eebf4fbaab5bfc/NP_20161130_KING28-1RV_1445319.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "RAMPANT: (Above) Malaysian part-time football referee Shokri Nor and Thanasegar S Sinnaiah were charged with agreeing to receive RM15,000 (S$6,000) for match-fixing.", "caption": "RAMPANT: (Above) Malaysian part-time football referee Shokri Nor and Thanasegar S Sinnaiah were charged with agreeing to receive RM15,000 (S$6,000) for match-fixing.

He has until tomorrow to respond.\n\nThere is a positive storyline in prospect for United, however, as captain Wayne Rooney goes into the game just one goal short of Sir Bobby Charlton's club record tally of 249.\n\nRooney, who has had to get used to being a substitute this season, could start in this game.\n\nHerrera is not taking anything for granted, but feels United can be confident having already proved they have the measure of West Ham.\n\nUnited had 17 shots to West Ham's six last Sunday and Randolph made a series of outstanding saves.\n\nHerrera, 27, said: \"West Ham are a good side, it is not easy to stop them creating chances.\n\n\"They have (Manuel) Lanzini, they have (Dimitri) Payet, they have (Michail) Antonio - they have very good players, but they just created two chances in the whole game.\n\n\"They didn't get the ball for one minute because we were the dominant team so, hopefully, on Wednesday, we can create as many chances as we did (on Sunday) and (then) normally we should win.\"\n\nLIFT SPIRITS\n\nUnited winger Jesse Lingard admitted that \"the luck's not there at the moment\" for the Red Devils, but has called on the team to lift spirits by booking a place in the League Cup semi-finals.\n\nLingard, who had a potential winning goal against the Hammers disallowed for offside, told MUTV: \"We're playing really well, but we keep drawing.\n\n\"The performances are there - it's just (a matter of) putting the ball in the back of the net.\n\n\"It's four draws in a row with numerous chances - the luck's not there at the moment. But we have to concentrate on the game on Wednesday now.\"\n\nDefender Phil Jones expects tomorrow morning's quarter-final against the same opposition to be a different encounter, but reiterated the need for United to keep creating the opportunities to score.\n\n\"We just need to stick together, keep training well and keep creating the chances, and we will get the goals,\" the centre back insisted.\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nepl\n\nManchester United\n\nWest Ham United\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nFree WiFi 7 router, installation & more with 5Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2cf5cc0f1f7fe2d1cffa3c4f922b9c90a834202748954f2466136eaa3e7502b4/NP_20161130_UNITED30_1455031.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "OPTIMISTIC: Man United's Ander Herrera is confident ahead of their League Cup quarter-final with West Ham, as they had done well in the 1-1 draw with the Hammers on Sunday.", "caption": "OPTIMISTIC: Man United's Ander Herrera is confident ahead of their League Cup quarter-final with West Ham, as they had done well in the 1-1 draw with the Hammers on Sunday.

Here are some of the classic ones\n\nShare this article\n\nBEGGAR FOR A DAY\n\nMay 14, 1991\n\nBeggars were being flown in from overseas by syndicates to make up to $100 a day here.\n\nThis prompted then sub-editor Herbert Fernandez to 'beg' at Serangoon Road, Chinatown and Raffles Place and find out. He wrote: \"The hardest part about begging was to look people in the eye... At Serangoon Road, I wanted to flee out of fear of meeting a familiar face.\"\n\nWhen interviewed, some said they were generally sympathetic towards beggars. But they also could not tell the difference between real and fake beggars.\n\nSTALKER FOR A DAY\n\nSept 26, 1992\n\nTwo Japanese women tourists were raped in their hotel room by a man who had followed them there.\n\nIn a test of local hotel security, then-reporter Dave Ang was sent to six top hotels to see how easily he could gain access to hotel rooms as an outsider. He loitered around guest lobbies and corridors, and acted suspiciously.\n\nHe managed to follow two young Japanese women to the door of their room.

Dressed in a conspicuous burqa, then-reporter Denyse Yeo, accompanied by an actor, Melvinder, visited four of Singapore's finest hotels.\n\nPretending to be a Central Asian couple who had just a bag and $40, they sought to find out which ones were willing to grant them a night's shelter.\n\nThe test, conducted in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, was based on Mr Ravi Veloo's No Room at the Inn, a modern version of Joseph and Mary's search for an inn.\n\nOnly one hotel tried phoning for help. They could not take them in.\n\nPRISONER FOR A NIGHT\n\nSept 24, 2005\n\nFancy paying RM50 (S$16) for a night in Johor Baru Prison (Penjara Johor Baru)?\n\nTo promote its Life Behind Bars programme, journalists were invited to give it a go.\n\nThen-reporter Andre Yeo (in glasses) was sent to experience what it was like to be an inmate for a night at the 130-year-old prison, which moved its inmates to new prisons.\n\nBesides dealing with mosquitoes, cockroaches and agonising boredom, he also had to use the bucket system - twice. He slept just two hours.\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nIs Your Used Car a Hidden Goldmine?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/15d7e1d7d7ab6cdf31b8825896f22b34ee13f2b259e7b39379d34886233f2793/np_20161130_begging_784103.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "BEGGING: Mr Herbert Fernandez “begging” on the streets of Singapore.

It is not known when he started his stint and when he was supposed to come back.\n\nThe NTU School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering student was supposed to return to the Czech Republic the next day when tragedy struck.\n\nStrong winds blew down a tree and it landed on his car.\n\nIn an e-mail to students, NTU president Bertil Andersson said the tree hit Mr Tan's head. Rescue crew found him unconscious and he was rushed to a hospital.\n\nIn the e-mail, Professor Andersson said: \"He did not regain consciousness in hospital. Accompanied by Professor Ooi Kim Tiow, the associate chair of the school, his parents and brother flew over to be by his side last Wednesday.\"\n\nYesterday, NTU said in a media statement that doctors certified him brain dead before he died last Friday.\n\nIn the statement, Prof Andersson said: \"Justin is lovingly remembered by all who knew him, not just for being a good student, but also as a fine sportsman.\n\n\"NTU is doing all we can to assist and support Justin's family and his schoolmates to help them cope with the emotional impact of this tragedy.\"\n\nATHLETE\n\nMr Tan was a national youth athlete who represented Singapore in youth sport climbing championships in 2011 and 2012, reported The Straits Times Online.\n\nLianhe Wanbao reported that Mr Tan's mother had returned to Singapore with her other son on Monday because of the teenager's national service commitment. Her husband is still in the Czech Republic.\n\nShe told Lianhe Wanbao: \"I actually have two sons, but now, I am left with only one.\"\n\nOne of Mr Tan's friends told The New Paper that she was shocked by his death. The 23-year-old, who asked not to be named, said she had known him for six years.\n\nThey were supposed to meet in July for a meal but she could not make it at the last minute.\n\nRegretting her decision, she said: \"I have learnt to treasure those around me more. I will never ever back out at the last minute to meet someone again. I wish I had the chance to meet Justin for dinner.\"\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\naccident\n\neurope\n\nNanyang Technological University\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 2, 2025, 04:45am\n\nCaught naked in car: Man hurt after confronting wife's alleged lover in Sengkang carpark\n\nJun 25, 2025, 08:03am\n\nBoy, 9, loses kidney after falling from monkey bars at Bukit Batok playground\n\nJan 21, 2025, 02:14am\n\nFormer Mat Yoyo host 'Bobo' injured in motorcycle accident\n\nJan 15, 2025, 07:37am\n\nIndonesia firefighters save the day - and a nose\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/eb79bea748ba1ebd194a06ef7bb9767bd5bb3d437a700e528141000b79a17f1f/NP_20161130_SQTREE30-6Q6_1454788.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "\"I actually have two sons, but now, I am left with only one.\" - Mother of Mr Justin Tan, who died after a tree landed on his car in a storm (above) and hit his head", "caption": "\"I actually have two sons, but now, I am left with only one.\" - Mother of Mr Justin Tan, who died after a tree landed on his car in a storm (above) and hit his head PHOTO: WWW.PLUSKA.SK"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/693d223217619cbf376aafa880563878e891857d459fae0058f5822965f43a5f/TNPKV44.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "77-year-old petrol station worker dies after being hit by reversing car at Geylang Esso", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/75220338cc14dcc8a4dff4b324ee901810d68a6153ba9342c8552436568a10d9/NP_20161130_SQTREE30-64Y_1454795.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e2b05887bca83b16d7d9be46e34fb80087abb23d9bd65c02a85f9df3811529a9/TNPKV33.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Caught naked in car: Man hurt after confronting wife's alleged lover in Sengkang carpark", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

(See report, below.).\n\n\"I will be funny in December,\" director Judd Apatow, 48, tweeted. \"For now, I am more concerned with not electing a madman who incites violence and racism.\"\n\nActor Bryan Cranston, 60, who does a pretty good Trump impression himself, told podcast The Bestseller Experiment that if Mr Trump wins, he would \"definitely move\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 24, 2024, 08:48am\n\nJackie Chan returns to Hollywood with new version of The Karate Kid\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe said: \"It's not real to me that that would happen. I hope to God it won't.\"\n\nEchoing his sentiment is actress Cobie Smulders, who, when asked by The New Paper in a phone interview last month which presidential candidate she supported, confirmed she would back Mrs Clinton\n\n\"Of course I hope Hillary wins, because I just don't know what I will do if she doesn't. I can't even believe we're having this conversation,\" the 34-year-old Jack Reacher: Never Go Back star said.\n\nMr Trump could also jeopardise Hollywood's biggest overseas market: China.\n\nHe has vowed to \"beat China\" in the economic stakes, and throughout his electoral campaign, he has accused China of stealing American manufacturing jobs.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention in July, Mr Trump called the US' support for China's embrace of free trade a \"colossal mistake\".\n\nChina's box office was worth US$6.78 billion (S$9 billion) last year and the country is expected to overtake the US as the world's biggest movie market next year.\n\nHollywood has been catering to the Chinese market for years, casting Chinese stars like Angelababy, Fan Bingbing and Li Bingbing to draw Chinese viewers.\n\nChinese companies have also poured millions into Hollywood, with stakes in film companies such as Legendary Entertainment (Pacific Rim) and Lions Gate Entertainment (The Hunger Games).\n\nIf Mr Trump wins, and embitters relations with China, it could endanger Hollywood's Chinese box-office earnings.\n\nLast month, Mr Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which he earned in 2008 for his reality show The Apprentice, was smashed with a sledgehammer and pickaxe by an angry vandal.\n\nIt seems appropriate, given Mr Trump's fall from favour in Hollywood.\n\nOne moment he was a celebrated reality TV host and the next, he was the bogeyman feared for inciting racism and for his misogyny and xenophobic views.\n\nCranston believes the current political state of affairs will continue to provide fodder for artists everywhere.\n\n\"There'll be books written. There'll be movies made,\" he told USA Today.\n\n\"There will be theatrical productions about Donald Trump because of the anomaly that he presented.\"\n\n\"Of course I hope Hillary wins, because I just don't know what I will do if she doesn't. I can't even believe we're having this conversation.\"\n\n- Actress Cobie Smulders\n\nCelebs vs Trump\n\nBy\n\nLisa Twang\n\nRead articles by Lisa Twang\n\nWith the US presidential election around the corner, Hollywood celebrities are working hard to make their voices heard -- and that includes having a field day with their anti-Donald Trump videos.\n\nHere are three of our top picks...\n\nSNL TAKES ON THE TRUMP TAPE\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nAlec Baldwin got rave reviews for his portrayal of Mr Trump on episodes of Saturday Night Live, and for good reason. Baldwin nailed his impression of Trump in the NBC sketch comedy show, which saw Kate McKinnon play Mrs Clinton.\n\nIn this episode, released a day after a 2005 recording of Mr Trump making lewd comments about women surfaced, Cecily Strongplays CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin, who questions Baldwin's Trump.\n\nAs Mr Trump, Baldwin jokes that the damning conversation took place 11 years ago, \"back when I was a young, childish 59-year-old man\".\n\nWhile many Americans were amused, Mr Trump criticised Baldwin's performance on Twitter, calling for an end to the show.\n\n\"Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!\" he wrote.\n\nIMPORTANT (SAVE THE DAY. VOTE)\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nThe Avengers director Joss Whedon assembled a \"tonne of famous people\" for his public service announcement urging Americans to vote in the election.\n\nStars such as Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo, James Franco, Julianne Moore and Neil Patrick Harrislent their support to this tongue-in-cheek video.\n\nAlthough Mr Trump is not named, actor Don Cheadledescribes him as a \"racist abusive coward who could permanently damage the fabric of our society\".\n\nThe stars also joke about getting Ruffalo to do a nude scene in his next movie to encourage viewers to vote.\n\nWILL.I.AM FEAT APL.DE.AP AND LIANE V - GRAB'M BY THE P****Y\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nUsing Mr Trump's infamous sexist line about women as the title for this parody song, The Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am dons a blond wig in the most unconvincing Trump impersonation ever.\n\nDespite the lack of physical resemblance to Mr Trump, will.i.am roasts the Republican presidential candidate in this catchy tune.\n\n\"Got the KKK supporting me/ And the black community,\" says will.i.am as Mr Trump.\n\nHe also mocks Mr Trump's inability to answer questions about the Syrian crisis and war in Afghanistan.\n\nThe video concludes with will.i.am appearing as himself, asking viewers to vote for Mrs Clinton.\n\n\"Donald Trump does not look like the President of the United States of America, nor should he be,\" he says.\n\n\"If this was a TV show, maybe I would watch it, it would be pretty funny...

(See report below.)\n\nThe women bought over the business at Block 527, Bedok North Street 3, two months ago with the help of their fathers.\n\nMiss Indah said that donating a sizeable chunk of their week-long revenue would hit their take-home income, but both of them shrugged it off.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 30, 2025, 09:34am\n\n'It was never smooth sailing': Dog welfare group ex-president reflects on 13 years at the helm\n\nMore related stories\n\nMiss Jannah told The New Paper: \"We thought 30 per cent was a good number. If you want to help, it has to be a substantial amount, even if it hurts a little.\"\n\nMiss Indah said: \"Well, businesses come with risks, right?\"\n\nMiss Indah Nabielah Zulkarnain TNP PHOTOS: AHMAD FARUQ ROZALI\n\nOnly their income will be affected as their staff of two chefs and three part-time waiters will continue to draw their full wages.\n\nMiss Jannah, an RMIT University business management graduate, said: \"It would demoralise them otherwise. So we both decided we would make the sacrifice so Akid can benefit from it.\"\n\nThey estimate that they will lose about 15 to 20 per cent of their take-home income for that week.\n\nIt's their way of giving back, they said.\n\nVOLUNTEER WORK\n\nMiss Indah, a life sciences graduate, became involved in fund-raising activities while studying at the National University of Singapore.\n\nHer experience in volunteering at an orphanage in Indonesia five years ago also played a part in making her want to help Akid.\n\n\"Five years later, the children (at the orphanage) are still messaging me on Facebook, asking me when I'm returning to visit. The fact that these kids remember us means that they treasure every little bit we do, even if we didn't do much,\" she said.\n\nAgreeing, Miss Jannah said: \"My parents told me, 'You don't need money to be nice'.\n\n\"(Indah) didn't have to fork out a million dollars to have the kids remember her. It's just the things we do that matter.\"\n\nMiss Jannah's path to volunteering was more personal.\n\nA decade ago, she was a beneficiary of a South East Community Development Programme financial aid programme.\n\nHer mother, who has fought thyroid cancer for close to two decades, was also a source of inspiration.\n\n\"She never saw her condition as something to hold her back. She still gave back by volunteering on weekends,\" Miss Jannah said.\n\nShe plans to ask her musician father, Mr Saharuddin Jalil, to invite some bands to perform at the restaurant next week in the hope of attracting more customers.\n\nAsked if they are worried about coping with the expected crowd, Miss Indah said with a smile: \"That will be a good problem.\"\n\nOther companies which give back\n\nBy\n\nFoo Jie Ying\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Foo Jie Ying\n\nOn New Year's Day this year, Neo Garden Catering donated all its takings to charity.\n\nCalled \"Begin with Love\", the one-day charity drive is an annual event.\n\nThe catering arm of the Neo Group raised more than $160,000 for six beneficiaries this year, said group chairman and chief executive Neo Kah Kiat.\n\nHe told The New Paper: \"A good year begins with a good start. By making this a yearly initiative, we want to start each new year by doing good, contributing back to society positively, and remembering that while we immerse ourselves in the festivities, it is also important to remember the less fortunate.\n\n\"As we continue to give back to our community through the 'Begin With Love' initiative, we hope to inspire more companies to follow suit because every bit counts when it comes to giving.\"\n\nThe BreadTalk Group, which owns bakery BreadTalk and restaurants such as Din Tai Fung and Carl's Jr, have given back to society in more ways than one.\n\nAfter the 2004 tsunami, Breadtalk donated 90 cents to the Singapore Red Cross Society for every bun sold at $2.30.\n\nOther initiatives by the BreadTalk Group include a waste compost project with OCBC Bank and Yu Neng Primary School to turn cake waste from the central kitchen into fertiliser or compost for plants.\n\nA spokesman said: \"At BreadTalk, we are very committed to the mantra of giving back to society. So committed are we that every staff member at the HQ is encouraged to contribute to corporate social responsibility.\n\n\"Each HQ staff member is given one day off a year so that they can volunteer for a cause they feel passionate about.\"\n\nSound therapy has made autistic boy 'calmer'\n\nBy\n\nFoo Jie Ying\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Foo Jie Ying\n\nMr Muhammad Ridzuan Raman, 40, was surprised when he learnt of a charity drive for his son Akid.\n\nWestern food restaurant T Bob's Corner will be donating 30 per cent of its takings from Oct 18 to 23 to Akid.\n\n\"I'm honoured and touched by their actions. But I know I can't expect people to donate money to me,\" the driver, who had previously held a fund-raising campaign for his son, told The New Paper yesterday.\n\nAkid, 11, was diagnosed with autism five years ago.\n\nIn February, TNP reported  (report here) about Akid's condition, and how he turned aggressive at the beginning of this year.\n\nHe would break windows or doors, and run away from home.\n\nSTRAPPED TO BED\n\nAt the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), he had to be strapped to the hospital bed whenever he turned violent to prevent him from harming himself and others.\n\nSUPPORT: T Bob's Corner restaurant's Miss Indah Nabielah Zulkarnain and local musician Saharuddin Jalil (standing) are helping to raise funds for Mr Muhammad Ridzuan Raman (seated) and his son Akid. PHOTO: BERITA HARIAN\n\nThe boy also deliberately pulled out two of his own teeth. He would also punch or bite if he did not get what he wanted.\n\nIn a phone interview yesterday, Mr Ridzuan, who has two other sons, aged 12 and nine, and a daughter aged 10, said that Akid had been admitted to IMH four times between August last year and June this year.\n\nHis condition improved only two months ago after he went for sound therapy - the use of music to improve an autistic child's communication and behaviour, among other things.\n\n\"He has become calmer. There's no more agitation. He's no longer restless, and is a bit more cheerful. I hear laughter here and there,\" his father said.\n\n\"It'll be great if he can rely on therapy instead of medication.\"\n\nTHE NEW PAPER, FEB 25\n\nMr Ridzuan hopes to send Akid for another therapy session but is worried about the cost.\n\nA four-day programme will set him back by $2,200.\n\nMr Ridzuan earns only $1,400 a month as a driver. He is not on any financial assistance, and his children have stopped receiving help from a family service centre for their education needs, he said.\n\nHe is now trying to apply for financial assistance for his children through their school.\n\n\"My priority is to get Akid better before I worry about everything else,\" he said.\n\nI'm honoured and touched by their actions. But I know I can't expect people to donate money to me.\n\n- Mr Muhammad Ridzuan Raman (above), father of Akid, who was diagnosed with autism five years ago\n\nBy\n\nFoo Jie Ying\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Foo Jie Ying\n\ncharity\n\nfood\n\nautism\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 21, 2024, 11:26pm\n\n'Everyone can give' during Great Singapore Give\n\nOct 9, 2024, 07:22am\n\nRonan Keating helps raise millions for S'pore charities\n\nAug 7, 2024, 05:57am\n\nRichard Marx to headline Dementia Singapore charity concert\n\nJul 4, 2024, 03:35am\n\nMan rescues elderly friend trapped in cluttered flat\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - How SMEs Can Optimize Cash Flow & Financial Stability\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/90947d30012e752256439d0aa5468391b2493619f0e8fdad14ef318fb453e719/jikid15.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS: Miss Nurul Jannah Saharuddin", "caption": "YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS: Miss Nurul Jannah Saharuddin TNP PHOTO: AHMAD FARUQ ROZALI"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/44c60983edd81718ff843e6dd24e3fce3b3ea02d60f811ba969ba5c280d7bf80/drsiew_0.png?w=150", "alt_text": "'It was never smooth sailing': Dog welfare group ex-president reflects on 13 years at the helm", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b62e6fbdcdf26e2ee3d795c2eb14cbdedf4692e6cccbc14438e88e1284289965/NP_20161015_JIKID15-6NN_1412845.jpg?w=620", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3cdf850264c861afa85b80a23bc0c35580b02c98792cdd23e3a896faea3402e5/np_20161015_jikid15-96d_1412842.jpg?w=620", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b73faca9a3fb213ca756f040487b9c80227afede665016ee682759d8f1f393a5/np_20161015_jikid15_14129912.jpg?w=283", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0171d4aec596e179f6f4fc1b15d86375de6fece5ac6f793d941b1fb0e420d106/np_20161015_jikid15-n1b_14128442.jpg?w=288", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6c5736b59e553dac937e7fc91923f7a986236825c04d19e4c19bfac073f4bfdb/screenshot_2024-11-22_at_7.18.59_am.png?w=318", "alt_text": "'Everyone can give' during Great Singapore Give", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

E-scooter community leader says: He must be punished\n\nShare this article\n\nThe three-lane Mandai Road is usually occupied by buses, cars and heavy vehicles.\n\nIt is no place for a small but powerful electric scooter (e-scooter) - which is not allowed on the roads anyway.\n\nBut an e-scooter rider not only blatantly ignored the rule by riding on Mandai Road in heavy morning traffic, he also, at one point, flirted with injury, perhaps even death, by cutting out into the middle lane to overtake a bus.\n\nHis bold, and foolhardy, act was captured by the camera phone of the front passenger in a car travelling behind the e-scooter at around 8am on Thursday.\n\nThe rider, who was carrying a backpack and wearing a helmet and gloves, initially travelled on the left-most lane of the road. The road has a speed limit of 70kmh.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 15, 2023, 06:06am\n\nWoman accuses Grab driver of speeding, drink driving\n\nMore related stories\n\nAt one point, the camera panned to the speedometer of the car, which shows it was travelling at just under 70kmh. The driver pointed to the speedometer and said, \"Power,\" referring to the e-scooter ahead.\n\nOVERTAKES BUS\n\nAs the e-scooter gained on the SMRT bus service 171, one of them commented: \"Let's see how he overtakes the bus.\"\n\nAs if on cue, the rider sped up to overtake the bus. When he was alongside the bus, a taxi could be seen travelling behind him in the middle lane.\n\nAll it would take for tragedy to strike would be for the bus to veer slightly to its right, or for the rider to slip and fall.\n\nFortunately, this did not happen, and as the rider cut in front of the bus to return to the edge of the road, someone in the car laughed and exclaimed: \"Steady, lah!\"\n\nThe video, which was posted on citizen journalism website Stomp on Thursday, has gone viral, with more than 80,000 views.\n\nIt was fiercely debated on Big Wheel Scooters Singapore (BWSS), a community of e-scooter enthusiasts who were upset and concerned that the rider was giving them a bad name.\n\nA BWSS member wrote: \"These sort of idiots get no sympathy from me if/when they get mauled by other vehicles.\"\n\nBWSS chairman Denis Koh told The New Paper yesterday that \"black sheep\" such as the e-scooter rider in the video must be punished.\n\nHe said: \"I strongly believe that education plays an important role, but stern action must be dished out swiftly in order to cultivate proper etiquette and to preserve safety for users and other stakeholders sharing the path.\"\n\nMr Koh, who is also a member of the Active Mobility Advisory Panel, added that the BWSS Facebook page, which has more than 10,000 members, will now forbid any post related to speeding or illegal modifications to make e-scooters go faster. (\n\nSee report\n\n)\n\nIt was announced in Parliament in March that personal mobility devices (PMD) such as e-scooters will be allowed on footpaths, cycling paths and shared paths, but not roads, at the end of the year.\n\nE-scooters are allowed to travel below 15kmh on footpaths and below 25kmh on bicycle or shared paths.\n\nThese guidelines were reiterated by the police and Land Transport Authority (LTA) when The Straits Times sought more information on Thursday's incident.\n\nTNP understands that current legislation, if strictly interpreted, forbids the use of PMDs on any LTA roads, pavements or park connectors, and allows them to be ridden only on private premises.\n\nAPPROACH\n\nThe authorities have largely adopted a soft-touch approach on this, though some e-scooter riders have said they were fined for riding on park connectors or footpaths.\n\nThe Mandai Road rider's reckless behaviour comes less than a week after a 53-year-old woman was hit by an e-scooter on a footpath and is now on life support in hospital. (See report at far right.)\n\nThe accident sparked calls, particularly from pedestrians, for e-scooters to be banned on footpaths.\n\nMr Alex Chua, 29, a trade finance operation executive who has been commuting to work daily on his e-scooter, said he was berated by a pedestrian yesterday.\n\nHe said: \"I can understand why they are angry about us riding on the pavement due to many reckless riders. We sometimes use the pavement as pedestrians, too, so we understand their worry.\"\n\nMr Chua, who owns the same model of e-scooter used by the reckless rider on Mandai Road, added: \"Not all riders are disciplined like me.\n\n\"It all depends on the rider's obligation to the safety of others. Even a kick scooter can kill someone.\"\n\nFast e-scooters not rare - but dangerous\n\nBy\n\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Zaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nAn e-scooter achieving speeds of up to 70kmh like the one in the video clip shot along Mandai Road.\n\nUnusual?\n\nNot if you ask owner Norman Lee of motorcycle workshop Race Werks.\n\nOut of curiosity, Mr Lee hooked up a customer's $900 e-scooter onto the workshop's eddy current dynamometer in early August.\n\nThe machine, which measures a motorbike's horsepower, speed and acceleration, gave a reading of 59kmh while the e-scooter's speedometer showed 67kmh.\n\nMr Lee, 36, who showed The New Paper a video clip of the dyno test, said: \"The way the e-scooter picked up speed from 0 to 50kmh was like a 70 or 80cc motorcycle.\n\n\"Despite a simulated load of 80kg, it still managed 59kmh.\n\n\"In the wrong hands, especially those without training, this can be dangerous.\"\n\nBut there are sellers online who tout e-scooters capable of speeds between 45kmh and 60kmh, said business development manager Chew Boon Hur of Mobat, a local brand of e-scooters assembled in China.\n\n\"We dictate the specifications of our e-scooters to our partners in China because we're concerned for rider safety,\" he said.\n\nLike Mr Lee, Mr Chew was aware of the clip showing the e-scooter rider overtaking a bus along Mandai Road.\n\nMr Chew said: \"Any speeds above 25kmh can make it hard for a rider to control the e-scooter in an emergency.\"\n\nMr Lee said more awareness is needed to discourage people from modifying e-scooters to go faster even when there are hobbyists on social media who provide \"tuning\" services.\n\nBut when you add more power and speed to the equation, you risk getting hurt, Mr Lee said.\n\nLIMITED\n\n\"E-scooters are not meant to go as fast as motorcycles because they have limited suspension travel and inadequate brakes to deal with high-speed braking,\" said Mr Lee.\n\n\"The worst case scenario when you jam the brakes (on an e-scooter) is you'll lose traction and crash.\"\n\nMr Ronald Tay of scootersg.com believes that most e-scooter riders are law-abiding.\n\nIn his opinion, educating new riders on safety and engaging customers just before they buy e-scooters are every dealer's responsibility.\n\n\"I'm not going to sell a 20kg machine (e-scooter) to a 40kg girl,\" said Mr Tay.\n\n\"I will spend 20 minutes with each customer to select a suitable e-scooter for his or her needs.\"\n\nGROUP: E-scooter riders at Pasir Ris Drive 3.\n\nHousewife still unconscious, family not giving up\n\nBy\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\nHer chances of recovery remain slim, but her family is not giving up.\n\nThe family of the housewife who was knocked down by an e-scooter in Pasir Ris last Saturday has decided to keep her on life support.\n\nMadam Ang Liu Kiow, 53, is still unconscious in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Changi General Hospital (CGH) after a 17-year-old on an e-scooter crashed into her a week ago.\n\nHer son, Mr Wilson Leong, 22, a student, told The New Paper yesterday that his mother is no longer under sedation.\n\nHe said: \"We can see some movement with her eyes and hands, but whether it's a reflex or conscious reaction, we don't know.\n\n\"Doctors say the chances of her waking up are slim.\"\n\nVIDEO\n\nMr Leong has seen the video uploaded on Stomp of an e-scooter overtaking a bus in Mandai Road.\n\nHe said the incident is different from his mother's accident, but he felt strongly that enforcement action must taken against users of personal mobility devices who blatantly disregard the law.\n\n\"Such devices are only going to get more trendy,\" he said.\n\n\"This guy was travelling at 70kmh.

Hello, Bradxit.\n\nAs the world continues to reel over the shocking news of US actress Angelina Jolie filing for divorce from US actor Brad Pitt after a 12-year romance (including two years of marriage), a plethora of theories from various sources have emerged, attempting to answer all our burning questions.\n\nIn her court documents dated Sept 15, Jolie, 41, cited irreconcilable differences for their split.\n\nAnd in separate statements to the media, both parties have asked for privacy, with Pitt, 52, adding: \"I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the well-being of our kids. I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time.\"\n\nHollywood's erstwhile golden couple have six children, three of whom are adopted (Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, and Zahara, 11) and three biological (Shiloh, 10, and eight-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne).\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:05am\n\nFewer marriages and births in Singapore in 2024: MSF\n\nMore related stories\n\nReactions to the divorce came fast and furious, with many pointing a finger at Pitt, since Jolie was the one who initiated the break-up.\n\nHer intention to have full physical custody of their six children, with visitation rights for Pitt, only adds to the unflattering picture being painted of him.\n\nHer shock move allegedly blindsided Pitt, who is apparently \"furious\" at the unnecessary fallout.\n\nGossip website TMZ cited sources saying that he has blasted Jolie for \"unleashing hell\" and the media storm that will inevitably follow.\n\nPitt's ex-wife, US actress Jennifer Aniston, 47, has reportedly commented that the failed marriage is \"karma\", according to Us Weekly, as Pitt famously left Aniston for Jolie in 2005.\n\nSo what are the theories floating around about this year's most shocking celebrity break-up?\n\nTheory #1\n\nPARENTING CLASHES\n\nA source told People magazine that Brangelina \"always had disagreements when it came to disciplining the kids\".\n\nPitt is the \"stricter\" one, insisting on \"more structure\" and \"having rules\", while Jolie adopts a more laissez-faire approach. He was also known to \"get frustrated sometimes and yell at the kids\".\n\nThere is no doubt that Jolie loves playing mum, a role she excelled at even before Pitt came into the picture.\n\nShe was a single mother to Maddox, who was adopted in 2002, three months after Jolie split from her second husband, US actor Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nHowever, even if the pair don't see eye to eye when it comes to parenting styles, both were co-parents for 10 years before they exchanged vows (which they admitted was at their children's insistence) and their brood has always been the focus of their union.\n\nSo this theory is a bit far-fetched. Arguments over who does what are common, but never to the extent of being the chief cause of a divorce.\n\nTheory #2\n\nTHIRD PARTY\n\nRumours are circulating that Pitt allegedly had an affair with French actress Marion Cotillard, 40, his co-star in the upcoming war romance Allied, and that Jolie hired a private investigator to watch him, according to New York Post's Page Six.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nA source said: \"He's in the throes of a midlife crisis, and Angie is fed up.\"\n\nPossibly adding fuel to the fire is that the movie's trailer, showing them getting hot and heavy as on-screen lovers, was released mere hours after the divorce news.\n\nBut the \"other woman\" theory was quickly debunked.\n\n\"Marion had nothing to do with it,\" a source told Us Weekly, while another insider added that Jolie did not hire a private eye.\n\nAnother source close to Cotillard told The Daily Mirror that she's \"absolutely devastated\" after being fingered as the third party, as she is \"blissfully happy\" with her long-time partner, French actor and director Guillaume Canet, with whom she has a five-year-old son.\n\nTheory #3\n\nANGER & DRUG ISSUES\n\nTMZ cited sources who claimed that Pitt has \"an anger problem\" that has become \"dangerous for the children\", and that Jolie was \"fed up\" with his weed habit as well as his drinking, the combination of which created an unsafe environment.\n\nThis theory sounds more likely, as Jolie's lawyer said the filing was solely \"for the health of the family\".\n\nPitt has publicly discussed his lifelong battle with marijuana, though he told Esquire in 2013 that he gave up drugs to have a family.\n\nCould he have suffered a relapse?\n\nThis is a likely scenario.\n\nA source told Us Weekly that \"an incident took place and prompted (her) to act and file\", adding that it was one that \"affected the entire family\".\n\nJolie made the final decision to divorce only one week ago, not long after they had celebrated their second wedding anniversary, in August.\n\nThe source said\" \"She still says Brad is the love of her life, and the decision has weighed heavy on her heart. Her priority now is the children.\"\n\nTheory #4\n\nDRIFTING APART\n\nThis is actually the most mundane, yet common, reason for any couple - famous or not - to call it quits.\n\nEspecially when being together for 12 years is like an eternity in Hollywood.\n\nPeople reported that both \"have spent more time apart this year\" due to their individual endeavours.\n\nJolie has been busy with her United Nations work and her next directorial effort, First They Killed My Father: A Daughter Of Cambodia Remembers.\n\nPitt is tied up with several movie productions, including a sequel to his 2013 blockbuster hit World War Z.\n\nTheir last project together was last year's By The Sea (above), also written and directed by Jolie, which could have inadvertently taken a toll on their marriage.\n\nThe drama about an estranged couple trying to repair their damaged marriage raised eyebrows back then, with many speculating the movie was somewhat autobiographical.\n\nAlthough Jolie dismissed the idea in a 2015 interview with The Telegraph, during which she admitted to having \"fights and problems like any other couple\", it is sadly hard not to read it that way now.\n\nBrangelina: A 12-year relationship timeline\n\nBy\n\nJoanne Soh\n\nRead articles by Joanne Soh\n\nSummer of 2004\n\nThe Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie 2005 action thriller Mr. & Mrs. Smith starts filming.

I feel very sorry then. That's a sad story and unfortunate for a family. That's the first I've heard of it.\"\n\nClooney has been close to Pitt ever since they worked on the 2001 heist film Ocean's Eleven.\n\nThe couple's own family members were taken aback at the sudden split.\n\nJolie's estranged father Jon Voight (above) told Inside Edition that he heard the news from his son and Jolie's brother James Haven.\n\n\"I am concerned for Angie and the children, and hopefully I will be seeing them very soon,\" said the 77-year-old US actor.\n\n\"It's very sad. Something very serious must have happened for Angie to make a decision like this.\"\n\nBritish singer-songwriter Adele  was also rocked by the news and she went to the extent of dedicating the second night of her six-night concert at New York's Madison Square Garden to Brangelina.\n\nA few songs into her show, the 28-year-old asked the audience if she could \"address the elephant in the room\", then saying that news of the divorce marks \"the end of an era\".\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nAccording to fans who posted on Twitter, Adele, whose hit 2011 album 21 was largely about her own personal heartbreak, led everyone \"in a group Brangelina break-up therapy session\".\n\nBy\n\nJoanne Soh\n\nRead articles by Joanne Soh\n\nmarriage\n\ndivorce\n\nCelebrities\n\nBrad Pitt\n\nangelina jolie\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:02am\n\nActress Tay Ying and celebrity chef Wu Sihan hold guo da li ceremony\n\nApr 14, 2025, 04:15am\n\nROM, ROMM to begin Saturday solemnisations at Esplanade Mall interim site\n\nMar 28, 2025, 05:11am\n\nHow to survive renovation: Top tips from SGAG's Xiao Ming and his wife\n\nMar 23, 2025, 12:00am\n\n'I needed to protect her against dark thoughts': Father of 5, whose wife had postnatal depression\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/46eebbee546f84528b0b93376de58ac45125ab027a829f7bc0833fe848f1f133/02614fc0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the drama By The Sea, which revolves around an estranged couple trying to repair their damaged marriage.", "caption": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the drama By The Sea, which revolves around an estranged couple trying to repair their damaged marriage.

By the time the school found out, the trainee teacher had come into contact with about 30 students and five staff members, putting them at risk of contracting TB.\n\nAfter being informed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) of her condition, the school decided to release her from her contract.\n\nThis is the second reported case of a pre-school teacher being diagnosed with TB this month.\n\nLast week, The New Paper had reported that a teacher at Little Greenhouse pre-school in Bukit Batok had been diagnosed with TB.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 24, 2022, 02:21pm\n\nOver 150 positive for TB in Jalan Bukit Merah; MOH extends screening\n\nMore related stories\n\nAt least 80 pre-schoolers had to be screened for the disease last Wednesday, and 24 more children were screened last Friday.\n\nIn the latest incident, a teacher at Bridges Montessori pre-school in Punggol was affected.\n\nThe principal of the pre-school, Ms Jen Chng, told TNP that the teacher had gone through training at the Montessori pre-school for two weeks before she started her teaching duties.\n\nMs Chng said the school hired the 29-year-old teacher from the Philippines sometime in July, and she was only there for a month.\n\n\"The school has taken action to terminate her. We believe that she withheld information from the school,\" said Ms Chng.\n\nMs Chng said the teacher had worked in Singapore before and had also worked elsewhere, like Dubai.\n\nShe added the school hired her after she cleared her medical check-up, which declared her medically fit.\n\nHowever, they overlooked a clause in the report which stated the teacher might not be free from active TB.\n\nIt is not known why the teacher was certified medically fit despite the clause.\n\nA senior teacher at the school, known as Ms Ria, who spoke to TNP with Ms Chng, admitted they had overlooked it.\n\n\"The report said that she was fit, so naturally we took it as that,\" she said.\n\n\"She also didn't show any symptoms of being ill.\"\n\nThe students at Bridges Montessori pre-school range from 1½ years old to about seven years old.\n\nThe teacher was also attending follow-up check-ups at the time because of complications with her X-ray.\n\nMs Chng said it was only when they received a call from the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Aug 12 informing them of the teacher's condition that they confronted her.\n\nShe said the teacher told them that she was given a medical certificate at one of the check-ups here by a doctor, who told her she had TB.\n\nBut she had not informed the school, Ms Chng said.\n\nINFORMED\n\nThe school informed parents about the incident on Aug 13, and let the teacher go shortly after.\n\nMs Chng added: \"We got MOH to come down and get tests done here.\n\n\"The screening was done on Tuesday (Aug 23), and results will be out soon.\"\n\nMs Irene Toh, the director of the pre-school, told TNP yesterday the results of the screening, released last Friday, were confidential, but that some children had tested positive for TB.\n\n\"Their parents shared with us that they came back positive, but these were latent,\" she said.\n\nMs Toh also clarified that the teacher was released from her contract by \"mutual understanding\".\n\n\"We can't terminate someone because they are sick,\" she said.\n\n\"She said she wanted to go home to be with her family for support.\"\n\nMs Toh said the teacher did not want to return to the school because \"she would feel awkward, and she can't face the children and the parents\".\n\nShe met the teacher on Aug 16 after being informed by MOH of her diagnosis.\n\n\"I was very concerned. She is a foreigner and alone here. I passed her some money to help with her finances because her flight ticket and medication are not cheap.\"\n\nMs Toh also said they are following directives from the authorities. Ms Chng told TNP last week that the school had taken the necessary actions, including sanitising the school.\n\nBut a parent of a child in the school, who contacted TNP about the incident, said she was not convinced, and was upset with how it was handled.\n\nDeclining to be named, she said: \"I think there is a problem with protocol. It has now put so many kids and their families at risk.\n\n\"The school should have closed, at least until the screening is completed.\"\n\nThe Early Childhood Development Agency said there have been three reported cases of TB at childcare centres this year. (See report above.)\n\nCaused by the bacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis, TB mostly affects the lungs. Symptoms include persistent coughing, fever and loss of weight and appetite.\n\nCall them happy\n\nChen Diya (left) and Carrie Yeo of The Freshman. PHOTO: LIKES COMMUNICATIONS\n\nRiding on the popularity of their latest hit, Mandopop duo The Freshman, made up of Project SuperStar 2 alumni Chen Diya and Carrie Yeo, released a \"Singlish\" version titled Call Me (Not Maybe) last week.\n\nThe Mandarin original, Remember To Ask Me Out When You're Free, was penned for local director Royston Tan's latest telemovie The Provision Shop, which premiered on Channel 8 last month.\n\nThe theme song was so well-received that even Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong shared and praised it on Facebook.\n\nIn a joint phone interview from Kuala Lumpur, where they were promoting their latest album Growing Up, Chen, 30, told TNP: \"It was a very spontaneous decision to record a Singlish version. We were actually at Carrie's house signing autographs for our albums when we wrote the lyrics.\n\n\"A lot of people commented that they wanted an English version, so we decided to do it for fun.\"\n\nIt took the pair 1½ hours to complete the lyrics, and four takes of the live recording session and music video.\n\nOUT OF LOVE\n\nChen said: \"We took this opportunity to express our love for Singapore and we really did it out of love. We wanted to use this song to connect to people as well.\"\n\nYeo, 34, said: \"It makes us very happy when people share the video and caption it with our lyrics.\"\n\nAnd, yes, the title Call Me (Not Maybe) was inspired by Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen's 2011 monster hit Call Me Maybe.\n\nChen said: \"It's meant to be a punny thing, we hope that young people will understand the reference.\"\n\nThe Freshman have felt overwhelmed, flattered, blessed and proud of the song, a \"fun and casual\" project that has ended up attracting more than 480,000 views and close to 10,000 shares on Facebook.\n\nIt has more than 14,000 views on YouTube.\n\nChen said: \"It was crazy to see it go viral. We felt connected with the masses for the first time and the feeling is indescribable.\"\n\nYeo said: \"We noticed a pretty significant climb (in likes) on our Facebook page after we posted the video.\"\n\nIt is also their first attempt at writing a patriotic song.\n\nChen joked: \"We are not very opportunistic in the sense that we are not savvy enough to use social media for our own benefit.\n\n\"It has to be a natural thing, we must have the 'feel' to do it.\"\n\nOlinda's family, friends in her new MV\n\nSingapore Idol alumnus Olinda Cho has been known to wear her heart on her sleeve when it comes to her love for Singapore, but she is finally officially putting her patriotism into music.\n\nShe was approached by StarHub in June to help with the musical arrangement for the company's Majulah Moms music video after seeing her rendition of national anthem Majulah Singapura, which she posted on YouTube two years ago.\n\nThe 36-year-old was tasked to record her part and sing the original Majulah Singapura, as well as her own rendition.\n\nThese recordings were used as a guide for the 51 mums in the MV.\n\nALL SMILES: Singapore Idol alumnus Olinda Cho invited her friends and family to sing her original song, My Singapore. PHOTOS: YOUTUBE/OLINDA CHO\n\nCho, who is single, joked to TNP: \"I wasn't in the video because I'm not a mum. I asked (StarHub) to put me in it, but they said, 'Oli, do you have a kid? If you have, then we can definitely put you in'.\"\n\nORIGINAL SONG\n\nLast week, she released her own original song titled My Singapore,for Singapore's 51st birthday.\n\nIt was written and composed by Cho and her younger brother Yu Wang, 31, and it has had more than 2,000 views on YouTube.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nCho said: \"We originally wrote it for Singapore's 50th birthday, but I didn't want it to get lost among the 50,000 songs that everybody would be writing, so I waited and decided to keep it for this year.\n\n\"I wanted to make this present better by getting all my friends whom I've met along my musical journey, from (local reality TV singing competitions) Singapore Idol to Sing! China.\"\n\nFeatured vocals in the MV include Singapore Idol alumni Sylvester Sim and Daphne Khoo, former actress and host Jaime Teo, host Rebecca Tan and contestants from the Sing! China Singapore auditions Zhang Zhi Ling, Low Meiqi and Chang Wen.\n\nCho also invited her parents and relatives to chip in vocally, as she wanted them to represent the pioneer generation.\n\nShe gathered everyone to record the MV and vocals in the studio last Tuesday.\n\nCho said: \"I don't know how else to thank my country. I am very proud to be a Singaporean.\"\n\nThree TB cases at childcare centres this year\n\nBy\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\nA spokesman for the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) said there were three reported cases of tuberculosis (TB) at child care centres this year, out of 1,300 child care centres in Singapore.\n\n\"Centres have generally been vigilant and have implemented the required measures to prevent the spread of TB,\" said the spokesman.\n\n\"Under the Child Care Centres Regulations, new staff need to undergo a chest X-ray and be certified to be free from active TB by a registered medical practitioner before they can start work in centres.\n\n\"Centres are also required to promptly inform parents and the ECDA on any suspected TB case.\"\n\nThe number of new active TB cases in Singapore has fluctuated from year to year, but within a stable range, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Health. (See chart below.)\n\nSaid the spokesman: \"TB transmission typically requires close and prolonged contact with an infectious individual. It is not spread by contact with items or surfaces touched by a person with TB.\"\n\nShe said those who are contacted and screened around an infectious TB individual usually comprise those with close interactions.\n\nLATENT\n\n\"There is no need for work places or other places where the active TB case has visited to be closed,\" said the spokesman.\n\nShe added that those with active TB also rapidly become non-infectious once treatment starts.\n\nThe disease then becomes latent, and is not uncommon.\n\nIt is estimated that up to 29 per cent of Singaporeans have latent TB infection (LTBI) and the prevalence of LTBI increases with age, said the spokesman.\n\nShe added: \"Those with LTBI do not have symptoms of TB and do not spread TB to others.\"\n\nThe TB bacteria remains inactive in most healthy adults with LTBI, but they are also monitored and assessed by the Tuberculosis Control Unit.\n\nOther cases\n\nBy\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\nThere have been a number of other cases of tuberculosis (TB) that have been reported this year.\n\nANG MO KIO\n\nIt was revealed in June that six residents of Block 203, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, had contracted multidrug-resistant TB. The first of the six cases was diagnosed in Feb 2012, and the sixth in May this year.\n\nIt was reported that 223 residents and former residents of the block were later screened at a station set up by the Ministry of Health below the block. Two suspected cases of active TB were found, and another 45 were suspected cases of a latent form of the disease.\n\nTANAH MERAH STATION\n\nAt least five cases of TB among SMRT staff working around Tanah Merah station were confirmed, with three of them being active TB cases.\n\nIt was reported this month that about 30 employees were screened, and 13 of them were suspected of having the disease.\n\nPEACEHAVEN BEDOK DAY CENTRE\n\nA female resident at the centre was diagnosed with active TB in June.\n\nA total of 36 residents and centre staff were screened, but no other cases of active TB were found. Several were found to have latent TB.\n\nLITTLE GREENHOUSE PRE-SCHOOL\n\nA teacher at the pre-school in Bukit Batok was diagnosed with active TB this month.\n\nMore than 100 pre-schoolers had to be screened.\n\nBy\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\ntuberculosis\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES\n\nPRE-SCHOOLS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 13, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nMan jailed six months for avoiding TB treatment\n\nJul 15, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nMan alienated from community after TB treatment\n\nJul 15, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nMy TB treatment was a bitter pill to swallow\n\nJul 4, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nTwo more possible cases of TB at Ang Mo Kio block\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nRECOMMENDATION", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c295b6bcd6e99893aeab77164bd5e5eb63dc78a54298c5497d51bb479a2bd2c6/NP_20160830_DSTB_1370230.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "RISK?

Sleigh Bells claim Demi Lovato (above) stole their song.\n\nPHOTO: AFP\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nNov 29, 2016, 06:36am\n\nThe Song Remains The Same\n\nOur resident Kiss92 DJ/ journo wants musicians to stop suing one another\n\nShare this article\n\nSo now Demi Lovato is being sued for stealing a song.\n\nUS indie act Sleigh Bells claim that the US pop star's 2015 hit Stars is way too similar to their 2010 tune Infinity Guitars, particularly the beat.\n\nIn the court document, they point out Stars' nearly-identical bass drum and hand clap combination as a particular point of contention.\n\nThis lawsuit comes hot on the heels of a similar case brought against Ed Sheeran just a couple of weeks ago.\n\nComposer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the classic Marvin Gaye sex jam Let's Get It On, asserted that Sheeran stole the melody, harmony and rhythm for his 2014 hit Thinking Out Loud.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\nJust last year, a jury ordered Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams to pay US$7.3 million (S$9.9 million) to Gaye's estate as their 2013 hit Blurred Lines is apparently a rip-off of Gaye's Got To Give It Up.\n\nCOPYCAT? Sleigh Bells (above) claim Demi Lovato stole their song.\n\nLegendary rockers Led Zeppelin have also been in court over a claim that they purloined a guitar riff for their glorious classic Stairway To Heaven.\n\nYou know what?\n\nIt's all bull.\n\nMusicians have always stolen ideas, and they always will. And if you stop them, then music will stop progressing in any meaningful way.\n\nMusicians create their own unique sound by basically copying other musicians and then putting their own spin on what they've learnt.\n\nThere would be no Mozart without Bach. The Beatles wouldn't have been The Beatles without Buddy Holly.\n\nI don't know anything about rap but I assume that Run-D.M.C. was a huge influence on Jay Z.\n\nEvery genre of music has its own conventions, everything from beats and chord progressions to the types of instruments used.\n\nSongs of the same genre all feel similar. That's what genres are: A group of artistic works that are more or less the same.\n\nNobody invents genres. They are created by a bunch of different artists all working together to improve and ultimately perfect a certain sort of thing that they like. It's a collaborative effort.\n\nWho invented jazz? Who invented metal?

I actually felt quite bad because I didn't include (Huang) Jinglun. He's cool about it, he understands that musically, there are a lot of things to factor in.\"\n\nThe music video, which took half a day to shoot, shows her sitting in the back of a London cab as it takes her around Singapore sights.\n\nIt has garnered more than 380,000 views and 9,000 shares on Facebook and about 27,000 views on YouTube.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nThe filming of the MV and music arrangement and recording of A Singapore Medley took two weeks.\n\nShe said: \"I think it was a nice touch to show the audience that all these songs are sang by Singaporeans.\n\n\"I knew that my video outreach will go regional so besides showcasing local music, I wanted everyone to see places like Chinatown, Geylang East and Marina Bay Sands and to know that Singapore is very small but pretty.\"\n\nAs Poon said she does not receive monetary returns for A Singapore Medley, she did not need to seek copyright permission.\n\n\"I didn't tell any of the selected artists that I was going to use their songs because it was meant to be a surprise. Even Derrick (Hoh) and (Kelvin Tan) Weilian didn't know, even though we are from the same company,\" she said.\n\nPoon has not done any National Day-related projects in previous years because she was in Taiwan, where she was based for five years.\n\nShe now shuttles between Singapore and Taiwan.\n\n\"All I could do was watch the live feed of the National Day Parade from Taiwan, wear red, and gather together with whoever is Singaporean and in Taiwan,\" she said.\n\nEver since she became an artist in 2005, after being the first runner-up in the first season of local reality TV singing competition Project SuperStar, Poon's dream has been to perform a National Day Parade theme song.\n\n\"I asked my boss, 'When is it my turn?'\n\n\"I think that it's a wish for every Singapore artist because it's (something) very close to the heart... I think it's a big thing,\" she said.\n\nCall them happy\n\nChen Diya (left) and Carrie Yeo of The Freshman. PHOTO: LIKES COMMUNICATIONS\n\nRiding on the popularity of their latest hit, Mandopop duo The Freshman, made up of Project SuperStar 2 alumni Chen Diya and Carrie Yeo, released a \"Singlish\" version titled Call Me (Not Maybe) last week.\n\nThe Mandarin original, Remember To Ask Me Out When You're Free, was penned for local director Royston Tan's latest telemovie The Provision Shop, which premiered on Channel 8 last month.\n\nThe theme song was so well-received that even Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong shared and praised it on Facebook.\n\nIn a joint phone interview from Kuala Lumpur, where they were promoting their latest album Growing Up, Chen, 30, told TNP: \"It was a very spontaneous decision to record a Singlish version. We were actually at Carrie's house signing autographs for our albums when we wrote the lyrics.\n\n\"A lot of people commented that they wanted an English version, so we decided to do it for fun.\"\n\nIt took the pair 1½ hours to complete the lyrics, and four takes of the live recording session and music video.\n\nOUT OF LOVE\n\nChen said: \"We took this opportunity to express our love for Singapore and we really did it out of love. We wanted to use this song to connect to people as well.\"\n\nYeo, 34, said: \"It makes us very happy when people share the video and caption it with our lyrics.\"\n\nAnd, yes, the title Call Me (Not Maybe) was inspired by Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen's 2011 monster hit Call Me Maybe.\n\nChen said: \"It's meant to be a punny thing, we hope that young people will understand the reference.\"\n\nThe Freshman have felt overwhelmed, flattered, blessed and proud of the song, a \"fun and casual\" project that has ended up attracting more than 480,000 views and close to 10,000 shares on Facebook.\n\nIt has more than 14,000 views on YouTube.\n\nChen said: \"It was crazy to see it go viral. We felt connected with the masses for the first time and the feeling is indescribable.\"\n\nYeo said: \"We noticed a pretty significant climb (in likes) on our Facebook page after we posted the video.\"\n\nIt is also their first attempt at writing a patriotic song.\n\nChen joked: \"We are not very opportunistic in the sense that we are not savvy enough to use social media for our own benefit.\n\n\"It has to be a natural thing, we must have the 'feel' to do it.\"\n\nOlinda's family, friends in her new MV\n\nSingapore Idol alumnus Olinda Cho has been known to wear her heart on her sleeve when it comes to her love for Singapore, but she is finally officially putting her patriotism into music.\n\nShe was approached by StarHub in June to help with the musical arrangement for the company's Majulah Moms music video after seeing her rendition of national anthem Majulah Singapura, which she posted on YouTube two years ago.\n\nThe 36-year-old was tasked to record her part and sing the original Majulah Singapura, as well as her own rendition.\n\nThese recordings were used as a guide for the 51 mums in the MV.\n\nALL SMILES: Singapore Idol alumnus Olinda Cho invited her friends and family to sing her original song, My Singapore. PHOTOS: YOUTUBE/OLINDA CHO\n\nCho, who is single, joked to TNP: \"I wasn't in the video because I'm not a mum. I asked (StarHub) to put me in it, but they said, 'Oli, do you have a kid? If you have, then we can definitely put you in'.\"\n\nORIGINAL SONG\n\nLast week, she released her own original song titled My Singapore,for Singapore's 51st birthday.\n\nIt was written and composed by Cho and her younger brother Yu Wang, 31, and it has had more than 2,000 views on YouTube.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nCho said: \"We originally wrote it for Singapore's 50th birthday, but I didn't want it to get lost among the 50,000 songs that everybody would be writing, so I waited and decided to keep it for this year.\n\n\"I wanted to make this present better by getting all my friends whom I've met along my musical journey, from (local reality TV singing competitions) Singapore Idol to Sing! China.\"\n\nFeatured vocals in the MV include Singapore Idol alumni Sylvester Sim and Daphne Khoo, former actress and host Jaime Teo, host Rebecca Tan and contestants from the Sing! China Singapore auditions Zhang Zhi Ling, Low Meiqi and Chang Wen.\n\nCho also invited her parents and relatives to chip in vocally, as she wanted them to represent the pioneer generation.\n\nShe gathered everyone to record the MV and vocals in the studio last Tuesday.\n\nCho said: \"I don't know how else to thank my country. I am very proud to be a Singaporean.\"\n\nSingapore\n\nnational day\n\nMusic\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nEnjoy ultra-smooth streaming with 3Gbps Broadband.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/841f13bc0a0508f207408c4d6dc4ec4a87751cbd0e30ed7db76e1f6cb84ec082/NP_20160808_TLKELLY-UBQ_1348856.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "COVER GIRL: Home-grown Mandopop singer Kelly Poon released a cover medley of 12 Mandarin songs by 12 local artists, including herself, last Monday.

PHOTO: ST FILE.\n\nFollowing The New Paper's report yesterday, Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) Ong Ye Kung put up a post on Facebook yesterday evening, condemning the sexualised activities at the National University of Singapore's orientation camps.\n\nHere is his post in full:\n\nEntering university is a heady experience. It is an adventure that as a father to two teenage girls, I hope that my own children will get to go on. University prepares us to tackle the toughest challenges of our times - climate change, abject poverty, terrorism, ageing populations, diseases, widening income gap. Orientation marks the start of university life. Every year, student leaders and staff organise activities and camps. Students sometimes have to go through difficult and challenging experiences - but these are what memories are made of, how bonds are forged, how tribes are formed. Activities can be rigorous, creative, even wild; students may push boundaries. But at all times, we must respect human dignity and remember the point and purpose of a university education. Pretending to ejaculate into the face of a fellow student plays no part in this purpose - it is a reprehensible act that cannot be tolerated; goading others to act out a rape scene not only degrades the real suffering of rape victims, it inflicts fresh humiliation on female students. Protesting such acts has nothing to do with being prudish or a bad sport, everything to do with respect for human dignity. Orientation is still ongoing or will be starting soon at some universities. I have asked that orientation activities be carried out in a manner that respects the dignity of the freshmen. As for what was reported to have happened at NUS, the university has made clear to me that it does not condone such incidents; it is conducting an investigation and will take strong disciplinary action against those found responsible. I thank the staff and student volunteers for their hard work and the many hours of planning that have gone into the orientation programme. I know that much of it was useful and edifying.

These materials can range from beer crates to leftover marble slabs, cement or floor tiles.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 21, 2025, 06:58am\n\nYale-NUS library books disposal sparks outrage among students, alumni\n\nMore related stories\n\nTriple Eyelid started in 2014 after Mr Tan left his previous job as an interior designer. Mr Tan belongs to a growing group of upcycling enthusiasts here.\n\nFor him, the business was borne out of his love for the environment, which started when he was a student in Tasmania, Australia, pursuing a degree in Environmental Design.\n\n''(Eco-consciousness) is a very common thing in their daily lives,'' he said.\n\n''Everybody knows how to build. Everybody recycles and separates their trash.''\n\nMr Tan created this unique nightstand from a log that was once a jewellery maker's worktable. TNP PHOTO: MAX PASAKORN\n\nHoping he could bring that mindset back to Singapore, he started Triple Eyelid.\n\nWith no tools of his own, Mr Tan walked around with a trolley, carting back what people discarded and turning them into his own creations.\n\nOne of his first projects was to turn discarded pieces of wooden pallets into a bed for his own office. He also turned wood into crates to organise his office.\n\nNow, the studio is housed inside the workshop of Xcel Industrial Supplies, a company that supplies wooden pallets and packaging materials. They provide Triple Eyelid with reclaimed wood.\n\nMr Tan runs the company alone.\n\nOne of his greatest challenges, he said, was learning how to make the furniture itself.\n\n''I didn't have a crafting background,'' he said. ''So it was a lot of trial and error.''\n\nHe encourages people who would like to try making upcycled products to first do research on the tools they need.\n\nSCARED\n\nSometimes, people may get scared off by the concept of upcycled goods, said Mr Tan.\n\n''A lot of people have the misconception that upcycled designs are trash-looking, or look like things that people throw away,'' he said.\n\nBut one glance at the clean, modern look of Triple Eyelid's products would clear that up.\n\nSome products, such as a table made of Chengal wood and copper pipes, offers the unusual charm and harmony of wood and metal.\n\nBesides making bespoke, upcycled furniture, Triple Eyelid also hosts workshops for people interested in upcycling their things at home.\n\nMr Tan uses these workshops to encourage others to be creative using whatever they have in their houses. ''If you make things well, you will treasure it more,'' he said.\n\nUpcycled designs are trashlooking, or look like things that people throw away.\n\n- Mr Jackie Tan on the mistaken belief people have about upcycled goods\n\nWhy throw when you can repair?\n\nTO REPAIR: Mr Yusri Sapari, with some of the items people bring to the Repair Kopitiam event: toasters, irons and toys.\n\nWhat do you do when a toy breaks?\n\nMany would just throw it away.\n\nA group led by 27-year-old Yusri Sapari, wants to change that mind set.\n\nRepair Kopitiam is a free monthly event at Jurong and Tampines where the public can learn to fix broken items, be it household appliances, clothes, furniture or toys.\n\nMr Yusri told The New Paper: \"Over the past 20 years, we have become a society that wants things more quickly. We don't have enough 'time' to repair our own things.\"\n\nAs he explained, repairing broken items not only saves money and the environment, it also gives you a sense of attachment to the item.\n\n\"(After repairing) you're not just a consumer. You're the owner of the item,\" he said.\n\nOne of the more common items that Mr Yusri shows his \"students\" to fix are standing fans.\n\nFor Mr Yusri, learning to repair his own things started when he was just a child.\n\n\"One of my first toys was my dad's toolbox,\" he said.\n\nRepair Kopitiam is held every last Sunday of the month from 9am to 3pm. For details go to repairkopitiam.sg\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\n(After repairing) you're not just a consumer.

Three award recipients tell KRYSTAL CHIA (krystalc@sph.com.sg) how they did it\n\nShare this article\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon during Chinese New Year in 2014, business analyst Edwin Huang was tucking into a bowl of beef noodles at an eatery in Seah Street.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a piercing scream coming from the kitchen.\n\nHe rushed over to find the eatery's owner on the ground, motionless.\n\nEven though he didn't know cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), he stepped forward anyway and helped save the man's life.\n\nYesterday, the 32-year-old was presented with the Survivor Awards Singapore.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 25, 2021, 08:28am\n\nBangtan Boys Are Now Superstars\n\nMore related stories\n\nMr Huang was at Authentic Hock Lam St Popular Beef Kway Teow when its owner, Mr Tan Han Theng, 63, collapsed.\n\nMr Huang saw that the elderly man had turned purple and had stopped breathing.\n\nHe told The New Paper that there was utter chaos in the kitchen after Mr Tan collapsed.\n\nHe said: \"Two employees and I first dragged Mr Tan out of the kitchen and into the corridor.\n\n\"Somebody then called the ambulance.\"\n\nAs he was not CPR-certified, Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) personnel guided him over the phone.\n\nMr Huang said: \"It was chaotic. I vaguely remember someone crying. And many pairs of eyes on me.\n\n\"My mind was completely blank. I just wanted to administer CPR correctly and save his life.\"\n\nThe entire episode was captured on the eatery's closed-circuit television cameras.\n\nThankfully, Mr Tan soon began to breathe.\n\nFive employees, including Mr Tan's wife, were at the scene.\n\nTNP understands that another customer was involved in the rescue but declined to comment on the incident.\n\nThe SCDF personnel on the phone gave clear instructions and also real-time updates on the whereabouts of the ambulance, said Mr Huang.\n\nREASSURING\n\nMr Huang added: \"It was very reassuring to know that help was on the way.\"\n\nSCDF paramedics arrived after about six minutes of chest compressions.\n\nParamedic Jonathan Wang, who was involved in the incident, said a heart attack victim's chances of survival are greatly increased when there is immediate intervention to keep the blood circulating to the brain until SCDF arrives.\n\nHe added that simple chest compressions are all it takes.\n\nSCDF Operations Centre supervisor Elvan B. Tamam, who guided Mr Huang over the phone, said: \"Mr Huang was calm over the phone and performed the guided CPR admirably. I'm glad Mr Tan pulled through.\n\n\"I feel that everyone should know at least the basics of CPR and feel confident doing it as the SCDF dispatcher guides you every step of the way.\"\n\nAfter being taken to Singapore General Hospital, three of Mr Tan's major heart arteries were found to be severely blocked, said Mr Tan's eldest daughter, Ms Dorothy Tan, 45.\n\nMr Tan was hospitalised for a month.\n\nHe underwent a heart bypass and pacemaker surgery.\n\nAlthough he had to be resuscitated a further three times in hospital, he pulled through.\n\nToday, he doesn't cook but helps oversee daily operations at the eatery's outlet at North Canal Road.\n\nThe Seah Street outlet closed in April 2014 after its lease expired.\n\nRecalling the incident, Mr Tan said he was playing a game of Candy Crush on his mobile phone when he had to go to the kitchen to cook.\n\nHe said: \"I stood up and took two steps towards the kitchen.\"\n\nHe then asked his wife: \"Why has the sky turned so dark?\"\n\nThat was the last thing he remembers before waking up in hospital.\n\nMr Tan and Mr Huang met last Thursday evening for the first time since the incident. The two men hugged and there were tears in Mr Tan's eyes.\n\nFour of Mr Tan's family members were also present to thank Mr Huang.\n\nMr Tan said: \"I have so much to thank him for and I'm glad I can meet him to convey my thanks.\"\n\nMr Huang was glad to see Mr Tan healthy and energetic. He was also touched that Mr Tan's family remembered him and were appreciative of his efforts.\n\nHe said: \"Mr Tan may be a man of few words but I could really feel his sincerity.\"\n\nDuring the reunion, Mr Tan's family gave Mr Huang shopping vouchers as a token of appreciation.\n\nMr Huang used to be a regular customer at the eatery, which was near his previous workplace.\n\nHe said: \"My wife and I returned to the outlet but was sad to see it had closed.\"\n\nThey did not know that the eatery had two other branches.\n\nMr Tan's family had kept Mr Huang updated on Mr Tan's operations in 2014.\n\nBut Mr Huang was still very worried for a few days after the incident.\n\nMEETING\n\nHis wife, Ms Adeline Choo, 32, recalls Mr Huang meeting her immediately after the incident.\n\nThe human resource consultant said: \"Edwin was very emotional. He couldn't talk about what had happened for a while.\"\n\nMr Tan's family had tried to meet Mr Huang in 2014 to thank him, but he declined.\n\nMr Huang said what he did was the least anyone could do for someone in need.\n\n\"I couldn't walk away. I knew that if it were my family members who were in need, I would wish for someone to help them, too.\"\n\nOn how Mr Tan intends to thank Mr Huang for saving his life, Mr Tan joked: \"Edwin gets a lifetime of free beef noodles.\"\n\nThey performed CPR to save man in courtroom\n\nSAVIOURS: Station inspectors Quek Suan (left) and Jahabar Sadiq were coming out of a meeting last November when they were told that a man had collapsed in a courtroom. TNP PHOTOS: CHOO CHWEE HUA\n\nAs police officers, they fight crime to save lives.\n\nBut what station inspectors (SI) Quek Suan and Jahabar Sadiq did not expect was to have to save a dying man in a courtroom at the State Courts.\n\nThey had just ended a meeting on Nov 27 when a colleague told them that a man in his 50s had collapsed in a courtroom.\n\nSI Quek said: \"We rushed immediately to find a pale, unconscious man. His lips had turned purple and he was not breathing.\"\n\nThe court interpreter was already administering an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) on the man when the duo arrived.\n\nAEDs send an electric shock to the heart to revive it.\n\nSI Quek, who celebrated his 45th birthday yesterday,said he immediately administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the man.\n\nSI Jahabar, 39, held the man's head in a tilted position to maintain an open airway.\n\nThe man started to breathe on his own after two cycles of CPR.\n\nEach cycle comprises 30 chest compressions and two blows of mouth-to-mouth breathing.\n\nRELIEF\n\nSI Jahabar said: \"The sense of relief I felt when he took his first breath was indescribable.\"\n\nThe man was semi-conscious for about seven minutes before Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel arrived.\n\nAround 10 people were at the scene, including court employees and police officers.\n\nWhile both SI Quek and SI Jahabar are CPR-certified, this was their first time administering CPR.\n\nSI Quek, who has been with Singapore Police Force (SPF) for 25 years, said: \"Luckily, the steps were fresh in my mind as I had attended a CPR re-certification course just one week before the incident.\"\n\nSI Jahabar has been with SPF for 18 years.\n\nThey hope this incident will inspire their colleagues to help save lives without hesitation.\n\nSI Jahabar said: \"Nothing really went through our minds during the incident.\n\n\"We only knew that we had to give the man a chance to live.\"\n\nI have so much to thank him for and I'm glad I can meet him to convey my thanks. - Mr Tan Han Theng on Mr Edwin Huang\n\n400 CERTIFIED AS CITIZEN FIRST RESPONDERS\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean launched the Citizen First Responder Training Programme yesterday.\n\nOrganised by the National Resuscitation Council (NRC) and National First Aid Council, the programme covers first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and Automated External Defibrillator (AED) training in five hours.\n\nIt was launched at Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, where 400 residents were certified as the pioneer batch of Citizen First Responders.\n\nDPM Teo said: \"You have taken this important step to empower yourselves to save lives, in the community, at work, and in public places.\n\n\"Together, we can promote self-help, care for one another and make Singapore a more resilient community.\"\n\nDPM Teo also presented the Survivor Awards Singapore to those who have helped survivors of cardiac arrest.\n\nThe award is jointly organised by the Unit for Pre-hospital Emergency Care and the NRC.\n\nThose interested in the course, which costs $45, can register by calling the Singapore Red Cross Academy at 6664 0565.\n\nBy\n\nKrystal Chia\n\nRead articles by Krystal Chia\n\nUncategorised\n\ncpr\n\nSingapore Civil Defence Force\n\nhero\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2021, 09:37am\n\nKing of the Hill\n\nSep 1, 2021, 09:37am\n\nTheron: Women are worth more than their looks\n\nFeb 28, 2019, 03:21am\n\nGranny helping hubby collect cardboard dies after BMW crashes into them\n\nNov 28, 2016, 07:45pm\n\nPanettiere back on red carpet\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nStream, game & surf with all-inclusive 10Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b004bf727b12d84293260c1e1d6ad3334d4e2be21e54fd8475b8782df56d119d/NP_20160118_KCHEART-XQY_1137880.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "REUNION: Mr Tan Han Theng (right) met Mr Edwin Huang for the first time on Thursday since the incident.", "caption": "REUNION: Mr Tan Han Theng (right) met Mr Edwin Huang for the first time on Thursday since the incident.

Instead of competing fiercely with them, some companies have decided on cooperation.\n\nLocal bank DBS, which chose to work directly with fintech companies traditionally seen as a threat to their business, was a case study.\n\n\"Our bank must move quicker, be more ambitious and act more as a technology company,\" said Mr Neal Cross, chief innovation officer (CIO) at DBS.\n\nTo achieve this, his unit operates as an innovation group, which means it supports projects rather than owning or delivering them.\n\nTo change the cultural mindset across the organisation, Mr Cross has created several structured programmes. For example, bank executives were challenged during a hackathon to create a fintech company in three days.\n\nHis team also pairs executives from DBS with those at fintech companies and gives them a challenge to work out together, after which they pitch their solution or idea to the CEO.\n\nMr Cross was named the world's most disruptive CIO in a contest in August.\n\nE-PARTICIPATION\n\nSingapore ranks fourth in terms of human capital - below South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong.\n\nHuman capital is measured by the quality of maths and science education, the extent of tertiary enrolment and citizen e-participation, credit card ownership and Internet usage.\n\nThe study also noted that Singapore is establishing programmes to enhance computer science education in schools and getting the elderly online.\n\nMr Zaqy said Singapore would face more challenges with its diversity than countries with homogenous populations, especially in getting the elderly on board.\n\nHe added that access to more affordable data plans would also help the lower income group.\n\nBy\n\nLinette Heng\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Linette Heng\n\nEconomy\n\nSingapore\n\nTechnology\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 19, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nChinese anti-graft drive will target govt-enterprise ties\n\nMar 19, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nChina to curb excessive credit for property sector\n\nMar 19, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nG20 caves in to US protectionism and drops free trade pledge\n\nMar 17, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nDon't just hire 'plug-and-play' workers: Manpower Minister\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9681e1f57861806a633613b9f5e831559e9a0d2438496509a6f0bc96cce46bba/NP_20161123_LHTECH23_1448859.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Our bank must move quicker, be more ambitious and act more as a technology company. - Mr Neal Cross, chief innovation officer at DBS", "caption": "Our bank must move quicker, be more ambitious and act more as a technology company. - Mr Neal Cross, chief innovation officer at DBS"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/aed72b2961b917a110622297ceb306c4f98e0a5f0aeba23cdeb67d630fa6daf3/imgl1445.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Singapore maintains spot as world's most expensive city, tied with Zurich: EIU", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a5815e8af9e07c9f98125405bc9cabc8d28efd30ca17786e8cae38f2fdd01b5c/np_20161123_lhtech23-v4v_1448863.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

PHOTO: ST\n\nThe Lions, who had carried out coach V Sundramoorthy's game plan almost perfectly up to that point, collapsed to the turf at the Philippine Sports Stadium in Bocaue.\n\nThe 51-year-old coach had set his team out to sit deep in their defensive third, and have the front five players break forward on the counter-attack.\n\nThree times, Singapore pierced the Thai backline in the second half.\n\nBut only once did they get the ball on target, and even then, Shakir Hamzah's shot was beaten clear by Thai No. 1 Kawin Thamsatchanan.\n\nArguably Singapore's best chance of the game fell to fullback Juma'at Jantan.\n\nDeployed as a right winger, the 32-year-old could not sort his feet out in time and his shot eventually went wide.\n\nSundram, who walked into the post-match press conference wearing a wry smile, said: \"We should have scored with the breaks, if only we had got the right shot.\n\n\"Juma'at had a great chance and then Izzdin (Shafiq) was in great position, and so was Shakir... and it would have been a different game if we scored.\n\n\"But I'm very proud of boys, they got stuck in and played to the game plan. We need to move on, we cannot change anything now.\"\n\nThe Lions now head into their last game against Indonesia on Friday desperate for a win and possibly a place in the last four, if the Philippines fail to beat Thailand in matches played concurrently.\n\nLast night's performance has given Sundram's men hope, at least.\n\nSaid defender Daniel Bennett: \"We looked more like scoring than Thailand.\n\n\"We had three or four chances in the second half, and with a little bit more composure, we would have won.\n\n\"You can say we played a defensive game, but who had the chances?\n\n\"This is how we set up and we really could have pulled it off.\n\n\"Anyway, a draw or loss today, it would be similar because we would go into the last game needing to win.\n\n\"But I think we showed tonight we can play.\"\n\nIt was clear from the first whistle that Singapore were out frustrate the talented Thais, who had beaten Indonesia 4-2 in their first match last Saturday.\n\nPROTECTION\n\nJuma'at and Faris Ramli, Singapore's wide midfielders, acted as auxiliary fullbacks when their team were defending.\n\nWhile they dominated possession, the Thais' first clear chance came in the 40th minute when the outrageously skilful Chanathip Songkrasin picked out captain Teerasil Dangda at the backpost, only for the former Almeria striker to head wide from barely five metres.\n\nSingapore continued to frustrate their opponents in the second half, and in the 63rd minute, Juma'at burst through after a great pick-out by Khairul Amri, but he could not get a shot away.\n\nIn the 84th minute, defensive midfielder Izzdin Shafiq found himself in almost the exact same situation as Juma'at, but his shot on his weaker left foot was blocked.\n\nThe misses proved costly as, just five minutes later, Sarawut got on the end of Teerathon Bunmathan's cross from the right to sink the Lions.\n\nJuma'at told The New Paper: \"I feel so sorry for the team I could not convert.\n\n\"If I scored, it would be a different story... I'm not a natural scorer, but I will just continue to give my best for the team.\"\n\nAdded skipper Hariss Harun: \"There were a lot of positives tonight, but then again, no goals.\n\n\"We need to add that to our game in the match against Indonesia.\n\n\"We still have a chance (to qualify for the last four) and we want to go out and get the job done.\"\n\nSingapore now own a wretched record of just four goals in 10 international games since Sundram took over in late May.\n\nThe coach has been criticised in some quarters for the team's cautious approach, but he was defiant when asked if he regretted how he set his team up last night.\n\n\"I would do the same, given another chance,\" he said.\n\n\"We were one minute and 30 seconds away from snatching a draw against Thailand. You can check the record books when we last did that.\"\n\nThere were a lot of positives tonight, but then again, no goals. We still have a chance (to qualify for the last four) and we want to go out and get the job done.\n\n- Singapore skipper Hariss Harun\n\nSTAT ATTACK\n\nTEAMS & PLAYERS' RATINGS\n\nTHAILAND\n\n: Kawin Thamsatchanan 6.5, Tristan Do 7, Tanaboon Kesarat 6, Koravit Namwiset 6, Teerathon Bunmathan 6.5, Pokklaw Anan 6.5 (Charyl Chappuis 86), Sarach Yooyen 6,  Rungrath Poomchanteuk 6 (Adison Promrak 63), Chanathip Songkrasin 7, Siroch Chatthong 7 (Sarawut Masuk 63),  Teerasil Dangda 6.\n\nSINGAPORE:\n\nHassan Sunny 6.5, Faritz Hameed 6, Madhu Mohana 7, Daniel Bennett 7, Shakir Hamzah 7, M Anumanthan 6.5 (Shahril Ishak 91), Faris Ramli 6,  Safuwan Baharudin 6.5 (Izzdin Shafiq 77), Hariss Harun 6.5, Juma'at Jantan 6.5 (Yasir Hanapi 81), Khairul Amri 7.\n\nAttendance\n\n: 359\n\nReferee:\n\nRowan Arumughan (India) 4.5/10\n\nRating:\n\n4/10\n\nTNP MAN OF THE MATCH\n\nKHAIRUL AMRI\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nsuzuki cup\n\nSingapore Lions\n\nV Sundramoorthy\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 2, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nHassan in limbo: Thai club set to cancel contract with year left\n\nNov 30, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSundram: Who says I'm a defensive coach?\n\nNov 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nBack to the drawing board for Singapore football\n\nNov 26, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nAmri defends Sundram's tactics\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/43d37b53f890d83cdbbf83e9028a95d9598fda4807bf07f198a01518d7ca71a9/NP_20161123_SZSOC23-2KF_1448767.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "MISSING THE EDGE: Singapore striker Khairul Amri (above) lamenting a missed chance but it was Thailand's Sarawut Masuk ( on the ground) who didn't miss for Thailand.  ", "caption": "MISSING THE EDGE: Singapore striker Khairul Amri (above) lamenting a missed chance but it was Thailand's Sarawut Masuk ( on the ground) who didn't miss for Thailand.

No worries, Rain's still a mega Asian star\n\nK-pop star Rain may no longer be popular in Korea, but he's still a favourite in other countries\n\nShare this article\n\nIs K-pop star Rain over the hill?\n\nYes, on his home turf.\n\nThe 34-year-old singer-actor's dipping popularity in South Korea has been glaring.\n\nIn 2014, his last studio effort, Rain Effect, was a washout. The album's singles, 30 Sexy and La Song, failed to make the Top 10 on major charts Naver, Daum and Melon.\n\nAnd his fellow countrymen haven't showed much love for his recent drama projects either.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 9, 2025, 07:15am\n\nTwice to perform in Singapore twice, on Oct 11 and 12\n\nMore related stories\n\nBoth his TV series, My Lovely Girl (2014) and Come Back Alive (2016), fared poorly in Korea's nationwide viewership ratings.\n\nBut he is not done with showbiz.\n\nWhile he has been outshone by younger and fresher faces in Korea, Rain, who topped Time magazine's Most Influential People in the World poll in 2006, 2007 and 2011, is still a force to be reckoned with in other parts of Asia, particularly in Hong Kong and China.\n\nWe look at how he stays red hot in the international scene.\n\nCONCERTS\n\nIn July, at prestigious Chinese music awards ceremony MTV Asia Music Gala 2016, Rain went home as one of the night's biggest winners with the Best Overseas Artist award.\n\nHis current concert tour, The Squall, was sold out in Hong Kong and in Chinese cities including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang and Changsha.\n\nAnd good news for Rain's fans in Singapore: He will be performing at Resorts World Sentosa next month.\n\nExpect a spectacular show complete with dazzling visuals.\n\nIn an interview with video platform Tencent, Rain said: \"For this concert tour, our team has put in a lot of effort for production and stage design.\n\n\"There will be 'rain' as well as some laser effects.\"\n\nCHINESE TV\n\nLast year, Rain's first Chinese television drama production, the 68-parter Diamond Lover, reportedly raked in $6 billion won (S$7 million).\n\nDiamond Lover, in which he plays a cold, unfeeling rich businessman, was a huge commercial success in China, topping eight streaming platforms and chocking up more than 7 billion views online.\n\nWhile Rain was already a household name among Hallyu fanatics, this drama won him China audience.\n\nIn an interview with Chinese web portal ent163.com, he said he enjoyed filming Diamond Lover as the pace was comparatively more relaxed than Korea's.\n\n\"I feel I can adapt more to the filming culture in China,\" he said.\n\n\"In Korea, we usually shoot our dramas as they air, so actors very often have to pull all-nighters.\n\nRain cited veteran Chinese stars Jackie Chan and Jet Li as his idols and \"hopes to work with more Chinese directors in the future\".\n\nHe has appeared in high-profile Chinese variety shows such as Happy Camp and Hurry Up, Brother (China's version of Running Man).\n\nRain's second Chinese TV series, Endless August, co-starring Victoria Song from K-pop girl group f(x), will be released next year.\n\nFACE OF TOURISM\n\nAt the peak of his popularity between 2006 and 2011, Rain ventured into Hollywood, starring in action flicks such as Speed Racer (2008) and Ninja Assassin (2009).\n\nAnd despite focusing his sights on China in recent years, he hasn't entirely given up on the Western entertainment world.\n\nLast December, he was appointed the official tourism ambassador of Queensland and the face of QPop, a new tourism marketing campaign that aims to entice more Korean and other Asian travellers to visit the Great Barrier Reef state.\n\n\"It is an honour to come to Queensland for this opportunity,\" Rain told content distributor RedRobot.org during his trip to Australia.\n\n\"There is a lot of culture in Queensland, it is very pretty with nature. It is the perfect place to enjoy your holiday.\n\n\"I tried different food, and I especially enjoyed the Eat Street Markets. I had a really good time there, eating nice food and meeting people.\"\n\nLast month, Rain was spotted in Los Angeles at Los Angeles County Museum of Art's annual Art + Film Gala, attended by a glitzy crowd that included Hollywood A-listers such as Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Salma Hayek and Brie Larson.\n\nFYI\n\nWHAT:\n\nRain Tour in Singapore The Squall\n\nWHERE:\n\nResorts World Ballroom, Resorts World Convention Centre\n\nWHEN:\n\nDec 30, 7.30pm\n\nTICKETS:\n\n$118 to $338 from Sistic (6348-5555 or\n\nwww.sistic.com.sg\n\n)\n\nBy\n\nTan Kee Yun\n\nRead articles by Tan Kee Yun\n\nk-pop\n\nChina\n\nSouth Korea\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 16, 2025, 11:55pm\n\nBTS' Jin partnered Singapore Tourism Board for music video shot in Singapore\n\nMay 1, 2025, 11:38pm\n\nK-pop boy band Riize heading to Singapore for Jan 2026 show\n\nApr 27, 2025, 08:25am\n\nBTS' J-Hope is a rock star at first solo show in Singapore\n\nMar 10, 2025, 12:12am\n\nNo O levels for teen as she moves to Korea to chase K-pop dream\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nGet free installation and consultation with 5Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/068351bd239fc88a57df10110541305ffbe08fb07e46c80f49137819ea2b063f/Twice.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Twice to perform in Singapore twice, on Oct 11 and 12", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/05488b09002ca407ec21bd7129395ad4a1335018a3585b9a0247382db9eebf41/hzjin160525jpg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "BTS' Jin partnered Singapore Tourism Board for music video shot in Singapore", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The thing about Gabriel is there is never a grey area with him.\n\nHe is either not involved or he is brilliant.\n\nSingapore could do with one of his good games.\n\nWith Singapore needing goals and points, this is really the time for Sundram to twist instead of sticking to his usual plan.\n\nJohn Wilkinson is a former  Singapore international  midfielder who collected  29 caps and four international goals from 2007 to 2010.\n\nFOX Sports is proud to be the exclusive pay-TV broadcaster for the 11th edition of the Asean Football Federation (AFF) Suzuki Cup.

If they declare him capable of playing, and the player does as well... I have never forced anyone to play in my life.\n\n\"I've never demanded anyone should be injected to play. If a player is 100 per cent, I make a decision. But the suggestions I have forced him to play are wrong, completely wrong.\n\n\"I had the luxury to give (Mesut) Oezil a break because Germany didn't pick him.\n\n\"Sanchez was not overloaded with games before United, either, as he didn't play in Colombia.\"\n\nWhile Sanchez may need a rest, Giroud has started only once all season but has scored four goals in his last four appearances.\n\nAnd Wenger says he has not decided which of the pair will start up front against PSG.\n\n\"They are different style of players,\" he said of Sanchez and Giroud.\n\n\"That dictates a different style to us as well. The shape and form of the players of the moment, their hunger... it's a mixture of many ingredients.\n\nAsked if Giroud, who was sent off in the 1-1 draw in Paris earlier in the season, was now an impact player, Wenger replied: \"No, not really. I have only good players.\n\n\"Every week I leave top players on the bench. I rotate as well, a little bit.\n\n\"Olivier Giroud has been out a long time and is ready now to compete again.\n\n\"It will change game to game, and I will make rotations, but he will not be on the bench forever.\n\nOPPORTUNITIES\n\n\"He will have opportunities. I have not decided yet (if he will start).\"\n\nTwo players who will definitely not be involved due to injury are Spain pair Santi Cazorla and Hector Bellerin.\n\nBellerin ended speculation of a move away from the Emirates Stadium by penning a new long-term deal on Monday but misses out with an ankle injury - with Wenger pleased to see the 21-year-old extend his stay in north London.\n\n\"It just sends out the message that the media will have to find a different name for someone who wants to leave the club,\" he said.\n\n\"It shows the players we have educated here are committed. That's what you want.\"\n\nCazorla, meanwhile, is still missing with an Achilles problem with Wenger now refusing to give a potential comeback date for the midfielder.\n\n\"I've given a bit up on that. I don't know how far he is,\" he conceded.\n\n\"My gut signing is it will be short, two weeks, but when a player comes back to full training it still takes two weeks for a player to be ready to play again.\"- PA Sport.\n\narsenal\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nChampions League\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 13, 2024, 03:12am\n\nArsenal grind out Man Utd win to go top of the Premier League\n\nApr 29, 2024, 06:20am\n\nMan City still have a mountain to climb in title race\n\nApr 4, 2024, 01:53am\n\nKlopp plans to tune out Arsenal, City games to reduce stress\n\nApr 1, 2024, 02:59am\n\nPep G says City still the team to beat despite trailing\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBest High-Interest Savings Accounts in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/29255982b7f42faf0f2f97d14b4480f3cf5ebe42173bc95fda581230cfc64154/NP_20161123_ARSE23_1448811.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "INJURED?

I don't have a specific time in mind; whether it's 48.9 or 49.81, I don't care,\" he said at a media conference at the Tanah Merah Country Club yesterday.\n\nSchooling has been in contact with University of Texas swim coach Eddie Reese over the last few days - the swimmer arrived in Singapore last Friday and leaves this Friday - and he is ready for hard work when he returns to the United States.\n\nEXPECTATION\n\n\"Eddie sent me a long text yesterday... and the last sentence was, 'I like you no matter what, except if you get fat'; that's Eddie's humour for you.\"\n\nTraining has been \"on and off\" for Schooling since the Olympics, and he acknowledged that at times he was tempted to take it easy, especially with all the adulation over his victory.\n\nSchooling's Rio win made him the first Singaporean Olympic gold medallist and he said: \"I definitely felt I had reached the pinnacle and achieved all my goals.\n\n\"But there is still a lot of work to be done and improvements to be made, and I'm really excited about that.\n\n\"I want to see how good I can get. When I am done swimming, I don't want any 'could I's' or 'should I's'.\n\n\"I feel that I am still far from my full potential, and there's a lot of work to do.\"\n\nHe said there would not be much change to his weights or technique programmes, but Reese has introduced new elements to his dry-land training.\n\n\"This year, I am rowing; I didn't believe it would help me and I asked Eddie, 'this is a joke, right?' He said, 'just do it'.\n\n\"It is so hard, but that's one of the key things that will bring me to the next level.\"\n\nHe sees South African Chad le Clos as his main rival at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, after Phelps' retirement.\n\nSchooling said: \"The rivalry with him (le Clos) will grow in the next few years, and it will be good.\n\n\"I need some motivation, and I love having Chad as a rival because he's not afraid to say what is on his mind.\n\n\"I love and respect that, because that fires me up, too.\n\n\"I hate it when people say politically-correct stuff. If you want to beat me, say you are going to beat me.\n\n\"I love that fire, that's what every sport needs.\"\n\nHe's pretty good with a club, as well\n\nBy\n\nDavid Lee\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by David Lee\n\nWith one big swing and another massive haul, Singapore's first Olympic champion Joseph Schooling proved he is not just a one-trick pony.\n\nThe 21-year-old shot an 81 (39 stableford points) to win the golf tournament and also picked up the longest drive gong with a distance of 255 metres as he helped to raise more than $500,000 for the Singapore Swimming Association in their inaugural fundraiser yesterday at the Tanah Merah Country Club's Garden Course.\n\nSchooling, who was a single-handicapper in high school, said: \"It was pretty fun even though the start was rough.\n\n\"I lost a ball at the first hole but saved that. The first four holes were pretty bad but I played the next five one-under. I had two birdies on the front nine and one on the back.\n\n\"It's always a wonderful feeling to be home and I was especially looking forward to the fundraiser because it gave me a chance to also give back for a cause I feel deeply passionate about.\n\n\"I would like to thank the partners and sponsors for coming out to play today.\n\n\"I'm confident that with everyone's support, we can only continue to excel and make our nation proud.\"\n\nSUPPORT\n\nThe fundraiser saw 280 golfers take time out to show their support for the SSA at the tournament and a dinner attended by guest of honour, President Tony Tan Keng Yam, patron-in-chief of the national sports association.\n\nThe money raised will go towards helping the association achieve its Vision 2020 goals in three key areas - long-term athlete development pathways, supporting the post-sport careers of elite athletes and critical professional staff development.\n\nUnderlying all three areas is a core focus in skill upgrading and education for coaches, technical officials and sports administrators.\n\nThe money will also be used to help strengthen the affiliate clubs' network through development of services and programmes that help nurture aspiring elite athletes.\n\nSSA president Lee Kok Choy said: \"The SSA is humbled by the generous contributions it has received tonight.\n\n\"We are very encouraged by the continued support shown by our affiliates, sponsors and partners, whose contributions tonight will go a long way in helping us in this journey to achieving our Vision 2020 goals of Singapore as a world class aquatics hub.\"\n\nIt's always a wonderful feeling to be home and I was especially looking forward to the fundraiser because it gave me a chance to also give back for a cause I feel deeply passionate about.\n\n- Joseph Schooling (above)\n\nBy\n\nLim Say Heng\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Lim Say Heng\n\njoseph schooling\n\nSwimming\n\nSingapore\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 12, 2024, 03:02pm\n\nEnd 'witch-hunt', says Schooling on controversy\n\nApr 2, 2024, 08:44am\n\nJoseph Schooling used to search for own name on Google\n\nApr 2, 2024, 06:57am\n\nPM Lee, Edwin Tong pay tribute to Joseph Schooling\n\nMar 1, 2023, 08:09am\n\nSchooling out of Singapore's SEA Games team, first time since 2011\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/90a620a58f0b09cd00a8c6112d97da386e5afb4b2584d64c5cac08bda3c62344/NP_20161123_SZSOC23_1448843.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "GOOD CAUSE: Joseph Schooling chatting with President Tony Tan Keng Yam during the Singapore Swimming Association fundraiser dinner at Tanah Merah Country Club.", "caption": "GOOD CAUSE: Joseph Schooling chatting with President Tony Tan Keng Yam during the Singapore Swimming Association fundraiser dinner at Tanah Merah Country Club.

Talk fast\" is the show's tagline.\n\nThe rapid-fire dialogue of Gilmore Girls has always been one of the most entertaining aspects of the show, as characters discuss everything from favourite flavours of wedding cake to the perils of having no clean underwear because it is laundry day.\n\nAnd considering Lorelai and Rory's coffee addiction, they are even more prone to caffeine-fuelled rants and raves, which can be impossible to follow without subtitles.\n\nAs Lorelai once said, \"You know my babbling capabilities are infinite.\"\n\nThe trailers for the new season have the leading ladies chatting about US comedian Amy Schumer, Batfleck and yes - a lack of underwear.\n\nApparently, some things don't change.\n\n2 BOYS, BOYS, BOYS\n\nRory had an enviable love life, with a string of gorgeous boyfriends worshipping at her feet.\n\nEvery Gilmore Girls fan has a favourite Rory boyfriend: the sturdy and reliable Dean (Jared Padalecki), romantic rebel Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) and high-achiever Logan (Matt Czuchry).\n\nAll three have been confirmed to appear in the revival, and the question is obviously which one she will choose to be with.\n\nSeason Seven saw Rory reject Logan's proposal of marriage to relish her single status, so will she take up with him again or go back to one of her other old flames?\n\nWhichever man she ends up with (or not), we are throwing our lot in with Jess.\n\nThe bad-boy poet is the stuff of teenage dreams, and even though he once caused Rory to fracture her wrist in a car accident, his street urchin appeal and ability to quote Charles Dickens still make us swoon.\n\n3 FAMOUS LAST WORDS\n\nSherman-Palladino has long teased fans that she planned to end Gilmore Girls with four precise words.\n\nThe show's final four words have become the stuff of legend, since Sherman-Palladino was unable to use them in its seventh season.\n\nGilmore Girls has always felt incomplete without its creator's intended parting gift to fans, but A Year In The Life will finally reveal the hallowed last words.\n\nThe colourful Sherman-Palladino has been known to write really off-beat dialogue, creating wacky expressions such as \"Oy with the poodles already\" and \"You've been Gilmored\".\n\nWhatever the show's parting words are, we are pretty sure they will pop up on coffee mugs, T-shirts and become countless Internet memes.\n\nBy\n\nLisa Twang\n\nRead articles by Lisa Twang\n\nTV\n\nentertainment\n\nunited states\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 14, 2022, 02:24am\n\nLocal actor Mark Lee's secrets to a strong marriage\n\nDec 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: The Wheel Of Time\n\nDec 2, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: Arcane\n\nDec 2, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: Hawkeye\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nGet the right WiFi routers for the best connection with StarHub\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3864be7da6f454c5a12d40a09942e48fdcc8cf91839b108319f56aaa2ff03521/026c1602.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": ":Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life", "caption": ":Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life PHOTO: NETFLIX"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/183d03eb6dc93af73589b37063a29516853e3e53434589cb4d1f7f11515c0c4f/file7k79ekkwghd124580258.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Star-studded period drama Pachinko follows a Korean family in Japan", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/166a98141565ea681d6e63d7f2ce5598b7959aaea9900946e58f005413d262ad/marklee.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Local actor Mark Lee's secrets to a strong marriage", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Hope Felice has a speedy recovery.\"\n\nMadam Sern also shared some good news on the website that Madam Mico had returned safely to Manila on Monday.\n\nHer condition was stable enough that she could fly back in business class on Philippine Airlines with a nurse, instead of returning home by air ambulance.\n\nBETTER: She is now with her daughter Izelmae.

World Championship gold\n\nShare this article\n\nThe 2017 Fina World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, is just eight months away, and Olympic champion Joseph Schooling has earmarked the men's 100m butterfly as his main priority for the meet.\n\nThe 21-year-old won Singapore's first-ever Olympic gold medal in Rio in August 2016 when he beat American legend Michael Phelps, South Africa's Chad le Clos and Hungary's Laszlo Cseh in a new Olympic record time of 50.39sec in the event.\n\nWhile Schooling previously spoke of his desire to expand his repertoire of events leading up to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, he told The New Paper that he is keen to maintain his status as top dog in the 100m butterfly in Budapest, instead of experimenting with other events.\n\n\"I am still going to focus on my 100m fly... obviously I want to stay at the top,\" he told TNP, during his current visit back to Singapore from the United States, where he trains and studies at the University of Texas.\n\n\"That should be my fall back, my comfort zone... but my training enables me to do well in both the 100m and 200m fly, and that shouldn't change.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 6, 2024, 01:32am\n\nPhelps: Schooling's 2016 gold 'so impressive'\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I think I can do a good 200m fly, too.\"\n\nHe added that butterfly would be his main focus moving forward, although the freestyle events would be \"fun\", and will \"add a little flavour\" to his career.\n\nThe desire to be an Olympic champion has been the main driving force in his swimming career so far and, after achieving that goal, Schooling acknowledged that he'd spent some time away from the pool as he worked to reinvigorate himself psychologically and focus on what he wants to achieve next in the sport.\n\nPhelps' 100 butterfly world record of 49.82, achieved in 2009 in the now-banned performance-enhancing swimsuits, has given the Singaporean fresh impetus in the short-term, while branching out and doing well in other events is his long-term target.\n\n\"The 100m fly is my favourite event, but that doesn't mean I can't be good, or excel in other events,\" he said.\n\n\"I am capable of doing the 100m and 200m fly, the 100m and 200m free, and the individual medleys.\n\n\"If I win more events and be more versatile, that'd be great.\"\n\nBy\n\nLim Say Heng\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Lim Say Heng\n\njoseph schooling\n\nsports\n\nSingapore\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 12, 2024, 03:02pm\n\nEnd 'witch-hunt', says Schooling on controversy\n\nApr 2, 2024, 08:44am\n\nJoseph Schooling used to search for own name on Google\n\nApr 2, 2024, 06:57am\n\nPM Lee, Edwin Tong pay tribute to Joseph Schooling\n\nMar 1, 2023, 08:09am\n\nSchooling out of Singapore's SEA Games team, first time since 2011\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/790135370bbd451a2b36cc10df9343195c82b3f27f68f45f1585b5f7b0222677/20161122_095210.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Olympic champion Joseph Schooling has set his sights on getting gold at the upcoming World Championships in July 2017.

I think the role of Alfred is very suitable for me since he is a bad boy, which is similar to my radio persona.\"\n\nOng, 46, admitted the details of his scenes, which include him dancing with KTV girls, were hazy because he enjoyed his scenes too much.\n\nIt is his first time appearing on screen in a local film; he provided the radio voice for The Teenage Textbook Movie in 1998.\n\nWhereas Ong was living it up for Lulu The Movie, FD, whose real name is Mark van Cuylenburg, had a hellish time, thanks to his hairpiece.\n\nIn his movie debut, the 60-year-old plays fashion icon Karl Lagerfeld, who owns a beloved cat and wants Lulu to be his next muse. His costume included a chic white wig with a ponytail, which FD said was unbearably tight.\n\nHEADACHES\n\n\"It took two hours to put on the wig every time, which was no joke. And I had the most amazing headaches after wearing them.\n\n\"I tell you, the joy of ripping off that hair at the end of the day was comparable to that of seeing my firstborn,\" he deadpanned.\n\nOn hearing how Ong partied with his cast mates, FD was incredulous.\n\n\"He was partying and boozing with a bevy of women, while I got to hang out with a cat,\" he complained.\n\nStill, FD said working with Chong was a delight, and he loved the sleek leather gloves and suit his character wore.\n\nOng and FD, who have known Chong for about 15 years, gushed about how professional she was while making Lulu The Movie.\n\n\"Michelle is a superwoman,\" said Ong. \"She was so present in every aspect of the movie-making process. One moment she would deliver lines in character, and the next, give instructions as a director.\"\n\nBoth agreed Chong, 39, who created the Lulu character as one of her comedy personas on parody TV show The Noose, was one of the pillars of the show.\n\n\"We only watched The Noose for Michelle; frankly, the show is nothing without her,\" said FD.\n\n\"She brings her energy and passion for the entertainment industry with her, which makes her shows so much fun to watch.\"\n\nSaid Ong: \"Unlike some local directors, Michelle keeps things fresh and uses different actors in her movies. Lulu The Movie will also appeal to everyone because it's bilingual and uses both English and Mandarin.\"\n\nWhen TNP asked how Ong's fiancee, fellow DJ Jean Danker, would react if she caught him in a KTV lounge, he laughed. The two are set to wed on Dec 16.\n\n\"I don't think she would be too pleased about that. But that's why it's so much fun to play a role like this, because you get to live out your fantasies,\" said Ong.\n\nChen is Lulu's Brad Pitt\n\nActor Chen Tianwen plays Lulu's Singaporean online boyfriend, Brad Pitt.\n\nChen, 53, also met his China-born wife Bao Xiao Hui online, and was teased about the similarities between himself and his on-screen character by host Pornsak Prajakwit during the press conference for Lulu The Movie.'\n\n\"Yes, my wife and I did meet and communicate through (Chinese social network) Weibo,\" Chen told TNP in an interview.\n\n\"But unlike in the movie, she knew exactly who I was. Lulu's character thought she was meeting Brad's handsome brother Leon (played by Leon Jay Williams), and was disappointed by me.\"\n\nChen described Brad as a \"good, honest guy who is a bit 'orbit' (Singlish for embarrassingly unfashionable)\". While his character woos Lulu with sumptuous claypot dishes, Chen said with a laugh that he does not cook for his wife at all.\n\n\"I can only make Maggi Mee, maybe,\" he said.\n\nChen, who enjoyed a resurgence in fame last year after his song Unbelievable went viral online, hopes audiences will enjoy the lightheartedness of Lulu The Movie.\n\n\"It's a comedy, but it also makes you think. It's about a brave woman who follows her dreams to come to Singapore, and I find Lulu a really inspiring character.\"\n\nBy\n\nLisa Twang\n\nRead articles by Lisa Twang\n\nSingapore Celebrities\n\nSingapore Movie\n\nDJ\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 21, 2022, 05:17am\n\nRebecca Lim wants all the traditional rituals at her upcoming wedding\n\nMay 12, 2022, 04:48am\n\n'I have nothing now': Sharon Au's Paris home burglarised\n\nFeb 20, 2022, 06:00am\n\nLife lessons from actress Rui En\n\nJan 28, 2022, 02:23am\n\nLocal actress Rebecca Lim on her Mr Right and what her ideal wedding looks like\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - Unlock Growth with Smarter Cash Strategies\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a36585e4054adc2a054ff1b7aed7fd9756a7295eb88fddcd3a0e7ef73e6f2902/tay-ping-hui.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Tay Ping Hui admits he was 'a total noob'", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6c434af18d3e801c220f3847a0563f979f2e6b4c5e4088cb0d36489ad0ffe086/NP_20161122_LTLULU22-NFM_1447680.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/89e9cf203b5e4183cfdef27b1b84dff3ec83d2af519a6a9be451a05785b6529e/rebeccalim.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Rebecca Lim wants all the traditional rituals at her upcoming wedding", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He is a wonderful box-to-box player who complements Sarach Yooyen really well in the sense \"one goes, the other covers\".\n\nI am surprised by how clever Sarach is on the ball. He troubleshoots really well in tight situations.\n\nThis central-midfield partnership keeps Thailand ticking and allows playmaker Chanathip Songkrasin to express himself.\n\nThe little maestro can be unplayable between the lines.\n\nSingapore's own central midfield trio of Hariss Harun, Safuwan Baharudin, and Anumanthan Mohan Kumar or Izzdin Shafiq will have to keep things tight to avoid being overrun in the engine room.\n\nI know it's funny when I say Thailand are not great at either end of the pitch when they recently scored twice against Australia and then netted four times against Indonesia.\n\nBut main striker Teerasil Danga just reached double figures in the last two seasons with Muangthong United and Thailand are missing the more clinical Adisak Kraisorn, who is injured.\n\nThat said, the brace against Australia definitely put the wind back in Teerasil's sails. Having missed out on the last Suzuki Cup (he wasn't released by La Liga's Almeria), he hasn't won this title before and he looks hungry.\n\nLions centre back Madhu Mohana played really well against the Philippines but I know the Thai mentality. Daniel Bennett and Baihakki Khaizan have built a certain reputation and the Thais will take a step back if they see their names on the starting list.\n\nSure, the two of them don't have great pace but they never had that in the first place.\n\nWhat they have are loads of experience. Dan reads the game better and Bai often wins the first ball.\n\nMy prediction... It is all about head and heart, isn't it?\n\nI'm going to go with Thailand to win by the odd goal, 2-1.\n\n● John Wilkinson is a former  Singapore international  midfielder who collected  29 caps and four international goals from 2007 to 20\n\n10.\n\n● FOX Sports is proud to be the exclusive pay-TV broadcaster for the 11th edition of the Asean Football Federation (AFF) Suzuki Cup.

Singapore need to stretch Thailand and I feel they can get at them on the counter-attack.\n\n- Ex-Singapore international John Wilkinson, on Thailand\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n3\n\nThailand will be playing their third game in eight days.

TNP FILE PHOTO\n\n\"I'm hoping to request to take both storeys of one of the buildings,\" he said.\n\n\"I have about 100 dogs, so I think having both storeys would be pretty comfortable for the number of dogs I have right now.\"\n\nSURPRISE\n\nSOSD president Siew Tuck Wah said he was caught by surprise.\n\n\"For the Government to be building this shelter space so that all of us can be spared from finding and building on a new land is unprecedented,\" he said.\n\n\"It is really a better outcome than we could have imagined.\"\n\nGLAD: Dr Siew Tuck Wah, president of Save Our Street Dogs, is surprised that the Government has come up with a solution. TNP FILE PHOTO\n\nBut, elated as they may be, there were some concerns about space raised by Animal Lovers' League (ALL) co-founder Cathy Strong and Causes For Animals Singapore (CAS) co-founder Christine Tan.\n\nMs Strong, whose organisation houses about 400 dogs and over 200 cats, said: \"I'm afraid the dogs won't have a space to run around in the future, since they didn't really specify.\n\n\"Most of my dogs are quite huge, so we are still working on a solution with the authorities.\"\n\nMrs Tan told TNP that although the new area in Sungei Tengah will be cheaper than what CAS is now paying at Seletar for the space of about five four-room HDB flats, the new place will also be much smaller.\n\n\"CAS dogs now have the courtyard space to roam on a rotational basis for a few hours a day,\" she said.\n\n\"But I'm not sure if they can do that at the new place since it's mentioned that the dog runs they are building will be shared.\"\n\nWhen asked what were some of the ideas discussed during the meeting, Mrs Tan said: \"We explored the possibility of having a common adoption space and education facilities for the public.\"\n\nAnimal lovers were also rejoicing online when they heard the news.\n\nFacebook user Sharon GJ Ong posted on SOSD's Facebook page: \"Of all the many beautiful days I have enjoyed so far in 2016, today is extra beautiful.\"\n\nFacilities will house 7,000 animals\n\nThe Government will be building and leasing out two-storey animal shelter facilities at Sungei Tengah Road and opposite Farmart, the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) said yesterday in response to The New Paper's queries.\n\nThe development will help cover nine animal welfare groups, 29 pet farms and several independent shelters in Loyang and Seletar that now collectively house about 6,000 to 7,000 animals.\n\nThe AVA said the Government understood that it may be challenging for animal welfare groups and pet farms to raise enough money to tender for land and build their own facilities, so the move will help ease their cashflow as they will not need large upfront capital.\n\nFACILITIES\n\nThe land area of the facilities will be about 3ha and construction will begin early next year, the AVA said.\n\nIt estimates that monthly rent will be about $13 per sq m.\n\nThe final cost will depend on the design and the contractor's tender prices.\n\nPet farms will have to tender for the units and their rental will be based on their tender bids.\n\nThe priority is to house the existing animals in Loyang and Seletar.\n\nThe AVA will consider leasing out to other animal welfare groups and pet farms in other areas in future if there is sufficient space.\n\nIt is seeking the views of the groups and pet farms on the design specifications, and will continue to keep them in the loop.\n\nBy\n\nElaine Lee\n\nRead articles by Elaine Lee\n\nAVA\n\nanimals\n\nSingapore\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 3, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nHome for chickens?

What else do you need in a striker?\"\n\nWhether the Dazzler and his charges can shackle the duo, however, is another matter altogether.\n\nTeerasil, 28, is on fire, having scored five goals over the last seven days.\n\nAfter netting twice in Thailand's 2-2 draw with Australia in a World Cup qualifier last Tuesday, he opened his Suzuki Cup account with a hat-trick against Indonesia four days later.\n\nThe three goals took his tally in the competition to 12, just five behind all-time top scorer, Singapore's Noh Alam Shah.\n\nSarach, 24, was also impressive against Indonesia, bossing the midfield and making key contributions at both ends.\n\nDespite his small stature, the 1.68m-tall Sarach seemed to come out on top in every tackle and chipped in with two assists - both for Teerasil.\n\nSingapore's players know how strong the Thais are, but are confident of keeping them quiet.\n\nRookie midfielder M Anumanthan, who had a solid Suzuki Cup debut in the draw with the Philippines on Saturday, is relishing the task of taking on Sarach and Co.\n\n\"It will be my first time playing Thailand, so I'm really excited and I'm raring to go,\" said the 22-year-old, whose role is to shield the back four.\n\n\"We want to show we are not pushovers and we will go out there with belief, and fight.\n\n\"We are not afraid of them.\"\n\nCentre back Madhu Mohana, who is likely to keep his place at the heart of defence alongside the evergreen Daniel Bennett, is also up for the challenge of keeping Teerasil quiet.\n\n\"We know what they are capable of,\" said the 25-year-old.\n\n\"They're fast and always moving, so we have to stay compact.\n\n\"As for Teerasil, he's a good player and we respect him.\n\n\"But he has two arms and two legs, just like us.\n\n\"And if we have to kick him, we'll kick him.\"\n\nWHAT THE THAI MEDIA SAY\n\nSupachok Umaklat\n\nFourFourTwo Thailand:\n\n\"We respect Singapore, especially after they managed to defend against Philippines with just 10 men.

surprise, surprise - Adison and Tanaboon to nod home in a group stage match.\n\nThailand, however, won 2-1, and Singapore eventually exited the tournament at the group stage.\n\nAmri is not about to dwell in former glories, though, and is only looking ahead.\n\n\"Forget about (the previous goals), they mean nothing,\" said the Lions' main goalscorer, who has netted 11 times in his last 20 international matches.\n\n\"Seeing how Indonesia scored twice against them tells us we can do it, too.\n\n\"But we have always had the belief we can score.\n\n\"If not, we better not even step onto the pitch.\"\n\nOTHER GAME:\n\n8pm: Indonesia v Philippines\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSingapore Football\n\nsuzuki cup\n\nV Sundramoorthy\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 10, 2025, 10:45pm\n\nLions survive late onslaught to claim first win of Asian Cup third-round qualifiers\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:01pm\n\nLion City Sailors retain Singapore Cup to cement domestic dominance\n\nMay 18, 2025, 11:06pm\n\nLion City Sailors denied at final hurdle as Sharjah FC clinch AFC Champions League Two title\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:16pm\n\nACL2 trophy is 'something beautiful to fight for', says Lion City Sailors' Hariss Harun\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3ee2103bcdb0c72f1382393016514a61bb8218c794de7c0a4e2ffe60525e059c/NP_20161122_SZLIONS22_1447937.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "V Sundramoorthy", "caption": "V Sundramoorthy PHOTO: THE STRAITS TIMES"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e400e1386ad4c39dc902ce6505c1cb3a6811d01bd31f3f2f5cd2cd05f1ae5b65/mtsoc119d2e6a25Attachment.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Singapore U-16 boys roar back with 3 goals in 8 minutes to stun Cambodia", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/05e270f22204c75fbbcd028d21060aef4c295735ce3b50df3fcd374227563e1b/sg1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Lions survive late onslaught to claim first win of Asian Cup third-round qualifiers", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

So let's see tomorrow.\"\n\n- SAZALI ABDUL AZIZ\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nsuzuki cup\n\nthailand\n\nSINGAPORE ATHLETES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 2, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nHassan in limbo: Thai club set to cancel contract with year left\n\nNov 30, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSundram: Who says I'm a defensive coach?\n\nNov 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nBack to the drawing board for Singapore football\n\nNov 26, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nAmri defends Sundram's tactics\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nYour dream home, now more affordable with IKEA home design ​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d3d3ed5f392a1da960bb21af577ea80f3cd22c0c0cc84328cda49ff63fc846b2/NP_20161122_SZSOC22A_1447924.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "SHAKE ON IT: Thailand coach Kiatisuk Senamuang (left) and Singapore coach V Sundramoorthy will renew their rivalry, this time from the technical area.", "caption": "SHAKE ON IT: Thailand coach Kiatisuk Senamuang (left) and Singapore coach V Sundramoorthy will renew their rivalry, this time from the technical area.

They project a big-club mentality, but remain crippled by a small-time approach to accountancy.\n\nMauricio Pochettino has hinted that the club's underlying limitations in the transfer market stop the manager from really competing with the other London and Manchester clubs.\n\nTottenham remain undefeated in the England Premier League, thanks to the erratic nature of the competition and their manager's tactical nous.\n\nBut the Champions League offers a more accurate barometer of Spurs' development and they are clearly stalling on the continent.\n\nGAP\n\nJust a solitary victory in four games - one of which was a dispiriting loss against Monaco at Wembley - reiterates the gap between Pochettino's men and the rest in Group E. Two goals from four games provide the exclamation mark.\n\nTottenham are a little out of their league, which makes the unnecessary negotiation delays with Kane all the more galling.\n\nSpurs' toils in the Champions League could be attributed in large part to Kane's earlier absence through injury.\n\nEven the undefeated EPL record masked a worrying run of six games without a victory, until the fortuitous win over West Ham last weekend.\n\nTwo overriding factors contributed to Tottenham's lucky escape: Slaven Bilic's tactical naivety and Kane.\n\nBilic's late introduction of defensive midfielder Havard Nordtveit proved disastrous, as the EPL rookie gifted Spurs their late penalty.\n\nKane, of course, put away the spot-kick, to go with his poacher's finish moments before. Two goals in as many minutes pinched the points and lifted the striker's tally in derbies to 18 from 22 games, the best ratio of any striker in EPL history.\n\nNot a bad effort for a footballer still scratching away at his obvious rustiness.\n\nBut a half-fit Kane is still a step up on Vincent Janssen, who currently views life at Tottenham through a half-empty glass.\n\nAt 22, the Dutchman remains a work in progress, but the sniper-like relentlessness of the EPL has shot his confidence to pieces.\n\nPairing him with Kane against West Ham was a mistake. Starting him against Monaco may be another.\n\nDele Alli was presumably rested at the weekend in anticipation of a Champions League contest that Spurs cannot afford to lose if they are seeking to extend their stay in Europe.\n\nBut their perilous position owes just as much to the club's inability to shake off that small-club syndrome as it does any individual travails on the pitch.\n\nPochettino hasn't been allowed to buy enough striking talent in depth.\n\nIn recent games, he has started Janssen up front with no reward. Even Son Seung Min has taken on a position that clearly doesn't work with the tools in his creative box.\n\nWhen he came on against West Ham, the South Korean changed the game. His lively run and cross led to Kane's equaliser and he played a pivotal role in winning the penalty.\n\nSon rises out wide. He shrinks up front.\n\nBut Pochettino's squad are not overly endowed with line-leading, reliable finishers. Kane stands alone.\n\nHe's not only a forward who provokes trepidation among Monaco's league-leading defenders, he's also a benchmark for Tottenham's ambition.\n\nIf Spurs are serious about their domestic and European proclamations, then they'll pay Kane the going rate for a man with golden boots.\n\nBesides, he could yet prove the difference in Monaco.\n\nAnd that would make him just about priceless.\n\nI'm not panicking and I'm not demanding anything as I've read in the papers. We're having a conversation and I have no doubts that we will get it sorted. I want to be here for a long time and I am sure I will be.\n\n- Harry Kane, on his contract situation at Tottenham\n\nA must-win game for Spurs\n\nTottenham Hotspur face a must-win game and will be motivated by thoughts of revenge, when they visit Monaco for their Champoins League  Group E clash tomorrow morning (Singapore time).\n\nThe London side have lost both of their home games so far, to leaders Monaco and then second-placed Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nThe Germans now sit two points above them after winning 1-0 at Wembley and Spurs badly need to make up ground this week.\n\nThey got a boost in the Premier League at home to local rivals West Ham last Saturday, turning a 2-1 deficit into an unlikely 3-2 victory when Harry Kane, only recently returned from injury, scored twice in the last few minutes.\n\n\"It's a must-win game (in Monaco) and this gives us a big high to go out there and win,\" said Kane.\n\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino added: \"The last month has been tough for us and it's fantastic to discover that feeling again for the games ahead.\n\n\"The first is a game we must win against Monaco and it's for that reason we need to have the mentality and feeling that we can go to Monaco and win.\"\n\nUNBEATEN\n\nTottenham remain the only unbeaten side in the Premier League, although six draws in their 12 games means they are only fifth in the table, albeit four points behind the leaders.\n\nMonaco are second in Ligue 1, three points off the pace, after a comfortable 3-0 victory at Lorient.\n\nColombia striker Radamel Falcao continued his fine run with another goal for the principality side and, after hapless spells with Manchester United and Chelsea, would love to remind doubting English fans of his quality.\n\nHe scored twice in the last Champions League fixture, an easy 3-0 win over CSKA Moscow, which followed two draws and a 2-1 win in their opening game at Spurs.\n\nBernardo Silva and Lemar scored in the first half-hour against Tottenham while Pochettino's side were still adjusting to Wembley, where they are playing Champions League games as they start construction of a new stadium at White Hart Lane.\n\nThe French side need only a repeat of last season's draw at home to Spurs in the Europa League to qualify for the knockout stage with a game to spare. - Reuters.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nChampions League\n\ntottenham hotspur\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 15, 2024, 02:14am\n\nAncelotti confident for Champions League final\n\nMay 8, 2024, 06:13am\n\nMbappe's best not enough to save PSG from getting the boot\n\nMay 7, 2024, 07:50am\n\nReal must 'improve' to overcome Bayern in Champions League\n\nApr 28, 2024, 02:38am\n\nKane double steers Bayern 2-1 past Frankfurt ahead of Real clash\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9c06bb623bfd02f03ceafbb28dba96448db01e3b9e31374aeb8eb617992b5edd/NP_20161122_NEIL22_1447766.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Harry Kane.", "caption": "Harry Kane.

It's really unfair to those who genuinely want to watch the concert,\" he said.\n\n\"What makes me angrier is that there are people buying the resale tickets at crazy prices.\"\n\nBy\n\nIsabelle Liew\n\nRead articles by Isabelle Liew\n\nconcert\n\nTickets\n\nSingapore\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 21, 2024, 09:14am\n\nEnergy to perform at Indoor Stadium in Nov\n\nAug 15, 2024, 03:59am\n\nJane Zhang returns to S'pore in Dec after 12 years\n\nAug 14, 2024, 05:18am\n\nEric Moo, Tiger Huang, Z-Chen, Jess Lee in October concert\n\nAug 7, 2024, 08:11am\n\nAdele's shot at Guinness World Record draws ire of Koreans\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nStream, game & surf with all-inclusive 10Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/23fd5d1c5cbb6396d3f39f1b594b90c5e812f63afff4cc004dd1c30574be3ab7/282525.2_40627262_-_21_11_2016_-_ilcold22.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO: COLDPLAY"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/addd5195b7797ca99158e966d198565675fb20671a8696aaa3ae9e671d0cac25/screenshot_2024-09-27_at_11.36.05_am.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Art, inclusivity and courage at Dare Festival 2024", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/41bed1ee577ab5e22f2b2b3762283c0bf09dc5fe0c4d777f6011c19506366b09/NP_20161122_ILCOLD22_1447674.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/27a8c83015470dbd2029d354402bbe27a21098f43779054cffb87b44d3d0b95e/NP_20161122_ILCOLD22-JJU_1447676.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/22e728f59f631391de722942b3ca0232e0fe875ee6d3b6cf52a8b980a7f7f69d/NP_20161122_ILCOLD22-R2D_1447906.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5b11632e82e8338830a69a9b3cda65997109ab802ba92d4ee3d66d7e7a4bc812/screenshot_2024-08-21_at_4.38.26_pm.png?w=318", "alt_text": "Energy to perform at Indoor Stadium in Nov", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

PHOTO: AFP\n\nIn September, American company Liberty Media had taken control of Formula 1 in a deal estimated at US$8 billion ($11.4m).\n\nMany now predict a new era for the glamour sport, a European-dominated sport that has long sought to break into the US market and win fresh audiences.\n\nIn recent times, audiences trackside and on television have fallen and yesterday, Malaysia announced that it will discontinue its Grand Prix after 2018 due to falling revenues.\n\nSpeaking to state-run Bernama news agency, Tourism and Culture Minister Nazri Aziz said: \"We spend 300 million ringgit ($97m) per year, but are not getting 300m back.\n\n\"There are no returns on the F1 Grand Prix.\"\n\nHe noted that attendance had declined despite the high cost of staging the race, which has been held at the Sepang circuit near Kuala Lumpur since 1999.\n\nBy contrast, Malaysia's MotoGP at Sepang is consistently popular and this year's race was sold out.\n\nSepang agreed last month to extend its leg of the world's premier motorcycle championship until at least 2021.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist for emerging-market Asia at Natixis SA in Hong Kong, said the recent drop in attendance could be a sign that the novelty of the event is wearing off, and may also be a reflection of weak regional growth.\n\n\"It (F1) also comes with costs. Thus, with tourism receipts (from F1) waning, the cost benefit calculus is tipping in the other direction,\" Nguyen said.\n\nCROWN JEWEL\n\nUnlike the Sepang Formula 1 race, the Singapore Grand Prix has been regarded as one of the best on the circuit ever since the inaugural stop in 2008.\n\nEcclestone had previously christened it as the \"crown jewel\" of Formula 1.\n\nRun along downtown Singapore, the one-of-a-kind street race under lights featured the spectacular Marina Bay skyline as a backdrop and uniquely offers a world-class entertainment programme over the three race days, with the likes of Beyonce, Bon Jovi, Queen, Justin Bieber and Kylie Minogue entertaining thousands over the weekend.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Straits Times yesterday, Ecclestone seemed to backtrack on his earlier comments, when he said: \"My words were taken in a funny way. What I said was simple - no decision has been taken yet.\"\n\nThe outspoken chief executive also revealed nothing further of the negotiations and simply said they would end very shortly.\n\n\"Negotiations are ongoing and will be sorted out shortly... I'm sure.\n\n\"We want to extend long-term. We'll see what happens.\"\n\nIn 2008, the Singapore Grand Prix generated a crowd of more than 250,000 over the course of the three days.\n\nAt this year's race, the event saw a dip, with just over 200,000 spectators turning up for the race weekend.\n\nThe event has been generating annual tourism receipts of $150m on average every year.\n\nSaid Choo: \"Formula 1 also adds more value to Singapore as a destination. Both Formula 1 and Singapore are flexing their muscles and I believe they will lock down a deal that is agreeable to each other.\"\n\n\"My words were taken in a funny way. What I said was simple - no decision has been taken yet.\"\n\n- Bernie Ecclestone, on the Singapore GP\n\nBy\n\nSwetha Sundararajan\n\nRead articles by Swetha Sundararajan\n\nFormula 1\n\nSingapore\n\nsports\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 16, 2023, 02:23pm\n\nF1 drivers prep to work late shift in Las Vegas\n\nSep 15, 2023, 06:11am\n\n'It was like a dream': Fan spots Lewis Hamilton at Promenade ahead of S'pore Grand Prix\n\nMar 20, 2023, 12:46am\n\n'I've never seen a car so fast', says Hamilton of Red Bull\n\nNov 19, 2022, 03:44am\n\nF1 launches new all-female racing series\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - Unlock Growth with Smarter Cash Strategies\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/62e620b10c846435777b3cdc1000ce6c4d27a3d2eb634a04e517680a9a2ed81f/02603d8f.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Marina Bay street circuit.", "caption": "The Marina Bay street circuit.

Sunderland (home), Bournemouth (away), West Ham (home) and Middlesbrough (away) - over the next few weeks and it is not far-fetched to expect them to pick up 12 points during that stretch.\n\nChelsea, though, face a challenging fortnight that could define their season.\n\nAt Stamford Bridge on Sunday morning, Spurs will be attempting to pour cold water on the Blues' red-hot streak.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's side are in fine fettle, the only Premier League side yet to taste defeat.\n\nTheir comeback win over West Ham last weekend demonstrated the confidence that is running through their veins.\n\nTwice, West Ham went ahead during the game, only to eventually lose 3-2, with Spurs equalising through Harry Kane a minute from time.\n\nKane, who only just returned from injury, struck the winner in time added-on for a result that will add even more belief in his side.\n\nSCORE TO SETTLE\n\nSpurs have a score to settle.\n\nIn May, they squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with the Blues, a result which saw them drop two valuable points that extinguished their own title chances.\n\nAfter taking on Spurs, Chelsea will then go head to head with, arguably, even more formidable opponents.\n\nConte will cross swords with Pep Guardiola on Dec 3 at the Etihad Stadium, which is where the bookmakers continue to think is the likeliest destination of this season's EPL crown.\n\nManchester City, who are behind Liverpool only on goal difference, have more than enough firepower to test Chelsea's much-vaunted three-man backline.\n\nIn Kevin de Bruyne, Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Raheem Sterling, and the back-in-favour Yaya Toure, City pack a mighty punch up front.\n\nChelsea lost to Liverpool at home and were thumped by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nMeetings with the two other title contenders are scheduled over the next two weeks, and how they emerge after it will determine whether Chelsea are the real deal.\n\nBy\n\nGary Lim\n\nSports Editor\n\nRead articles by Gary Lim\n\nCHELSEA (EPL)\n\nepl\n\nAntonio Conte\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThese 5 S-REITs Are Outperforming in 2025 -

This time, the onus will be on Spanish side, as Allegri has pointed out.\n\nJuve meet Dinamo Zagreb, who are without a point, in their final group game and can bank on getting the win they will still need if they lose tomorrow.\n\nSevilla, on the other hand, face a much tougher final game at Lyon.\n\n\"I believe that the match (tomorrow) is more important for Sevilla than for ourselves,\" said Allegri.\n\n\"If we don't beat Dinamo Zagreb at home in our final group game, then we don't deserve to be in the Champions League.\" - Reuters.\n\nChampions League\n\njuventus\n\nSevilla FC\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 15, 2024, 02:14am\n\nAncelotti confident for Champions League final\n\nMay 8, 2024, 06:13am\n\nMbappe's best not enough to save PSG from getting the boot\n\nMay 7, 2024, 07:50am\n\nReal must 'improve' to overcome Bayern in Champions League\n\nApr 28, 2024, 02:38am\n\nKane double steers Bayern 2-1 past Frankfurt ahead of Real clash\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/81bf10c61326c424189f1aa689ac30e1524b9af2e5e6d8cfb53af9fff9e56eac/NP_20161122_JUVE22_1447943.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Massimiliano Allegri.", "caption": "Massimiliano Allegri.

operating 63 flights a week to and from Jakarta, has been told to cut five flights a week due to runway maintenance works at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.\n\nThe five affected flights are SQ962 and SQ963 from Mondays to Thursdays and Saturdays.\n\nSIA apologised to customers for the inconvenience and said it will progressively contact those affected to accommodate them on other flights.\n\nResponding to media queries, a Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) spokesman said the authority is aware of SIA's plans.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 14, 2025, 02:50am\n\nSIA

services to Jakarta as soon as possible to reduce the impact on business travellers and tourists, who rely heavily on air services to travel between Singapore and Jakarta.\n\nThe latest development comes several weeks after SIA said it had to postpone plans for a thrice-weekly Singapore-Jakarta-Sydney service, which had been due to start tomorrow.\n\nThe Indonesian authorities had also cited

I don't know how a tipped ball can amount for a five-or-six-tenths of a second ... Nothing can justify it. It's just a bad call.\"\n\nCoach Casey said the Raptors (8-5) would look into the call with the NBA, but didn't know if the team had any real options other than to swallow the difficult outcome.\n\n\"I've got to hear another explanation, because we reviewed it about 10 times in there. Even if the clock started once, DeMarcus Cousins deflected it, T. Ross caught it, shot it with plenty of time ...

That's probably why Gordon's players would lie down in traffic for him.\"\n\nTietjens is the most successful sevens coach of all time, leading the All Blacks to 12 World Series titles, two World Cup wins and four Commonwealth Games gold medals.\n\nHe left after a failed bid at the Olympics and has now joined Samoa.\n\n\"Sometimes people change for the sake of change, but New Zealand rugby sevens needed it,\" said Te Nana, who captained the All Blacks to the 2001 World Cup victory under Tietjens.\n\n\"The time was ripe for a change and fresh ideas.\"\n\nNew Zealand started their Olympic campaign under Tietjens by losing to Japan in the group stage. But, while they survived the group, they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual champions Fiji.\n\nWhile Te Nana believes fatigue eventually got to the All Blacks at the Olympics, he would not discount the fact that there has been much improvement in the game worldwide.\n\nCLOSER LEVEL\n\n\"It's an Olympic sport and a lot of teams put the effort in, and get the training regimen right, and that's made everyone come to a closer level,\" said the 41-year-old, who has scored 113 tries for the All Blacks.\n\n\"Legitimately, five or six teams can win any tournament now and that's a positive thing. The way it played out in Singapore (last year) is one of the examples - and it's great.\n\n\"Who wants to turn up knowing that New Zealand or Fiji are going to win it?\"\n\nKenya won the Singapore leg of last year's HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series, with the tournament returning to the Singapore Sports Hub next April.\n\nEven with Olympic gold medallist Jerry Tuwai in the squad, Fiji's Daveta were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the recent Singapore Cricket Club International Rugby Sevens won by the England Academy.\n\nSpeaking to local media on the sidelines of the Saint Andrew's Village, Te Nana believes that Singapore could also do well in the sevens game, his confidence coming from watching young players since he arrived on Friday.\n\n\"I've been surprisingly impressed by the level of skills of the boys here - it's very similar to New Zealand,\" said Te Nana, who was also impressed by how quickly the boys absorbed and applied points raised during training sessions.\n\nHe is supposed to help pick two youngsters to train in New Zealand as part of the Heroes in the Making Programme, but he reveals that he has at least six players he is keeping his eye on.\n\nWhile Singapore could possibly match New Zealand at the youth level of rugby, making the transition to the senior level would not be easy.\n\nHe said: \"The tough thing is to carry on, to upskill themselves, keep going up and playing high-level hard games.\"\n\nFrom now till Dec 31, two-day season passes for adults ($120 for Category 1 and $40 for Category 2) for the 2017 HSBC Singapore Sevens are 20 per cent lower than the general sale period from Jan 1, 2017. To mark the launch of the revamped website\n\nwww.singapore7s.sg\n\n, organisers are offering the first 5,000 Category 1 ticket buyers a free HSBC Singapore Sevens commemorative T-shirt. This offer is valid from Oct 17 to Dec 31 while stocks last.\n\nSometimes people change for the sake of change, but I think New Zealand rugby sevens needed it.

We got them back on Thursday but they couldn't train.\n\n\"Sadio came back pretty early but Phil, because of the flight, he had a little ill-effect but nothing big, as everyone could see today.\"\n\nThe Liverpool boss was pleased that his side did not lose a game they were in a strong position to win.\n\n\"We were much better in the second half,\" he added.\n\nGOOD PERFORMANCE\n\n\"It was a really good performance against a good side.\n\n\"Southampton are a well-organised side and I think they adapted their style to our strengths.\n\n\"We had enough chances to win the game, especially in the second half, our reaction was really good and the body language was better.\n\n\"I am fine with the performance, we could and maybe should have scored, that is how football is and many times in my life we have lost games like this - when you are much better and have more chances. But we didn't because we stayed concentrated.\"\n\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel insisted his side did not change their approach to counter the attacking threat of their opponents and was pleased to return from the international break with a strong display after losing at Hull a fortnight ago.\n\n\"We played a very good team with good players. It was important to keep the organisation, they score lots of goals and it is very difficult to develop our game.\n\n\"It is not our tactic (to defend), it is just that we played a very good team. They have good, physical players who are also technical and have a good spirit.\n\n\"We know it is always difficult after the international break. It is difficult with 15 international players.\n\n\"I am happy with the attitude and the spirit among my players.\"\n\nThe Saints failed to get a single shot on target, with Charlie Austin's second-half header wide of goal the closest they came.\n\nPuel was again left praising the impact of defender Virgil van Dijk, who has shone in most games this season.\n\nAsked about another superb display by the former Celtic man, Puel replied: \"Yes, but he is in every game, it is not a surprise, it is not amazing. Since the beginning of the season, Virgil has been excellent.\" - PA Sport.\n\nfor the first time this season there was a lack of quality in front of goal. (Roberto) Firmino's was the standout chance, (Joel) Matip could have done more - maybe been a bit braver from a fantastic (Philippe) Coutinho cross - and then (Nathaniel) Clyne at the back post.\n\n- Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher\n\nepl\n\nliverpool\n\nSouthampton\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nEnjoy free installation & more with 10Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1e1e46afb9e888a66cc00e8ef0fe238ce26661355a57c1a95f494f5a98d4ead7/NP_20161121_KLOPP21_1446882.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "PROFLIGATE: Roberto Firmino (above) had the best chance to give Liverpool all three points against Southampton, but his shot went wide.", "caption": "PROFLIGATE: Roberto Firmino (above) had the best chance to give Liverpool all three points against Southampton, but his shot went wide.

We need this kind of player.\n\n\"The Premier League, Champions League and cups are so demanding. John Stones didn't play, so we need all the players to be fit to achieve our targets.\"\n\nAsked if Toure had been selected to allow other players to rest in preparation for Thursday morning's (Singapore time) Champions League trip to Borussia Moenchengladbach, Guardiola responded: \"It's for many, many, many reasons. Now we have Yaya. We will have Yaya during the season. He's ready and can play with us. You know the reason why (he had been left out).\"\n\nMENTALLY PREPARED\n\nMan City fans will certainly go \"ya, ya\" in agreement.\n\nToure had earlier been asked by the BBC about being clapped back into the City dressing room by his teammates and he said: \"I was prepared mentally and I knew that one day my manager would need me.\n\n\"You must always stay professional.\n\n\"I was delighted to play, it was difficult for me. I am very happy to be playing football, my teammates are very important to me. They have always been brilliant with me, always supportive. I always want to be there to help them.\"\n\nHe added: \"We knew sometimes we need to fight to win games and this was tough. Crystal Palace are in trouble and they needed a performance in front of their fans.\n\n\"City are always involved in the title race and we will keep it going.\n\n\"Maybe my prediction is it will be like 2014.

Yes, the Grand Prix has cost Singapore a lot of money, but we've also given them a lot of money.\n\n\"Singapore was suddenly more than just an airport to fly to or from somewhere.\n\n\"Now they believe they have reached their goal and they do not want a grand prix any more.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nSep 20, 2024, 11:14am\n\nSingapore gears up for another electrifying F1 weekend\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn response, a Singapore Grand Prix spokesman told The New Paper: \"We don't comment on ongoing commercial negotiations.\"\n\nEcclestone also said that he would not be surprised if some of the current manufacturers - including world champions Mercedes - quit the sport in the next few years, too.\n\n\"It could happen to us that Mercedes and Ferrari run away,\" explained the Briton.\n\n\"But honestly, if the races get better, this may not be such a terrible vision. We have to expect the manufacturers to leave us anyway.\n\n\"Mercedes will retire on the day when it suits them and it's something we had before - look at Honda, BMW and Toyota. They go when Formula 1 has done the job for them.\n\n\"There is no gratitude.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ecclestone also believes that the sport could be made more attractive by ditching the current one-race format for two shorter races.\n\nHe believes F1 would appeal more to modern audiences, sponsors and advertisers if there were two 40-minute races, separated by a gap during which drivers could be interviewed.\n\nBut he questioned whether the sport's decision-makers have the \"courage\" to make such a seismic change to the traditional schedule.\n\n\"People have a much shorter attention span and a lot of sports are looking at introducing shorter forms of their games,\" the F1 chief executive told the Sunday Times.\n\nTV AUDIENCE\n\n\"The television audience went up for Brazil. We had a long race with the heavy rain and a couple of crashes, but that meant we had two starts because of the red flags, and people tuned in.\n\n\"We need to look at the traditional concept of one long race.\n\n\"Two 40-minute races with a 40-minute break in the middle when the drivers could be interviewed, cars worked on, would be attractive to viewers, the TV companies, the sponsors, and advertisers would love it.\n\n\"Cars would qualify on a Saturday as usual for the first race and that would set the grid for the second.\n\n\"It would shake things up with lighter, faster cars.\n\n\"But I don't know if we have the courage to change.\n\n\"Times change though and it is something we must look at.\"\n\n- Wire Services.\n\nFormula 1\n\nSingapore\n\nsports\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 16, 2023, 02:23pm\n\nF1 drivers prep to work late shift in Las Vegas\n\nSep 15, 2023, 06:11am\n\n'It was like a dream': Fan spots Lewis Hamilton at Promenade ahead of S'pore Grand Prix\n\nMar 20, 2023, 12:46am\n\n'I've never seen a car so fast', says Hamilton of Red Bull\n\nNov 19, 2022, 03:44am\n\nF1 launches new all-female racing series\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Business Accounts in Singapore: Make Your Company’s Idle Cash Work Harder\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e62cb0a851e8d2fc1dac0e1ba4cb1e28454932eaf0be444168329253771db557/NP_20161121_SIN21_1446949.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Singapore Grand Prix.", "caption": "The Singapore Grand Prix.

That will also cover the cost of sending Madam Mico home by air, rehabilitation care in the Philippines and basic provisions for her family for a year.\n\nMadam Sern massaging Madam Mico's affected foot. PHOTOS COURTESY OF DORA SERN\n\nMadam Sern, who renewed Madam Mico's contract for two years in July, was aware that all foreign domestic workers had to be covered by insurance but she did not know the details of the coverage.\n\nShe found out only later that her insurance plan covers the minimum $15,000 for hospitalisation.\n\nA check online confirmed that her premium costs about $200 for a 26-month policy.\n\nMadam Sern told The New Paper on Friday: \"The insurance was paid each time we renewed her contract every two years.\n\n\"It has been 25 years since we hired her, and we are no longer in contact with any agents, so we are not aware that we can pay a higher premium for better coverage.\"\n\nMadam Mico, who has high blood pressure, has recovered significantly since she was rushed to the hospital last month.\n\nThe doctor's diagnosis was initially bleak. The family was told that she might not be able to move the right side of her body and may never speak again because she will need a tracheostomy tube in her windpipe to help her breathe.\n\nMOVED\n\nShe was later moved to the high dependency ward and eventually to a C Class ward at CGH.\n\nMadam Mico's recovery has been remarkable over the past few days - her tracheostomy tube was removed, and she can do simple exercises with her right hand.\n\nThe doctor decided she was fit to fly, and she left for Manila by air ambulance with a nurse yesterday night.\n\nShe will be transferred to a hospital near her hometown, about eight hours away from the capital.\n\nMadam Sern and her children, who are in their early 30s, took turns to keep their helper company at the hospital every day.\n\nMadam Mico (far left) is like a second mum to Madam Sern's children (front row).\n\nThey gave her massages and talked to her though she could hardly respond.\n\nMadam Sern said: \"My oldest son, Eugene, was the one who discovered her unconscious.\n\n\"He thought she was just resting but realised something amiss when he tried to wake her up for dinner.\n\n\"I couldn't stop crying when I saw her in the ICU, and I would break down again every time I was at home.\n\n\"I couldn't cry in front of her because I had to put up a strong front.\"\n\nMadam Mico, who earns $600 a month, lives with the family in a five-room flat in Sengkang.\n\nShe was an active member of Madam Sern's church.\n\nMadam Mico had been looking forward to Eugene's wedding, which was a week after her stroke.\n\nHe had planned to serve her tea at the traditional Chinese tea ceremony to thank her for raising him.\n\nMadam Sern added: \"My son couldn't hold back his tears for a few minutes in front of hundreds of people when he was giving his wedding speech in church. He was so worried about her.\"\n\nMadam Mico, a grandmother of two, also had plans to return to the Philippines after her two-year contract. Her only child, daughter Izelmae, 26, will then leave the country to make a living.\n\nMadam Sern said: \"I told her it was not her time to go yet. She still had to enjoy life on earth.\n\n\"She was so good to my family and took care of my children so well. We love her so much.\"\n\nHer youngest son, Mr Ervine Wong, 30, who works in the aerospace industry, said: \"She is part of my family, and she was like our second mum when our mum was busy working.\n\n\"Aunty was the one we interacted with, and we would chat and share about our lives with her every day.\"\n\nIt has been 25 years since we hired her, and we are no longer in contact with any agents, so we are not aware that we can pay a higher premium for better coverage.\n\n- Madam Dora Sern\n\nOpt for better coverage\n\nBy\n\nLinette Heng\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Linette Heng\n\nEmployers need to buy medical insurance with coverage of at least $15,000 a year for hospitalisation fees such as inpatient care and day surgery during their foreign domestic worker's (FDW) stay here.\n\nThis covers 97 per cent of all inpatient and day surgery bills at public hospitals, said Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say in a parliamentary written reply in August.\n\nHe was responding to a question posed by Mr Patrick Tay, an MP for West Coast GRC, about the recourse that employers can take if their domestic helper has an underlying mental illness, cancer or critical illness.\n\nMr Lim added: \"For the minority of employers who face genuine difficulties in paying their FDWs' medical bills, they can seek assistance from medical social workers at the relevant healthcare institutions.\"\n\nHe also suggested individual employers could voluntarily buy additional insurance for greater coverage, or send their FDWs for more medical examinations before employment to check for pre-existing illnesses.\n\nMost basic plans offered by insurance companies cost under $250 for 26 months of coverage.\n\nOn average, a 26-month plan will cost about $100 more if the hospitalisation coverage is doubled from $15,000 to $30,000.\n\nThe plans also include personal accident insurance with a minimum coverage of $40,000.\n\nFDW employment agencies told The New Paper that they usually advise their clients to choose an insurance plan with higher coverage.\n\nMs Shirley Ng, director of Orange Employment Agency, said most clients choose the basic plans for younger helpers and are willing to pay a higher premium only if they are hiring a helper above 35 years old.\n\nShe said: \"The increase in premium is marginal, but it can make a difference because if your helper is unwell, she is your responsibility until the doctor certifies she is fit to fly home.\"\n\nMr Gabriel Ee, director of Island Maids, said: \"Some employers do not see the necessity (for a more expensive plan) and will just buy a basic plan because it is rare for medical bills to go beyond $15,000.\n\n\"But it can get painful if you are the exception. The extra coverage will buy you peace of mind.\"\n\nBy\n\nLinette Heng\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Linette Heng\n\nDOMESTIC HELPER\n\nlove\n\nFamily\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 27, 2025, 03:46am\n\nDomestic helper jailed for stealing $12,000 from elderly employers\n\nJul 29, 2024, 09:00pm\n\nNetizens divided over making maids sleep in bomb shelter\n\nJun 6, 2024, 09:00pm\n\nMaid goes MIA on mum of 4 undergoing confinement\n\nApr 30, 2024, 10:38am\n\nLabour of Love: From maid to 'second mother'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nHow Budget 2025 Will Help Workers Across All Career Stages\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8fc5f600b00508eccaa49afd28eac1392b13eb24fa5f547bfb44f96e9cbdceb0/40593282_-_18_11_2016_-_lhhelper21.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Madam Dora Sern praying with her domestic helper Felicidad Muna Mico, who has since moved to a normal ward.", "caption": "Madam Dora Sern praying with her domestic helper Felicidad Muna Mico, who has since moved to a normal ward.

Some small companies here have built charity-giving into their businesses. MOHAMED FIRDAUS AL-AMIN (aamfir@sph.com.sg) speaks to three which support SPCA\n\nShare this article\n\nMany customers who use FussPro Services to clean their homes are pet owners.\n\nMost of the pets, FussPro found out, had been adopted from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).\n\nBeing pet lovers themselves, the team at FussPro decided they would do something to support the SPCA.\n\nLast month, they launched a promo code, BEKIND, on their website.\n\nCustomers who apply the code when booking cleaning services will have 10 per cent of their bills donated to the SPCA.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 30, 2025, 09:34am\n\n'It was never smooth sailing': Dog welfare group ex-president reflects on 13 years at the helm\n\nMore related stories\n\nFussPro co-founder Ken Yee Liew, 30, told The New Paper that although the amount donated is not going towards the business, he is confident it can still help his brand.\n\n\"The amount that we donate can be used for mainstream marketing and advertising, which is a key component for any company wanting to grow its business,\" he said.\n\n\"However, donations to charities like SPCA is also a form of marketing, which can help drive more meaningful business. It makes us happy knowing that we are contributing in our small way to these causes.\"\n\nThe firm also offers complimentary spot and stain treatment as part of its cleaning procedure, as it learnt that accidents can occur despite the pets being trained.\n\nFussPro was founded in 2014 and has six people in its key team and more than 100 cleaners and staff.\n\nENCOURAGING\n\nMr Ken said the feedback from his customers has been encouraging, with many urging the firm to continue supporting the SPCA.\n\nHis advice for other small businesses looking to give back?\n\n\"Look for organisations whose beneficiaries have problems that your business solves,\" he said.\n\n\"Find out how you can help them. If possible, work to be a part of that community and through these communities, you can explore cross-marketing opportunities.\"\n\nHome Cleanz, founded in 2004, is another cleaning service that donates to the SPCA.\n\nWith about 70 cleaning and laundry staff, the business had been looking for ways to give back to society.\n\nIn April, it started giving $2 to the SPCA for every spring cleaning service.\n\nThe spring cleaning packages range from $300 to $600.\n\nAccording to Ms Angie Chua, marketing executive at HomeCleanz, the firm does not find it difficult to donate and is willing to help.\n\nMs Chua said: \"There are many charities out there for old folk, families in need and people with disabilities.

And luckily, I got my fingertips to it.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old shot-stopper revealed that one of his pre-match rituals helped him get his size 10.5 gloves to the ball.\n\n\"I always give myself a pep talk before games,\" said Hassan.\n\n\"I tell myself, 'Whatever it is, just try, you never know if you'll get there... Just don't freeze'.\n\n\"So that actually helped me, especially towards the end, when I was tired and had muscle cramps in my calf and thigh, and the referee thought I was (play-acting).\"\n\nHassan was even given a yellow card when he went down complaining of cramps in the final 10 minutes.\n\nWhat mattered most was that he extended his remarkable record in national colours since V Sundramoorthy took over in late May.\n\nHassan has now gone 585 minutes without conceding a goal from open play in a Lions' shirt.\n\nHe was beaten thrice in the 3-1 defeat by Bahrain in Riffa in September, but all three goals came from the penalty spot.\n\nThe last goal from open play that beat the goalkeeper was in June, when Vietnam defeated Singapore 3-0 after extra time in the AYA Bank Cup final in Yangon.\n\n\"When you are on the field, you don't really look at the stats or think of the numbers,\" he said.\n\n\"But good stats are worth looking at, and something like this is a boost for my confidence.\n\nCLEAN SHEETS\n\n\"Seven games is a long run and (the statistic) is nice to have, but I prefer to win matches and not just have clean sheets but not win.\"\n\nHassan, who plies his trade in Thailand for Army United - recently relegated to the second division - is looking forward to the Lions' next game, against the Thais tomorrow.\n\nHe said: \"I pretty much know all of their players, from Kawin (Thamsatchanan) to Teerasil (Dangda).\n\n\"Against the Thais, we need to cover the space, follow our men, and beware of the third man running.\n\n\"If you look at their physique, they are not the same size as the Aussies or Iranians, or even the Koreans and Japanese.\n\n\"But, in terms of their play, I think they are just one level below Japan.\n\n\"Just look at the way they scored against Australia (in a 2-2 draw in a World Cup qualifier last week) - Chanathip (Songkrasin) fooled four players with just one pass.\n\n\"We cannot let them have time with the ball. Once they have a good look and find the running man, the next thing you know, they're behind us.\"\n\nThe fatigue factor is a concern for Sundram, as he prepares his team to face the Thais, who beat Indonesia 4-2 in their opening game on Saturday.\n\n\"Obviously, it's a factor,\" Sundram told TNP yesterday. \"Our boys had to run a lot to make up for (Hafiz) and had to put in extra effort.\n\n\"But, hopefully, the players' recovery sessions will do them good.\"\n\nThe players who played against the Philippines on Saturday did light recovery training at the team's Novotel Hotel base yesterday, while the rest trained at the Ateneo de Manila University.\n\nFATIGUE\n\nBesides fatigue, Sundram has some selection issues.\n\nHafiz is suspended, right back Faritz Hameed picked up a dead leg in the last match and Mustafic Fahrudin left the squad yesterday after his father died in Serbia.\n\nBut Hassan said the squad have been lifted by the positive response to their battling display against the Philippines, who are the top-ranked Asean team (124th). Singapore are ranked 171st.\n\n\"From what we saw on social media, the fans appreciate our effort,\" said the custodian. \"That's something we did not get for the past few matches.\n\n\"The Thailand game will be totally different to the one against the Philippines, and we go into the game as the underdogs again.\n\n\"No one gave us a chance against the Philippines, but now that we have the belief in the team, we can go out there and do it again.\"\n\n585\n\nLions goalkeeper Hassan Sunny has now gone 585 minutes without conceding a goal from open play. He was beaten thrice in the 3-1 defeat by Bahrain in Riffa in September, but all three goals came from the penalty spot.\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nsuzuki cup\n\nSingapore\n\nthailand\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 2, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nHassan in limbo: Thai club set to cancel contract with year left\n\nNov 30, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSundram: Who says I'm a defensive coach?\n\nNov 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nBack to the drawing board for Singapore football\n\nNov 26, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nAmri defends Sundram's tactics\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5053b8106a579464bd46c944990cb9d084e6bec26724f5f18ac79b30fae138ff/NP_20161121_SZSOC21_1446965.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "FAMILIAR FOES: Lions goalkeeper Hassan Sunny, who plays for Thai club Army United, is looking forward to facing the likes of Thai striker Teerasil Dangda in their Group A clash tomorrow.", "caption": "FAMILIAR FOES: Lions goalkeeper Hassan Sunny, who plays for Thai club Army United, is looking forward to facing the likes of Thai striker Teerasil Dangda in their Group A clash tomorrow.

We are really happy to have jobs we are passionate about,\" said Hana.\n\nBaozi joked that his nickname, which means bun in Mandarin, came about \"because I was a bit chubby when I started cosplaying, and my face looked like a bun\".\n\nHana's handle, meaning \"flower\" in Japanese, is from Japanese romance film Hana And Alice.\n\nThe duo met at a Chinese cosplay event in 2011 and have been cosplaying together for five years.\n\n\"Hana is better at make-up and editing pictures, while I am good at making props and accessories. So the two of us together can complete any kind of cosplay,\" said Baozi.\n\nSaid Hana: \"When we started cosplaying, we would slowly teach ourselves how to do make-up by watching online tutorials.\n\n\"We would analyse how to replicate different looks on our faces, and which kind of cosmetics and make-up styles suited us.\"\n\n(From left) Hana as Natsume Takashi and Baozi as Natori Shuuichi from Natsume Yuujinchou.

But there is no point wasting time and energy on people who don't like you, while ignoring the friends who have always supported you.\"\n\nIndeed, Baozi and Hana are looking forward to meeting their local fans at AFA, which Baozi called \"their No. 1 favourite event\".\n\n\"This is our fourth time attending AFA Singapore, and we are happy and excited to meet everyone again.\"\n\nBy\n\nLisa Twang\n\nRead articles by Lisa Twang\n\nCosplay\n\nSingapore\n\nChina\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 22, 2023, 03:40am\n\nGuests turn up in cosplay for couple's anime-themed wedding\n\nAug 31, 2023, 12:43pm\n\nI cry and then make TikToks for same people who destroyed me: Cosplayer Rurusama\n\nFeb 16, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nAll aboard for Cosplay on the high seas\n\nJan 2, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nTying the knot in epic fashion\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nCOURTS\n\nBosch Appliances on Sale: Hood, Hob, Oven, Washer, Dryer & More\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/eee9243552fbb05468604cfd1330fe641cc8ca4181321897f4a6a00f07c36b4e/NP_20161121_LTCOS21-5QR_1446895.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "TRANSFORMED: Hana as Shingo and Baozi as Keiichi Kagami from Kuroneko Kareshi no Asobikata.", "caption": "TRANSFORMED: Hana as Shingo and Baozi as Keiichi Kagami from Kuroneko Kareshi no Asobikata.

They include concept art, illustrations, animations and comics.\n\nIt traces its roots to a community of anime enthusiasts who draw and have fun together, said the studio's co-founder and general manager, Mr Ng Kian Chuan, 31, who prefers to be known as KC.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 25, 2024, 09:00pm\n\nFriends throw Honkai party for man with muscular dystrophy\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn 2013, one of its artists, Mr Low Zi Rong, 32 drew what he envisioned to be Internet Explorer,as a person.\n\nKC said: \"We uploaded our designs on Facebook and Microsoft Singapore approached us to develop one of our designs, the Internet Explorer character Inori Aizawa. In the end, they bought over the rights for the character's design and artworks. We were then commissioned to do the animation, additional artworks, and comic series. \"\n\nFrom August 2013, they worked tirelessly to develop the Inori Aizawa character.\n\nThey created five different storyboard ideas for the animation, ranging from the classic schoolgirl to a ramen delivery concept, before settling for a storyline of a girl who transforms to an all-action heroine fighting against robots.\n\nIt became an instant hit when it debuted at Anime Festival Asia Singapore 2013 in Nov 2013.\n\nSaid KC: \"Our Inori Aizawa animation video went viral. The KPI (key performance indicator) we had to meet for the video was 2 million views within two months. We hit that number within two days.\"\n\nHe credits the project for bringing to life their dream of setting up a studio.\n\n\"If Microsoft had not approached us, we might not have established this company. The idea was always there, but their capital was the spark that allowed us to set it up,\" he said.\n\nSustaining success now requires continual effort, especially against regional competition.\n\nKC said: \"Our focus is the overseas market as most of our clients are from overseas. But focusing on the international market is tough - we compete with other illustration studios in the region like in Thailand and Indonesia who are able to offer clients more competitive rates.\"\n\nThe team soldiered on and have undertaken several projects for major clients, including Faber-Castell, Ninja Division, and Anime Festival Asia.\n\nKC said: \"We never thought of giving up. After all, we've been talking about doing this (having an illustration studio) for a long time. What is there to regret when you are pursuing a dream?\"\n\nANIME FEST\n\nThis year, Collateral Damage will make its presence felt at the Anime Festival Asia Singapore 2016 - the region's largest and most followed Japanese popular culture and anime festival. It will be held at Suntec City Convention and Exhibition Centre (level 3 and 4) this week, from Friday to Sunday.\n\nKC, a regular attendee and participant since the event was first organised in 2008, has observed its growth through the years.\n\nHe said: \"At the start there were about five creative booths, but it has got much bigger. It's the biggest anime platform in Singapore, and perhaps the region. It's good that the platform for amateur artists is more (robust) now; it's definitely beneficial for artists.\"\n\nAnime Festival Asia's executive festival director Shawn Chin said there are more than 200 exhibiting booths this year.\n\nApart from setting up a booth at the anime festival, Collateral Damage is also looking to expand its horizons.\n\n\"I won't call it an expansion, but rather an expedition. Two of us will be looking and negotiating with various American clients,\" KC said.\n\nThe KPI we had to meet for the video was 2 million views within two months. We hit that number within two days.\n\n- Mr Ng Kian Chuan on how the studio's Inori Aizawa animation went viral.\n\nBy\n\nKintan Andanari\n\nRead articles by Kintan Andanari\n\nanime\n\nSingapore\n\nTechnology\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 17, 2024, 06:03am\n\nHaikyu!!

He's a player who is very important for us.\n\n\"It wasn't ideal to have Harry on the pitch for 96 minutes, that's true, but it's difficult to take him off when you need to win the game.\n\n\"In the end, we pushed him but now he's very happy with the energy and that can help him recover.\"\n\nSpurs' unbeaten record was in jeopardy after Michail Antonio headed West Ham into a first-half lead.\n\nThey equalised through youngster Harry Winks, who lashed in the rebound after Vincent Janssen's shot was blocked on his full English Premier League debut.\n\nBut Manuel Lanzini put the Hammers back in front after Winston Reid was brought down in the area by Janssen.\n\nHowever, Kane's late heroics meant more misery for West Ham, who remain just a point above the relegation zone.\n\nThat misery deepened yet further during the six minutes of stoppage time after stand-in skipper Reid was sent off for a second booking.\n\n\"You can imagine it's very difficult to take this kind of defeat in a derby when there are four minutes to go and you're a goal up and you're thinking about killing the game,\" said manager Slaven Bilic.\n\n\"We had really good opportunities to kill the game off but, unfortunately, it wasn't to be.\n\n\"For the penalty, Son did a really good move and our player went down a little bit too quickly.\n\n\"Our penalty, to be fair, I didn't see.

The Monaco game is a must-win, we're excited, we'll train tomorrow and travel on Monday.\"\n\nThe victory also means that Tottenham remain unbeaten in the Premier League after 12 games this season. - PA Sport.\n\nepl\n\ntottenham hotspur\n\nWest Ham United\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nFind the Best Fixed Deposit Rates\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/03b51142a3a1cf22fdbaefc2e4cacff6b26deafdf6412efe27aa0d71c0ec4221/NP_20161121_POCH21_1446810.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "BACK IN BUSINESS: Harry Kane (above) nets two late goals to rescue Spurs.", "caption": "BACK IN BUSINESS: Harry Kane (above) nets two late goals to rescue Spurs.

We were just a bit unlucky and a bit imprecise with our final ball. We have to take this defeat and move on.\"\n\nWith Leipzig extending their unbeaten start to the season to 11 games on Friday, defeat also meant Bayern lost top spot in the Bundesliga.\n\n\"What's there to say? We lost,\" said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm. \"The last pass was missing for us, especially in the first half. We had plenty of chances, while Dortmund only had a few, but we didn't take our chances and that's why we lost today.\n\n\"The league's now exciting and that is what everybody wants, isn't it?\"\n\nTuchel believes Leipzig can emulate Leicester and win the Bundesliga title against the odds this season.\n\n\"Leipzig are no flash in the pan,\" said Tuchel. \"They are to be taken absolutely seriously. It is comparable with what happened last season in England, the phenomenon which was Leicester City.\n\n\"Leipzig can go exactly the same way.

It was pretty brutal for me,\" he said. \"To have come that close and miss it (the final); it's like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.\n\n\"To know that you had it only to let it slip away,\" he said.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who is gunning for a medal at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, added: \"This only makes me look forward to Tokyo 2020 and I'm really excited and looking forward to see what Team Singapore can do there... we have a lot of potential.\"\n\nOlympic champ gets busy\n\nHe dabbled in a bit of golf on Friday, hours after he arrived home from Houston, Texas, where he's been busy studying at university and training, with the world championships scheduled in Budapest next July.\n\nYesterday, Singapore's swimming superstar Joseph Schooling officially started a busy week when he launched the Watsons Dream Tree initiative, which is aimed at supporting those with dreams and passion to come forward and share with members of the community, and be a force for change.\n\nMembers of the public can pen their wishes on tree props set up outside selected Watsons stores.\n\nWISH CAME TRUE: Bryan Liu, 11, one of the five children with life-threatening illnesses from Make-A-Wish Foundation Singapore, got his wish fulfilled when he met Joseph Schooling in person at the launch of Watsons Dream Tree Initiative. PHOTO COURTESY OF WATSONS SINGAPORE\n\nWatsons also donated $5,000 to the Make-A-Wish Foundation Singapore (MAWF), a cause supported by the 21-year-old swim sensation, as part of the launch.\n\nSchooling, Singapore's first Olympic gold medallist when he won the 100m butterfly at the Rio Games in August, joined Watsons Singapore to launch the initiative.\n\nFive children, aged nine to 15, from the MAWF were chosen to kick off the initiative ahead of Christmas.\n\nIt was a dream come true for the children to meet Schooling, and nine-year-old Raphael Lim, said: \"I am very happy to be able to meet Joseph Schooling today. His victory has inspired me to pursue my own hopes and dreams!\"\n\nA crowd of around a 100 people turned up to see their hero and Schooling was happy to witness the excitement and enthusiasm.\n\n\"Dreams do come true if one believes in them,\" he said. \"I'm blessed and thankful that I can accomplish the things I dreamt of as a little kid. Everyone should have the opportunity to realise their dreams, and I am very happy to be able to work with Make-A-Wish Foundation Singapore and Watsons Singapore to help grant wishes of children who are faced with life-threatening illnesses.\"\n\nBy\n\nCatherine Robert\n\nRead articles by Catherine Robert\n\njoseph schooling\n\nSwimming\n\nOlympics\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 12, 2024, 03:02pm\n\nEnd 'witch-hunt', says Schooling on controversy\n\nApr 2, 2024, 08:44am\n\nJoseph Schooling used to search for own name on Google\n\nApr 2, 2024, 06:57am\n\nPM Lee, Edwin Tong pay tribute to Joseph Schooling\n\nMar 1, 2023, 08:09am\n\nSchooling out of Singapore's SEA Games team, first time since 2011\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nFind the Best Fixed Deposit Rates\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/24345f48278f442bf65490aa06862bd0b982208f89f0ba557df6ccc3694fc120/026b8f5e.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "He has a packed schedule but Joseph Schooling is glad that he is able to give back.", "caption": "He has a packed schedule but Joseph Schooling is glad that he is able to give back.

All, except goals.\n\nIf this is where Liverpool's early season fairytale begins to unravel, Klopp cannot argue that he had not been amply forewarned.\n\nFifa's scheduling previously put the brakes on a five-game winning streak in all competitions for Liverpool until the beginning of last month.\n\nConfronting opponents able to frustrate them in doubling up defensively has also not helped; clearly Southampton had taken notes of Manchester United's bus parking exercise at Anfield.\n\nEven on the occasions when the hosts' back line found itself breached after the interval, the post-international break lethargy reared its ugly head for a Liverpool trident which would have previously been backed to comfortably plunder Fraser Forster's goalmouth.\n\nHANGOVERS\n\nForster did his part in repelling numerous attempts but Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino, a potent partnership for both club and country, still appeared to be ridden with hangovers in front of goal following their belated, long-haul returns.\n\nThe threat of Coutinho's potential absence from the game on the English coast had triggered inevitable concern but, in truth, the Brazilian and his compatriot would have been far better served in operating as impact substitutes instead of leading the line.\n\nKlopp's attempt to right a similar wrong emerged far too late; Daniel Sturridge may be brimming with confidence after enjoying some overdue time in the on-field spotlight but continues to toil when presented limited opportunity at the fulcrum of Liverpool's attack.\n\nKlopp drew on further options from his bench, but they arrived with little time to make a greater impact.\n\nAn additional but unspoiled four minutes of additional time saw Divock Origi's introduction appear a desperate a last roll of the dice than it should have proved.\n\nFor all Liverpool's complaints of what lies in store over the festive period, Klopp will be relieved that the next genuine threat to his side's title credentials currently lies some way off on the fixture list.\n\nSOUTHAMPTON:\n\nFraser Forster, Cedric Soares, Jose Fonte, Virgil van Dijk, Ryan Bertrand, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (Harrison Reed 77), Oriol Romeu, Steven Davis, Nathan Redmond, Charlie Austin (Jay Rodriguez 74), Sofiane Boufal (Shane Long 65)\n\nLIVERPOOL:\n\nLoris Karius, Nathaniel Clyne, Joel Matip, Dejan Lovren, James Milner, Georginio Wijnaldum, Jordan Henderson, Emre Can (Daniel Sturridge 77), Sadio Mane (Divock Origi 90+2), Roberto Firmino, Philippe Coutinho\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nepl\n\nliverpool\n\nSouthampton\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThe Underrated Strategy That Keeps Your Investments on Track\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c6dff61c299a42b86deb26e767573a1554df52a9f2665fb5a227114b4a33cfc4/NP_20161120_RBSOC20_1446332.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "FRUSTRATED: Liverpool's (from right) Roberto Firmino is stopped in his tracks by Jose Fonte and Charlie Austin of Southampton.", "caption": "FRUSTRATED: Liverpool's (from right) Roberto Firmino is stopped in his tracks by Jose Fonte and Charlie Austin of Southampton.

article\n\nMAN UNITED 1\n\n(Juan Mata 69)\n\nARSENAL 1\n\n(Olivier Giroud 89)\n\nFor 88 minutes at Old Trafford yesterday, it looked like the same old story for Arsene Wenger against his nemesis, Jose Mourinho.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn 11 previous meetings against the Gunners, Mourinho had never lost a Premier League game.\n\nIndeed, Wenger's only win in 15 encounters as a manager in any competition against the Portuguese came in the Community Shield last season.\n\nWhen Juan Mata gave United the lead midway through the second half of a game the hosts dominated from start to finish, it seemed Wenger would once again walk away empty handed from a ground where his teams have so often been humbled, if not crushed.\n\nHow it didn't happen again will have Mourinho and United fans scratching their heads from now until May.\n\nAt the end of it all, the Portuguese could not contain his disappointment.\n\n\"We were the best team by far,\" he said. \"They had no chances to win.\n\n\"We scored a fantastic goal, we had chances to win the game and then the only time they go there and the only time we had a situation we could not resolve, they scored.\n\nOf all Arsenal's recent visits, this was arguably their poorest performance yet, but when you have a predator like Olivier Giroud on the bench, you always have a chance - especially against a United side that still, even under Mourinho, have not learnt the art of finishing games off.\n\nApart from a tame Alexis Sanchez header that should have found the target and some choice fruity chants aimed at Mourinho by the travelling fans, the opening exchanges produced little to shout about at a somewhat subdued Old Trafford.\n\nLate in the first half, however, the game burst into life when United were denied a strong penalty claim after Nacho Monreal impeded Antonio Valencia with an outstretched arm.\n\nReferee Andre Marriner deemed Valencia went down too easily, a borderline decision but one that infuriated Mourinho.\n\nAnywhere else on the pitch and it would surely have been given as a foul.\n\nGoals have been in short supply at Old Trafford this season but without the suspended Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Mourinho had every reason to feel aggrieved at half-time after seeing Petr Cech save smartly from Mata and Anthony Martial, while David de Gea was a virtual spectator.\n\nIndeed, Arsenal had been surprisingly unimaginative with Sanchez, nominally their centre forward, spending far too much time in deep positions and both Mesut Oezil and Theo Walcott were hardly a threat.\n\nTo put their display into perspective, it was the first time since April that the Gunners had failed to register a single first-half shot on target.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson was all smiles as he made his way out of the directors' box at the interval.\n\nON THE PROWL\n\nThe home side continued to show plenty of energy and pace and looked far less frail in central midfield than of late as Michael Carrick slotted in alongside Paul Pogba.\n\nBut not for the first time this season, their attacking play lacked craft, with Marcus Rashford too easily bundled off the ball by the Arsenal back four and not enough players prepared to get into the box.\n\nIt cried out for Wayne Rooney, United's second highest scorer of all time behind Bobby Charlton, who was again relegated to the bench for what Mourinho insisted beforehand were tactical reasons rather than anything to do with his much-publicised antics while on England duty last week.\n\nSure enough, on 62 minutes, Rooney replaced the ineffective Anthony Martial while Daley Blind was sent on for Matteo Darmian, who was perhaps fortunate not to have received a second yellow in the first half that would have reduced United to 10 men.\n\nThe Red Devils continued to control proceedings against a poor Arsenal side and it was no surprise when the visitors fell behind midway through the second half.\n\nAnder Herrera sent a dream cut-back into Mata's path and the former Chelsea man finished with aplomb from 15 metres.\n\nIt was the first time Arsenal, unbeaten since the opening day of the campaign, had been behind away from home.\n\nOn came Giroud to try and rescue a point, though in truth, the Gunners didn't deserve anything from what was an abysmal display by their own high standards.\n\nBut United paid the price for their failure to add to their lead, and with their only worthwhile effort two minutes from time, Arsenal got out of jail.\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain beat Rashford too easily and whipped in a cross and fellow substitute Giroud jumped above three defenders to power in a bullet header.\n\nMourinho, desperate for United to go on a run in the chase for the top four, often wrongly claims there is no justice.\n\nThis time he would be right, though critics would argue this kind of setback will continue until he settles on a regular starting 11 and a back four he can rely on.\n\nOTHER RESULTS\n\nCrystal Palace 1 Man City 2\n\nEverton 1 Swansea 1\n\nSouthampton 0 Liverpool 0\n\nStoke 0

I've worked very hard and it just goes to show that your hard work will eventually pay off.\"\n\nRusyaidi's parents and big sister were present at the event yesterday and dad Salime, a boarding officer, said: \"We are very proud and extremely happy.\n\n\"My favourite sport is football and, ever since Rusyaidi started playing with the Garena Young Lions, I have always been going down to his games and supporting him.\n\nDISCIPLINE\n\n\"I just hope he will not stop working hard and that he will continue to work on his stamina with discipline.\"\n\nMum Rohaizah, a full-time housewife, said: \"I don't know much about football, but I can only pray he will do his best in whatever his passion is.\n\n\"If I had to choose between his studies and football, of course I would want him to focus on his studies.\n\n\"Studies still come first no matter what, but I'm very proud of him.\"\n\nAn initiative of The New Paper, in collaboration with the Football Association of Singapore, the award is named after the late Singapore international Dollah Kassim, who delighted so many during the 1970s with his attacking skills and was affectionately known as the \"Gelek King.\"\n\nDominic Nathan, editor of The New Paper, believes the award can be used as a platform to boost Singapore football.\n\n\"This award does recognise the past and the present, but we also hope to build something for the future,\" he said.\n\n\"This award can be used as a platform to build the future, especially when we've seen good players emerge as winners over the last few years who could potentially flourish in national colours.\n\n\"The award is meaningful, it honours a football legend in Singapore, Dollah Kassim, so in a way, it is an initiative to contribute back to Singapore football.\"\n\n\"I've worked very hard and it just goes to show that your hard work will eventually pay off.\"\n\n- Rusyaidi Salime\n\nBy\n\nSwetha Sundararajan\n\nRead articles by Swetha

It's \"post-truth\".\n\nAnd \"post-truth\" is Oxford's true Word of the Year.\n\nBut isn't \"post-truth\" also two words?\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 10:28am\n\n'Only one gantry working': Commuters fume over EWL delays and overcrowded MRT stations\n\nMore related stories\n\nNo, the hyphen joins the two words to make it a compound word, which is counted as one word.\n\nBut ironically, in a post-truth world which we live in now, \"post-truth\" feels like two words.\n\nWhat does it mean anyway?\n\nYou want the meaning of \"post-truth\"? You can't handle the meaning of \"post-truth\"!\n\nOxford defines it as an adjective \"relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief\".\n\nI told you that you couldn't handle it.\n\nTo cut all that verbiage, Oxford could've just used a picture of US president-elect Donald Trump.\n\n\"Post-truth\" was chosen because \"Oxford Dictionaries has seen a spike in frequency this year in the context of the EU (European Union) referendum in the United Kingdom and the presidential election in the United States\".\n\nBut can \"post-truth\" apply to Singapore too?\n\nTake, for example, this online Straits Times headline that appeared on Friday: \"North-South, East-West MRT lines show best performance in 29-year history.\"\n\nI don't know about you, but I take everything I read from The Straits Times as an objective fact.\n\nHowever, in a post-truth world, this online headline went against my personal belief.\n\nIt's right up there with other dubious public transport-related headlines like \"Bus fares will be affordable if raised\" and \"Rise in major breakdowns but MRT gets more reliable\".\n\nAnd I wasn't the only one who felt that way, judging by the reactions on social media like \"You're kidding??!!!\" and \"Hahahahaahaa\".\n\nOn The Straits Times' Facebook page, the report was greeted with some incredulity. Someone commented: \"Joke of the day. I laughed till I almost hit the car in front!\"\n\nAnother: \"I smell breakdowns coming... they always have a way to jinx the MRT.\"\n\nThe latter comment was prescient as later that day, SMRT tweeted: \"Due to a track fault, pls add 10 mins travel time from Tanah Merah to Bugis towards Joo Koon.\"\n\nAWARDS\n\nThis sort of thing has happened before, of course.\n\nIn February last year, SMRT received the award for Delivering Value Through Risk Management in London.\n\nAlmost immediately after that, the MRT train delays started with four incidents over five days, including a fire that shut down the entire Bukit Panjang LRT system.\n\nFive months later at the SMRT annual general meeting, CEO Desmond Kuek announced winning another award for Best Public Sector Campaign given by the Singapore Institute of Public Relations.\n\nHours later, both the North-South Line and East-West Line were shut down during evening rush hour.\n\nThe breakdown was so epic, songs were written about it.\n\nA month later, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew quit.\n\nSo did it happen again last week?\n\nAs it turned out, the online Straits Times headline was wrong.\n\nWhat the online report actually said was: \"The North-South and East-West MRT lines achieved 144,000 train-km before breakdown in the first 10 months of this year, the best recorded performance for the two lines in recent years.\"\n\nAnd \"The North-South and East-West lines started operating 29 years ago.\"\n\nThe headline on The Straits Times website has since been corrected to read: \"North-South, East-West MRT lines show best performance for first 10 months of 2016.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the error is preserved in the web page's URL itself,\n\nwww.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/north-south-east-west-mrt-lines...\n\n.\n\nAnd I have the screengrab.\n\nAs they say, the Internet is forever.\n\nAnd that's the post-truth and nothing but the post-truth.\n\nMeanwhile, to avoid getting stuck in a train breakdown in the near future, I recommend you take a Chinese helicopter instead.\n\nBut remember to add a hyphen.\n\nAs Spandau Ballet sang, I know this much is post-true.\n\nBy\n\nS M Ong\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by S M Ong\n\nsmrt\n\nmrt\n\nCOLUMNS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 12:32am\n\nPassenger injured after bottle thrown at bus leaves hole in window\n\nJul 3, 2025, 01:58am\n\nPower fault halts train service across entire Bukit Panjang LRT line\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:10pm\n\nWhat triggered the six-day EWL MRT disruption in September 2024\n\nJun 3, 2025, 03:00am\n\nCar hits cyclist, rear-ends bus in Jalan Besar crash;

It is not every rider's cup of tea but it possesses a cool engine.\n\nCool, as in it's not only unique-looking, but the engine runs cooler.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 20, 2025, 08:09am\n\nGroom-to-be killed in crash during ride to father's grave\n\nMore related stories\n\nThis is not a full-on review of the Road Glide Special, but we are stating what's obvious at first glance.\n\nMy first impressions were formed recently after taking the Road Glide Special on a 30-minute ride along smaller roads and expressways. Surprisingly, the familiar right thigh roasting effect is now gone.\n\nThe engineers have built the latest Milwaukee-Eight 107 ci engine - that's 1,750cc to the uninitiated - from the ground up.\n\nThe heat loss is explained by the muscular-looking cylinder heads with a new oil cooling system.\n\nA redesigned exhaust system - with its catalytic converter now further aft - also helps to draw heat away from the rider's thighs.\n\nYou'll notice the reduction in vibration just by taking note of the handlebar when the bike is idling.\n\nOur short journey was made more comfortable, thanks to a counter-balancer in the single-cam engine.\n\nThe ninth-generation engine also judders less in sixth gear especially at lower speeds. I was half-expecting the engine to bog in top gear at about 60kmh and roughly 1,200rpm showing on the clocks. But it didn't.\n\nPOLITE\n\nNow some purists may miss the mechanical-sounding \"clank\" when shifting gears. The sound is now more \"polite\" on the smoother transmission.\n\nOverall, the 2017 Road Glide Special still rumbles to the V-twin tune and pulls harder than before, thanks to the increased displacement and torque.\n\nBut for 2017, these aren't the only improvements coming your way. Every Harley touring model gets better suspension with improved comfort and confidence in handling.\n\nLow Rider models will also possess a touch of sophistication with keyless ignition.\n\nWIN A HARLEY AT BIG WALK\n\nAnd yes, the Street 750, which made its Hollywood debut in 2015's Avengers: Age Of Ultron superhero movie, will boast anti-lock brakes, a security system and new paint schemes.\n\nThis awesome bike will also be given away to one lucky winner at The New Paper Courts Big Walk at the Singapore Zoo on Nov 26.\n\nRemember to get your entry form when you collect your goodie bag. Bring along the form on the day of the Big Walk and just drop it in the contest box at the Harley-Davidson Motorcycles booth at the zoo.\n\nIt's a chance that should not be missed.\n\nAnd just in case you forget to take part, there will be visual reminders in the form of two Street 750 motorcycles placed near the start and finish lines of the Big Walk.\n\nGood luck!\n\nBy\n\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Zaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nmotorcycle\n\nSingapore Zoo\n\nREVIEWS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 14, 2025, 07:48am\n\nMotorcyclist risks life to rescue drunk man on expressway\n\nDec 12, 2024, 08:07am\n\nTeck Whye Lane rider mounts divider, sparks outrage\n\nDec 6, 2024, 07:48am\n\nMotorcyclist's close call with runaway truck caught on video\n\nAug 20, 2024, 07:25am\n\nPedestrian's close call with motorcyclist: Whose fault?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/573d01de4a1c6c2bf349664c85df77dfe72902643cce51751764fcdcd5bab4e0/NP_20161120_BIKER20-A40_1444313.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "LOWER TEMPS: Harley-Davidson Singapore sales manager Willy Low explaining the secret behind the 2017 Road Glide Special's cooler engine", "caption": "LOWER TEMPS: Harley-Davidson Singapore sales manager Willy Low explaining the secret behind the 2017 Road Glide Special's cooler engine PHOTO COURTESY OF VELLAVAN GUNASEKARAN"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6448b5db68b684941fb43500f59d68139de24dd59758bf17b4932b387c417953/groomtobe_0.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Groom-to-be killed in crash during ride to father's grave", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1cb036870b873efeabbac71c2fb8d8abd22069db10cb5c55d776f8a338244b99/traffic.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Motorcyclist risks life to rescue drunk man on expressway", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

president of Sentosa Golf Club, at the inaugural tee-off of the New Tanjong yesterday.\n\nPHOTO COURTESY OF SENTOSA GOLF CLUB\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nNov 19, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nNew Tanjong, newer charm\n\nMajor makeover leaves Sentosa with two championship courses\n\nShare this article\n\nSentosa Golf Club (SGC) members face a dilemma.\n\nBut it is a happy one.\n\nWith the completion of the redevelopment of the club's New Tanjong Course, members can choose between two world-class courses.\n\nThe award-winning Serapong Course's reputation is already established, after staging some of the biggest events on the global golf calendar, namely the Singapore Open.\n\nAnd the New Tanjong is poised to give \"Big Brother\" a run for its money with its slew of quality changes.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTiger Woods moots part-time return\n\nMore related stories\n\nOne hundred Sentosa members and their guests had the opportunity to tee off on the New Tanjong at a special preview yesterday.\n\nThey came together to pledge a total of $50,000 for the beneficiaries of Assisi Hospice & ARC Children's Charity by buying the inaugural 25 flights.\n\nFeaturing an iconic experience set against the Singapore Straits with panoramic views of metropolitan Singapore, the New Tanjong will assert a unique personality with large sandbelt bunkers rarely seen in Asia.\n\nIt also offers golfers the challenge of playing on a course with modern hints of inspiration resembling the style of renowned golf course architect Alister MacKenzie.\n\nApart from the enhanced golfing experience, environmental sustainability is a hallmark of the redeveloped course, with several green initiatives implemented to conserve and re-use resources.\n\nGO GREEN\n\nThese include a special temporary nursery to facilitate the relocation of more than 300 trees during the redevelopment, installing six reservoir-cum-water features to ensure that the New Tanjong is self-sufficient in irrigation, re-using concrete from old cart paths, and re-using the fairways' sand cap and greens mix.\n\nThe redeveloped 18-hole par-72 course is home to unique hole layouts, water features and the hardy \"zorro zoysia\" grass on its fairways, ensuring the rigorous conditioning required to host international championship tournaments\n\nThe major makeover of the course also addresses several potential issues associated with older venues.\n\nLike other golf courses in the region, Tanjong has had to withstand the vagaries of a tropical climate, with such weather conditions typically allowing a golf course to have a lifespan of about 20 to 30 years.\n\nDespite smaller-scale upgrading efforts over the years, the old Tanjong course's infrastructure faced challenges in irrigation, drainage and turf maintenance.\n\nThe course was closed for redevelopment in November 2015, with nine months of construction followed by a three-month turf maturation period.\n\nSaid SGC president Low Teo Ping: \"The successful completion of the New Tanjong marks an important milestone in the club's vision of being beyond Asia's best.\n\n\"With the New Tanjong Course, SGC now returns to offering two high-quality courses, including our award-winning Serapong Course.\n\n\"The two courses provide further opportunities for Singapore to host international golfing tournaments.\"\n\nTo allow the New Tanjong time to mature, SGC will offer limited games and put in place longer intervals between flights until the course is officially open in February.\n\nBy\n\nGodfrey Robert\n\nRead articles by Godfrey Robert\n\nGolf\n\nSingapore\n\nsports\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 22, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nWoods shows 'progress' after

We were the best team by far. They had no chances to win,\" Mourinho said.\n\n\"They could not be Arsenal the way they normally play football. We were phenomenal defensively.

Too high? Moneylenders and debt counsellors tell NG JUN SEN (ngjunsen@sph.com.sg) that such rates were the norm before new rules kicked in last year\n\nShare this article\n\nIt is a mathematics problem that would scramble the minds of most financial experts.\n\nIf one borrows $8,000 at an interest rate of 20 per cent a month, and has paid monthly instalments totalling $76,800, how much longer will it take to clear the debt?\n\nThe answer is - possibly never.\n\nThis is the quandary one family here is facing after a moneylender here refused to renegotiate the terms of the loan.\n\nThe result is that even if they continue paying $1,600 every month until the end of time, they would still owe the moneylender $9,600.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 07:51am\n\n$10 million Toto results to be announced on July 17\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe loan comes with a monthly interest rate of 20 per cent, which works out to a 240 per cent yearly interest rate.\n\nIt is similar to the interest rates charged to Mr Goh Meng Leong, who appeared in the news last week when a judge quashed one moneylender's bid to bankrupt him even after he had paid back twice the principal sum.\n\nSuch high interest rates charged by licensed moneylenders were the norm before new moneylending rules kicked in last year, capping interest rates at 4 per cent per month. (See report on facing page.)\n\nThe family's troubles began when their father turned to licensed moneylenders to repay gambling debts. It started with two initial loans of about $10,000, made in 2010 and 2012.\n\nWhen he couldn't manage the payments, he borrowed more, owing a total of seven moneylenders through 18 loan contracts.\n\nHis story was narrated to The New Paper on Sunday by one of his daughters, who wanted to be known only as Yan, 44.\n\nYan, who is single and living with her father, says: \"He thought he could handle the first two loans... He was registered as business partner in a small restaurant so he was able to (get the) loan in the first place.\n\n\"As he did not stop gambling and had regular payments to make, it just went out of control. He has no income, so he could not even pay off (the loan even if he wanted to).\"\n\nYan's family had no idea that he had made those loans until they got repayment letters and phone calls from moneylenders.\n\nWhen they found out, they confiscated their father's passport and cut him off his gambling habit.\n\nThey managed to clear off several debts for him using their own savings, borrowing from friends and transferring the debts to their own names.\n\nBut it was one of the 18 loans - an $8,000 loan contract made in 2012 - that has the family scratching their heads.\n\nThey have paid around $76,800 to repay the interest from this loan so far, nearly ten times the original amount loaned.\n\nYet, the debt is still not repaid.\n\nThe moneylender still wanted them to pay back another $9,600 in full - the principal sum of $8,000 and remaining interest of $1,600 - before they can close the books on the contract.\n\nNO INSTALMENTS\n\nThe moneylender was also unwilling to accept instalments for this last $9,600, or restructure the loan contract to fit the new lending rules.\n\nMoneylenders are not obliged to do so, but some do it out of goodwill. (See report, right.)\n\nYan, a regional sales director at an international company, does not want to reveal the family's name to avoid trouble with this moneylender.\n\n\"Despite having made so much money from us, they still refused to allow us to switch the contract (to a more favourable one). We feel that this is unethical,\" says Yan, who earns a five-figure monthly salary.\n\nThe seemingly never-ending debts have caused problems for the siblings.\n\nYan says: \"It is tougher for my sister, who has two young children. Her husband does not really know about the financial burden that our father has placed on us... She has kept it away from him. She has emptied her own savings and taken out a loan with a bank.\n\n\"She has also cut down on one education plan for each of her children, and there have been no holidays for the past three years, unless it is to nearby destinations.\"\n\nAs for her father, he declined to speak to TNPS but communicated through Yan that he regrets what he did.\n\nThis problem has also left him estranged from his son and his son's two children, aged four and five.\n\nYan says: \"He has regrets. He has lost the chance to ever be acknowledged by his only son and his son's children.\"\n\nCan you renegotiate? It depends on the moneylender\n\nLicensed moneylenders should always be willing to meet at the negotiating table, two moneylenders tell TNPS.\n\nThat is provided debtors have shown a willingness to pay up, they add.\n\nA spokesman from Credit Assist, a licensed moneylender in Chinatown, says: \"It will be unreasonable for a moneylender to refuse negotiations when the person has been paying for so many years.\"\n\nHis company has a practice to help borrowers repay their debts, even lowering the interest rate for the borrower if necessary.\n\n\"We do have a guide here that if the borrowers have paid over a certain amount, we will be more lenient with them. Some of our customers even had their rates lowered to 12 per cent annual interest, which is almost nothing,\" he says.\n\nBut there is no regulation to compel moneylenders to do this.\n\n\"It is purely based on each company's ethics,\" the spokesman added.\n\nLast year, the Moneylenders Act was changed to cap nominal monthly interest rates at 4 per cent and an upfront administrative fee of not more than 10 per cent of the loan principal.\n\nPreviously, there was no such cap and moneylenders were free to set the interest rates based on a \"willing lender, willing borrower\" system.\n\nLIKE LOAN SHARKS\n\nAnnual interest rates of 240 per cent are commonplace, leading people to compare these rates to unlicensed moneylenders or loan sharks, says the Credit Assist spokesman.\n\nIn comparison, banks currently charge an annual interest rate of between 5 and 20 per cent for personal, unsecured loans.\n\nThe actual rate depends on many factors, such as the size of the loan and one's credit rating.\n\nMany contracts that are currently active were inked before these changes kicked in.\n\nOne licensed moneylender, who gave his name as Mr Lim, believes that some licensed moneylenders still refuse to budge because the old contracts are too profitable to give up.\n\n\"Perhaps for some of these moneylenders, they see it as a way to hang on to the old days, because the new rules are not sustainable to them,\" says Mr Lim.\n\nHe declines to be identified, adding that the community of licensed moneylenders is struggling with the 4 per cent cap.\n\nMr Lim, who is the sole proprietor of his firm, explains: \"Customers come to us because they are not able to get a loan from the banks. These are usually people who are more likely to default.\n\n\"The bad debt ratio that we are dealing with is probably 10 times that of the banks. That is why interest rates have to be 10 times higher.\"\n\nTNPS was unable to reach the Moneylenders' Association of Singapore for comment.\n\nDespite high rates, borrowers have few alternatives\n\nBy\n\nNg Jun Sen\n\nRead articles by Ng Jun Sen\n\nAn annual interest rate of 240 per cent for a loan may sound high, but debt counsellors say they have seen worse .\n\nCredit Counselling Singapore (CCS) general manager Tan Huey Min has even seen cases where borrowers were charged annual interest rates of 1,000 per cent.\n\nDespite such high rates, people still signed off on such contracts because they had few alternatives.\n\nMs Tan says: \"They can't take personal loans from banks because they need to have a certain level of income to do so.\n\n\"And they may not have the option of borrowing from co-operatives as they are open only to a certain segment of the public.\"\n\nThe changes in the Moneylenders Act last year has helped reduce the number of borrowers facing issues, albeit slightly.\n\nFrom January to October this year, CCS has counselled 3,219 cases, compared to 3,760, over the same period last year.\n\nMs Tan says: \"Gambling debts are often the main reason, but there are also those who borrow due to medical emergencies.\n\n\"We are also noticing a number of borrowers who used to be high-income earners, but did not want to change their spending habits and lifestyles when they lost their jobs.\"\n\nThere are 160 licensed moneylenders operating today, according to the Law Ministry website.\n\nBAD APPLE\n\nWhile banks have to abide to strict rules and licensed moneylenders have the Moneylenders Act to stick to, Ms Tan says moneylenders can be difficult to negotiate with as each has \"its own way of doing things\".\n\nMr Billy Lee, founder and executive director of Blessed Grace Social Services, estimates that one in 10 moneylenders is a bad apple.\n\nHe deems them unethical when they give out a loan even though they know the person may not be able to repay it.\n\nIn March, the new Moneylenders Credit Bureau (MLCB) gave moneylenders the ability to see other loans that customers have taken before and their repayment records.\n\nBut Mr Lee says some moneylenders still provide loans to these chain borrowers \"based on their own rules\".\n\nSome of these firms also have a history of harassing borrowers and reject repayment plans that his social workers come up with, he adds.\n\nMr Lee says he will usually try to negotiate with the moneylender, but when he realises that the moneylender is out to keep the borrower on a contract that he knows will never be repaid, he will report the moneylender to the authorities.\n\nHe even keeps a blacklist of errant moneylenders who repeatedly deny requests for negotiations and frequently reject repayment plans from the social workers.\n\nBy\n\nNg Jun Sen\n\nRead articles by Ng Jun Sen\n\nSingapore\n\nFinance\n\nGambling\n\nShare this

I know it's part of the game but I don't like it.\n\n\"Usually in a match, only 65 minutes (of the 90) are playing, but this time I'm not even sure if we played 45.\n\n\"You could see they wasted time, taking a long time to take corners and so on.\"\n\nUNPERTURBED\n\nSundram and his charges were hardly bothered with the criticism.\n\nSkipper Hariss Harun said: \"It doesn't matter to us.

So it's natural to sit back and counter.\"\n\n\"Coach sets us up to our strengths, and we thought,even after the red card, we might have nicked something at a set-piece.

{"article_url": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/edmund-chen-live-moment", "site_title": "Edmund Chen: 'Live in the moment'", "publish_date": "2016-11-19T22:00:00", "content": "PHOTOS: EDMUND CHEN\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nNov 19, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nEdmund Chen: 'Live in the moment'\n\nFormer actor Edmund Chen will take time off from working on book and join the Big Walk\n\nShare this article\n\nHis daughter was going through a tough time in her life, and he has based his second book on that.\n\nFormer actor Edmund Chen launched the second in his four-part illustrated Chinese book series, My Little Red Dot, on Monday (Nov 14).\n\nThe first book, My Little Red Dot: River Series, was published last year.\n\nThe second, My Little Red Dot: Forest Series, follows the main character on a journey of self-discovery.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 20, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nHe wins Harley with daughter's help\n\nMore related stories\n\nPHOTOS: EDMUND CHEN\n\nChen, 55, who wrote the text and drew the illustrations, tells The New Paper on Sunday: \"My daughter wanted to fit in with her friends and be like them, so she changed a lot about herself.\n\n\"Because of my wife's and my background in the acting industry, she didn't want her friends to judge her based on that. One day, she told me not to take her to school in case her friends saw (us) - that really woke me up.\"\n\nChen's wife is veteran actress Xiang Yun.\n\nHe says he thought of creating a character that represented his 16-year-old daughter's experiences growing up.\n\n\"I wanted to make a character that could be another friend to her. It took a long time to think of what it should look like, something simple but not so symmetrical,\" he says.\n\nThus, My Little Red Dot was born - a minuscule fish with big eyes and a red dot on its body.\n\nChen says the fish character does not have a proper name yet, as it is still \"very small and insignificant\", and he will probably reveal its name once the character completes its journey of self-discovery.\n\nThe books are also colouring books. He says: \"The first impression that people have of my book is that it's just a normal colouring book for therapy purposes. But, it's more than that. I think of it as philosophical, where there is a meaningful story behind every page.\n\n\"For example, one page can be about struggles, and the next will be about successes. Flip the page and it might be about a mid-life crisis.\n\n\"It's also about finding your true self. When you hate something about yourself, you try to change it. Once you change it, you finally realise that you lost that uniqueness, and you try to get it back again.\"\n\nChen gives the example of how, back in his acting days, people used to tease him about his red cheeks, which he tried to cover up with foundation until he found out that it was part of his identity.\n\nMy Little Red Dot: Forest Series features plants and trees in Singapore, and readers can scan QR codes behind each page to find out more about them.\n\nChen will take a short break from his books to attend The New Paper Courts Big Walk with his daughter and son, 25.\n\n\"For me, it really isn't about the location and the end of the trail, but about the journey and bonding with my family while staying healthy,\" he says. \"It's nice to just relax in the zoo and not realise how fast time passes by. You have to live in the moment and cherish it.\"\n\nThen it will be back to drawing up the third book.\n\nSays Chen: \"I'm working on the third book, which has the city as the theme, and hopefully it can be published by next April.\n\n\"I feel that my next two books are starting to push me out of my comfort zone, as I have to draw and create something that is different and better than the previous ones.\"\n\nHe is also creating My Little Red Dot merchandise such as water bottles and postcards, and working with travel brand Samsonite to design luggage.\n\nChen even hopes to have a cultural centre of his own soon, where people of all ages can have a hands-on experience of his artwork.\n\n\"It's definitely on my mind, but I'll take things one at a time. Sometimes, we must take a step back and look at ourselves to see whether our dreams are realistic or not.\"\n\nWHEN\n\nSaturday, Nov 26, 2pm\n\nWHERE\n\nSingapore Zoo and Night Safari\n\nREGISTRATION FEE\n\n$35\n\nON-SITE SIGN-UP\n\nToday, noon to 8pm\n\nRegister and collect your goodie bag at:\n\nCourts Orchard\n\n228, Orchard Road\n\nCourts Megastore\n\n50, Tampines North Drive 2\n\nWIN\n\nA Harley-Davidson Street 750 motorcycle worth $17,000\n\nA total of $28,000 worth of lucky draw prizes\n\nMORE\n\nCourts Megastore 10th Anniversary logos will be planted along the route of The New Paper Courts Big Walk.

I still cant believe it.\"\n\nHafiz's coach and teammates backed him.\n\nLions coach V Sundramoorthy felt the red card was \"harsh\", and said he would review a video of the incident, while Safuwan Baharudin felt the sending-off was \"soft\".\n\nM Anumanthan added: \"For me, it's not a red card.\n\n\"Hafiz's leg was not that high, and even (Younghusband) said it did not hit his face.\n\n\"But the referee's decision is final and we cannot go against it.\"\n\nSkipper Hariss Harun hailed the fighting spirit of his teammates.\n\n\"Hafiz was unlucky because he didn't mean the challenge,\" said the midfielder, who turned 26 yesterday.\n\n\"But putting that aside... the result was a credit to everybody.\n\n\"We had to run a lot without the ball tonight and that's never easy.\"\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nsuzuki cup\n\nSingapore\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 2, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nHassan in limbo: Thai club set to cancel contract with year left\n\nNov 30, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSundram: Who says I'm a defensive coach?\n\nNov 27, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nBack to the drawing board for Singapore football\n\nNov 26, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nAmri defends Sundram's tactics\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBest High-Interest Savings Accounts in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9884b383d3d152c4cbe54650769a517f15e4a24de0c6a99ffaae27b805026090/NP_20161120_SZSOC20_1446279.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "UNLUCKY: The huge tackle by Hafiz Abu Sujad (ight) which resulted in him being given a red card.", "caption": "UNLUCKY: The huge tackle by Hafiz Abu Sujad (ight) which resulted in him being given a red card.

winner\n\nShare this article\n\nRusyaidi Salime was crowned the 2016 The New Paper Dollah Kassim Award winner on Saturday morning, during the National Football Academy graduation ceremony held in Jurongville Secondary School.\n\nThis was the second time the 18-year-old, who is a second-year diploma in computer engineering student in Singapore Polytechnic, was nominated for the award.\n\nRusyaidi was selected from a pool of six nominees, which also included, Irfan Najeeb, 17, Nur Adam Abdullah, 15, Danial Syafiq Mustaffa, 16, Justin Hui, 18, and Qayumm Raishyan, 16.\n\nThe National Football Academy (NFA) Under-18 right back's win came following a solid season, in which he had played for the Garena Young Lions, and ended the season with the most starts in the team.\n\nSaid Rusyaidi in an interview with The New Paper: \"It was a surprising win for me, but a pleasant surprise.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 30, 2025, 01:52am\n\nBoy, 10, loses pocket money

Abdullah (son of Dollah Kassim), Rusyaidi  Salime and The New Paper Editor, Mr Dominic Nathan\n\n\"It's important to keep working hard, the moment you start doing so, many opportunities will come your way.\"\n\nThe Dollah Kassim Award was first started in 2010 to honour young and deserving football talents in Singapore under the age of 18, in memory of the nation's football legend, Dollah Kassim, also known as the \"Gelek King\".\n\nNominations for the award recipients are made by Football Association Singapore (FAS) NFA coaches who oversee the development and the training of young footballers here.\n\nNominees are picked based on their technical ability with regards to the game, as well as their character, which were two notable attributes of the late Dollah Kassim.\n\nThe winner gets to keep the Dollah Kassim Award trophy for a year and earns himself an overseas training opportunity with a prestigious football club.\n\nPrevious years' winners include Ammirul Emmran Mazlan (2010), Adam Swandi (2011), R Aaravin (2012), Hazim Faiz (2013), Muhelmy Suhaimi (2014) and last year, Joshua Pereira.\n\nBy\n\nSwetha Sundararajan\n\nRead articles by Swetha

You (journalists) have been drunk as well. I was responsible, you are responsible, Wayne is responsible as well.\n\n\"I don't think the (England Football Association) has to be responsible about that. We are people, we are old enough to take our responsibilities.\n\n\"I have a lot of respect for Wayne Rooney, about his career, as a human being. Private life is the private life, I don't have comments about that.\"\n\nOn tonight's game against Crystal Palace, Guardiola was happy to report that none of his 12 players who were on international duty came back injured, although some of them are tired.\n\n\"All the players came back good, fit. The players who played 90 minutes are tired, especially the South American players, but that is normal and tomorrow we are going to decide.\"\n\nBEWARE\n\nThe Spaniard said he is expecting a tough outing at Selhurst Park, as Palace \"cross a lot of balls\" and Benteke is \"unstoppable\" in the box.\n\nWith a Champions League game against Borussia Moenchengladbach coming up next Thursday morning (Singapore time), Guardiola hinted that he will rest some players tonight.\n\nHe said: \"When some of them come back from the national team, their regeneration is quicker than others, for the physical condition, for many, many things.\n\n\"We have a game and a final in Germany in three or four days and three days later, we have Burnley, so everyone is going to play.\"\n\nepl\n\nmanchester city\n\ncrystal palace\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b979dce0718a1e4efc85ca37506f590088efdf4e5457863479dec27e9cc33623/NP_20161119_CITY19_1445732.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "\"I was an international player during my time as a player and sometimes, I was drunk as well.
