He also created three chances, the second-most of any Chelsea player.\n\nTuchel is already fully aware of the nuance required to rouse his new charges back into form; some require an arm around the shoulder while others will need to be pushed.\n\nMount sits somewhere between those two extremes, but Alonso is already benefiting from being brought back in from the cold with a first senior appearance for the Blues since a 3-3 draw with West Bromwich Albion last September.\n\nHis ball-juggling before unleashing a volley to double their lead in the 84th minute highlighted a newfound level of confidence after being banished by Lampard for a far shinier and costlier alternative, with last summer's feted arrival of Ben Chilwell.\n\nVisible reminders of Chelsea's deposed legend have been stripped away, with the \"In Frank We Trust\" banner hastily removed less than seven days after its debut.\n\nIf Mount continues to excel under Tuchel, that legacy will not stay hidden for long.\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a70e879a4cd8bcca6bdbb1035cd197e5f6b84c014ed343478f7cb721cf75e90f/NP_20210201_RBSOC01_6301458.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mason Mount created three chances against Burnley, the second-most of any Chelsea player.

Exactly what the virus would want. I expected it. We have Covid fatigue.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe eight shoppers that TNP approached were confident that masking up would give them enough protection from the coronavirus that has blighted the world in the past year.\n\nOne of them, who was with her husband and wanted to be known only as Ms Nancy, 58, said: \"I think it is okay and safe without social distancing because people are wearing masks.\"\n\nAnother shopper, Mr Hong, 47, who was with his wife and son, said: \"I am not worried because we are moving around and not trapped in one area. It is fine because people are wearing masks.\"\n\nDr Leong said while it is true that masks do provide some protection, the assumption is they are good quality masks that are used properly in tandem with strict hand hygiene.\n\n\"The mask is only as good as how you use it. Many wear it with their nose exposed and with big gaps by the side,\" he added.\n\nWhen approached, many shop owners and assistants either declined to comment or were defensive about the lax safety measures in the area.\n\nWhen asked about SafeEntry, a woman selling festive snacks kept asking if the TNP team wanted to make a purchase before she finally pointed to a neighbouring shop and said: \"There is a QR code next to our shop. It is the same if you scan next door.\"\n\nAt the only shop enforcing SafeEntry and temperature- taking, the owner who wanted to be known only as Mr Larry, 28, said: \"I am worried that there is no social distancing and customers are not keeping a distance from one another.\"\n\nMr Low Chek Liang, 58, who runs a shop selling Chinese New Year decorations, said: \"I am not scared even though there is no SafeEntry. If you have a strong immunity, there is nothing to be scared of. I think I have a strong immunity.\"\n\nLast November, the Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng Citizens' Consultative Committee decided to cancel the Chinese New Year bazaar over crowd control concerns.\n\nBut it has done little to keep the crowds away. On Saturday, three safe distancing ambassadors told TNP about the difficulties their team of 10 faced in trying to manage the crowds.\n\nDIFFICULT\n\n\"We have to make sure everyone is 1m apart and wearing masks, but since it is a weekend, it is difficult to control them,\" said one.\n\n\"We even activated teams from Orchard and other areas to come over and help, along with assistance from police officers.\n\n\"But we really need the full cooperation of the public.\"\n\nThe surge in physical interactions is highly risky, warned Dr Leong.\n\n\"If we continue like this, a super spreading event will occur. What made us safe previously may not be good enough for the next lap,\" he said.\n\nDr Leong added that while we have managed to \"push back\" the virus in recent months, if we just \"maintain status quo, we will falter\".\n\nThis is because the virus is adapting into new strains that are more infectious in places such as Britain, South Africa and Brazil.\n\nMeanwhile, complacency set in here with the more relaxed measures in phase three, likely contributing to a rise in community cases, he noted.\n\nDr Leong expects a spike after the festive celebrations as \"we have a coming together of a perfect storm. Big gatherings, more transmissible virus, Covid fatigue\".\n\nWarning that the virus was \"coming back with a vengeance\" in several countries, he said: \"The vengeance reeked of death, illness and misery in Manaus, Brazil.\n\n\"They are having 'Covid deja vu'.\n\n\"One circuit breaker (in Singapore) is one too many. Nobody wants CB deja vu.\"\n\nBy\n\nGracia Yap\n\nRead articles by Gracia Yap\n\nClariss Chia\n\nRead articles by Clariss Chia\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2cd7fd964b18c3c4b9b9dc6feb670cc9233fbf4c55e694424f394301443cb3fb/NP_20210201_GYSAFE__6301124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The streets and shops at Chinatown were so crowded, people were literally rubbing shoulders with one another.

I slowed down to brace for an impact. But the driver in front of me was not able to slow down in time.\"\n\nThe video shows the speeding car swerve before slamming into the back of a blue car. It is then seen spinning before crashing into the barrier on the side of the expressway.\n\nThe impact of the collision caused the blue car to turn turtle and debris to be strewn across all five lanes of the expressway.\n\nMr Lam, who called the police to report the accident, said the driver of the speeding car was able to get out of the vehicle.\n\nBut the driver of the car that turned turtle looked to be in a bad condition, he added.\n\nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said the driver of the car and his passenger were taken to Sengkang General Hospital. TNP understands the driver was a 44-year-old male and the passenger was a woman.

That's the next step now.

Both his winners were trained by Michael Clements, who saddled a treble with Tuesday.\n\nTNP PHOTO: SALWA SUANDI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 31, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nThe champ Duric's Prosperous Return\n\nThe 4-time top jockey also scores on newcomer Kassab on first day back\n\nShare this article\n\nA champion is always a champion. Four-time King of Kranji Vlad Duric bounced back from his time-out with a double on his first day back for the new season on Saturday.\n\nSidelined for the first four race meetings of the year through a careless riding suspension and a minor throat issue, the 43-year-old jockey was back in the winner's enclosure at only his second ride - the aptly named Prosperous Return in Race 2.\n\nHe then took Race 6 on the promising newcomer Kassab - the fourth of his six rides. He was nominated on seven horses but Threeandfourpence was withdrawn from Race 9.\n\nBoth his winners were trained by reigning champion Michael Clements, who also sent out Tuesday to take Race 3 with South African Juan Paul van der Merwe astride.\n\nThanks to the treble, Clements took his season's tally to eight winners, four ahead of Jerome Tan and Lee Freedman, who saddled a double with My Big Boss in Race 8 and Augustano in Race 9.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nBoth Freedman's winners were ridden by his apprentice jockey, Iskandar Rosman.\n\nCertain quarters thought Duric's best chance was the Clements-trained last-race odds-on favourite Knight Love. But the last-start winner petered out to finish ninth after being handy.\n\nThe jockey certainly lived up to his reputation as a top rider with two masterful rides on Prosperous Return and Kassab.\n\n\"It's good to be back. This horse is very good, he has a good head,\" said Duric, referring to the Tivic Stable-owned Prosperous Return in the $75,000 Restricted Maiden event over 1,400m.\n\n\"He came back relaxed under me. He's looking for a mile and up to 1,800m. He's tough.\"\n\nDuric jumped his mount well from the second-widest barrier and moved up together with the last-minute favourite Real Efecto, who was drawn the widest. The pair raced to the front.\n\nAfter a while, Real Efecto opened up a two-length lead. Prosperous Return kicked up to join him shortly after straightening.

He has been working on it and even been encouraging them to set it up... He is not against it... He thought the project was good.\"\n\nWhen asked why Infantino would support a European Super League, Tebas said: \"Maybe he has a position in this future Super League that he is going to take up.\"\n\nDocuments containing details of the Super League, first reported this month by British newspaper The Times, proposed a 20-club tournament with 15 permanent members.\n\nIt would include the English Premier League's \"Big Six\", as well as La Liga giants Real Madrid and Barcelona, with those clubs guaranteed billions of euros in revenue.\n\nTebas believes the documents show Infantino was involved in discussions.\n\n\"There is the mention of a codename 'W01' which clearly refers to Mr Infantino. That is his codename,\" said Tebas.\n\n\"So he should urgently clarify his personal position, to explain why he was at some of the meetings and encouraged the project...If he comes out and says it's not true and can prove it, I will apologise.\n\n\"When I say something, it is for a good reason. I know the truth.\"\n\nAs the head of the Spanish league, Tebas has been one of the most vocal opponents of the Super League project, which he said has been driven by Real, as well Liverpool, Manchester United and AC Milan.\n\nBarcelona's outgoing president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, said in October the club had also signed up.\n\n\"While I am in charge of the Spanish league, it's not going to happen,\" Tebas said. - AFP\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Another tournament in the second half of the year is also in the pipeline.\n\nLocal club Black Wondersticks men's coach R. Saravanan, like many others The New Paper spoke to, was thrilled at the prospect of his charges being involved in competitive action after an enforced hiatus of over a year.\n\n\"Good start to have a mini-tournament such as this, as the players have been training, doing skills and drills but have not seen game time. So this is a good way to kick-start the season as we wait for the leagues to resume,\" said the 41-year-old, who guided the men's national team to SEA Games gold in 2015.\n\n\"Going from five outfielders to three outfielders will require players to adapt but, at the same time, they will improve in terms of their skills, game sense and quick reflexes.\"\n\nNational players Siti Nurhaliza Khairul Anuar, Lim Jian Hong and Vignesa Pasupathy were among those who hailed the initiative as a positive move, but the format change has also raised worries.\n\n\"Injury and the lack of substitutes are concerns, but also this tournament is open to all level of players aged above 15,\" said Saravanan.\n\n\"So my concern is that the level of play is totally different. For example, my side play at a high level but 15-, 16-, 17-year-olds may not be as conditioned as the senior players.\"\n\nNUS Titans' Siti said this format means players have to travel for games only to play 15 minutes, but added that it's still \"better than nothing\".\n\nVignesa, who returned to full fitness just last November after an anterior cruciate ligament injury in his left knee, wasn't too perturbed by the potential injury situation.\n\n\"After being out of action for so long, training without competition can be so draining,\" said the 24-year-old, who won the Premier League title with Black Wondersticks in 2018.\n\n\"Yes, the risk is higher, but just have to be better prepared.\"\n\nLim, who turns out for NUS Nemesis, added that, without the rolling substitutions, the 15-minute duration can be too intense and expects the pace to drop as the period progresses.\n\nEven so, the 25-year-old is only too keen to return to the court for matches, though he hopes the format for future tournaments can be tweaked so as to further minimise the likelihood of injuries.\n\nAddressing the injury concerns, Ho said: \"We are looking into giving game officials the authority to introduce 'power breaks', especially in the early weeks of the tournament, if the officials deem that the players are looking exhausted or are in need of a break.\"\n\nBy\n\nNarendaren Karnageran\n\nRead articles by Narendaren Karnageran\n\nOTHER SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 8, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHill wary of past final race controversies\n\nDec 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nThird time's the charm for world No. 2 paddler Sun Yingsha\n\nDec 1, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nKey figure skating event hit by Covid fears\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nEx-pro footballer among 8 teacher-coaches given awards\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/de8d0c5cb9bc46372a969a91e55cf3c244f83f316794974fa6e1ecb7a0acf175/NP_20210201_NKFLOOR01_6300994.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Singapore Floorball Association's new competition format will see teams of four take to the court, instead of the usual six.", "caption": "The Singapore Floorball Association's new competition format will see teams of four take to the court, instead of the usual six.

The 33-year-old's club contract dwarfs those of the other top earners in global sport.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's contract with Juventus is worth a reported 30m euros a year, but bonuses may have taken it up to 70m euros last season.

These will be further treated in chemical recycling plants.\n\n\"The recovered plastics... can be converted into higher-value products such as pyrolysis oil, which can serve as feedstock for Singapore's petrochemical sector to manufacture new plastics and chemicals,\" said the NEA.\n\nThe facility will also be able to recover suitable polyethylene terephthalate, a type of plastic commonly known as PET, which will be mechanically recycled.\n\nThe NEA said there is currently no local facility that recovers contaminated plastics from domestic waste.\n\nUnder the current system, recyclables are collected from the blue National Recycling Programme bins at various locations across the island.\n\nThe new facility will tap a larger source of waste collected, such as from the green general waste bins in Housing Board estates, thereby reducing the amount of waste sent for incineration and to landfills, said the NEA.\n\nThe feasibility study on the facility will propose the technologies and equipment required to recover up to 72,000 tonnes of plastic waste a year for chemical recycling, among other things.\n\nThe study will, in addition, determine the cost-effectiveness for the facility to separate and recover non-plastic recyclables, such as paper, metals and glass, the NEA said.\n\nThe facility would be \"a key enabler in closing the waste loop, especially for plastics\", the agency said.\n\nnp_20210201_doplastic_6301384.pdf\n\nDOMINIC LOW\n\nEnvironment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 1, 2025, 11:46pm\n\n'Pig-faced' rare bat sighting at Lower Peirce sparks buzz among nature fans\n\nDec 10, 2024, 03:22am\n\nEven corals grow up in HDB-style homes in Singapore\n\nNov 8, 2024, 03:55am\n\nEverything you wanted to know about water heaters but never asked\n\nMay 22, 2024, 04:27pm\n\nCetta expands into new sectors by acquiring stake in EAS.ai\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fcfca69cb16cce220185d4771666b6d451c8d719b499fa2b3ff8815b72f2571d/BrianTeo-pixgenerics-5.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Warm, humid nights and rainy mornings expected in first half of July", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/435f5ef588b62ada2c36c875359e03a9a820626fc3ffc36ebeb683bdf59a2072/np_20210201_doplastic_6301384.jpg?w=1922", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f3b4ada009d8306839bfca513239e0b277e505abefee243890c0e8398f67536a/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-04-30%20at%2018.00.43_2fdbd92c.jpg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "'Pig-faced' rare bat sighting at Lower Peirce sparks buzz among nature fans", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He trusted her and since Jan 1, on two occasions, he invested much of his life savings into the account.\n\n\"I wanted to earn a little more due to the pandemic,\" said Mr Lin, who works in the food and beverage industry.\n\nTwo weeks later, he was told his trades had failed and he owed the broker around $53,000.\n\n\"I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat,\" Mr Lin said. \"These are savings that I've saved bit by bit, from working over the years.\"\n\nLast Thursday, the Singapore Police Force's Anti-Scam Centre (ASC) contacted him.\n\nThat was when he learnt that the bank account of the broker he had transferred almost $50,000 to was under investigation for being a suspected investment scam.\n\nMr Lin was one of over 200 victims who found out that they had fallen prey to scams in the course of an ASC operation.\n\nDuring a three-day operation from last Wednesday to Friday, officers from the ASC worked with banks to intervene in scams involving fake gambling platforms and investments.\n\nThey traced fund transfers of suspicious accounts, contacted victims who made the transactions, and advised them to stop any further transfers.\n\nFrom 2019 to last year, investment scams increased by 126 per cent to 1,102 cases, with victims losing at least $69.5 million. Fake gambling platform scams also increased by 1,800 per cent to 299 cases last year from a year before, with losses totalling $15.4 million.\n\nScammers also often lure victims through online dating platforms. Investment scam victims are often given an initial \"profit\" to entice them into committing larger amounts, which are deposited into the scammers' accounts. The scammers then become uncontactable.\n\nIn fake gambling platform scams, victims are often convinced that the online betting platforms introduced have loopholes that would allow them to reap easy profits.\n\nCurrently, 76 men and 22 women, aged between 17 and 59, are being investigated for suspected involvement in 359 investment and fake gambling platform scams.\n\nThe suspects allegedly helped the syndicates by opening bank accounts or transferring monies for the syndicate.\n\nThose convicted of cheating can be fined and jailed for up to 10 years, and those involved in money laundering can be fined up to $500,000 and jailed for up to 10 years.\n\nVictims of fake gambling platform scams may also be charged under the Remote Gambling Act. They can be fined up to $5,000 and jailed for up to six months.\n\nCHARLOTTE CHONG\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dfd1c20b2a589205a89c705fe612391a7561d5b401dd7c8ecfe827490334e9c0/NP_20210201_CCSCAM01M_6301276.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(Above) The Anti-Scam Centre.

However, she argued that under Section 405 of the Penal Code, there was no requirement to prove the actual identity of the person who is entrusting the property.\n\nJustice Vincent Hoong said he will consider the \"interesting arguments\" and give his decision at a later date.\n\nAccording to Raj Kumar, he started communicating with Maria by e-mail in 2012 and remitted $1,200 to her after she asked for money to meet him in Singapore.\n\nShe did not come to Singapore and later e-mailed him to say she was in Malaysia and asked him to receive a sum of money on her behalf. Raj Kumar was told to collect the cash from another person in Singapore, then take it to Malaysia.\n\nOn March 9, 2013, Raj Kumar met the intermediary, Ms Melody Choong, at a taxi stand at NEX shopping mall in Upper Serangoon.\n\nMs Choong, then a money mule working for an online persona known as Jacques Chicoine, handed Raj Kumar an envelope.\n\nMs Choong, who has since served a six-month jail term for money laundering offences, testified that the envelope contained $81,000 in thousand-dollar notes.\n\nShe had earlier collected the envelope from Sie Min Jeong, who received the funds in his bank account from another online persona known as Maureen Othman.\n\nSie made a police report on March 24, 2013, after the bank told him he needed to return the funds to the remitter as it had been wrongly credited.\n\nBut Raj Kumar claimed that the envelope contained a stack of dollar-note-sized paper.

Noncompliance means \"a violation of federal law\", the order said.\n\nExemptions are allowed for people eating, drinking or taking medication, as well as those communicating with the hearing-impaired.

Its handlebars stem from the sides of the bike's top yoke for added comfort on long commutes.\n\nStill, the marque is not able to escape its racing heritage.\n\nWhile past Aprilia sportbikes display single-panel fairings to counter wind drag, the 183kg RS 660 has a dual fairing system, similar in concept to the current rage of winglets on racebikes in MotoGP and Superbikes.\n\nDespite being a parallel twin, its engine sounds like an angry V4 motorcycle.\n\nThe slender and compact RS 660 has a competitive edge compared with other middle-weight sportbikes and is equipped with sophisticated electronics usually found on top-end machines.\n\nThe ride-by-wire machine has five riding modes - three for road use and two for track riding. It has anti-wheelie, cruise and traction controls, a quickshifter and anti-lock brakes.\n\nThe Italian motorbike senses what is happening around it via a six-axis inertial measuring unit, thanks to internal gyroscopes and accelerometers.\n\nBut why did Aprilia invest in a middle-weight sportbike when the Big Four Japanese manufacturers have scaled down on their models in the category?\n\nMr Niccolai's answer: to catch people. He explained that current trends depict a drop in motorcycle owners in the large capacity segment but an increase in motorcycle ownership in the small capacity class.\n\nSo Aprilia hopes to entice riders who are downgrading as well as those who want to upgrade to a motorcycle with more performance.\n\n\"We want to give (riders) something more,\" said Mr Niccolai. \"We hope the RS 660 is an option that is just right.\"\n\nBy\n\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Zaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nMOTORSPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew-look Ducati Monster still as playful like before\n\nNov 21, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nQatar GP winner Hamilton reduces Verstappen's lead\n\nNov 16, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAlfa Romeo's Zhou becomes China's first F1 driver\n\nNov 15, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHamilton hails best weekend as he keeps title hopes alive\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a1e49ab754cf5b0218415a3a49ca49e978d58de833ab833cacb261f519513b08/NP_20210201_BIKER01_6300591.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Managing director of Piaggio Asia-Pacific Simone Niccolai on the new Aprilia RS 660.

When kissing your partner, you may spread the virus to him or her and cause them to develop symptoms.\n\nIf you've engaged in oral sex, your partner may then develop ulcers around the genital region caused by HSV-1.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, about 70 per cent of the world's population are carriers of HSV-1.\n\nThe good news is that oral and genital herpes are often asymptomatic, and do not spread to your partner when there are no active ulcers.\n\nThey only flare up in a person's body when the person's immune system is weakened and conversely become contagious through contact when an ulcer is present. The frequency of flare-ups can occur every few months, to every few years to even every few decades.\n\nAnd one experiences symptoms of being tired, chills, fever, body ache and then the emergence of painful ulcers, often in the same place either at the genitals or mouth.\n\nOne can get an accurate diagnosis with a swab test of the active ulcer or a blood test two to three months after an active infection. Getting a diagnosis can equip you with knowledge on how to prevent this infection with lysine supplements or treating any active ulcers with antiviral tablets such as Valtrex. If left untreated, these ulcers often get painful and will run its course over two to three weeks.\n\nHPV WARTS\n\nThese are cauliflower-like warts caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).\n\nThere are over 100 strains of HPV viruses, and apart from the 14 cancer-causing high-risk strains, there are also numerous strains which are low-risk that cause HPV warts.\n\nHPV warts do not turn into cancer but are often unsightly and manifest themselves in and around the genital region.\n\nHPV viruses exist on each of our bodies and those present on our bodies are often controlled by our immune system and do not cause any major symptoms.\n\nHowever, during sexual contact, these HPV viruses are exchanged with your partner and vice versa, where these new HPV viruses not detected by your body before, would then cause HPV warts to develop.\n\nThe good news is that although it is unsightly, these low-risk HPV-causing warts are often harmless and can be treated with a variety of options including creams, freezing with liquid nitrogen and even ablation with heat or electrocautery.\n\nAlthough they are easily treatable, what is of greater concern is getting vaccinated against the high-risk strains such as 16, 18 and 45, which affect women more because of its risk of causing cervical cancer. This life-threatening condition can easily be prevented with vaccination.\n\nBACTERIAL VAGINOSIS\n\nOne of the biggest causes of a fishy and foul-smelling vaginal discharge is this condition that occurs when there is an imbalance between the good and bad bacteria in the vagina.\n\nIt is often caused by a bacteria called Gardnerella.\n\nIn the event of a big build-up of bacteria, it can also cause one to develop vaginitis symptoms - inflammation and pain of the vagina, resulting in swelling, pain and even painful sexual intercourse.\n\nUntil now, doctors and scientists do not know the exact mechanism of how this occurs but sex with or without condoms often exacerbates this condition.\n\nIt can be easily diagnosed with a vaginal swab, and treatment comes in the form of vaginal pessaries or oral antibiotics to eradicate this infection.\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nInvestor Options Most Don’t Consider\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1f0afc580e991b4147c35599335fa768609eb282a92889afc114db3ccc86b71d/NP_20210201_STI01_6300584.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Even interactions such as skin-to-skin contact and kissing can pose a risk of disease transmission.", "caption": "Even interactions such as skin-to-skin contact and kissing can pose a risk of disease transmission.

When it happens, it happens, but I believe we have to fight against it, we cannot do anything else.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nLiverpool's worst run in the league since 2017 had seen them slip from the top of the table to fifth before kick-off with Klopp admitting his first priority is now to secure Champions League qualification for next season.\n\nBut the German was delighted with the response from the Reds as they clicked back into gear, particularly after going in front.\n\n\"What I saw today, it's not about shape or form it's about who we are. That was us, second half especially it was us,\" said Klopp.\n\n\"Tonight we knocked a wall down - that's good. It is easier to lose (confidence) that's how it is, but it is possible to get it back as well. It is not a light you can switch on and off. You have to show it in the right moment.\"\n\nA return to the Champions League is also Spurs' target in Mourinho's first full season in charge, but Tottenham's chances may now depend on how long Kane is sidelined.\n\nKane and Son Heung-min have been the most deadly duo in the EPL this season and thought they had combined for the opening goal inside the first five minutes.\n\nSon finished coolly from Kane's through-ball, but the South Korean had just strayed offside in the build-up and the goal was ruled out by a VAR review.\n\nThere were signs of life in Liverpool's attacking play despite a 3-2 defeat by Manchester United in the FA Cup on Sunday and they created many more clear-cut chances than in recent weeks as Hugo Lloris twice denied Mane with excellent saves.\n\nWith Kane clearly hobbling, Tottenham were clinging on for half-time when Liverpool finally struck.\n\nSadio Mane got in behind and squared for Firmino to bundle in at the back post for his first goal in eight games.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold's drop off in form has been another major part of Liverpool's regression from the side that romped to the title last season with 99 points.\n\nHowever, the England right-back connected sweetly to drill in his side's second after Lloris could only parry Mane's initial effort into his path.\n\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg's brilliant strike from outside the box halved the deficit just two minutes later.\n\nLiverpool, though, rarely looked troubled after Kane departed and could have won far more convincingly.\n\nMohamed Salah's powerful strike was ruled out after a VAR review for a handball by Firmino earlier in the move.\n\nBut Mane restored the two-goal cushion when he pounced on an error from Joe Rodon to fire high past Lloris.\n\n\"It's hard to resist so many defensive individual mistakes - unless you score four goals against Liverpool,\" Mourinho said. \"Every time we came back the next mistake was coming.\"\n\nVictory takes Liverpool into fourth, above West Ham United, whom they face on Monday morning (Singapore time).\n\nTottenham's early season form saw them being touted as contenders for a first top-flight title in 60 years ahead of their last clash with Liverpool last month.\n\nNow a run of just two wins in eight games has plummeted Mourinho's men down to sixth, four points adrift of the top four. -\n\nREUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nGet Support From The SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support Scheme\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ab066a300c5b6b1a1dc04b3773caa4941530e76539d6f555cd3f268b179eb1f3/firmino.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Roberto Firmino (in red) ended his goal drought as Liverpool got back to winning ways.", "caption": "Roberto Firmino (in red) ended his goal drought as Liverpool got back to winning ways.

Some devotees making milk offerings.\n\nTNP PHOTO: TIMOTHY DAVID\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 28, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nThis year's Thaipusam a muted but safer affair\n\nMany pleased with well-organised event and Covid-19 safety measures that allowed them to attend prayer service\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Thaipusam festival was a muted affair this year, with a trickle of devotees visiting Sri Thendayuthapani Temple in Tank Road yesterday.\n\nWhile the prayer service and colourful festive attire gave a sense of normalcy to the event, signs of the pandemic were all around, with stringent restrictions in place to ensure the safety of devotees and staff.\n\nThe festival, which welcomed about 10,000 visitors who arrived in time for pre-booked slots, marks one of the first large-scale events to take place in Singapore since measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 came into force early last year.\n\nNot even a heavy downpour at noon stopped the steady stream of devotees, who waited in line to complete temperature screening and registration before entering the temple.\n\nSeparate routes were arranged for general visitors and those carrying paal kudams or milk pots - the only ritual allowed to go ahead this year.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\nAbout 5,000 had booked time slots ahead for the ritual.\n\nAmong the missing sights were kavadis (wooden or metal structures with milk offerings), ceremonial piercings and the loud fanfare and music accompanying the foot procession from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road.\n\nDevotees told The Straits Times the event was well-organised with effective safe distancing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nStudent Losheini Ravindran, 24, who visited the temple with her parents and sister, noted the event was much quieter than in previous years.\n\n\"There are a lot of changes in place, but our devotion remains the same. The organisers have been very careful with the safety measures and we were able to spend enough time at the sanctum to pray,\" she said.\n\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong and Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam attended the event and spoke to organisers and volunteers at the temple.\n\nThe festival attracted large crowds in previous years. In 2018, the 3km-long foot procession alone had nearly 10,000 participants, with a further 40,000 people including supporters and tourists joining in the celebrations.\n\nMr Ganesh Kumar, 41, who attends the festival every year and had carried kavadis in the past, was struck by the stark contrast to the pre-Covid years.\n\nThe senior executive at Gardens by the Bay, who attended the event with his mother, said: \"Although Thaipusam is very different this year, I think the event was well-organised, especially the routes to separate general devotees and those carrying milk pots.\n\n\"We are glad that we were able to come and pray on this day, even with all the measures in place. I hope next year things will be back to normal and we can have a lively Thaipusam again.\"\n\nBy\n\nMalavika Menon\n\nRead articles by Malavika Menon\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He is the standout form selection and, with improvement, he should get the Justin Snaith-Richard Fourie partnership off to a winning start.\n\n(1) ARIZONA SKY\n\nand\n\n(4) RED SOLE\n\nwill be wiser to the task after their modest debuts.\n\nRed Sole's stablemate,\n\n(2) CALLMEMRGREENLIGHT,\n\nwas well fancied on debut. With cheekpieces fitted, he could pose the biggest threat.\n\n(7) SEEKING PEACE\n\n, a speedy filly, will be prominent for a long way and could give the boys something to fear.\n\nRACE 2 (1,160M)\n\n(6) HEAVEN'S GIRL\n\nwas supported in both her starts. She is going a bit further now and should finish strongly.\n\n(4) WARRIOR CAPTAIN\n\nwas caught late last time and should make a race of it.\n\nStable companion\n\n(5) GIN AND TONIC\n\nhas a shout if she jumps on terms.\n\n(8) SAVAGE LOVE\n\nand\n\n(1) FISHER KING\n\nare looking to improve.\n\nRACE 3 (1,600M)\n\n(1) STARBOARD\n\nhas confirmed the promise of her debut third with consecutive second-place finishes, the latest over this course and distance. She should go one better.\n\n(2) DAUGHTER OF ZEUS\n\nwas outrun late last time and should pose a threat.\n\n(5) ZETA JONES\n\nand\n\n(6) GOLLY MISS MOLLY\n\nwere not far off that pair last time and could go close again.\n\n(3) SWAZI QUEEN\n\nand\n\n(4) IMPERIAL BALLET\n\nhave shown enough to do well.\n\nRACE 4 (1,160M)\n\n(1) BATTLE FORCE\n\nhas been threatening.

Stable companion\n\n(12) RA'ED\n\nwas well beaten on debut but will come on with the experience gained.\n\nRACE 5 (1,600M)\n\n(13) GRAND ESCAPE\n\ncaught the eye on debut when getting going late to finish third behind more-experienced and in-form rivals. He would have come on since for this step-up in trip.\n\nStable companions\n\n(5) CHURCHHAVEN\n\nand\n\n(3) WOLF MAN\n\nhave improved. They could fight out the finish.\n\nWolf Man should strip fitter for a pleasing comeback run behind\n\n(2) GREENLIGHTFLASH\n\n, who could also make his presence felt.\n\n(4) SUPERIOR LEADER\n\nshould also have more to offer reverting to this trip after a pleasing third.\n\nRACE 6 (1,160M)\n\nIt could get close between\n\n(5) BAT OUT OF HELL\n\nand\n\n(11) MAGIC CHOICE\n\non their recent meeting behind Theatre Of Dreams. Bat Out Of Hell finished 3/4 lengths in front of Magic Choice. Both found problems in the running. Over a slightly longer trip and depending on improvement made, it will be interesting.\n\n(13) SARSAPARILLA\n\nwas not disgraced on debut and would have come on.\n\n(1) DALGETY BAY\n\nhas shown improvement to have every chance.\n\nRACE 7 (1,400M)\n\n(2) FABIAN\n\nand\n\n(4) KING OF GEMS\n\nrenew rivalry, having clashed in a hot sprint last time. Both are capable over 1,400m.\n\n(3) HUDOO MAGIC\n\nwill appreciate the step-back to this distance and play a leading role under favourable conditions.\n\n(6) CAPTAIN OF STEALTH\n\nand\n\n(8) HURRICANE HARRY\n\nare distance-suited and boast solid form in similar contests.\n\n(9) PINKERTON\n\nhas come good after being gelded and has been beaten only once over this track and trip.\n\nRACE 8 (1,600M)\n\n(7) DOUBLE MARTINI\n\nenjoyed the extra distance last time and is improving fast. He should be right there.\n\n(1) SHADOW CREEK\n\nhas been knocking on the door and should give another honest performance.\n\n(4) IRISH RAIN\n\nran flat second-up after a rest. The colt was in front of\n\n(2) LIGHT WARRIOR\n\nin his previous run. However, stable jockey S'manga Khumalo has opted to ride first-timer\n\n(6) DANCE PARTNER\n\n. Watch.\n\nRACE 9 (1,000M)\n\n(2) BARZALONA\n\nwon the first two-year-old contest of the Cape season. He beat stablemate\n\n(1) AFRICAN RAIN\n\n, who has won since.

Expect a good fight.\n\n(11) IRISH WILLOW,\n\nthe only filly in the race, is having her peak run.\n\n(5) FORT COMMANDER\n\nneeded the sprint but is jumping up to 1,600m.\n\nRACE 11 (1,800M)\n\nUnbeaten\n\n(1) KOMMETDIEDING\n\nwas most impressive when tried beyond a sprint last time. On that evidence, the colt should have little trouble getting the trip.\n\nHowever, Guineas third-placegetter\n\n(2) RASCALLION\n\nis proven in Graded company and is likely to do better with the extra 200m.\n\n(5) RED LARK\n\nand\n\n(4) HOEDSPRUIT\n\ncould make their presence felt over this distance.\n\n(3) CRIMSON KING\n\nwas third in a 1,600m Grade 1 as a two-year-old and is open to improvement after a break and a gelding operation.\n\nRACE 12 (2,400M)\n\n(5) SMOKING HOT\n\nbeat\n\n(3) LILY BLUE\n\n(5kg better off) by two lengths and Oaks runner-up\n\n(4) POMANDER\n\n(7kg better off) by five lengths. He could be tested by the pair. Lily Blue won her only try over this distance but needs to be covered until late before turning it on.\n\n(1) FACTOR FIFTY, (2) SNOW PALACE\n\n(blinkers on) and\n\n(6) FIFE\n\nare capable but need to get the right run.\n\nRACE 13 (1,000M)\n\n(2) RUSSET AIR\n\nis back to defend his title but he has yet to win since that race 12 months ago. He could run well fresh.\n\n(1) KASIMIR\n\ncould finish better than the third spot he achieved last year. He had, however, finished behind stablemate\n\n(6) RIO QUERARI\n\nover 1,000m before that. Rio Querari should be a factor again. It is probably worth noting stable jockey Fourie has instead opted for crack sprinter\n\n(12) ERIK THE RED,\n\nwho is unbeaten over 1,000m.\n\n(10) CELTIC SEA\n\nshould have her way again on these terms after back-to-back wins in Cape Town.\n\nGrade 1 winners\n\n(13) TEMPTING FATE\n\nand\n\n(14) VERNICHEY\n\nadd further intrigue to this blockbuster.\n\nRACE 14 (1,600M)\n\n(7) WHORLY WHORLY\n\nis trying a little extra distance, which could suit. He beat\n\n(6) GOLDEN PHEASANT\n\n(won subsequently) by 13/4 lengths over 1,400m and they meet on identical terms. Golden Pheasant won over this course and distance and it could get close.\n\n(8) CORNISH POMODORO\n\nis sporting blinkers which could see him take honours.\n\n(3) GREEN HAZE\n\nis coming right. Respect.\n\nRACE 15 (1,600M)\n\nClassy and versatile\n\n(1) CLOUDS UNFOLD\n\nis lining up for an unprecedented hat-trick of Majorca Stakes wins.

He silenced his nearest rival, the trial-winning newcomer Gentlemen Exellent, by 21/4 lengths over the Poly 1,000m dash.\n\nWith hotshot Brazilian jockey Ruan Maia astride, he tracked third before unleashing a powerful burst to score in a swift 58.29sec.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nMaia has since been lured to ride in the ultra-competitive Hong Kong.\n\nLike the Shane Baertschiger-trained Gentlemen Exellent, who will have plenty of admirers in Race 8, Knight Love has improved further.\n\nThe bay gelding worked on a good hold and finished full of running after his hit-out on Monday morning with jockey Louis-Phillipe Beuzelin astride.\n\nThe Frenchman partnered Knight Love in his first three starts for a debut all-the-way triumph over 1,200m on turf in restricted Maiden company and two seconds in Class 4.\n\nHe was ridden by then-apprentice jockey Shafrizal Saleh in the Group 2 Singapore Classic over 1,400m, but finished 10th behind the sensational Inferno after being well up.\n\nWith Beuzelin serving a suspension for careless riding, four-time Singapore champion Vlad Duric has been engaged for the ride. This suggests the connections' eagerness for another quick success.\n\nThis will be Duric's first day for the new Singapore racing season.\n\nHe lost four Kranji race days this month - two through careless riding and another two recuperating from a minor throat issue.\n\nOne who is usually perched at the top of the jockeys' table, it is strange to see his name right at the bottom of the list.\n\nHe is starting from scratch, with seven rides tomorrow.\n\nBut it looks like he has to wait until the final event on Knight Love, his best ride of the day.\n\nWith luck, he may strike in the opener with the Stephen Gray-trained Hwasong, whose only win from 10 starts was with the Australian aboard.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3f6695bebe0b7051e2f7c2cc20cc3f669579a90ff55028883bba9e50360953fa/NP_20210129_TLBEST29_6293195.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Knight Love resuming from a four-month spell to score easily on Dec 27.

What I saw yesterday (in training) was very open stuff, very helpful stuff.\n\n\"We will build a team that nobody wants to play against.

Liverpool have neither a main man nor a reliable partner, just a carousel of utility men and malnourished academy kids.\n\nAnd the price is likely to be paid in the final league standings.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Reds have conceded more goals (22) than Aston Villa (21) in 10th position, a decent fun fact that pales in comparison to United's defensive misdemeanours.\n\nThe erratic Red Devils have fished the ball out of David de Gea's net more than anyone else in the top half - 27 times in fact. The odd freakish result in a surreal season inflated that number, certainly, but title contenders should usually concede fewer goals than relegation candidates.\n\nDown in 15th position, Burnley have shipped only 24 goals.\n\nApart from looking up and cursing City's dramatic renaissance, United and Liverpool also have brittle back fours in common. Against Sheffield United, the Red Devils offered less solidity than jelly and ice-cream.\n\nTheir spine is largely dependent on a damaged Swede.\n\nTo his immense credit, Victor Lindelof has pushed through the pain barrier for the past two months, as he manages a back injury first suffered playing on a plastic pitch against AZ Alkmaar in late 2019.\n\nTwo games a week are currently beyond Lindelof, forcing Maguire to go through more partners than a Tinder addict.\n\nOrdinarily, Eric Bailly steps up. Unfortunately, Bailly gives the impression that the very act of \"stepping up\" might trigger a fresh injury. He picked up a knock in training this week, forcing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to pick Axel Tuanzebe.\n\nThe 23-year-old hadn't started a game in the English Premier League since October 2019 and it showed. The hesitant centre-back looked like the club mascot had been thrown a jersey and told to run around and hope for the best.\n\nDRAGGED OUT OF POSITION\n\nTuanzebe disappeared beneath the flight of the cross for Sheffield United's first goal and his positioning for the second resembled a helicopter missing a propeller. He was dragged all over the place.\n\nIndeed, the visitors' winner seemed to pull back the curtain at Old Trafford, revealing not a glittering collection of trophy-hunting wizards, but a number of sweaty men frantically stretching and pulling at things in the hope that something worked.\n\nIn fairness, United's calamitous defending wasn't entirely representative of the club's current standing, anymore than their recent table-topping antics were an accurate reflection of their progress.\n\nThey are caught somewhere in the middle, rather like de Gea at set-pieces.\n\nIf United and Liverpool share a shortage of fit centre-backs, then the Red Devils are all alone when it comes to an alarming unpredictability between the sticks.\n\nBlades manager Chris Wilder didn't need a profound tactical plan at Old Trafford. The direct approach often works against de Gea.\n\nAim an in-swinging cross towards the six-yard line. Surround de Gea like paparazzi on a red carpet. Get a forward to peel away and nod a header past the stranded Spaniard as he flaps like a drowning seagull.\n\nSolskjaer didn't appreciate the deja vu. United have shipped eight goals from set-pieces this season. Since the start of last season, they have conceded 14 goals from corners, the joint-highest in the EPL.\n\nDe Gea's poor distribution also led to the Blades' winner, which underlined the discernible lack of communication at the back.\n\nEmpty stadiums pick up everything, but there was only the sound of silence as United took an eternity to break up their opponents' advance and still failed.\n\nSolskjaer can always call upon the indefatigable Maguire. But who can be called upon to stand alongside the United skipper? The defensive uncertainty at Anfield has replicated itself at Old Trafford.\n\nWhat would either club give to have a resurgent Stones or even an Aymeric Laporte to support a main man like Ruben Dias?\n\nOf course, that would be greedy. That would be Manchester City.\n\nIf the rule of three applies to this particular narrative, then Pep Guardiola can expect a happy ending.\n\nLiverpool and United, on the other hand, are a centre-back short of a title challenge.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The inconsistencies don't win you the league.\n\n\"It's what we said about Manchester United for many, many months - that the inconsistencies of individuals on this team is what's holding them back.\"\n\nThe Blades went ahead in the 23rd minute when Kean Bryan headed in John Fleck's corner, with David de Gea flapping at the cross, although replays suggested he may have been pushed by striker Billy Sharp.\n\nThough Harry Maguire equalised in the 64th minute by heading in Alex Telles' corner, United paid the price for hesitant defending 10 minutes later, when Oliver Burke's low drive deflected off Axel Tuanzebe and crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nUnited's big-name players were anonymous against Chris Wilder's side, as their 13-match unbeaten run in the league came to an end.\n\nThe pairing of Scott McTominay and Brazilian Fred at the base of the midfield has worked throughout their recent run of good form. But, without them, United were back to the ponderous and hesitant, slow build-up play that rarely suits them.\n\nNemanja Matic and Paul Pogba did not bring that same level of intensity.\n\nUp front, Anthony Martial struggled again, while Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood produced too little, with Edinson Cavani introduced only late in the game.\n\nAt the back, Tuanzebe, at centre-half alongside Harry Maguire, looked well short of the standards set by the injured Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly.\n\nSolskjaer avoided blaming individuals, but was clearly unhappy with the performance.\n\nHe said: \"Disappointed, we couldn't get to the heights of the last few months' football we played.\"\n\nThe Red Devils are still a point behind leaders Manchester City, who have a game in hand, but Ferdinand warned that the gap could widen again.\n\n\"If anybody was starting to get carried away at Old Trafford... it was a reality check,\" he said. - REUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nDiscover 3 Practical Steps To Help You Get Back On Your Feet\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c27b52a620c9bc4d5fe39d4f36c8beb9338c78bd298ca5cff90a97a7d4f4cdd6/NP_20210129_UNITED29_6295653.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Rio Ferdinand.

The DMA can also set screen time limits. Teachers can monitor and control students' screens during lessons, such as directing them to watch videos for learning or sharing their screen.\n\nA petition on the website Change.org last Saturday called for MOE to not install the DMA on learning devices, citing concerns over students' privacy.\n\nThe petition had over 5,800 signatures as of last night.\n\nMr Loh said: \"We appreciate the feedback expressed by some students and parents on having greater flexibility over the use of the personal learning devices. We will engage them and see what arrangements can be worked out.\"\n\nMOE is working towards giving parents the option to manage their child's device after school hours, during weekends and school holidays, he added.\n\nThe school will also uninstall the DMA from students' devices upon graduation.\n\nPERSONAL PRIVACY\n\nStill, some students are not comfortable with MOE knowing how they use their devices.\n\nSecondary 2 student Ethan Fun, 14, who uses his own laptop for school work, gaming and social media, said: \"Students need their personal privacy and space.\"\n\nHe plans to buy a separate device from school for academic use later this year.\n\nHome digital devices used for school will have to meet school specifications and have the DMA installed, at no charge, to ensure cyber security. This is because the devices will be connected to the school's IT network, Mr Loh said.\n\nParents interviewed were largely supportive of schools monitoring their teenagers' devices.\n\nPrivate educator Lim Wee Ming, 45, who has two sons in secondary school, said: \"I don't think schools will randomly go into students' devices to see what they are doing. From what I understand, teachers can access the devices to perhaps show students a certain learning function or take over the students' screens, and this is necessary for more efficient learning.\n\n\"Anyway, we already send our personal data to companies like Apple and Google, so why kick up a fuss?\"\n\nExecutive leadership coach Cassandra Nadira Lee, 46, who has a son in Secondary 2, said schools could engage with students to explain why installing the DMA is necessary, so that it does not feel like a directive imposed on them.\n\n\"It's not easy, but MOE has to find a balance between wanting to protect them, and ensuring they don't feel like they are being controlled.\"\n\nAMELIA TENG, EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT\n\nEducation\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 18, 2024, 06:58am\n\n'Never too late,' says N-level candidate serving 11th jail term\n\nOct 17, 2024, 01:31am\n\nLow-income parents want to give kids head start but lack the means\n\nAug 23, 2024, 01:07am\n\n'Retired' at 32, ex-scholar refuses to be 'a slave to the grind'\n\nAug 19, 2024, 08:33am\n\nTeatime: Your kids are not gifted if they struggle for GEP\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e8fd269b75065e9f2ba5b5ff2f707e3437588e766d3450b686f4885debfcefcc/twss_pic_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "TNP FILE PHOTO"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0e8ae8f889cb891a8c1a8ce4fcd755fc22b52c788b8506a692d6714644cc4b54/2.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Breaking free through education behind bars", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a991861771b0e28c87fa1bea7e906ef925c197cde7685e457853441eb4f99e42/inmates_waiting_for_their_results.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "'Never too late,' says N-level candidate serving 11th jail term", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

TNP PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 28, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nResident employment up, unemployment and retrenchment dip\n\nShare this article\n\nDespite challenges posed by the pandemic, Singapore's resident employment continued to rise while its unemployment rate fell.\n\nRetrenchments, too, dipped in the fourth quarter of last year, after rising five straight quarters.\n\nWhile cautioning that recovery might be uneven this year and the momentum gathered by the labour market could potentially stall, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said yesterday: \"Considering how disruptive the Covid-19 pandemic was at all levels and across all sectors of the economy, the fact that resident employment actually managed some modest growth is something that we are very encouraged (by).\"\n\nResident employment grew by 28,900 in the fourth quarter of last year - the second consecutive quarter of growth after expanding by 43,200 workers in the previous three months.\n\nOn the other hand, non-resident employment fell by 42,400, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in its preliminary estimates for the fourth quarter of last year. This was mainly due to reductions in foreigners holding work permits.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:21am\n\n'I still can't get over it': Flight, cabin crew mull over new course after Jetstar Asia closure\n\n1\n\nMore related stories\n\nFor the whole year, resident employment grew by 9,300, while non-resident employment fell by 181,500, or 16 per cent. This resulted in total employment contracting by 172,200 last year - the most severe in two decades.\n\nUnemployment also continued to ease, with rates declining for two consecutive months - November and last month.\n\nLast year, the unemployment rate was 4.1 per cent among residents and 3 per cent overall, compared with 3.1 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively in 2019.\n\nOverall, the unemployment rate last year was higher than 2019's, but remained below past recessionary peaks.\n\nMs Teo said the growth in resident employment was a testament to workers' resilience, as well as employers' willingness to retain locals with the support of initiatives such as the Jobs Support Scheme, and SGUnited jobs and traineeships.\n\nShe agreed that \"some of the employment opportunities that people got themselves into last year were not exactly what they had set out to find when they embarked on the job search\".\n\nBut locals were willing to try different jobs and that led to the country being able to maintain a \"high degree of resident employment\" by the end of last year, she added.\n\nLabour market estimates yesterday also showed retrenchments declining in the fourth quarter of last year to 6,100, after increasing for five consecutive quarters.\n\nFor the whole year, however, retrenchments affected 26,570 workers - the highest since the 2001 recession due to the dot.com bust.\n\nGiven the larger workforce now, however, the incidence of retrenchments was smaller than in past recessions, at 13 per 1,000 employees.\n\nDuring the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, it was 16 per 1,000 employees.\n\nLast year's lay-offs were mostly in sectors such as the arts, wholesale trade and air transport services.\n\nMOM said it remains to be seen if the fall in retrenchments will continue this year, as the ongoing travel restrictions and business transformations in other sectors may cause further job losses.\n\nCHARMAINE NG\n\nEmployment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 10:34pm\n\nNearly 40 employers offer 450 roles at job fair for retrenched Jetstar Asia staff\n\n1\n\nJun 11, 2025, 05:29am\n\nNTUC exploring options to match retrenched Jetstar Asia staff to roles at SIA Group\n\n1\n\nApr 28, 2025, 03:33am\n\nSingapore's Q1 unemployment up slightly\n\nJan 30, 2025, 11:43pm\n\nEstate cleaners give manager kickbacks for fear of losing jobs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Studies have indicated that this variant \"is less susceptible to antibody neutralisation\", WHO said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

No,\" she told a WHO live social media event.\n\n\"We are in the fight of our lives. We have to make sure that we're not fighting each other; that we're fighting the virus... the variants included.\n\n\"We can conquer this virus - and we will conquer this virus.\"\n\nAll variants and strains included, WHO said 4.1 million cases were registered around the world over the past week, and some 96,000 deaths.\n\nWhile the number of deaths was similar to the previous week, the new case number marked a 15 per cent decline week on week.\n\nIt was the second consecutive week that new case numbers declined, after peaking in the first week of January.\n\nThe global decline was largely driven by relative reductions in cases in some countries that have seen the highest numbers in recent months, WHO said, including in the US - the country hardest hit by the pandemic All regions saw new case numbers come down or remain flat. - AFP\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Pretty then uses her bare hands to dig him out.\n\nMulligan said: \"(I felt) terror. Ralph didn't want to use a stuntman, which I totally get, but it just did leave me with the terrible task of trying to stop him from suffocating.\n\n\"I was in charge of his face. I felt like if I'd been in charge of any other part of his body, I would have been fine.\n\n\"But I kept on saying to (director) Simon (Stone), please don't put me in charge of his mouth... I'm going to mess it up and he's not going to be able to breathe. So it was really stressful.\"\n\nFiennes emerged from that scene unscathed.\n\nAdding a sense of authenticity, Stone asked the crew to bury mock-up treasures to replicate the excitement around the original discovery.\n\nHe said: \"We buried the treasure that they find and we hid it from them... And so they went on a treasure hunt. It took hours and we were just rolling and rolling and rolling and sometimes there'd be long periods where no one found anything.\"\n\nFiennes actually unearthed some medieval pottery while digging on set outside London.\n\n\"It was like a bit of clay,\" he said, adding he hoped audiences would be inspired by the film's small details.\n\n\"We live in a world of mass production... some of these (Sutton Hoo) treasures... are stunning pieces of craftsmanship. And that is a cause for wonder.\" - REUTERS\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/61f1b47884f9324d349f5acdf8ba52e1340e168994b080e22d3a50a58369ded4/dig_unit_02431_r.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Carey Mulligan (left) and Ralph Fiennes in The Dig", "caption": "Carey Mulligan (left) and Ralph Fiennes in The Dig NETFLIX"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/57205b4d818b58d9a486f0d593b692f5de14d8f9c46d3fbbf7accb62fae7e6fa/btstars20250708.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "National Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/06f5af9d15a7bffb2eeef3285750478e5e20b243c653d0c3e06dae3a7d63d5c1/tccollagestar.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Star Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

We didn't expect it, we came into the game confident. We've got to pick ourselves up.\"\n\nUnited's defeat ended a 13-match unbeaten run in the league since they lost to Arsenal at Old Trafford on Nov 1.\n\nMikel Arteta's improved side are their next opponents, this weekend.\n\n\"It's all good and easy when you're winning football matches and you're playing well, but now it's time to stand up and be counted,\" said Maguire.\n\n\"When you get kicked down, it's how quickly you bounce back and Saturday's a big one and we've got to get three points.\"\n\nArsenal are not sure if Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be ready to feature against United after the striker missed two games due to his mother's illness, Arteta said on Thursday.\n\nAubameyang pulled out of Arsenal's FA Cup fourth-round defeat at Southampton last weekend and was also absent from their 3-1 league win over the same opponents on Wednesday morning.\n\nArteta was asked about the Gabon forward's availability after the 31-year-old thanked Arsenal for their support and had said he would return home ahead of the United game.\n\n\"I don't know. I spoke with him yesterday. Things are looking better at the moment but we're going to have to wait and see,\" Arteta told a news conference.\n\n\"He's our captain and one of the most important players.

We were here to support him as well with the time that he needed to get that sorted.\"\n\nArsenal on Wednesday signed Real Madrid midfielder Martin Odegaard on loan until the end of the season and Arteta also suggested the Norwegian may need more time to build his fitness.\n\n\"We believe he's got some special qualities that we need that we have been missing. Now we have to give him a little bit of time,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"He hasn't played that many minutes in Madrid, but he's been training hard. He looks so excited, as we are, to have another big talent in our club.\n\n\"He's a specialist to play in the pockets. To be in the No.8 or 10 positions. He can play off the sides...

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer opted to rotate his team, leaving out Fred and Scott McTominay from central midfield and that had a big impact on the game with United lacking the intensity that pair have been providing in the middle of the pitch. Sheffield United, who now have eight points, went ahead in the 23rd minute when Bryan headed in John Fleck's corner with United goalkeeper David de Gea flapping at the cross, although replays suggested he may have been pushed by Sheffield striker Billy Sharp.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nUnited's frustration over that decision was amplified when Anthony Martial had the ball in the net but the effort was ruled out for a foul by Harry Maguire on goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.\n\nNO ZIP\n\nSolskjaer's side were lacking any of the zip and invention of their recent good run of form, but managed to get on level terms when their Sheffield-born captain Harry Maguire met an Alex Telles corner with an unstoppable header.\n\nUnited paid the price from hesitant defending, however, when Burke's low drive deflected off Axel Tuanzebe and crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.\n\nSolskjaer demanded his team pick themselves up for their trip to Arsenal on Sunday morning after suffering their first league defeat since early November.\n\n\"Disappointed, we couldn't get to the heights of the last few months' football we played. Very disappointing, we couldn't find a solution to their very compact block and good defence. \"That little spark, that edge, we didn't have that extra creativity, imagination, the X factor we've had - it's happened, we look at it, agree it is not good enough and go again,\" he said. \"There is no time to feel sorry for yourself because Saturday you go again, we have Arsenal, we have to forget this, learn from it and move on.\"\n\nBurke was ecstatic at his club's first win at Old Trafford since 1973. \"Amazing result, really was a must-win for us and I'm chuffed for the boys, they put in a great shift. Amazing feeling and amazing for me to get the goal, I am buzzing for the boys and hopefully we can take that into our next games,\" he said. \"We showed great courage and great determination.

Manchester United may even be top again when you read this sentence.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut the form guide and common sense suggest that the Red Devils must sustain their remarkable form, despite an underlying caution in their tactics, for the rest of the season to stay on top. It's a long shot.\n\nCity, on the other hand, can probably take it from here on autopilot. It's not so much that they've done it all before, but rather they've got it all on the bench.\n\nTheir comfortable 5-0 thrashing of West Bromwich Albion yesterday morning (Singapore time) was achieved without a conventional No. 9. No other title rival could do that.\n\nImagine what Spurs without Harry Kane or Leicester without Jamie Vardy might look like.\n\nIn a way, we can. Glance over at Chelsea's struggles up front.\n\nFrank Lampard lost his job trying to fill his striking vacancy, switching between Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud to stop confidence haemorrhaging through the brittle duo of Timo Werner and Kai Havertz.\n\nLiverpool retain their nominal striker, but in name only. Roberto Firmino is present, but hasn't been correct for a while now. The Reds' jaded forward line has suffered from a toiling Brazilian and AWOL midfielders covering in defence.\n\nTottenham are underachieving with a conservative manager. Leicester are arguably overachieving with an outstanding manager. Arsenal are somewhere between the two, spending much of the season behaving like a jittery gambler, unsure whether to stick or twist.\n\nA weird season played inside eerily empty stadiums and beneath the pandemic's infernal cloud was always going to be an exercise in inconsistency, a temporary reality that City's rivals may look back on with real regrets.\n\nRomantics remember 2016 as Leicester's eternal Cinderella story. Arsenal fans remember 2016 as the lost opportunity. They were the forgotten runners-up, missing their greatest chance to win the title since Arsene Wenger's heyday.\n\nSo many clubs could end up with that same sinking feeling this time around.\n\nLeicester, Chelsea, Spurs, United and Liverpool are all acutely aware that this title will be secured with the lowest points tally in years. Monopolistic practices are no longer in place. It's a free-for-all.\n\nAnd yet, unexpectedly, there's the sobering prospect of the old empire striking back.\n\nNo one else can rival City's current form. Their machine-like addiction to industrial artistry has returned. The 5-0 win at the Hawthorns was their 11th in a row in all competitions (for the first time since 2017).\n\nNo one can currently rival Guardiola's ability to improve players and persevere with unstable talents until they flourish.\n\nIlkay Guendogan was Guardiola's first signing at City, but polarised the fan base until recently. Now, he's irreplaceable.\n\nThe German ruled the left side against West Brom in an advanced role, scoring twice and linking with Phil Foden, another key beneficiary of Guardiola's tuition.\n\nOn the right side, Joao Cancelo has switched from Kyle Walker's understudy to a quick-thinking quarterback so quickly it feels like a trick of the eye, a kind of coaching magic.\n\nThere are even disappearing acts that no one notices. Do you remember Kevin de Bruyne, the Belgian wizard, threads like a seamstress and shoots like a cannon? No one did against West Brom.\n\nGuendogan, Foden and even Riyad Mahrez are overcompensating for the absences of both de Bruyne and Sergio Aguero. Slowly, but most definitely surely, the tortoises are taking charge.\n\nGuardiola's men, superior in pretty much every department, are threatening to walk off with this thing.\n\nIn time, their rivals may be left to rue the one that got away.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Six of those strikes have come in City's last 10 matches.\n\nJoao Cancelo, Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling also found the net for City.\n\nOn Guendogan, Guardiola said: \"Gundo is a guy who has an incredible sense of goal.\n\n\"It is not just knowing the right time to arrive at the box, it is the right second.\n\n\"This is the most difficult thing - not to arrive one metre before, or one metre later, but at exactly the right time, and Gundo has this sense.\n\n\"And it's not just that - with his finishing too he has this way to control the ball, slow down and take a second to compose himself and see what happens, and be clinical.\"\n\nAnother Citizen who has had an impressive season is fullback Cancelo, who laid on Guendogan's first goal.\n\nSaid the German: \"(He) has the ability to offer something a little bit different in the role.\n\n\"He gets a lot of touches and he has quality. I knew this, that's why I made the run and the ball was perfect.\n\n\"He's doing well, especially the last few weeks.\"\n\nCity's form prompted former England striker Gary Lineker to tweet: \"A Man City side playing their best football again, with a strong defence, is a frightening thought for the rest of the league... and Europe.\"\n\nWest Brom remain second from bottom on 11 points, six points from safety.\n\nThey have conceded 22 goals in their last five home league games, the most since Aston Villa in December 1935 (22).\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nExplore High-Demand New Collar Jobs That Value Skills\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ffaf6d229f017bd4ea73f20857385b8cb1791656e81415c5b81ad3f12eb60ced/NP_20210128_CITY28_6292733.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Pep Guardiola.

Ice packs were then applied to his neck, armpit and groin, and water sprayed on his face.\n\nSingapore Armed Forces captain Tan Baoshu, 33, who was the supervising officer of the march, rejected suggestions from other army personnel to evacuate the NSF to the camp's medical centre, saying that the soldier was suffering from physical exhaustion and would recover after resting.\n\nTan ordered CFC Lee to be evacuated only much later and the NSF arrived at the camp's medical centre at around 9.05am.\n\nDespite receiving treatment at the centre and later at CGH, CFC Lee's condition deteriorated.\n\nDr Kenneth Heng, a senior consultant in the emergency department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, testified that evacuating CFC Lee to the medical centre should have been the priority and that a 40-minute delay was \"too long\".\n\nTan was charged in October 2018 with offences including causing death by performing a rash act.\n\nHe was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in January last year, after he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. He died the following month.\n\nCFC Lee's mother, Madam Jasmine Yeo, who was present in the coroner's court yesterday, told reporters later that the lapses were \"totally unforgivable\".\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nDeath\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:25am\n\nDriver who killed motorcyclist in crash had view obstructed by sunshade\n\n7\n\nJul 4, 2025, 03:08am\n\n69-year-old woman found dead in Changi flat after days of foul smell\n\n4\n\nJun 9, 2025, 08:05am\n\nCollision involving lorry claims life of 27-year-old e-bike rider\n\n3\n\nJun 2, 2025, 02:34am\n\nPrivate-hire driver who worked 15-hour shifts 'for my kids' dies of stroke\n\n15\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a8800e8b7fa983dec6fcebee767a00c0ea02117731000d6e0ac3a03f078479f7/NP_20210128_SQLEE__6292795.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "CFC Dave Lee Han Xuan died 12 days after being admitted to hospital for heatstroke.

Shanmugam yesterday.\n\nHe was commenting on the case of a 16-year-old Singaporean student who was detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) last month for plotting to attack Muslims at two mosques here on the second anniversary of a terror attack in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nThe Protestant Christian of Indian ethnicity was influenced by Christchurch shooter Brenton Tarrant, and is the first ISA detainee to have been inspired by far-right extremist ideology.\n\n\"It was quite chilling,\" Mr Shanmugam told reporters at the Home Team Science and Technology Agency, noting that the youth had planned the attack expecting that he would be killed by the police while executing his plans. \"And he was prepared to die.\"\n\n\"Violent impulses, I've said this many times, are not restricted to any particular racial group or religious group. It can occur amongst anyone. It's really a question of being exposed to hate speech and then being influenced by it.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 06:16am\n\nWhen is it acceptable to address a stranger as 'uncle' or 'aunty'?\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe said Singapore's strategy has been to engage with community and religious organisations on maintaining religious and racial harmony, as well as use the ISA to pick up radicalised individuals before they can cause any harm.\n\nIf the attack had succeeded, it would likely have incited fear and conflict between different racial and religious groups in Singapore, Mr Shanmugam noted.\n\nWORRYING TREND\n\nMaking the point that such extremism is not restricted to one particular group, he pointed to terrorists who claim to act in the name of Islam, as well as right-wing extremists with hateful manifestos.\n\n\"Tarrant inspired this boy whom we picked up. It is sad, I would say, that it's come to this, the world has come to this. And it's also creeping into Singapore,\" said Mr Shanmugam.\n\nMr Shanmugam also flagged another worrying trend - that seven people under the age of 20 have been picked up under the ISA since 2015, after getting radicalised through the Internet. Four have been detained, while three were served with restriction orders.\n\nTo weed out more of such cases, he said the Internal Security Department and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth are engaging religious organisations to be more vigilant. Advisories have also been issued to these groups to strengthen their crisis preparedness.\n\n\"Our population has confidence that the Government is in the middle, and we protect you, regardless of who you are, whether you are Muslim or Christian,\" he said.\n\nFABIAN KOH\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/61b5962464634fcfde30364f37753c95b447022cca1ada65ea7508a09aba1e06/NP_20210128_FBSHAN28_6293068.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Law Minister K.

Then I will celebrate Chinese New Year with eight visitors - not more - from the family.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters during a visit to Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic, where vaccinations for seniors aged 70 and above kicked off yesterday, PM Lee stressed there remains a danger of a superspreader event occurring during the new year festivities.\n\nThe Government is able to keep things under control if one or two cases emerge, he added. But if a few dozen clusters emerge, there is a very real risk Singapore may go back to the situation in March and April last year, when cases spiked.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We had to lock down with a circuit breaker, and that's a very high and disruptive cost for all of us in Singapore to pay.\"\n\nRather than take that risk, Singaporeans can restrain themselves and celebrate Chinese New Year differently this year to keep Singapore safe, PM Lee added.\n\nUnder new measures announced by the Covid-19 multi-ministry task force, up to only eight visitors are allowed per household each day. Individuals are advised to visit a maximum of two households daily.\n\nDiners should also avoid shouting auspicious phrases when engaging in the tossing of yusheng, or during lohei.\n\nPM Lee said: \"When you lohei, please do it in your hearts. If you must have the sound, there are very good apps - you press the button and they will say the right words for you.\"\n\nHe said he hopes everybody will understand that this will not be a normal Year of the Ox.\n\n\"Celebrate it in the right spirit, but keep ourselves safe so that perhaps a year from now, when the Year of the Tiger comes around, we would be roaring like a tiger.\"\n\nPM Lee, who received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Jan 8, said he would be receiving the second dose tomorrow.\n\nApart from his arm feeling slightly sore for the first two days, he did not have any side effects.\n\nPresident Halimah Yacob also got the jab on the sidelines of a visit to Outram Polyclinic yesterday.\n\nMadam Halimah said the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore's position is that Covid-19 vaccines are permissible for Muslim use.\n\nYUEN SIN & LINETTE LAI\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/55e0cde435ccd03190e681499c3cecfb7382cfee29a092d3be0fbc9035b3e3c1/NP_20210128_YSLEE28_6292983.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic, where vaccinations for seniors started yesterday.

This was because its systems were not updated.\n\nThe Singaporean former healthcare assistant knew that she was not entitled to the monies but did not inform TTSH about its error. Instead, she made use of the cash for her personal expenses.\n\nLast December, she pleaded guilty to one count of dishonest concealment of property involving more than $22,000. She also admitted to a cheating charge.\n\nAnother count of dishonest concealment of property linked to the remaining amount and a second cheating charge were considered during sentencing.\n\nFAILED TO REPORT FOR WORK\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Emily Koh had earlier said that TTSH appointed Nurul as a healthcare assistant on March 20, 2017, and she earned $1,630 a month.\n\nBut she failed to report for work on Aug 16 and 17, 2018.\n\nShe did not notify her colleagues and supervisors about the reasons for her absence.\n\nThere was also no prior leave approved by her supervisor.\n\nDPP Koh had told the court: \"According to the terms and conditions of the accused's employment with TTSH, the accused was deemed to have voluntarily terminated service... by failing to report (for work) for more than two consecutive days without notifying her immediate supervisor.\"\n\nEven though Nurul's last day of employment was Aug 17, 2018, her details erroneously remained in the hospital's human resource system.\n\nSeparately, Nurul went to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital for a consultation on Oct 10, 2019.\n\nShe lied to an employee there, claiming that she was working for TTSH and was entitled to staff medical benefits.\n\nNurul's offences came to light after a TTSH senior executive alerted the police in January last year. - THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7f78c5ae7e780fc9594dd0f7d9906d6c8c26969be160db7cfc3253cfac643a1b/NP_20210128_SQNURUL__6292835.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Nurul Atiqah Kamsari did not inform the hospital about the error.

It is done during rest periods in training and after training.\n\nPurpose-built cooling pads, which can be stuck onto the body, also help to cool a person with a suspected heat injury.\n\nIn September last year, the Ministry of Defence said the SAF had introduced enhancements to its heat injury management and prevention measures. These include implementing a simplified evacuation protocol; improving heat injury awareness for commanders and medics; enhancing existing cooling and heat injury prevention measures; and strengthening an open reporting culture.\n\nOther measures taken in the wake of CFC Lee's death include rolling out a new training safety regulation for all commanders and medics to evacuate every trainee who cannot respond to simple questions on time, place and identity. - THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nYour dream home, now more affordable with IKEA home design ​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/64195085c490499ea8361b13417b3b100755598d59569707dc77de45ee80f2b8/NP_20210128_SQLEE28A__6292896.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Arm immersion is a preventive measure where soldiers dip their arms into iced water between 15 seconds and 30 seconds to help cool their core body temperature.

The problem is, few of us have the patience.\n\nWell, for those of you who are \"careful\" punters, I say keep an eye out for when Elliot Ness makes his racing debut.\n\nOn the strength of what we have seen of him at the trials, he has been well \"educated\" by Mark Walker and could be ready for a winning Kranji debut.\n\nElliot Ness was again at the trials on Tuesday morning and, like he did in late December, he won the hit-out with authority.\n\nRidden by Saimee Jumaat, the three-year-old held third spot right until the field of five were 200m from home.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nWith Billy Elliot and Anpanman trading blows in front, Saimee urged Elliot Ness through a gap and, scrubbed along, he drew away from his two rivals to score by just over two lengths.\n\nHis time of 60.83sec for the 1,000m was commendable.\n\nSince arriving in Singapore from Australia late last year, Elliot Ness has acclimatised like a good horse.\n\nFormerly racing as Prohibition, winning trials isn't something new for him.\n\nThe chestnut gelding ran in two trials at Randwick - and he won them both.\n\nRight now he certainly looks good to go. And as Walker and his team have been patient with him, so too should the Kranji faithful. Just hold your horses until Elliot Ness steps out in a race. He could be hard to beat.\n\nAlso at the trials we saw Lim's Shot roll back the months with a solid win in his hit-out.\n\nRidden by Marc Lerner, Lim's Shot and Evil Roadster (I Saifudin) had the trial to themselves.\n\nEvil Roadster always seemed to have the upper hand until 200m from home when Lerner clicked his mount into overdrive. Lim's Shot relished the chance of a good stretch out and he went on to beat Evil Roadster by a neck.\n\nPrepared for the races by Jerome Tan, Lim's Shot had a true \"moment to remember\" on July 11. That day, he led the field out for Race 1.\n\nIt was an auspicious occasion as it signalled the re-start of racing which had gone into cold storage for slightly more than three months because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTrue to the No. 1 saddlecloth which he wore, Lim's Shot won that 1,200m sprint, beating Performante by a neck.\n\nIt was his first win after a three-year drought.\n\nHe was back. So too, racing.\n\nLim's Shot is one of those horses who refuses to believe he's getting long in the tooth.\n\nHe is, you know, already eight but he's still as game as ever.\n\nIn an earlier trial, Heavenly Dancer drew attention when he charged home to take third behind Qaraat and Autumn Rush.\n\nHe was doing his best work over the concluding stages and it told us that he was at or is near the top of his game.\n\nAlready a winner of two races from just five starts, trainer Stephen Gray could be in the process of moulding him into one of the stars of the 2021 season.\n\nChart his progress. It could be worth your while.\n\nYESTERDAY'S GALLOPS BY HORSES ENGAGED ON SATURDAY\n\nRACE 5:\n\nSupersonicsurprise (CC Wong) 35.6.\n\nRACE 6:\n\nKakadu (S John) 39.4.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d520f602991a41a93b98c2b53b75b737a744a89e4aa87765d8a331db39eaf07c/np_20210128_bmtrials28_62910992.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1e42f2ebaf825e27fbdd96b8eb09029f407904f0079182b89b5cf6da850cce04/IMG_0407.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "Group 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Not bad for an old fella.\n\nThe veteran has not featured on the board for quite some time now. Indeed, if you're keeping score, it was a year ago - on Jan 18 - that he made his last winning deposit for the owners, the MTS Racing Stable.\n\nThey must have been over the moon. After all, their old warrior has - in a career which has spanned \"donkey's years\" - brought home cheques totalling in excess of $400,000. And to think, he is not done yet.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nCome Saturday, Supersonicsurprise will be having his 90th race start. It's a huge milestone for any racehorse and for that alone, he deserves a rousing round of applause - and maybe even, a juicy carrot or two.\n\nSo, the question. Can he put another win on the board?\n\nIt's a big ask. At nine years old, he will be taking on rivals, some of them half his age. Still, as always been the case with the gallant galloper, you can bet your bottom dollar that he'll give you a run for your money.\n\nOn the other side of the scale, there's Kakadu. He's just four years old and he's had just five starts. He was one of \"the handful\" who galloped yesterday, in 39.4 with race jockey S John in the saddle. He is in Race 6.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1e42f2ebaf825e27fbdd96b8eb09029f407904f0079182b89b5cf6da850cce04/IMG_0407.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "Group 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

They were also knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United last Sunday.\n\nThe Reds have not found the net in the league in the past month and Klopp said people were \"losing trust and faith\" in his attacking trio of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino far too quickly for his liking.\n\n\"I see them working on everything and we're working as a team on solutions. It's a complex game and it's never about one person,\" Klopp told reporters ahead of their trip to Tottenham Hotspur tomorrow morning (Singapore time).\n\n\"We have to become the team we want to be and that is the team nobody wants to play against. At the moment, every team is defending deep but we have another chance tomorrow night.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"People tell us we are the best team in the world, which we are not but it's not a problem. We have to prove it again and strike back. The more negative things that are said about us, maybe the more we want it.\"\n\nThe last time these two sides met, they were first and second in the league, but Spurs have also endured a slump to sit one point behind Liverpool with a game in hand.\n\n\"Things have changed,\" Klopp said. \"We want to make sure the next month is more positive, but we cannot change last month.\n\n\"We played some good stuff against United and we have to be more consistent. We play Tottenham and we have to go game by game. Is it difficult? Yes. That's how it is in every Premier League game.\"\n\nAfter Spurs, Liverpool face a daunting run of fixtures, facing three of the top four - West Ham, Manchester City and Leicester City - in their next five league games.\n\nKlopp also spoke about new Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel, who was his successor at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund, saying that Frank Lampard had left him a \"present\".\n\nLampard was dismissed on Monday, after a run of five defeats in eight EPL games.\n\nKlopp, who took nearly four years to win his first trophy with Liverpool, sympathised with Lampard, who was only 18 months into the job.\n\n\"It's really harsh to make that decision really early,\" said Klopp. \"Mr Abramovich gives you some chances - players, money - but is not the most patient person in the world.\"\n\nOn Tuchel, Klopp said he is a \"really good manager\", adding: \"I know him for a long time, I respect him a lot. This Chelsea squad is a present and I'm pretty sure Thomas sees it like that.

We are going to play our best and we want to be able to play our (brand of) football as much as we can.\"\n\nThe AFC Champions League will feature 40 teams - up from 32 - for the first time and the group stage will be contested in centralised locations, which are yet to be finalised.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 12, 2025, 02:38am\n\nSingapore U-16 boys roar back with 3 goals in 8 minutes to stun Cambodia\n\nMore related stories\n\nTampines will play in the East Zone group stage from April 21-May 7, with knockout stages running through September and October, before a double-legged final on Nov 21 and 27.\n\nThe AFC Cup draw was also revealed yesterday in Kuala Lumpur, with SPL sides Lion City Sailors and Geylang International placed in Group H and I respectively.\n\nThe Sailors will face Malaysian Super League (MSL) runners-up Kedah, who are managed by former Home United coach Aidil Sharin, as well as Vietnam's Saigon and a play-off winner.\n\nIndonesia's Persipura Jayapura will face the winners of the clash between Visakha (Cambodia) and Lalenok United (Timor-Leste) for the final spot in Group H.\n\nSailors coach Aurelio Vidmar rated his group as the toughest and expects an absorbing meeting with Kedah, who also have Singaporean midfielder M. Anumanthan in their ranks.\n\n\"We are in the hardest group, but that is a good challenge for us,\" said Vidmar who led Adelaide United to the 2008 AFC Champions League final.\n\n\"Aidil will know Singapore football and our club intimately, as much as we know about Kedah and their coach. So it will make for a fascinating game and I'm sure everyone is looking forward to that game.\"\n\nAidil, who guided Home to the 2018 AFC Cup Asean Zone title, added: \"I had a feeling we would be drawn with Sailors, it would be good to meet my former players and staff.\n\n\"That said, the Sailors have the advantage with the national team players they have and their marquee $3 million signing (Diego Lopes).\"\n\nOver in Group I, the Eagles will take on MSL side Terengganu, the Philippines' Kaya FC-Iloilo and Myanmar's Shan United or Ayeyawady United.\n\nGeylang coach Noor Ali singled out Terengganu as their stiffest challenge based on last season's performances, but still backs his side to make the zonal semi-finals, at least.\n\nTeams in the Asean Zone will play the group stage - single match, round-robin format - from June 22-28 before single-legged semi-finals on Aug 10 and 11. The Asean Zonal final has been pencilled in for Aug 25, while the AFC Cup final will take place on Nov 26.\n\nWith the AFC Cup group-stage matches also taking place at centralised locations, teams flying in will also have to cope with periods of quarantine before they are allowed to train and play.\n\n\"We know that the quarantine is there for good reasons, so we are just waiting for updates,\" said Lee.\n\nAdded Noor Ali: \"It is a very big concern, especially if the SPL is carrying on at the same time. There will be issues like fitness so, hopefully, we can work out something that is beneficial to all parties.\"\n\nBy\n\nNarendaren Karnageran\n\nRead articles by Narendaren Karnageran\n\nSingapore Football\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 10, 2025, 10:45pm\n\nLions survive late onslaught to claim first win of Asian Cup third-round qualifiers\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:01pm\n\nLion City Sailors retain Singapore Cup to cement domestic dominance\n\nMay 18, 2025, 11:06pm\n\nLion City Sailors denied at final hurdle as Sharjah FC clinch AFC Champions League Two title\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:16pm\n\nACL2 trophy is 'something beautiful to fight for', says Lion City Sailors' Hariss Harun\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Only Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes has scored more EPL goals from midfield than the Czech since he joined a year ago.\n\nA third goal was no more than the visitors deserved and it came 25 minutes from time when Craig Dawson headed in Jarrod Bowen's corner. Michy Batshuayi pulled a goal back with virtually the last kick of the game but it was too little, too late for Palace. - AFP\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nTransform your home affordably with IKEA Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ab345ca2ab22ede07e68f673f5f748e412461918b089271228361a3ae88f7eec/NP_20210128_SOC28_6293216.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "David Moyes.

He also taught an amputee to chop chicken with one hand using a chopping board with a steel pin in the middle that holds the meat in place.\n\nSimple innovations that work to make the food served even more delicious.\n\nDignity Kitchen\n\n69 Boon Keng Road, opens 8am to 8pm\n\nClosed on Sundays and public holidays\n\nBy\n\nKF Seetoh\n\nFood columnist\n\nRead articles by KF Seetoh\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/184a2c71587dadd8d0281997152108e12a89b3fcb78c7ff41b6cd00603b6b039/np_20210128_makan28_l_62920242.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Koh Seng Choon, is the founder of Dignity Kitchen in Boon Keng Road, a foodcourt managed by people with disabilities who whip up local favourites like laksa (above), kolo mee and claypot rice.

Pay a fair price you can live with.\n\nAnd with that in mind, here are eight places I found to have great value. Some may not be cheap, but for the joy and comfort I glean from them, I am willing to pay.\n\nHAI TIEN LO\n\nHai Tien Lo (Pan Pacific Hotel, Tel: 6826-8240) offers one of this year's most value-added staples with its pen cai.\n\nDepending on your budget, you can get the Classic Treasure Pot (from $268) with abalone and bird's nest, or the pricier Premium Wealth Treasure Pot (from $468) with 15 ingredients.\n\nRegardless of price, you will get a steaming pot of delicious happiness.\n\nAfter your meal, just keep some of the sauce in the pot, add some stock and whatever ingredients you have left over and you have another meal.\n\nYAN\n\nFor those who prefer to dine out, Yan (National Gallery Singapore, Tel: 6384-5585) offers six set menus, starting with the vegetarian menu at $78 a person.\n\nPHOTO: YEOH WEE TECK\n\nThis Cantonese restaurant is famous for its flavour-packed traditional dishes, and my favourite dish from its festive menu is from Set Menu 5 ($228 a person) - the Double-boiled Fish Maw, Chicken with Cordyceps Flower Soup.\n\nAfter such a tumultuous last year, you will want comfort, and drinking this will bring on such bliss.\n\nCRYSTAL JADE\n\nCrystal Jade does value well. Head to estore.crystaljade.com to check what is available and focus on the sets for exceptional value.\n\nCrystal Jade's Season of Wealth Golden Scallop Yusheng will impress. PHOTO: CRYSTAL JADE\n\nIf you are looking for yusheng, its Season of Wealth Golden Scallop Yusheng (from $108) should impress.\n\nExpect lots of vegetables, fruits, pickled vegetables, deep fried yam strips, Hsinchu bee hoon, with an olive oil-based dressing, and the winning touch - scallop slices that are briefly torched.\n\nBASILICO\n\nOne of the most memorable yusheng for the Year of the Ox comes from an Italian restaurant.\n\nPHOTO:  REGENT SINGAPORE\n\nBasilico (Regent Singapore, Tel: 6725-3232) presents one with angel hair pasta laden with applewood smoked salmon, Amalfi lemon-poached baby scallops, Norcia black truffles, Avruga caviar and pickled porcini mushrooms.\n\nIt is $128 and available from Feb 11 to 26.\n\nAfter this, you can go over to Summer Palace for a traditional and equally delicious meal.\n\nPUTIEN\n\nThere are modern versions of yusheng, but sometimes the traditional ones hit all the right spots.\n\nPHOTO: PUTIEN\n\nPutien's Prosperity Yu Sheng (with abalone) (from $39.80) is as expected, with pomelo strips, jellyfish, roasted white sesame and peanuts, and fried seaweed, with five-head Nanri abalone.\n\nThe sauce contains ingredients such as liquorice, sour plum sauce, tangerine sauce and peanut oil, and the taste reminds you of all the yusheng you have had before.\n\nVisit\n\nwww.putien.com\n\nfor more information.\n\nWAH LOK\n\nWah Lok (Carlton Hotel, Tel: 6311-8188) is selling its beloved CNY offerings online via\n\nwww.signatures.carltonhotel.sg\n\n.\n\nPHOTO: CARLTON HOTEL\n\nOne to try is its version of Buddha Jumps Over The Wall (from $526), a nutritious soup choking with premium ingredients that can take centre stage on your dining table.\n\nMIN JIANG\n\nSoups are an ultimate comfort and worth the value for an occasional indulgence.\n\nPHOTO: GOODWOOD PARK HOTEL\n\nMin Jiang (Goodwood Park Hotel, Tel: 6730-1704) has a double-boiled abalone soup and eel fish maw ($248), which has a collagen-rich soup simmered for three hours, with delicious prawn dumplings and minced pork meatballs.

It said that while some infected students may have been asymptomatic, it had also failed to require students with cold-like symptoms to get tested.\n\nPrime Minister Chung Sye-kyun called on people affiliated with the affected facilities to get tested.\n\nMeanwhile, China has started using anal swabs to test those it considers at high risk of contracting Covid-19, state TV reported.\n\nDoctors say this can be more effective in detecting the virus. Officials took anal swabs from residents of neighbourhoods with Covid-19 cases in Beijing last week, broadcaster CCTV said, while those in designated quarantine facilities have also undergone the test.\n\nBeijing has also tightened curbs ahead of Chinese New Year. It will require people arriving from low-risk areas in China between today and March 15 to show negative Covid-19 test results.\n\nPeople wanting to enter the capital from those areas will also first need to undergo a 14-day health observation period at home, Beijing authorities said yesterday.\n\nCovid-19 tests will also be performed on the seventh and 14th day of their arrival. - REUTERS, AFP\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/662d653efb4be274d2eb9e6cd65eb9095b74df707415fc9d7fcf8ab1d3fce15e/NP_20210128_KOREA28_6292948.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A young patient heading for a makeshift clinic at a Christian school in Gwangju, some 270km south of Seoul.

Around 668,250 cases have been reported each day over the same period, and the global fatality rate stands at 2.15 per cent.\n\nThe worst-affected countries - the US, India, Brazil, Russia and Britain - make up more than half of all reported Covid-19 cases but represent 28 per cent of the global population, according to a Reuters analysis.\n\nIt took the world 11 months to record the first 50 million cases of the pandemic, compared to just three months for cases to double to 100 million.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

Britain on Tuesday reached 100,000 deaths.\n\nThe Eastern European region, including countries like Russia, Poland and Ukraine, contribute nearly 10 per cent of all global cases.\n\nDespite securing deals for vaccine supplies early on, many European countries are facing delays in shipments from both Pfizer and AstraZeneca.\n\nIn India, the nation with the second-highest number of cases, infections are decreasing, with almost 13,700 new infections reported on average each day - around 15 per cent of its peak.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi said last Friday that India was completely self-reliant on coronavirus vaccine supplies as the world's second-most populous country inoculated more than one million people within a week of starting its campaign.\n\nChina, which recently marked the first anniversary of the world's first coronavirus lockdown in the city of Wuhan, is facing its worst wave of local cases since March last year.\n\nAs richer nations race ahead with mass vaccination campaigns, Africa is still scrambling to secure supplies as it grapples with concerns about more infectious variants first identified in South Africa and Britain.\n\nAccording to the Reuters tally, African countries have nearly 3.5 million cases and more than 85,000 deaths.\n\nThe South African variant is 50 per cent more infectious and has been detected in at least 20 countries. - REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nKitchen Remodeling | Search Ads\n\nSee the Latest HDB Kitchen Cabinet Trends and Designs\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/99c4b87fc21d70e79c8457459f5a51b32a751b0770a50167e5465fb91b64dac7/NP_20210128_GLOBAL28_6292971.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Many therefore squeeze themselves into even smaller subdivided flats known as \"cage homes\" - cubicles that can be as tiny as 50 sq ft or even less, with shared bathrooms and showers inside ageing walk-up buildings.\n\nIt is in these kinds of buildings that many clusters have been located in recent weeks. - AFP\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2483d7acca2c963171b3516bf0c10580864d59ad049551c8feac4b4b879927be/NP_20211210_PROTEST10_7055858.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Parents' groups in S.

Like Tarrant, he had planned to drive from one mosque to the other despite being too young to have a driving licence.\n\n\"The detailed planning and preparation attests to the youth's determination to follow through with his attack plan,\" ISD added.\n\nHome Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam told reporters yesterday that if such an attack had succeeded, it was likely to incite fear and conflict between the country's different racial groups and religions.\n\nHe said it was \"quite chilling\" to hear the boy tell ISD officers that \"he was prepared to die\".\n\nThe minister also said the teen will be rehabilitated instead of been treated as a criminal in the hope that \"after a number of years, he can be released and carry on with his life\".\n\nISD said its investigation to date indicates the youth had acted alone and his immediate family and those in his social circle were not aware of his attack plans and hatred of Islam.\n\nMs Kimberly Chew, a psychologist at Annabelle Psychology, said this suggests the youth was \"relying solely on his own interpretation of certain viewpoints that he gathered online and then acting on it\".\n\nMs Chew, who works closely with children and adolescents, said other factors such as low self-esteem, the experience of a traumatic event or a personality disorder can push a young person towards extremist views.\n\n\"Young people who often find themselves struggling with self-identity are easily influenced by information they get online. It becomes problematic when they are not able to decipher inaccurate information and determine what is fact,\" she told The New Paper.\n\nMs Chew said some red flags include the child suddenly refusing to engage with anyone different from them and steering clear of peers from a different race or religion. Sudden social withdrawal, changes in emotional state and a heightened state of secrecy are other potential behaviours to be wary of.\n\nISD said this case demonstrates that extreme ideas can find resonance among, and radicalise, Singaporeans regardless of race or religion.\n\nIt said: \"It is a threat to all of us and our way of life. We must remain vigilant to signs that someone around us may have become radicalised, so that we can intervene early to avert a tragedy.\"\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c28757cf36926b9b6526398448946d24b4e4498ce6c4fbcac925caacc356a170/np_20210128_sdterror_6292988.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The youth bought a tactical vest and had picked out a machete on Carousell, but he was detained before he could buy it.

I was just so determined to make something of myself.

The committee will develop the job ladders, training requirements and wage benchmarks for the sector, he added.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:21am\n\n'I still can't get over it': Flight, cabin crew mull over new course after Jetstar Asia closure\n\nMore related stories\n\nNTUC director of operations and mobilisation Fahmi Aliman will chair the committee, along with Singapore National Employers Federation deputy honorary secretary Felix Loh. The PWM, first introduced in 2012, sets out minimum salaries for local workers in various roles along a career and skills progression framework.\n\nAs a wage ladder, the PWM provides a clear career progression pathway for workers in the sector. To improve their wages, workers must undergo structured training to upgrade their skills.\n\nThe PWM currently covers the security, cleaning and landscaping industries.\n\nThe Government accepted the recommendations by a similar committee for the lift and escalator industry in 2018, and its PWM will take effect from next year.\n\nMr Zaqy did not give an estimate for when the PWM will be implemented for the waste management sector, noting that it would depend on how quickly players in the sector can come to a consensus.\n\n\"The key thing is you want to increase the salaries, productivity and so on, but you also don't want to create an unemployment effect, where you do it wrongly and create an unintended consequence.

He paid $58 for a win.\n\n\"When he won over 1,600m, I told Chopsy he can go longer. He has got big strides,\" said Shafrizal.\n\n\"He was hanging in once I passed the other horses, but that's what he always does.\n\n\"I couldn't ride a winner last week, but I'll take this as my birthday present!\"\n\nWhite praised Shafrizal for his handling of the horse.\n\n\"Shafrizal rides great. He's been riding terrific without winning many races,\" he said.\n\n\"It's good for him as he rides a lot better than what his record suggests. It's just circumstances or whatever reasons that have worked against him. Today's win was no fluke.\"\n\nRoyal Pavilion has earned nearly $170,000 from five wins and six placings.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nBoost Your Job Hunt With AI In SG's Competitive Job Market\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b457347748a15251cd9570c817a73c36f66ae3bbf5a5f1f37f5c8f4218862014/np_20210127_shafrizal26_62837612.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jockey Shafrizal Saleh is all smiles aboard $58 winner Royal Pavilion on Saturday.

I thought it was a very swift exit on the back of a positive result at the weekend.\n\n\"I did think it was an opportunity for Chelsea to really reach out and support him during this tough period, rather than do what they have done.\n\n\"But Chelsea have got history for that, so it was no surprise.\"\n\nLampard, who had just led the Blues to a 3-1 win over Championship side Luton Town in the FA Cup fourth round last Sunday, had been undone following a poor run in the English Premier League that had seen Chelsea lose five of their last eight matches and slip to ninth in the table.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe British media reported that the writing was on the wall for Lampard, as his relationship with Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia had deteriorated.\n\nThe Athletic reported that there were clashes over certain decisions.\n\nFor instance, he had wanted to offload defender Antonio Ruediger, who was highly regarded by the Chelsea hierarchy. He also wanted to sign West Ham United's Declan Rice, who was released from the Blues academy as a teenager.\n\nThere were also question marks over whether it was the board or Lampard who wanted Timo Werner and Kai Havertz - the biggest signings of their £220 million (S$399.8m) summer spending spree.\n\nIn a statement, the 42-year-old expressed his disappointment over the sacking, adding: \"I am proud of the achievements that we made, and I am proud of the academy players that have made their step into the first team and performed so well. They are the future of the club.\"\n\nTottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho, whose first two EPL titles at Stamford Bridge came with Lampard playing a starring role, said: \"I'm always sad when a colleague loses his job and of course, Frank is not just a colleague, he's an important person in my career, so of course, I feel sorry.\n\n\"It's the brutality of modern football. When you become a manager, it's something that you have to know.\"\n\nThe bottomline is still about results, said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.\n\nThe Spaniard added: \"People talk about projects and ideas. They don't exist. You have to win or you will be replaced.\n\n\"I am not judging Chelsea's decision. I respect their decision.

It's an ethical issue. Everyone has their own opinion and they are all respectable.\"\n\nOne of those who complained about being in a smaller room is world No. 67 Paula Badosa, the first player to test positive for Covid-19 in quarantine in Melbourne. She said she is being forced to endure \"pitiful\" conditions.\n\nBadosa told Spanish newspaper Marca she felt abandoned in a small hotel room after being diagnosed with the coronavirus.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who was moved to a different hotel after testing positive, said the Melbourne quarantine was one of the worst experiences of her career.\n\n\"I don't have windows in my room that is barely 15 square metres,\" she said.\n\n\"It's obvious that the only thing I breathe in is the virus. I have asked for cleaning products, like a vacuum cleaner, but they haven't given me anything.\"\n\nOfficials said they are having discussions on how to get some equipment safely to Badosa, who has been limited to doing sit-ups in her hotel room and using water bottles as weights to try to stay in shape. - AFP\n\nTennis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 02:25am\n\nChinese tennis player Peng Shuai denies making accusation of sexual assault\n\nFeb 4, 2022, 08:01am\n\nBarca official resigns after calling Spanish tennis star Nadal an 'enemy of the state'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nHe Chose To Embark On A Career Switch In His 60s!\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9f22103641cfc9b86544e27039b0fd837c535041e17d2e03911f4b7c8d5c0036/NP_20210127_NADAL27_6289183.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Rafael Nadal.

P\n\nPHOTO: AF\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nComment\n\nJan 26, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nThomas Tuchel's CV won't prepare him for Chelsea\n\nFormer PSG coach has to learn from mistakes and pander to Blues owner Abramovich's whims\n\nShare this article\n\nFrank Lampard should have been following Thomas Tuchel, not the other way around.\n\nChelsea's new manager previously imparted sage advice that his predecessor failed to heed. Coaching, Tuchel once claimed, is \"something you need to learn... not a thing you do because there's nothing else left or because it seems like the next logical step after 400 professional matches\".\n\nThe Blues legend clearly did not receive that memo or simply ignored it. Tuchel, similarly, will soon discover that everything he thought he knew about football is wrong.\n\nIf he felt being kicked out by Paris Saint-Germain on Christmas Eve while the club sat just a point away from the Ligue 1 summit was harsh, what awaits the German in west London will make that festive ordeal in the French capital seem comparatively tame.\n\nMethodology has increasingly less place within Roman Abramovich's Stamford Bridge empire than it did at the Parc des Princes.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Russian oligarch still governs using the core principles of Newton's Third Law, where every action has an opposing reaction.\n\nRuthlessly discarding a club legend for a continental taskmaster is hardly uncharted territory where the Blues' absentee owner is concerned, as Lampard already knew from first-hand experience when Rafael Benitez succeeded Roberto di Matteo in 2012.\n\nAbramovich's logic is transparent, with Tuchel expected to get a tune out of two flat-noted compatriots in Timo Werner and Kai Havertz, last summer's marquee signings.\n\nTomorrow morning's (Singapore time) visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers will provide a bellwether of how much cajoling his new charges will require during the months ahead.\n\nSome will acclimatise quicker than others, with Thiago Silva and Christian Pulisic already trusted former lieutenants from his time with PSG and Borussia Dortmund respectively.\n\nFor Werner, the prospect of becoming reborn under someone with form in galvanising strikers yet to realise their true potential is evident; Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang saw his goal tally turbo-charged during Tuchel's first season at Signal Iduna Park.\n\nBut, crucially, he is not inheriting a Chelsea team that is in the dying embers of their reign as European champions, as Benitez did from di Matteo some eight seasons earlier.\n\nFans perceived the former Liverpool manager as an unlovable stepfather who had replaced one of their own, and openly voiced their disapproval of his presence in the dugout, despite him steering them to Europa League glory at the end of that campaign.\n\nTuchel's lack of history with a rival counts for little when taking the place of a man whose standing among supporters can still withstand the ignominy of recording their worst points-per-game return of any full-time manager in the Abramovich era.\n\nFollowing in Juergen Klopp's footsteps at Dortmund and Mainz prepared him for weathering a 2½-year storm of impatience at PSG.\n\nStepping into the shoes of a Chelsea icon such as Lampard, however, brings different challenges.\n\nA fiery demeanour also dissuaded last season's FA Cup finalists from hiring him earlier.\n\nThe fact Maurizio Sarri was considered a less incendiary choice to succeed Antonio Conte in 2018 speaks volumes of their latest incumbent's preceding reputation.\n\nParallels between the journeyman coach last spotted at Juventus and Tuchel are striking.\n\nHierarchical conflict pockmarked both Sarri's solitary season at the Bridge and the 47-year-old's ultimate endgame in charge of Les Parisiens.\n\nIf Tuchel wants to leave a genuine mark, he needs to learn from those past mistakes and start pandering to Abramovich's whims. It is his - and Chelsea's - only real chance.\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nHow To Showcase Your Strengths And Land The Perfect Role\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/36dd645e41e89ec28801b052a5dfe2965515f3bc4b2c96069f43df8ee059506f/NP_20210127_RBSOC27_6290121.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Thomas Tuchel (above) must realise that stepping into the shoes of a Chelsea icon like Frank Lampard brings its own challenges.

Tank Road will be closed to traffic from 3pm today. While there will be no foot processions with kavadis - wooden or metal structures with milk offerings - from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road, devotees will be able to carry paal kudams, or milk pots, into the temple in Tank Road.\n\nARRIVAL\n\nDevotees must present a printout or SMS sent to their phones with the booking confirmation to enter the temple.\n\nDevotees may arrive 10 minutes before their time slot for registration.\n\nFootwear can be removed at two sandal removal points close to entrances A and B.\n\nBarricades and signs will be in place to direct visitors to the entry and exit points.\n\nVISIT ROUTE\n\nThere are two separate gates for entry into the temple, with no mingling allowed between the two routes to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nEntrance A: General devotee entry point\n\nGeneral visitors with a pre-booking to arrive for registration at the Tank Road entry point.\n\nAfter registration, they will join three single-file lanes towards the temple entrance.\n\nAfter completing prayers at the sanctum, they are directed to the exit point at Clemenceau Avenue.\n\nThey can collect packed food offerings at the exit point.\n\nEntrance B: Devotees carrying milk pots\n\nDevotees who wish to carry milk pots should arrive for registration at the River Valley Road entry point.\n\nEach devotee carrying a milk pot may be accompanied by one other individual.\n\nAfter registration, devotees will be ushered to four holding zones to prevent overcrowding inside the temple.\n\nPre-prepared milk pots are given out at a designated point before devotees walk a round of the sanctum.\n\nAfter offering milk at a collection point, they are directed to the exit point at Clemenceau Avenue (separate from the general devotees’ exit route).\n\nThey can collect packed food offerings at the exit point.\n\nRESTRICTIONS\n\nStringent measures have been put in place at this year's festival to ensure safety.\n\nVisitors need non-transferable pre-booked time slots to enter the temple on Thaipusam.\n\nKavadis, ceremonial piercings and musical instruments/amplification devices will not be allowed. There will be no shaving of heads at the temple.\n\nVisitors must wear masks at all times and adhere to safe distancing measures.\n\nOnly milk pots prepared by the temple can be used for offerings.\n\nVisitors will not be allowed to gather outside the temple.\n\nnp_20210127_mmfestival27nn_6290257.pdf\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nDiscover Thousands Of Jobs In SG's Aviation Industry\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But that can be adjusted based on the number of booths.\n\nMr Chan added that to avoid wasting vaccines, supply is brought in based on appointments made at a particular venue on a certain day.\n\nFABIAN KOH\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nUNIQLO\n\nTrendy, flattering Baggy Curve Jeans @k.ityee swears by\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8f4fdbb156a2cd5f497e56c8661170e3eecdc4e264dc4e7e349e8ab3fcf1a92b/NP_20210127_FBCHANL9KL_6290116.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The community vaccination centre in Tanjong Pagar Community Club is one of the first two facilities set up for residents aged 70 and above, in the latest phase of the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive.

The club sit ninth in the standings.\n\nUnited are top of the English Premier League but were knocked out of the Champions League in the group stage last month, which had also piled intense pressure on Solskjaer.\n\nThe Norwegian, who took over the Old Trafford hot seat in December 2018, explained their long-term plan accounted for some poor spells.\n\n\"We know we would have some tough periods... We have been through two or three spells of bad form but they stood strong,\" said Solskjaer ahead of tomorrow morning's (Singapore time) home game against Sheffield United. \"We looked at the squad and the situation we were in. We had a longer-term plan in place. We knew there were going to be some patchy periods and we had to stay strong mentally.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"The leadership they have shown has been strong and steady, I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nSolskjaer added that striker Marcus Rashford trained yesterday and is available for selection after tweaking his knee.\n\nThe Norwegian also heaped praise on 33-year-old Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani, who led the line impressively in Sunday's 3-2 FA Cup win over Liverpool.\n\n\"When a striker of that age runs almost 12 kilometres... he chases down the centre-back every time their 'keeper has the ball, he tackles the centre midfielders, he makes a mistake and then gets back in his own 18-yard box,\" Solskjaer said of Cavani.\n\n\"His reaction, his work rate, his habits, his humility... We can go on and on. His experience and attitude has been a lesson for every single one of us.\"\n\nWhile the FA Cup win over Liverpool has brought much cheer to the Red Devils' camp,  Solskjaer wants his charges to keep their feet on the ground.\n\nHe said: \"We're not getting carried away. We know we have to get consistency, results, performances. The two teams that have been top of the league for the last three years have been amazing.\n\n\"Absolutely incredible consistency and in many other seasons, you would have won the league with 15, almost 20, points (fewer) than the two of them.\n\n\"We know that this is the start of something, we just have to be competitive and keep improving. No, we're not going to get  carried away, but just keep on working as we do.\"\n\nUnited will be confident of extending a 13-game unbeaten run in the league that has taken them to the top of the table against the Blades, who have won only once in the top flight this season.\n\nSolskjaer is wary of his side slipping back into bad habits as they have done previously after good runs during his tenure.\n\nHe said: \"Now I want to see the reaction, how we can now mentally go again, against Sheffield United.

The financial year at most clubs ends on June 30, meaning some prize money and broadcast income for domestic leagues and European competitions that completed beyond that date is not included in last season's figures.\n\nBARCA LEAD THE WAY\n\nSpanish giants Barcelona maintained their position at the top of the revenue table, despite their income falling 15 per cent to 715.1m euros (S$1.15b).\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nHowever, the La Liga side are still mired in an economic crisis due to spiralling debts of 1.2b euros, according to accounts released by the club on Monday.\n\nReal Madrid remain second, just 200,000 euros behind Barca's revenue.\n\nIn fourth, United are still the highest-ranking English side among seven Premier League clubs - Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Everton being the others - in the top 20.\n\nZenit Saint-Petersburg are the only club outside the top five leagues on this list and are also one of only two teams, including Everton, to see revenue growth this past year. - AFP\n\nDELOITTE FOOTBALL MONEY LEAGUE TABLE (TOP 10):\n\n1: Barcelona (715.1m euros), 2: Real Madrid (714.9m), 3: Bayern Munich (634.1m), 4: Manchester United (580.4m), 5: Liverpool (558.6m), 6: Manchester City (549.2m), 7: Paris Saint-Germain (540.6m), 8: Chelsea (469.7m), 9: Tottenham Hotspur (445.7m), 10: Juventus (397.9m).\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The last two of 11 operational patrol vessels were decommissioned last month.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 27, 2022, 10:46am\n\nThis is no smiley faced robot, but it should make you smile\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe four MSRVs and two tugboats will operate alongside the RSN's littoral mission vessels and unmanned surface vessels to protect Singapore's territorial waters and respond to maritime incidents.\n\nYesterday, Chief of Navy, Rear-Admiral Aaron Beng, officiated at the flotilla's inauguration ceremony, which was held at RSS Singapura-Changi Naval Base.\n\nFlotilla commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Lee Jun Meng, said the flotilla will strengthen Singapore's ability to deal with maritime security threats that have grown in scale and complexity through the years. Mindef said such threats include incidents of sea robbery and intrusions into Singapore's territorial waters.\n\n\"The additional capabilities will provide us with more flexibility and a wider range of responses, and allow us to be deployed for greater persistence to safeguard and protect Singapore's territorial waters,\" said LTC Lee.\n\nThe four Sentinel-class MSRVs were refitted to expand their operational lifespan, as well as equipped with a range of \"calibrated capabilities\", including for enhanced communications, improved visual and audio warning systems, a fender system and modular ballistics protection.\n\nIn line with other international maritime security agencies, the new flotilla's vessels will bear red \"racing\" stripes on their bow, said Mindef.

Indeed, the best Augustano could show were two fourth-placed finishes.\n\nOne of those runs was at his last start and it was indicative of a horse that's ready to run a good race.\n\nAugustano has been slotted for the $70,000 Class 3 sprint over 1,400m on Saturday. He was put through his paces on the training track yesterday morning and impressed, running the 600m in 39.3sec.\n\nApprentice Rosman Iskandar was the man in the saddle and, if he gets the ride on Saturday, his 3kg claim could offset the 58kg which Augustano has been asked to shoulder.\n\nFrom Lee Freedman's yard, Augustano has won close to half a million dollars for his owners, the King Power Stable.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThat said, the last time he saluted the judge was way back in August of 2019.\n\nThe good news is, he seems to be on a comeback trail and, while the task on Saturday does look formidable, you can bet on Freedman having him turned out looking like a million bucks.\n\nWhile the Class 3 sprint is the ''main'' race, so to speak, the real excitement should surface in the Class 4 flyer over the 1,200m on the Poly.\n\nSome promising youngsters will line up to do battle. Among them, we have four last-start winners.\n\nThey are The Archer, What You Like, Overcoming and Lim's Bestbreaker. Unfortunately for racing fans who savour a good battle, three of them are currently ''reserves'' in this capacity field.\n\nHowever, that didn't stop first reserve Lim's Bestbreaker for turning up on the training track where, with CC Wong astride, he ran the 37.6sec.\n\nThe others in Saturday's field who turned up for training were My Big Boss, Legend Of The Sun and the very exciting Gentlemen Excellent.\n\nBack to Lim's Bestbreaker, he has turned out to be quite a money-spinner for the Lim's Stable and he has put together two wins and two runner-up shows from just eight starts.\n\nAt his last start on Jan 16, he won a Class 4 race and, although the winning margin was less than a length, it was dominant.\n\nSlow to begin, he was still second last with 200m to travel. But he unleashed a terrific finish which left his rivals stranded in no-man's land.\n\nThat was on the Polytrack, as was his other win in November. Here is a horse with a future.\n\nThe same could be said for Gentlemen Excellent. With Matthew Kellady in the saddle, he worked like a winner, clocking 37.2sec for the 600m.\n\nBeaten convincingly by Knight Love on debut, Gentlemen Excellent had excuses. He received a check early in the race and later was crowded in traffic.\n\nStill, he came home well to take the purse for second. A winning show should come sooner rather than later.\n\nMy Big Boss and Legend Of The Sun, who also worked yesterday, clocked 39.4sec and 34sec respectively.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Reilly are pathetic astronauts in training in Moonbase 8.\n\nPHOTO: FX\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 26, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: Moonbase 8\n\nShare this article\n\nBeing trapped with other people has been the basis of many a sitcom - and long before the pandemic made the world miss human contact.\n\nMoonbase 8 is the latest astronaut-based series, a number of which have popped up recently.\n\nLast year, Steve Carell missed the mark with his big-budget take on an ineptitude-laced race to the moon in Space Force.\n\nNow it is the turn of Fred Armisen, John C. Reilly and Tim Heidecker.\n\nIf you recognise the names, then you know the type of comedy to expect. Awkward, wittering and often overlong improvisation.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 24, 2022, 10:00pm\n\nStar-studded period drama Pachinko follows a Korean family in Japan\n\nMore related stories\n\nSeparately, each of these comedians have provided plenty of laughs. But here, it is a very dry affair - drier than Moonbase 8's desert location.\n\nCap (Reilly), Skip (Armisen) and Rook (Heidecker) are wannabe astronauts, stuck in an Arizona training facility, failing to prove they are worthy of a moonshot.\n\nThey have been there for months yet it turns out, after they are briefly joined by a much more efficient female astronaut, the test can be completed in a matter of days.\n\nThe trio are happier to avoid the troubles of the real world and be kept in tinned bagels.\n\nAs a recurring sketch on something like Armisen's Portlandia, these three could be endearing. Stretching it to 30 minutes means too much needs to be filled.\n\nIt lacks pace, purpose and, crucially for a comedy, regular laughs. There are occasional funny moments. The attempt at \"de-peed\" water is delivered well and so is their complete failure to recall what Nasa stands for.\n\nOf all the possibilities offered- including \"Isn't it just a word? Nasa?\"- the space agency should really consider changing to Nautical Astronomy Society of Adventure.\n\nBut as a whole, Moonbase 8 is adrift as if it were floating in space.\n\nIt is not a difficult watch, but the gentleness does take it into visual wallpaper territory.\n\nWithout a clear goal driving the narrative, you have to want to spend time with these characters, but they are not fully defined and their personas neither advance nor devolve.\n\nWith the talent involved, a second series will have to aim for the moon.\n\nMOONBASE 8\n\nTuesdays at 10pm on FX (StarHub TV Ch 507/Singtel TV Ch 310)\n\nBy\n\nJonathan Roberts\n\nRead articles by Jonathan Roberts\n\nTV\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 14, 2022, 02:24am\n\nLocal actor Mark Lee's secrets to a strong marriage\n\nDec 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: The Wheel Of Time\n\nDec 2, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: Arcane\n\nDec 2, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: Hawkeye\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It is clear that word of mouth has been good and with justification.\n\nYEAR'S BEST\n\nThe first episode alone is brilliant and pulls some incredibly deft sleight of hand.\n\nIf it was a film, it would be a contender for the year's best - it is that good an experience.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 24, 2022, 10:00pm\n\nStar-studded period drama Pachinko follows a Korean family in Japan\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe series combines Ocean's Eleven, a Christopher Nolan level of reveal, The Thomas Crown Affair and a sniff of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nOmar Sy is Assane Diop, who convinces some thugs he owes money to to get in on his plan to steal Marie Antoinette's necklace from the Louvre.\n\nAssane's great influence in life is Arsene Lupin, the 1905 book by Maurice Leblanc about the titular fictional gentleman thief, given to him by his father who was taken from the young Assane for a crime he did not commit.\n\nFor Assane, his skills are only ever used against those who deserve being taken down a peg or ten.\n\nOutwardly, Sy is an extraordinary choice for a master thief, towering over his co-stars and with shoulders so broad he must have had to navigate most doors sideways.\n\nA gentle giant, and like his hero, wearing a genial nature as a mask.\n\nBut then, the show does play with presumptions - ours and other characters' - over Assane's appearance. He is an immigrant from Senegal which means he faces bias, which he uses to his advantage.\n\nDirector Louis Leterrier (The Transporter films, The Incredible Hulk, Clash Of The Titans, Now You See Me) gives the first episode a cinematic feel, while writers George Kay and Francois Uzan hand him the smartest material he has had to work with.\n\nCriminally, the first season has been split and the remaining five episodes cannot arrive soon enough.\n\nSERIES:\n\nLupin\n\nSTARRING:\n\nOmar Sy, Ludivine Sagnier, Vincent Londez\n\nTHE SKINNY:\n\nProfessional thief Assane Diop (Sy) owes a lot of money to low life Paris gangsters. To pay them back, he ropes them into a daring heist to steal a necklace - once the property of Marie Antoinette - from an auction at the Louvre.\n\nSHOWING:\n\nNetflix\n\nRATING:\n\nNC16\n\nBy\n\nJonathan Roberts\n\nRead articles by Jonathan Roberts\n\nTV\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 14, 2022, 02:24am\n\nLocal actor Mark Lee's secrets to a strong marriage\n\nDec 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: The Wheel Of Time\n\nDec 2, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: Arcane\n\nDec 2, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: Hawkeye\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Liverpool's other centre-back Rhys Williams (right) also had a tough outing at Old Trafford.\n\nPHOTO: AFP\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nComment\n\nJan 25, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNeil Humphreys: Reality check for Klopp's Reds\n\nFA Cup defeat by United offers worrying signs for once-dominant Liverpool\n\nShare this article\n\nEmpires are not supposed to end before they have barely begun. But the Liverpool era threatens to be remembered for its brevity.\n\nManchester United, once the dominant force for almost 20 years, may be poised to leave behind the dominant force of the last two years.\n\nAnd already, just three paragraphs in, seething Reds will be ready to dismiss such a claim as the sensationalist musings of a headline seeker.\n\nBut there was no pleasure in watching Liverpool's FA Cup defeat at Old Trafford yesterday morning (Singapore time).\n\nThe 3-2 scoreline didn't particularly matter. The tournament was of little consequence.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut the options available to both managers - and the reasons - hint at a changing of the guard.\n\nA single mistake from poor Rhys Williams felt like a trailer for what's to come.\n\nHe should not have been playing. At 19, he's obviously one for the future. But, in the present, the gangly centre-back was left stranded and exposed as Marcus Rashford and Luke Shaw ran him over.\n\nWilliams will get better, but not quickly enough to save this season. And that's not his fault. The shoulders of a skinny teenager with only one English Premier League start cannot be expected to prop up a fledgling dynasty.\n\nThat responsibility lies with Liverpool's owners, coaching staff and senior players, who are all culpable to a degree, fairly or otherwise.\n\nLet's start with the senior players. The odds of Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip and Joe Gomez all picking up injuries at the same time were slim but not entirely unexpected.\n\nLiverpool toiled through 2½ years of relentless pressing, at home and abroad, in their peerless quest for domestic, European and global superiority. It was a sight to behold.\n\nBut the pandemic disrupted pre-season preparations and increased the risk of muscle injuries and late, clumsy tackles for everyone. And yet, Liverpool's owners erred on the side of caution.\n\nUNDERSTANDABLE PRUDENCE\n\nA sensible, long-term transfer policy had previously worked brilliantly, so the club's prudence was understandable in an economic downturn.\n\nBut it's becoming painfully apparent that Liverpool cannot have it both ways, as the FA Cup defeat demonstrated. In balancing the books, the Reds have an unbalanced defence (a problem that has persisted for months).\n\nAs always, the idiotic \"Klopp out\" hashtags trending on social media miss the point entirely. Juergen Klopp has arguably performed a miracle of sorts in keeping Liverpool within touching distance.\n\nThe Reds have managed just one win in their last seven games - against Aston Villa's youth players in the FA Cup, no less - but they have no senior centre-backs available. None.\n\nA casual drift is now a malaise, tiptoeing towards an internal crisis.\n\nIs that too melodramatic? When United usurp Liverpool in English football, it's a crisis around Anfield. Few would pretend otherwise.\n\nFiscal pragmatism and successful teams are uneasy bedfellows, especially when another club, the only club that really matters to the Reds, are moving on.\n\nAnd if the prospect of United overtaking Liverpool feels unpalatable on Merseyside, it's not exactly welcomed in the neutral corners of the game either.\n\nA sport being played behind closed doors in a bid to convince us that any of this still matters needs its biggest brands competing, now more than ever.\n\nObviously, the pressure on the Reds to maintain their lofty standards is unprecedented, being the first EPL club to mount a title defence during a global crisis.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola had to deal with each other during their imperial phase. Only Klopp has to deal with Covid-19 during his. Perspective should never be lost.\n\nBut, as long as the season continues, the Reds could cheer us up a bit by signing a centre-back and having a real crack at the whole dynasty thing.\n\nLiverpool needed 30 years to knock United off their perch. It would be a real shame if the Red Devils returned the favour in a fraction of the time.\n\nThe Klopp era deserves something more than a premature decline.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Mohamed Salah bagged a brace for the Reds, with Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford scoring United's other goals.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nKeown wrote in his Daily Mail column: \"Cantona unlocked the door for Manchester United's success in his five seasons at the club. He and Bruno Fernandes are clearly different types of player, but Fernandes is having that Cantona effect.\n\n\"Teammates are following his lead. Every time Fernandes gets the ball, he tries to make something happen. That's his mentality.\n\n\"His winner on Sunday will give United great belief... United must now take that belief and use it in the Premier League title race.\"\n\nThe Red Devils sit top of the EPL table, two points clear of local rivals Manchester City, who have a game in hand.\n\nFormer Tottenham Hotspur and England midfielder Jermaine Jenas said on the BBC: \"Bruno Fernandes has dragged Manchester United to the top of the league single-handedly.\"\n\nAccording to ex-Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright, he did the same in the FA Cup, after coming on for Donny van de Beek in the 66th minute.\n\nHe said on the BBC: \"United went to their bench and brought Fernandes on, you have heard that he only scores penalties or he doesn't do it in big games but he made the difference. He was the difference today, Liverpool's subs made no impact.\"\n\nHaving known he would start the match on the bench, United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said the Portuguese spent 45 minutes after their last training session practising set-pieces.\n\nHe said: \"He's never happy with me when I tell him to go inside after training. But he knew he wasn't starting so he stayed out practising for 45 minutes yesterday and it worked.

Radakrishnan's conduct while mitigating for his client.\n\nHe said that several of Mr Radakrishnan's comments had perturbed him by alluding to the victim's \"supposed promiscuity and ill repute, and being the initiator of intimacy\".\n\n\"Cumulatively, Mr Radakrishnan's submissions constituted a blatant and unapologetic attempt to foist responsibility and blame on the victim,\" said Justice Aedit.\n\n\"Her character was flagrantly tarred, and I struggled to see what purpose such character assassination served.\"\n\nThe offender, now 25, met the victim in 2017 when she was in Secondary 2. They later engaged in sex acts in his home and hostel, once after watching the R21 movie Fifty Shades Of Grey.\n\nHe later became a relief teacher in her school, and the offences came to light after she told her form teacher about what he had done.\n\nThe man pleaded guilty at the State Courts last year to three charges of sexual penetration of a minor under 14. Eight similar charges were taken into consideration.\n\nYesterday, Justice Aedit highlighted part of Mr Radakrishnan's oral submissions that mentioned the victim's character and family background.\n\nHe also showcased photographs of the victim in what seemed to be an attempt to show her sexual maturity.\n\nThe judge said: \"On Mr Radakrishnan's accounts, it sounded as though it was the victim who had been sexually predatory and led the accused astray.\n\n\"I am appalled: The accused was the adult in the situation.\"\n\nExpressing his hope that no submissions of this nature will be seen in the courts in the future, Justice Aedit said: \"Where such submissions are made, it may be appropriate for the court to impose an uplift to any sentence imposed to reflect a clear absence of remorse in attacking the victim in a scurrilous way.\"\n\nMr Anand George, who replaced Mr Radakrishnan in the appeal hearing, argued that his client had demonstrated a strong propensity for reform.\n\nBut Justice Aedit said he found it difficult to agree that the offender's remorse was genuine for several reasons, including initially lying and denying the allegations when confronted by his head of department and the school principal.\n\nOn his decision to increase the sentence, he also cited several reasons, including the district judge failing to give enough weight to the victim's impact statement, in which the victim spoke of having flashbacks and fears of being alone.\n\nAn NTU spokesman yesterday said the man is no longer attending classes there.\n\nHe added: \"NTU takes a serious view of all criminal offences.\n\n\"Following the conclusion of court proceedings, the university will undertake internal disciplinary proceedings in accordance with our policies and processes. The conferment of the individual's degree has been withheld in the meantime.\"\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nCombat Siege\n\nYou will never turn off your computer again if you have a mouse\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2ce47e79b217b7ee4d4fd4b7fdec71c16d85dc11438c8d6739c18b8a0292290e/gavel-1238036-1278x855_revjun212022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

We did that, we scored twice... but in the end, they scored three, we scored two and they are through.\"\n\nSalah drew first blood for the visitors in the 18th minute, but Mason Greenwood levelled just eight minutes later.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nMarcus Rashford then gave the hosts the lead three minutes into the second half before Salah got his double in the 58th minute.\n\nRashford's goal showed why Klopp has been reluctant to rely on his young centre-backs. In the absence of injured seniors Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip and Joe Gomez, 19-year-old Rhys Williams partnered Fabinho in central defence at Old Trafford.\n\nWilliams failed to cut out Greenwood's through-ball for Rashford, who composed himself before slotting past the advancing Alisson.\n\nLooking ahead, Klopp said they would need to work on the training ground to prepare for Friday morning's trip to Tottenham Hotspur, who also rely heavily on counter-attacking.\n\nThe Reds would slip out of the EPL's top four if they were to lose again, but Klopp insisted that they are not running low on confidence.\n\n\"Tonight, I didn't see any confidence problems. We are on it, believe me, and we will sort that,\" he said. - REUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3f9bb58ac8f382a0927ab6ea7a7f9931023c64beed9d099301337bd051098098/np_20210126_pool26_6287341.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Juergen Klopp. ", "caption": "Juergen Klopp. PHOTO: REUTERS"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0c362fe16adf0f5aaaafa145ccfc3732c94b985dd515af01d7a50d5e9fcaf1e/dgsoc1199cf82a1Attachment103018.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Kopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d20943ec72fed817276fbd34af6c663fcb8cb3d9b2570bce9028fb60200ffec/tnp-photo.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Ben Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

People who have been infected are protected against only that type, and not the other three, which means they remain susceptible.\n\nOver the three decades prior to last year, all dengue outbreaks here were caused by either DenV-1 or, since 2016, by DenV-2. As neither DenV-3 nor DenV-4 has infected large numbers of people in the past, the vast majority of the population would be susceptible.\n\nThe rise of DenV-3 last year likely contributed to the largest dengue outbreak Singapore has ever seen, with a total of 35,315 people infected and at least 29 people dying from the disease.\n\nThe previous high was 22,170 infections in 2013. The most number of deaths was 25, in 2005.\n\nThe NEA said: \"If left unchecked, the current high Aedes aegypti mosquito population, coupled with the not insignificant number of dengue cases currently and the sizeable proportion of residents still working from home, would add to the dengue risk this year.\"\n\nCalling for greater vigilance against the mosquito-borne disease, the NEA said: \"The population immunity for DenV-3 and DenV-4 is low, and more people are susceptible to transmission of the virus.\n\n\"This could result in a continued high risk of dengue transmission given the current moderate number of dengue cases and the relatively high Aedes aegypti mosquito population.\"\n\nDenV-3 was found in the cluster of 19 cases at the intersection of Upper Aljunied Road and MacPherson Road, which includes Jalan Muhibbah and Jalan Mulia.\n\nDenV-4 was found in the Bedok North Street 3 cluster of 46 cases as well as the Gangsa Road cluster involving 21 cases.\n\nThese three clusters are among the top five dengue clusters today. The biggest of the 27 current clusters is in Tampines Place, involving 157 cases.\n\nLast year, the NEA carried out about one million inspections for mosquito breeding and found 23,400 breeding habitats.\n\nIt promises to \"adopt a high tempo of preventive inspections to remove mosquito breeding habitats, and further reduce the risk of dengue transmission\".\n\nSALMA KHALIK, SENIOR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Poh continued with her abusive ways and the police were again alerted after the Myanmar national told her brother about her ordeal on March 8, 2019.\n\nPoh, now 67, had earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of causing hurt to Ms Munawaroh and an assault charge involving Ms Moe Moe San.\n\nFour other charges involving both maids will be considered during sentencing.\n\nYesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kwang Jia Min urged the court to sentence Poh to at least six weeks' jail.\n\nShe added: \"Given that both victims suffered injury as a result of the offences, the prosecution submits that $500 is an appropriate amount for compensation for pain and suffering for each of the victim.\"\n\nThe DPP also pressed for more than $2,000 compensation for each woman over their loss of income.\n\nThe court heard Ms Munawaroh started working for Poh on June 2, 2018. Poh pinched her on the right upper arm just 13 days later for \"failing to perform her duties properly\".\n\nPoh was unhappy with the maid's \"work attitude\" on July 8, 2018, and pinched her on the right wrist. The maid left Poh's home two weeks later and lodged a police report.\n\nMs Moe Moe San started working for Poh on March 1, 2019.\n\nThe DPP said: \"(A week later), the accused was angry at Moe for not knowing how to switch on and off the gas stove despite the accused teaching her how to do so multiple times.\n\nImmediately after this gas stove incident, Moe was washing clothes in the toilet near the kitchen when the accused entered the toilet and got angry at the way Moe was washing the clothes.\"\n\nPoh hit the maid on the left upper arm and brushed her aside. Ms Moe Moe San, who suffered a bruise as a result, phoned her brother to tell him what happened and the police were alerted.

CHEONG\n\nTNP PHOTO: MARK\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 25, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSingapore aims to grow manufacturing sector by 50% over next decade\n\nBroader goal is to raise global competitiveness of sector and create higher-skilled jobs for locals\n\nShare this article\n\nSingapore aims to grow its manufacturing sector by 50 per cent over the next decade, while it works to ensure the sector maintains its contribution of about 20 per cent to the country's gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nBut it is not just about the numbers, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing yesterday as he shared his medium-term vision for the sector after a visit to local precision engineering firm Univac.\n\nThe broader goal, he said, is to raise the global competitiveness of Singapore's manufacturing sector and create higher-skilled jobs for locals by focusing on developing \"unique capabilities and products that cannot be found elsewhere\".\n\nThe manufacturing sector contributes about 21 per cent, or around $106 billion, of Singapore's total GDP, hiring about 450,000 workers, or around 12 per cent of the workforce.\n\nLast year, the sector expanded for six consecutive months from July to December, and experts have said it will continue to be a key driver of Singapore's economic growth this year.\n\nYesterday, Mr Chan said the Covid-19 pandemic underscored the importance of the sector, which helped to bolster the overall economy last year.\n\nHe also noted how during the height of the pandemic, \"securing essential supplies sometimes became a barter trade\" and may continue to be so as global supply chains continue to be disrupted.\n\n\"Whether people choose to sell to us often depends on whether we have things others value and wish to obtain. This goes beyond the issue of whether people are willing to pay the price for it,\" he added.\n\nMr Chan said the 2030 goal will require the sector to grow by around 50 per cent in the next decade - the same pace of growth as the last 10 years.\n\nIt is an ambitious target considering it will become harder to use foreign labour to supplement the Singaporean workforce, he said, adding that the sector's workforce will continue to make up around 12 per cent to 15 per cent of the total Singapore workforce, but with higher-skilled roles.\n\nFor the sector to achieve the 2030 goal, it will have to develop its competitiveness through its ability to innovate quickly and produce higher-value products, he said.\n\nTo do that, the Government has outlined a three-pronged strategy.\n\nFirst, it will continue to attract the best global and local companies in niche areas that will help Singapore remain a critical node in global value chains.\n\nSecond, Singapore will ramp up its efforts to grow the size and capabilities of local enterprises in advanced manufacturing to create better job opportunities for Singaporeans through tailored programmes and global networks.\n\nThird, the Government will work with polytechnics and universities to make engineering and manufacturing attractive to students.\n\nCHARMAINE NG\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He supported me from the moment I got here.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"He's a terrific owner, very generous and a very caring guy. You don't meet many like him.\n\n\"Our families became good friends.\n\n\"We often had dinners together, and my son Harvey told me one day that Mr Yong has always done the right thing by us, and he was right.\"\n\nYong, the chairman of local construction company Woh Hup and a former Singapore Turf Club committee member, was an avid racing fan who raced one of Singapore's oldest stables with its easily recognisable gold-and-red diamond silks.\n\nHe also raced and bred horses in England. He once owned Woodditton Stud in Newmarket, the headquarters of racing in England.\n\nIn its website, Woodditton said Yong bought the property in 1981 and enlarged it to 185 acres (74.8 hectares).\n\nSeveral champion stallions stood there, including Superlative, Sayf el Arab, Damister, Celtic Swing and Bin Ajwaad.\n\nIt added that, after Yong decided to relinquish his racing interests, the stud was purchased by Darley Stud Management in November 2001 on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed, the current ruler of Dubai.\n\nThe New Paper Racing editor Tan Thean Loon remembers visiting the sprawling stud farm in 1988, when he was on a trip to Newmarket.\n\n\"I met Mr Yong and his wife as I was walking in Newmarket's town and he invited me to his Woodditton stud.\n\n\"He showed me a few stallions and I am quite sure Superlative was one of them.\n\n\"Mr Yong was a down-to-earth man who enjoyed his racing. May his soul rest in peace.\"\n\nBefore Brown, Yong's horses were stabled with trainers like 13-time Malayan Racing Association champion Teh Choon Beng, Arnaud de Moussac, Dr Yeoh Kheng Chye and his brother Sonny.\n\nYong's Gold Strike, trained by Brown, came close to winning the $1 million Group 1 Singapore Gold Cup in 2019. He flashed home to beat all but Mr Clint by 3/4 lengths.\n\nKranji racegoers will remember the days when Yong would grace the club despite his advanced age, helped along by his son Eugene.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Around 160 units will be launched in next month's Build-to-Order sales exercise and they are expected to be completed in 2024.\n\nThe optional shared caregiving service will cost around $950 a month before subsidies, and around $1,950 a month if the seniors require feeding services.\n\nOther add-on services that are applicable for subsidies include social day care, meal services, home personal care, and medical escort and transport.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 7, 2024, 05:10am\n\nHow a woman holds on to her promise - and a $70m plot of land\n\nMore related stories\n\nThese services come on top of a mandatory basic service package that all residents must subscribe to and pay for in cash fully or partially upfront with the monthly fee throughout the lease term.\n\nPrices for the package range from $22,000 for a 15-year lease to $59,000 for a 35-year lease. It includes services such as 24-hour emergency monitoring and response service, basic health checks, simple home fixes and activities at the communal spaces within the development.\n\nMr Masagos, who is also Second Minister for Health, said: \"Some seniors may need a little more help with assistance with activities of daily living but may not want a maid to be living with them. We want them to have support within the community where help can be provided on a daily basis if needed.\"\n\nSeniors will be able to choose a lease ranging from 15 to 35 years, in five-year increments, as long as it covers the applicant and their spouse, if any, until they are at least 95 years old.\n\nPrices for these flats start from $40,000 for a 15-year lease to $65,000 for a 35-year lease, and must be paid for fully up front with cash or with Central Provident Fund (CPF) monies.\n\nGovernment subsidies such as the Silver Housing Bonus, which gives seniors up to $30,000 cash bonus when they sell their existing flat and use the proceeds to top up their CPF Retirement Account, are applicable.\n\nHowever, these flats cannot be resold or rented out.

For instance, some have predicted that digitalisation will precipitate a move towards decentralised living arrangements, rendering cities obsolete.\n\nBut history contains multiple examples of cities that bounced back after pandemics, he noted. For example, cities such as Chicago and New York saw a boom in the 1920s, after the 1918 flu pandemic ravaged the US.\n\n\"And the reason this happens is that cities are not just buildings and monuments. They are fundamentally about the people who dwell in them, and humans are, by nature, social animals.\"\n\nHumans are also adaptable and therefore have the ability to shape their future, he added.\n\n\"Let's think of the crisis as setting the stage for a software update - a reboot of sorts after the tremendous damage inflicted by the virus.\"\n\nLINETTE LAI, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c726c2e34e5a15c0ebe9426530c805d379272953e8217b5446d5b8d055cf08e6/NP_20210126_LLLAWRENCE26B_6287492.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Education Minister Lawrence Wong speaking at a dialogue chaired by The Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez as part of the Institute of Policy Studies' Singapore Perspectives conference yesterday.

But this season, he paid the price after splurging over £200 million (S$363.4m) during the summer transfer window.\n\n\"This was a very difficult decision for the club, not least because I have an excellent personal relationship with Frank and I have the utmost respect for him,\" Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich said in a statement.\n\n\"He is a man of great integrity and has the highest of work ethics.

Patience being a virtue is seldom recognised in this sport. They never learn.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool striker Michael Owen agreed the new signings will need time to gel.\n\nHe said: \"Madness. I'm convinced there's been plenty of politics going on in the background for some time at Chelsea.

His baby son was born two days after he returned to work.\n\nHis policies have been widely criticised, with Britain's numbers of cases and deaths now the highest in Europe.\n\nCritics say he was too slow to roll out measures such as rules on mask-wearing and virus tests for arriving travellers that other countries imposed much earlier.\n\nThe topical political drama is not the first to focus on Johnson's policies.\n\nIt comes after Britain's Channel 4 in 2019 aired a show called Brexit: The Uncivil War, with Benedict Cumberbatch playing Dominic Cummings, the strategist behind the Vote Leave campaign.\n\nCummings came under strong criticism last year after he refused to apologise for taking a lengthy road trip while ill with Covid-19 during the first national lockdown. - AFP\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\n4\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\n1\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\n4\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\n1\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nInvestor Options Most Don’t Consider\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f79fdf63c3bec5e465427b551640d621ad64dc2212ab9e7cba78d290b4b000db/mgr-15139r-msg_high_res_jpeg-rev-1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Kenneth Branagh in Tenet", "caption": "Kenneth Branagh in Tenet WARNER BROS"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/57205b4d818b58d9a486f0d593b692f5de14d8f9c46d3fbbf7accb62fae7e6fa/btstars20250708.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "National Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/06f5af9d15a7bffb2eeef3285750478e5e20b243c653d0c3e06dae3a7d63d5c1/tccollagestar.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Star Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

'I've kind of walked on the darker side of the universe a lot in my career - maybe it's time to not do that again',\" added Leto, who won an Oscar playing a trans woman with HIV in Dallas Buyers Club.\n\n\"But after seeing the opportunity here I just couldn't say no.\"\n\nDespite the throwback setting - carefully crafted with shots of Los Angeles landmarks that have avoided redevelopment over the decades - the stars said the film's flawed heroes offered a surprisingly modern cautionary tale for the pandemic era.\n\n\"Where obsession starts to overtake so many other aspects of your life... this year probably has taught us a lot about that,\" said Malek.\n\n\"We get so focused on certain things and (are) so narrow-minded, a certain tunnel vision about what has to be achieved in life... we perhaps start to neglect the most important things.\"\n\nFor Leto, a sense of always \"running on the treadmill\" in pursuit of career success with \"no time to focus\" had kicked in even before coronavirus brought the world to a halt.\n\nHe had famously checked into a silent desert retreat when the pandemic first hit the US, meaning he was oblivious about Covid-19 until comparatively late.\n\n\"When I went away, there were only 150 cases in America, and we had no phones, no eye contact... when I came out there was a state-of-emergency shutdown,\" he recalled.\n\nFor deeply spiritual Washington, the pandemic has evoked the biblical book of Exodus, when God \"sent the plague down and sent every man, woman and child back to their tent\".\n\n\"We've all been sent back to our tent,\" he explained, before offering a somber warning.\n\n\"As we go back outside, if we don't look out and take better care and treat our fellow man and woman as we would want to be treated, we will all be destroyed.\" -

It's good for Mo Salah, good for the confidence. It was a tough game,\" manager Juergen Klopp said.\n\nLiverpool's fabled forward line has been misfiring and had failed to score in four of their last five games, including last week's shock home defeat by Burnley in the EPL.\n\nBut it clicked back into gear at Old Trafford and they went ahead in the 18th minute in tried and tested fashion - Roberto Firmino slicing open United's defence with a superb pass to Salah who dinked a cool finish over Dean Henderson.\n\nUnited took only eight minutes to respond, though. Paul Pogba won a tackle on the edge of his own box, Rashford then advanced before delivering a \"quarterback style\" pass that Liverpool's James Milner failed to cut out.\n\nThe ball arrived at Greenwood who took a touch before burying his shot past Alisson.\n\nAnother Rashford raid just before the break ended in Pogba flashing a shot just wide when he should have hit the target.\n\nUnited were ahead shortly after the restart when Greenwood slid in Rashford who guided his shot past Alisson.\n\nBack came Liverpool with Milner wasting a glorious chance to score before, a minute later, Edinson Cavani sloppily gave away possession in a dangerous area and Firmino's ball in was dummied by Milner with Salah snaffling the chance.\n\nBoth sides hunted the winner but, when Cavani was fouled on the edge of the area, Fernandes meted out punishment, meaning Klopp has now reached the fifth round of the Cup only once in six attempts with Liverpool. -\n\nREUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

When she was told she had mistakenly called the police, she nervously insisted that she wanted to order a pizza.\n\nThat was when emergency communications officer (ECO) Mohamad Suhaimi Ami realised the woman was in distress and needed help, but she was unable to speak freely over the phone.\n\nThe officer, who has been with the Police Operations Command Centre (POCC) for about seven years, started asking her questions with yes-or-no answers to find out more about her plight.\n\nRecalling the incident, he added: \"Using the topic of ordering food, I got more information, including her address, and the police were dispatched to the location.\"\n\nMore details of the case could not be provided because of operational secrecy, but the police said the case was dealt with.\n\nMr Mohamad Suhaimi said: \"For some calls, you need to pick up on the signs. Some people don't have the opportunity to tell you straight about the problem.\"\n\nECOs at the POCC are trained to identify coded messages from those in distress, and have to clear an internal competency test before they are allowed to handle live 999 calls.\n\nThis is crucial as the POCC handles more than one million 999 calls a year. Last year, it recorded about 1.19 million calls, or more than 3,000 a day.\n\nBut more than 60 per cent were nuisance calls, including those made by wilful children and callers who kept silent after getting through.\n\nOfficially launched in 2015, the POCC is the nerve centre of the Singapore Police Force's operations, working proactively to detect crime, deploy front-line officers, and support responding officers with findings from sense-making.\n\nThe centre has progressively upgraded its capabilities and now houses liaison officers from Home Team agencies such as the Central Narcotics Bureau, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority and the Singapore Civil Defence Force.\n\nThose at the centre are split into three functional groups.\n\nThe Emergency Communications Group consists of ECOs who handle all 999 calls and text-based reports.\n\nThe Incident Watch Group consists of watch officers who assess the information routed from the ECOs and dispatch the appropriate resources to an incident scene. It also maintains oversight of all live incidents, keeping close communication with and supporting front-line resources.\n\nThe third group is the Sense-making Group, comprising officers who form an incident picture through the use of 90,000 police cameras (PolCams) islandwide, social media and other screening systems.\n\nWorking with the information from the ECOs, the Sense-making Group is able to form a situation picture even while the caller is still on the line.\n\nThe Watch Commander at POCC, Superintendent of Police Nini Chow, 51, said sense-making begins the moment a 999 call is received.\n\n\"The POCC is equipped with sense-making capabilities which provide a situation picture to responding front-line resources in advance,\" she said.\n\n\"This allows ground commanders to have a better appreciation of the situation at the incident location so they can deploy resources quickly and effectively manage the incident.\"\n\nPreviously, incidents were handled sequentially instead of concurrently by first deploying officers to the scene. Attempts to make sense of the situation usually happened only after gathering information on site.\n\nBut nuisance calls remain a concern.\n\nMr Mohamad Suhaimi said the volume of such calls is a worry and urged the public to call 999 only in an emergency.\n\n\"I'm afraid that when there's an emergency call coming in, that those in genuine need will be unable to reach us,\" he said.\n\n\"We are here to protect lives. The public needs to know that calling the emergency line should really be only for emergency use.\"\n\nBy\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6e0361860b5aeae7840385aebcae0d74bb8e43dd1ffb28693fe4f073f9d6a89a/NP_20210125_DSCALL25_6284896.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Mohamad Suhaimi Ami said sometimes the caller cannot speak plainly and he must pick up on the signs.

Seniors are particularly vulnerable to complications from Covid-19 and are at a much higher risk of hospitalisation and death if they are infected than younger people.\n\nTanjong Pagar GRC MPs Eric Chua and Joan Pereira, as well as Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Ng Ling Ling, were among the MPs who were out and about meeting residents over the weekend.\n\nHealth Minister Gan Kim Yong said last Friday that seniors in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar will be able to book their appointments for vaccinations at polyclinics from today.\n\nVolunteers from the People's Association and Silver Generation Ambassadors will also conduct house visits and tap existing grassroots events to answer queries and help seniors book appointments if necessary.\n\nTwo vaccination centres at Teck Ghee Community Club and Tanjong Pagar Community Club will be set up by Feb 1, with more to follow as vaccinations are progressively extended to all seniors by mid-February.\n\nLESTER WONG\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Eva.\n\nPHOTO: CLARISS CHIA\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 24, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nPregnancy-associated breast cancer on the rise\n\nPregnancy-associated breast cancer on the rise due to women delaying childbearing, says KKH doctor\n\nShare this article\n\nMadam Evelyn Lo was just 11 weeks pregnant with her first child when she was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer in November 2019.\n\nThe tumour was relatively small, but the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes in her arm, of which six out of 19 were cancerous.\n\nThe 37-year-old assistant redemption manager told The New Paper: \"When I found out I had breast cancer, I was okay with it. But knowing it might affect the baby - that was something I could not accept.\n\n\"It's every mother's nightmare to go through something like this, and if it came down to it, I would definitely choose my baby's life over mine.\"\n\nMadam Lo's condition was managed by an experienced multidisciplinary team from KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), where about 7 per cent of breast cancers in women below the age of 45 are pregnancy-associated.\n\nPregnancy-associated breast cancer is defined as breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy and up to a year after childbirth, and has a occurrence of about one in 3,000 pregnancies.\n\nKKH published an article, Pregnancy-Associated Breast Cancer: A Unique Challenge, last October on its Special Delivery online portal, as awareness and early referral are key towards optimising patient outcomes.\n\nMadam Lo underwent surgery early in her second trimester to remove the lumps behind her breast and the lymph nodes less than a month after she was diagnosed.\n\nShe began chemotherapy when she was three months into her pregnancy and went for radiotherapy at Singapore General Hospital 20 times in a month. She eventually delivered a healthy baby girl who is now eight months old.\n\nShe is in remission but still experiences the occasional numbness in her arm due to the removal of the lymph nodes.\n\nAccording to Dr Tan Qing Ting, a consultant at the KK Breast Department at KKH, there is a rising trend in the number of pregnancy-associated breast cancer cases.\n\nShe told TNP: \"Worldwide, the incidence is expected to rise due to women delaying childbearing. As the risk of cancer increases with age, the risk of pregnancy-associated breast cancer is generally lower for younger women.\n\n\"However, having children at a younger age does not guarantee that breast cancer will not occur during pregnancy.\"\n\nSymptoms of pregnancy-associated breast cancer can mimic pregnancy-related breast changes or mastitis, making it harder to detect.\n\nDr Tan said: \"We recommend awareness and vigilance when new symptoms, such as a persistent breast lump or changes in the breast skin and nipple, appear during pregnancy or breastfeeding. These changes may include persistent skin redness, distortion or recent indrawing of the nipple and abnormal nipple discharge.\n\n\"These should be carefully investigated by a doctor to ensure a malignancy is not missed.\"\n\nTreatment for breast cancer such as chemotherapy can affect ovarian function and may result in reduced fertility, but radiotherapy is not associated with a reduction in fertility.\n\nDr Tan said: \"At KKH, experienced breast care nurses provide guidance, support and assurance throughout the patient journey. Together with the patients' family, friends and other breast cancer survivors, this forms a strong psychosocial support network to help patients overcome the difficulties of cancer treatment.\"\n\nBy\n\nClariss Chia\n\nRead articles by Clariss Chia\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c630578dfe4035024adcaf0f132093890686a5c05e3f4ffaf896919bff5eb588/NP_20210125_CCCANCER25A_6284783.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Madam Evelyn Lo (above, with her husband) was diagnosed with breast cancer while pregnant.

I'm not writing to you about your Ministry of Education's response to a transgender student's claim that the ministry interfered with her hormonal therapy.\n\nI'm writing to you about something way less controversial.\n\nI want you to cancel Chinese New Year.\n\nBut there's a good reason for it and not just because I hate giving out hongbao.\n\nAs you may be aware, there's a pandemic going on.\n\nRemember last year, after Singapore had one confirmed case of the \"Wuhan virus\", we still carried on with Chinese New Year festivities like nothing happened?\n\nHow did that turn out?\n\nWe have had almost 60,000 cases and 29 deaths since then.\n\nBusinesses shut down. People lost their jobs. The Black Widow movie was delayed.\n\nEven though we lohei-ed like we did every year, it clearly didn't work. Why do we keep doing it?\n\nDon't you wish you could go back in time and start the circuit breaker before last Chinese New Year? How many cases could have been prevented?\n\nOn Friday, you announced that each household will be limited to eight visitors per day starting tomorrow, well ahead of Chinese New Year on Feb 12.\n\nDid you decide on eight because it's a lucky number? How ox-picious of you.\n\nBut in light of the numerous breaches of safety measuresfrom the start, it's a given that covidiots will break the rules.\n\nSome are already joking about gathering on the MRT where there's apparently no limit to the number of people.\n\nCOMPLACENCY\n\nWith the worrying increase of community cases recently, you warned of growing complacency and said: \"For every rule we set, please do not try and optimise your maximum gain around the rule as though this is something that you could, you know, gain some additional benefit out of.\"\n\nBut you know people are gonna.\n\nYou said there would be random spot checks, but how would the checkers know whether the eight visitors in the afternoon are the same from the eight visitors earlier in the day or later at night?\n\nWill the checkers monitor households for 24 hours?\n\nOr will you just access everyone's TraceTogether data?\n\nAt best, you can catch people breaking the rules only after the fact. By then, the damage would have been done.\n\nA post-Chinese New Year coronavirus spike is almost inevitable.\n\nAnd that's why you should just cancel Chinese New Year.\n\nThat is, no visiting allowed at all. It would be so much easier to enforce. No counting required. At any time of the day, zero visitors per household.\n\nNeighbours would snitch on each other. And knowing your neighbour would snitch on you, you'd be afraid to sneak in any visitors. Ownself check ownself.\n\nDrastic times call for drastic measures.\n\nYes, I understand that many will not accept the cancellation of Chinese New Year, but I suspect some may actually be relieved.\n\nNo more annoying questions from relatives you see once a year about when you're going to get married or have children. (I'm married with kids, so I'm not talking about myself.)\n\nYou can save money on new clothes and hongbao. You don't have to stock up on snacks for visitors. Maybe just for yourself.\n\nIt could be the most stress-free Chinese New Year ever.\n\nAll this plus preventing the spread of a deadly virus?\n\nI mean, how could you not cancel Chinese New Year?\n\nAnd the great thing is that even if you cancel it, there'll be another one next year.\n\nThe annoying relatives will probably still be there too.\n\nAs co-chair of the Covid-19 task force, you know what to do.\n\nI await your announcement at the next virtual press conference, which will be soon, I hope.\n\nWe all want the pandemic to be over as quickly as possible.\n\nWe don't want it to end with tears in Parliament again, do you?\n\nBy\n\nS M Ong\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by S M Ong\n\nHumour\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 6, 2022, 01:00am\n\nCute dog 'defends' elderly woman after man teases her with fruit\n\nDec 5, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nKhan-spiracy theories: If she is a spy, I am the next James Bond\n\nNov 21, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTraceTogether app oughta have Merli instead of otter\n\nNov 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nIs the Eternals movie racist?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He's such a good horse and it's even better it was a Kranji Stakes A race,\" said Maia, a former two-time champion in Macau.\n\n\"Thanks so much to James Peters for that ride and to everybody who have supported me during my stay in Singapore. I believe I've done a good job.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Now it's time for a new challenge in Hong Kong. But, like I said before, this is only goodbye. I would like to come back to Singapore to ride again, as I really love the place.\"\n\nMaia made a few fleeting visits before the Singapore Turf Club granted him a full licence last year and he nearly prevented Vlad Duric from winning his fourth straight title.\n\nIt boiled down to the final meeting before he lost by just three winners with his 62-winner tally, which included two Group 1s with Aramaayo in the Kranji Mile and Raffles Cup.\n\nHe also captured the Group 2 Singapore Golden Horseshoe with Boomba and the Group 3 Colonial Chief Stakes with Super Dynasty.\n\nGrand Koonta was his eighth winner. He is leaving as the leading jockey after four race meetings, three winners ahead of former two-time champion rookie Wong Chin Chuen and apprentice jockey Hakim Kamaruddin.\n\nDuric did not ride on those four meetings - the first two because of a careless riding suspension and the last two for a minor throat problem.\n\nAlthough he ran below par in his last two starts and his barrier trial for Saturday's task was a tad disappointing, the real Grand Koonta surfaced and provided Maia a smooth ride.\n\nThe Irish-bred gelding jumped swiftly to be well up.\n\nLast-start winner Surpass Natural led, hounded by Fame Star.

But it should not entail going on fad diets to drastically restrict calorie intake.\n\nIf your diet makes you feel cranky and miserable, it will be unsustainable in the long run, which means you will ultimately regain the weight you lost while dieting.\n\nMs Alessia Tan, certified nutritionist at Usana Health Sciences, said: \"The air we breathe is polluted, the food we eat is processed, our lifestyle is sedentary, and our body cells lack oxygen, vitamins, minerals and enzymes.\n\n\"Also, our organs in charge of detoxification and excretion are overwhelmed, and our body is overloaded with waste products and toxic metabolites, which renders it vulnerable to all sorts of bacteria and viruses.\"\n\nShe added: \"A healthy body can eliminate the toxic substances generated by its normal functioning. However, over the years where our liver is used as a dumping ground, it will reach its breaking point.\"\n\nDetoxification, according to Ms Tan, is a decisive step towards restoration of the body's regulatory mechanisms and purging out the toxins we put in.\n\nShe said: \"The short-term effects of detox include the healing reaction when the body is trying to get rid of all the bad bacteria, toxins and waste.\n\n\"Some common symptoms include muscle and bone pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, eczema and restlessness. The symptoms may last days, weeks or months depending on your health status.\n\n\"The long-term effects of detox include increased energy, heightened immune system, more self-confidence, overall feeling of well-being, and lowered risk of health issues.\n\n\"When your body is free of waste, it can finally savour the goodness and nutrients you are feeding it.\"\n\nYou can either eliminate the excess weight and toxins by going on a detox diet that, however, will likely send you back to your old habits once it is over, or slowly and steadily incorporating simple detox habits into your regular routine.\n\nThe latter is, of course, the recommended option.\n\nIt is best to steer clear of quick fixes and focus on a diet that is sustainable in the long term and does not involve laxative teas or starving yourself.\n\nMs Tan said: \"Do not go full on and eat like a supermodel when you have been a fast-food junkie.\n\n\"One week's worth of motivation is not going to turn 10 years of bad eating habits around. You will feel more discouraged upon not seeing results from a yo-yo diet.\n\n\"Change progressively and not drastically. Swop white rice with brown rice, soft drinks with fruit-infused water. A gradual change in diet is the long-term method to maintaining a healthy weight.\"\n\nHere are more ways to detox without going on an extreme diet.\n\nReduce eating window\n\nMany of us are guilty of unknowingly overloading our bodies with more glucose than it can process.\n\nNight-time fasting, which reduces our eating window, can help to burn off the extra glucose in our system.\n\nInstead of staying up late and snacking throughout the night, allow yourself access to food only after 12 hours of not eating so that your body can enter a fasting state. In other words, if you had your last bite of food at 9pm, have your next meal only at 9am the next day.\n\nSip on citrus water\n\nA lot of the weight you feel could just be bloating. Many of the food we eat are loaded with sodium, which causes our body to bloat when it retains fluids.\n\nParadoxically, drinking lots of fluids helps our body shed the water that it is holding.\n\nAdd citrus fruits, which are rich in an antioxidant that stimulates enzymes in the liver, to flush out toxins and maintain healthy bowels.\n\nCitrus fruits are also rich in vitamin C, which is a natural detox. So go ahead and throw some sliced lemon, orange or lime into your drink for a refreshing twist.\n\nWash all your produce\n\nOn top of eating a variety of fruit and vegetables, make sure you wash them thoroughly because most of them contain the very toxins you are trying to eliminate.\n\nThe pesticides used on crops have been associated with diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain. Plus, consuming pesticides might lead to weight gain because the toxins, which are stored in fat cells after consumption, can interfere with the body's energy-burning process.\n\nChoose organic produce if you can afford it.\n\nLettuce, grape, apple, pear, peach, strawberry, cherry and nectarine tend to have the most pesticides on them.\n\nIndulge in green tea\n\nBoil yourself a cup of green tea because studies have shown that drinking four to five cups of green tea daily, paired with regular exercise, can help shed belly fat.\n\nGreen tea is also rich in catechin, an antioxidant that improves the liver's capacity to turn fat into energy and increases the body's production of detoxification enzymes that fight off cancer.\n\nBreak a sweat\n\nWe all know that regular physical activity can help us lose weight, fend off a host of diseases, improve our mood and boost our energy, but it brings even more benefits than we may realise.\n\nExercising - and hydrating amply afterwards - can help to eliminate toxins from our body and get things moving, in terms of digestion and blood circulation.\n\nConsuming too much alcohol or salt can make us look bloated, so exercising and hydrating will definitely help to reduce the paunch as well.\n\nWhile experts say there is no optimal time to work out, exercising in a fasted state (that is, before your first meal of the day) means our body draws energy from our fat stores instead of the glucose in our system - which means exercising before breaking a fast can burn more fat than exercising after.\n\nStock up on healthy snacks\n\nJust because you are going on a detox does not mean you need to toss out everything in your kitchen so you do not get tempted when you are feeling peckish. Instead, swop those savoury and sugary treats for fruit and veggies.\n\nLoading up on such thoroughly rinsed and pesticide-free goodies every day is one of the most effective detox methods.\n\nIn particular, go for avocado, which contains fatty acids that help the liver flush out toxins, and beets, which contain antioxidants that repair and regenerate cells in the liver.\n\nPay attention to gut health\n\nBloating is a common problem that can be solved by incorporating more gut-friendly food and probiotics into your diet.\n\nThe gut flora is made up of multiple types of healthy bacteria that maintain our gut health. Probiotics help to boost our immune system by fending off bad bacteria, so add some fermented food such as kimchi, sauerkraut and yogurt to your menu to cultivate a healthier gut biome.\n\nThis article was first published in Her World Online (www.HerWorld.com).\n\nJOYCE CHUA\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Some Singaporeans can - and will. And demand for these costly canines shows no signs of abating, despite prices for many breeds ballooning since last year.\n\nPet shops told The Straits Times a golden retriever can cost up to $12,800, compared with about $5,000 last January. A toy poodle can go for as much as $11,800, when one cost around $4,000 in the previous year.\n\nDemand for puppies surged right after the circuit breaker ended, and all five shops suggest that prices will continue to rise.\n\nDogs are imported from countries such as Ireland, Taiwan and Australia, or come from local breeders.\n\nNanyang Technological University student Isabel Joy Kua, 20, who bought her three-month-old bichon frise, Sunny, for $8,900 last month, said: \"Several shops tried to get me to reserve a dog even before I interacted with it, which didn't make sense. But they said if I went the next day, the dog would probably have been bought by another customer.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 06:16am\n\nWhen is it acceptable to address a stranger as 'uncle' or 'aunty'?\n\nMore related stories\n\nBuyers said they were willing to pay \"pandemic premiums\" due to money saved from cancelled holidays and work-from-home arrangements.\n\nMs Kua had wanted a dog since primary school and finally managed to persuade her parents to let her buy one.\n\nOthers like Ms Joanna Cheng-Ajlani, chose to adopt dogs from animal shelters instead.\n\n\"To be honest, if not for the change in work arrangements for both my husband and me, we would not have even considered a pet,\" said Ms Cheng-Ajlani, who adopted nine-year-old Polo, a Singapore Special, from Action for Singapore Dogs (ASD).\n\nDepending on the animal shelter, adopting a dog can cost between $250 and $530.\n\nWhile adoption queries were reported to have increased last August, the number of adoptions have returned to pre-pandemic levels for animal welfare groups Causes for Animals (CAS) and Save Our Street Dogs.\n\nMr Ricky Yeo, founder of ASD, said: \"We are always operating at full capacity. While adoptions peaked... last year, the take-in rate is still high.\"\n\nThe organisation shelters around 150 dogs, of which 90 per cent are Singapore Specials.\n\nCAS fund-raising coordinator Christine Bernadette said while there is nothing intrinsically wrong with buying dogs, it is important to get them from ethical breeders.\n\n\"Many buyers are unaware about the conditions the parents of their dogs are subjected to, which often means being caged and kept alive just for breeding,\" Ms Bernadette, 32, added,\n\n\"There needs to be more education on the cruelty of puppy mills.\"\n\n- ADDITIONAL REPORTING: SHERLYN SIM\n\nMore pet owners and feeders struggle with animal upkeep\n\nHard hit by the pandemic, several community feeders and pet owners are asking animal welfare organisations for help.\n\nDue to overwhelming demand, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has expanded its pet food support programme fund from $50,000 to $230,000.\n\nThe programme, which began last August, is now on track to provide three to six months' worth of food for the 1,832 animals registered under 629 applicants.\n\nIt plans to provide for common domestic animals such as dogs, cats, rabbits and fish.\n\nOf the $230,000, $150,000 comes from SPCA's funds. The remaining $80,000 came from a recent public fund-raiser.\n\nSPCA has recently applied for a dollar-for-dollar matching grant from the Tote Board to boost the fund, which was set up to help pet owners affected by the pandemic.\n\nSPCA's executive director, Dr Jaipal Singh Gill, 38, said it received an unusual number of calls for help from pet owners about pet food around the middle of last year.\n\nWithin 24 hours of the launch of the fund, SPCA received several hundred applications.\n\nPet owners can apply for support for up to three pets at home, and five if they are feeding animals in the community.\n\nDr Gill, a veterinarian, said the applications \"came from people out of work because of the pandemic, or freelancers not getting work but who don't want to give up their pets\".\n\nApplicants like former interior designer Mariani Basri, 44, who lost her job amid the pandemic, was worried about coping with the food expenses of her four cats as well as making ends meet as a single mother of three.\n\n\"Thankfully, with SPCA's help, I no longer have to worry about this issue,\" she said.\n\nDr Gill said the process of going through applications was both heartbreaking and heart-warming, as despite their personal suffering, many pet owners and feeders were still trying their best to provide for their animals.\n\n\"It wasn't any one case that stuck with me but the general theme of people losing their jobs and not having sufficient funds to look after themselves and their families but still looking after animals and not wanting them to go hungry,\" he said.\n\n- NG WEI KAI & ANG QING\n\nBy\n\nAng Qing\n\nRead articles by Ang Qing\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bf190a0888099a041d5ae33f1d69621d990cacb03cc128d9a1fb82b7ea1ca6b7/NP_20210125_WKPETS25A_6284941.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Undergrad Isabel Joy Kua paid $8,900 for a three- month-old bichon frise.", "caption": "Undergrad Isabel Joy Kua paid $8,900 for a three- month-old bichon frise.

Part of the swimming pool also jutted out onto the enclosed land.\n\nThe encroachments were discovered in 2013 when national water agency PUB implemented a drainage improvement project to alleviate flooding in the area.\n\nTan Teck Siong and his wife Cheah Mee Poh - the first people to be prosecuted for trespassing under the State Lands Encroachments Act - were fined $4,000 and $3,000, respectively.\n\nThe offence carries a maximum fine of $5,000 or a jail term of up to six months, or both.\n\nTan was fined another $5,000 under the Building Control Act for making false declarations in December 2005 that the building works did not deviate from their approved plans.\n\nAccording to a written judgment published last week, Tan, 62, and Cheah, 60, have owned a plot of land in Jalan Tari Zapin, a 999-year leasehold property with an area of 546.6 sq m, since 2001. They had planned to build a house on the land as a gift for Tan's parents.\n\nRESPONSIBLE\n\nThe couple obtained the requisite approvals to build the house, and Tan was named as the qualified person responsible in ensuring works were carried out in line with regulations.\n\nThe house was left vacant as Tan's father died soon after construction was completed in 2005.\n\nIn 2013, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), while inspecting the site for the PUB project, discovered the encroachments.\n\nThe authorities wrote to the couple asking for the encroachments to be removed.\n\nThe couple claimed they could not reposition the gate as it would block the only vehicular access to the property, among other things.\n\nMeetings were held and correspondence exchanged, but none of the proposed solutions resolved the impasse. In the meantime, PUB began its work but did not upgrade 95m of the drain bordering the property.\n\nIt incurred about $24,000 in costs to come up with temporary flooding measures.\n\nThe matter went cold until June 2019 when SLA issued a demand to the owners, who eventually agreed to remove the encroachments.\n\nTan and Cheah were sentenced last month after pleading guilty to the charges.\n\nSELINA LUM, LAW CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nCombat Siege\n\nThe most realistic game 2025.

Not everything can change,\" he told The Straits Times.\n\nTwo recent variants causing concern among health authorities around the world include the B.1.1.7 strain first detected in Britain, and the 501.V2 strain first seen in South Africa.\n\nThese variants share a mutation affecting the tip of the spike protein, which helps the virus bind to human cells more effectively and could make the virus more contagious.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Think of it as a key getting into a lock. The mutations happening change the shape of the key and that affects how it slots into the lock.\n\n\"It's getting better at getting into the lock,\" said Prof Ooi.\n\nBut binding to the human cell is only the first step in infecting it, he noted.\n\n\"The protein actually literally needs to turn - the scientific term is confirmation - for the inside of the virus to be released into the cell.\n\n\"Otherwise, the shell is still in place and the heart of the virus cannot get into the cell.\"\n\nProf Ooi said the parts of the spike protein that enable it to turn the \"key\" in the \"lock\" and release the core of the virus into the cell have not changed and cannot change too much.\n\n\"The reason is that they are in contact with many other parts. If it mutates, the entire structure will collapse,\" he noted.\n\n\"The vaccine can generate antibodies against those parts of the virus that are really critical for the infection process, making it very hard for the virus to escape from the immunity developed.\"\n\nDr Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York, said existing vaccines will still prevent serious illness and people should continue to be vaccinated, The New York Times reported last Wednesday.\n\nPUBLISHED\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has already been shown to be effective against the B.1.1.7 variant, according to lab results published by the two companies.\n\nThe results, which have yet to be peer reviewed, were published on the medical preprint website bioRxiv last Tuesday.\n\n\"Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing Covid-19 caused by new virus variants,\" the companies said in a joint statement last Wednesday.\n\nProf Ooi added that Singaporeans need not worry about the mutations being reported or possibility of having to alter the vaccine in the near term.\n\nFOR MORE, READ THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nBy\n\nRei Kurohi\n\nRead articles by Rei Kurohi\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

And Kepa Arrizabalaga has surely played his last game for the club.\n\nIndeed, Abraham's hat-trick, Timo Werner's listlessness and Arrizabalaga's slapstick comedy only underlined the uncertainty around Lampard's squad.\n\nChelsea's FA Cup victory against Luton Town yesterday was rarely in doubt, but the 3-1 scoreline and a few jittery moments hardly conveyed stability.\n\nLike the snow at Stamford Bridge, Lampard's men cannot settle.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nOrdinarily, Abraham's commanding display would've rubber stamped his position as the main attacking focal point. His hat-trick - a low drive, a looping header and a tap-in - only confirmed his suitability.\n\nBut Chelsea paid £72 million (S$131m) for Kai Havertz, who spent most of last night welding his buttocks to the bench in sub-zero conditions, while Werner proved that snowflakes are not the only substance capable of melting on a heated pitch.\n\nThe German striker started brightly and faded soon after, only popping up at the end to miss a penalty.\n\nTOO MANY COOKS\n\nHis cause wasn't helped by Christian Pulisic occupying similar positions and intercepting passes around Werner.\n\nThe pair overlapped, but not in a creative way. Too many cooks are leaving Lampard in the soup.\n\nOn the touchline, Chelsea's manager occasionally had the look of a confused teenager sitting his first exam. He knows all the questions, such as how does he accommodate Abraham, Pulisic, Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Havertz into his line-up? Who will be his first-choice forwards? Will Werner ever provide a regular goal supply?\n\nLampard has no firm answers beyond the most obvious. Abraham remains the most reliable striker. But Lampard may face further interrogation for picking a 23-year-old academy graduate over foreign talents worth almost £130m.\n\nJust to muddy the waters further, Abraham still has a tendency to miss more than he scores.\n\nThe Englishman had a brace within 17 minutes, but squandered at least five more chances before completing his hat-trick.\n\nUp front, the indecision endures. But there is no grey area around Arrizabalaga, just an ugly, gaping hole between an arm and a leg that allowed Jordan Clark's strike to wriggle through.\n\nEven the Luton midfielder didn't seriously expect his speculative drive to beat an international goalkeeper with a £71m price tag.\n\nThe shot was far too close to Arrizabalaga, who had the option to stick out either an arm or a leg to block Clark's tame effort.\n\nInstead, his limps seemed to shrivel in the freezing conditions, leaving behind a flapping shirtsleeve and a wobbly sock.\n\nArrizabalaga didn't know where to put his head (or his arms and legs for that matter).\n\nLampard risks ending his own Chelsea career prematurely if he doesn't do likewise for his shattered Spaniard. A shaky goalkeeper with the yips didn't help a brittle side that rarely need an excuse to lose confidence against weaker opposition.\n\nIn the second half, Luton manager Nathan Jones sensed the uncertainty and threw on all five substitutes in search of an equaliser.\n\nAs the Championship club progressed, Chelsea hesitated, forcing Lampard to introduce Callum Hudson-Odoi to kill off the game.\n\nThe winger duly obliged, breaking free on the left before teeing up Abraham for a tap-in that even he couldn't miss.\n\nThe Englishman finally had his hat-trick. And Lampard had his leading man.\n\nIf the Chelsea manager needed further persuasion, Werner managed to miss a penalty in the final moments to round off another fruitless performance.\n\nIn comparison, Abraham looks like a model of consistency.\n\nWhether Lampard has the courage to pick a local boy over a couple of expensive signings remains to be seen. But his job might depend on it.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1ac310e142ecfd83baeb580ec6c0f8f101c4a89518f9d5d036bf50cc61dce351/NP_20210125_NEIL25_6284942.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham (in blue) bags a hat-trick in the 3-1 FA Cup victory over Luton Town.

He is awaiting relevant permits and should arrive next month.\n\n\"Good for the SPL, after so long someone is coming in with a huge price tag and anyone who is coming in at $3m has to be good,\" Tanjong Pagar United team manager Noh Alam Shah said of Lopes, who leaves Rio Ave after scoring 25 goals in 201 appearances in all competitions.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 12, 2025, 02:38am\n\nSingapore U-16 boys roar back with 3 goals in 8 minutes to stun Cambodia\n\nMore related stories\n\nAdded Hougang United coach Clement Teo: \"In the Singapore context, it is crazy... But, it is a step forward because there is a reason why players cost as much as they do.\"\n\nBesides providing quality on the pitch, Lopes, who is able to play anywhere across the midfield, is expected to be a draw.\n\n\"This comes as very good news and, given our state of football, this is one of the ways we can improve,\" said Tampines defender Baihakki Khaizan.\n\n\"News like this creates a lot of interest, headlines and it becomes a good marketing tool.\"\n\nGeylang International coach Noor Ali added: \"Good to have such quality foreigners coming here, it will bring fans back because if you sign someone for $3m, he is someone to watch.\"\n\nWith this marquee signing and a slew of other high-profile moves, the Sailors have clearly signalled their ambitions for the upcoming season, which is scheduled to kick off on Feb 20.\n\nAfter finishing third in the SPL last season, the Sailors have boosted their ranks. They have added 2019 Player of the Year Faris Ramli, and defenders Jorge Fellipe from Saudi Arabian second-tier side Al-Tai, and Amirul Adli from Tampines.\n\nClub chairman Forrest Li believes the Sailors' latest foreign imports will provide a fillip to not just them, but the whole local football community.\n\n\"Having top-quality players like Diego and Jorge... will give us the boost that we need but, more than that, they will hopefully give Singapore football a lift,\" said Li in a press release.\n\n\"I hope they will help reignite interest in the SPL and give Singapore football fans more reasons to tune into the local game.\"\n\nWhile the stockpile of talent at the privatised club has created a buzz, it has also raised concerns of an uneven playing field.\n\nOne member of the fraternity declined comment on the perceived advantage to the Sailors, while another said any negative reaction could be met with a warning. But most individuals The New Paper spoke to believe signings like Lopes will benefit the league as a whole.\n\n\"Every club stands a chance to win the league title, as long as they plan ahead and work hard,\" said Alam Shah.\n\n\"But of course, Sailors will have a higher chance than the rest... That said, we have to see this move in terms of the betterment of Singapore football.\n\n\"Look at Johor Darul Ta'zim, even our own player Hariss Harun is well taken care of.\n\n\"It's good to see Forrest has invested so much in the Sailors. I hope they emulate JDT... and the Sailors become a force to be reckoned with in the region.\"\n\nAdded Baihakki: \"I don't think we should see this in a negative light... this will be a clear message to other clubs and future investors that privatisation should be the way forward.\n\n\"I don't think we should criticise the Lopes signing, we should look forward and try to compete, rather than say, 'Oh they have everything, they will win'.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gavin Lee, coach of title contenders Tampines, felt other clubs have also reinforced well.\n\nHe said: \"We definitely do not see it as a disadvantage as the Sailors can play only 11 players.\n\n\"It will make for an exciting season as Geylang, Hougang have recruited well, so everybody's up for it.\"\n\nLast season's SPL top scorer Stipe Plazibat, stoked at the prospect of linking up with Lopes, said quality should always be welcome.\n\nHe added: \"Why should it be unfair? That's only one player out of 20 plus, no matter how good is he, at the end of the day, this is (a) team sport.\"\n\nBy\n\nNarendaren Karnageran\n\nRead articles by Narendaren Karnageran\n\nSingapore Football\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 10, 2025, 10:45pm\n\nLions survive late onslaught to claim first win of Asian Cup third-round qualifiers\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:01pm\n\nLion City Sailors retain Singapore Cup to cement domestic dominance\n\nMay 18, 2025, 11:06pm\n\nLion City Sailors denied at final hurdle as Sharjah FC clinch AFC Champions League Two title\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:16pm\n\nACL2 trophy is 'something beautiful to fight for', says Lion City Sailors' Hariss Harun\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I'm so many levels above these guys. I beat these guys',\" White told a media conference.\n\nThe Russian was also quick to mock McGregor on social media after the fight.\n\n\"This is what happened, when you change your team, leave the sparring partners who made you a champion and sparring with little kids, far away from reality,\" he tweeted.\n\nFor McGregor, it was a first knockout defeat as a pro and surely not an outcome he expected, as the Irishman arrived in Abu Dhabi on his yacht in midweek, enjoying the trappings of the wealth that this sport has brought him.\n\n\"It's a bitter pill to swallow, and I don't even know whether I'm that upset, I don't know what to say,\" he said, before going on to list trilogy fights against Poirier and Nate Diaz and a possible boxing match with Manny Pacquiao as being on his radar.\n\nThe 32-year-old Poirier, who avenged a 2014 loss at featherweight, was ranked second in the flyweight division going into the fight. But he was still rated as a heavy underdog to beat his fourth-ranked rival.\n\n\"I'm happy but I'm not surprised. I put in the work,\" said the American, after the referee stepped in after 2min 32sec of the second round to save McGregor from further damage after he was dropped by a fierce combination of punches.\n\n\"I'm happy with the place I'm in. I'm happy with the face I see in the mirror,\" he said. \"The goal was to be technical and to pick my shots, not brawl at all. I had him hurt and I went a little crazy.\"\n\nPoirier is now in prime position to inherit or fight for the UFC's lightweight belt, most recently held by Nurmagomedov. \"I felt like this was the title fight. If Khabib's not coming back, then I'm the champion,\" said Poirier. - AFP, REUTERS\n\nMMA (MIXED MARTIAL ARTS)\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c2c154c3340fc88e59bf711d6298951a6fd13f4e4f9a4d73beb2f2a69c723666/NP_20210125_UFC25_6284340.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Dustin Poirier (right) is now in prime position to inherit or fight for the UFC's lightweight belt, after beating Conor McGregor.

Organised by Decadance Co at a Lion Befrienders Senior Activity Centre near her home, these sessions used to be conducted on-site at the centre, but they have now moved online as a result of Covid-19.\n\nWhile Madam Lee, 69, misses chatting with her friends and neighbours at the on-site sessions, she has since taken to the virtual classes. She uses a SilverPad - a senior-friendly, iPad-like device with a simple interface - to watch the pre-recorded sessions online and is able to re-watch her favourite sessions whenever she wants to.\n\n\"I was able to practise my listening skills by counting the number of beats. The exercises lifted my mood, as the instructors were funny and made me smile,\" she says.\n\nWorking behind the scenes to bring smiles to elderly beneficiaries like Madam Lee, is the socially conscious contemporary dance company,\n\nDecadance Co\n\n.\n\nFounded in 2019, it uses dance and music to promote inter-generational harmony and inclusivity. Its flagship Decasilver programme is specially designed to improve the mood and well-being of the elderly beneficiaries.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 06:16am\n\nWhen is it acceptable to address a stranger as 'uncle' or 'aunty'?\n\nMore related stories\n\nAs many of them stay alone in rental flats, the dance and music exercises not only allow them to socialise with their neighbours, but also help ease feelings of loneliness and isolation.\n\nEven with no physical sessions since the start of Covid-19, Decadance Co has continued to encourage its following of seniors to remain active. The team created a series of eight videos with warm-up exercises, rhythmic games and a simple choreography for the seniors to follow. These videos were recorded in various languages and dialects and uploaded to YouTube.\n\nLike Decadance Co, there are many arts groups in Singapore using their talent and time to engage marginalised or vulnerable groups while championing causes, such as keeping our cultural legacy alive.\n\nMalay dance company\n\nEra Dance Theatre\n\n, for example, are the organisers of\n\nMuara Festival\n\n, one of the region's largest gatherings of Malay dance practitioners and enthusiasts.\n\nThe festival has grown steadily over the last 10 years, drawing over 10,000 attendees at its annual events and becoming widely recognised as the pinnacle of Malay dance festivals in the region.\n\nOver the years, the Muara Festival has become a platform for the exchange, collaboration and sharing of ideas between Malay performing arts practitioners, enthusiasts, young choreographers and the public. PHOTO: ERA DANCE THEATRE\n\nCovid-19 restrictions almost caused the festival's 10th anniversary celebrations last year to be cancelled, but fortunately the organisers were quick to move programming online.\n\nThe result was a successful weekend of livestreamed performances and workshops, with regional dancers being able to share ideas via video conferencing.\n\nMr Azmi Juhari, dance leader and choreographer from Azpirasi Dance Group, says: \"We have been participating in Muara since its inaugural run, but having it online this time is very exciting. We get to see ourselves close-up and from many different angles, allowing for active learning that will help lift overall standards in Malay dance.\"\n\nGiving the arts a new lease of life\n\nArts groups such as Decadance Co and Era Dance Theatre were able to pivot online and continue producing meaningful content for various segments of the community, thanks in part to the introduction of a new fund that helps smaller arts groups sustain through challenging times.\n\nThe\n\nSustain the Arts (stART) Fund\n\nis a joint initiative by the\n\nNational Arts Council\n\n(NAC) and the private sector to boost the long-term sustainability of small arts organisations.\n\nThe fund serves to nurture a culture of giving to the arts by recognising impactful work and encouraging the continued presentation of creative and quality programmes that inspires individuals and communities.\n\nAdministered by NAC, the stART Fund is also meant to support arts organisations in enhancing arts experiences through digital technology, and establish better governance and accountability through scaling up with robust governance structures and working towards sustaining their creative practice in the long run.\n\nThe need to upgrade organisational capabilities is especially pronounced in recent times due to the disruption caused by Covid-19 on the local arts and culture scene, where many small arts groups have had to cancel their events and programmes due to financial instability and other difficulties.\n\nPaper Monkey Theatre specialises in puppetry productions and workshops to encourage artistic development and enriching learning experiences for both children and adults. PHOTO: PAPER MONKEY THEATRE\n\nPaper Monkey Theatre\n\n, for example, had to cancel several public shows, as well as its annual Puppet Festival, last year.\n\nThe festival was created to showcase puppetry performances from around the world and provide a platform for puppetry artists to share and exchange ideas on the craft. The company saw its income plunge drastically after many show bookings with schools and elsewhere were cancelled.\n\nMr Benjamin Ho, artistic director of Paper Monkey Theatre, says: \"If arts programmes cannot continue, a part of our culture and heritage may be gone and that's heartbreaking.\n\n\"After I started learning about Chinese traditional hand puppets, I understood a lot more about my Chinese heritage.\n\n\"It would be sad to see puppets only in display cases of museums in the future… I want to pass the art down, so our future generations can enjoy them and be proud of their heritage.\"\n\nPaper Monkey Theatre is not alone in its struggle. Decadance Co is also finding it difficult to continue its operations with the limited performance opportunities and huge cuts in classes.\n\nMr Edwin Wee, director of Decadance Co, shares: \"As a new non-profit art start-up, continuing operations without operational funding becomes extremely stressful and discouraging. Only with continued financial support would our artists be able to continue creating effective engagement programmes for our silver communities.\"\n\nAt Superhero Me, children with and without disabilities work together through creative art experiences bridged by facilitators known as Captains to form friendships.

So, other than shifting our programmes online, we thought we could also use the opportunity to teach others how to create art programmes for a more diverse audience so that children with special needs could be better included.\"\n\nSuperhero Me is hoping to use stART funding for its upcoming inclusive arts training programme, that seeks to equip art professionals and teachers with the skills and confidence to improve the experience of art programmes for children of all abilities.\n\nIt also intends to run a mentorship programme that pairs special needs youth with creative professionals so that their art projects can be developed into products that can generate income.\n\n\"Young people with disabilities often have problems getting a job after leaving school. We hope to seed opportunities for them at a younger age and nurture longer-term partnerships, which may result in income-generating opportunities for them in the future,\" says Ms Loo.\n\n\"So, any form of support for our work - especially during this critical time - will, in turn, contribute to our efforts in creating a more inclusive society.\"\n\nBy helping to provide relief to these smaller arts and culture groups affected by the pandemic, the stART Fund - with your support - will go a long way towards helping Singapore's arts community continue to thrive and grow, enabling more people to enjoy and celebrate our diverse arts experiences.\n\nDonate now to the stART fund\n\nhere\n\nor find out more at\n\nwww.nac.gov.sg/start\n\n.

She was warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) for 10 days.\n\nBefore being diagnosed, she attended a Chinese New Year gathering. Her family members and friends who had contact with her were quarantined and eventually tested negative.\n\nMs Ong told The New Paper: \"I was apologetic about the inconvenience I caused. But I was relieved that I didn't infect anyone.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"It has made me more cautious. I won't be doing any visiting because I don't need another 'memorable' Chinese New Year.\"\n\nInstead, Ms Ong will be going on a cruise with her 75-year-old mother.\n\nA year on, she still avoids large crowds and even small gatherings, other than church services, and she keeps a diary of who she meets for contact tracing purposes.\n\nShe suffers from leftover Covid-19 symptoms such as loss of taste and smell but has learnt to live with it.\n\n\"It is dangerous when I cannot smell things like gas from the stove, so I have to be more vigilant. I also check my car more regularly to see if anything is wrong,\" she said.\n\nSTIGMA\n\nMs Ong added that former patients like herself face a stigma because people assume they must have behaved irresponsibly.\n\n\"I don't blame them, but the virus doesn't pick and choose. I went about my regular routine and lifestyle, and one day I got it. It can infect anybody.\"\n\nMs Ong, who has a 26-year-old daughter, volunteered for NCID's coronavirus research and has had 30 swab tests and five blood tests, giving six to eight tubes of blood each time.\n\nShe also \"kind of expected\" the recent rise in community cases as she thinks people are getting more complacent.\n\nBut she noted those who are overly paranoid also cause fear and anxiety in people around them, when all everyone needs to do is follow the rules.\n\n\"People don't realise the impact of their actions until they are affected directly,\" she said.\n\nMs Ong recalled how she woke up with a slight sore throat last month on the day she had an online job interview.\n\nShe admitted she was afraid to see the doctor in case her worst fears were confirmed.\n\nBut in the end, she postponed the interview and saw a doctor.\n\n\"It can be scary, but I live with my 75-year-old mother. I cannot afford to be irresponsible. So I go for regular checks and if I am not feeling well, I see a doctor. It is the right thing to do,\" she said.\n\nOn vaccines, she is not certain if it is a one-size-fits-all prevention against the virus, and she is still unsure about getting vaccinated as she still has antibodies from her infection to give her some immunity.\n\nOn what Singapore should do to curb the rise in community cases, Ms Ong said: \"It is really up to the individual. We can go back to phase two, we can start lockdown again or make the rules stricter, but some people will still breach the rules.\n\n\"The Government cannot possibly micromanage everyone. Instead, each individual needs to play his or her part to be more responsible and adhere to the rules.\"\n\nCovid patient, who spent 60 days at NCID, wary of new virus wave\n\nBy\n\nClariss Chia\n\nRead articles by Clariss Chia\n\nAfter spending 60 days at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) battling Covid-19, Ms Isabella Lim takes the virus seriously and urges others to do the same.\n\nThe current rise in community cases and clusters proves the unpredictability of the virus, and she is worried there could be another wave here.\n\nThe 26-year-old business operations executive, who was announced as Case 547 on March 23 last year, told The New Paper: \"The virus is scary and no one expected it to last so long. I really don't want to go through the same thing again.\n\n\"After recovering, I completely avoided crowded places and have had no nightlife. I prefer to hang out at home now.\"\n\nShe added: \"Some people may be asymptomatic, and you never really know. But for those who experience symptoms, it is only responsible to see a doctor and be more vigilant.\"\n\nLONDON HOLIDAY\n\nMs Lim and her boyfriend did just that after returning from London last March.\n\nThey stayed in an apartment during their two-week holiday in London and did not go out much, masking up whenever they did.\n\nOn their return flight, they wore double masks out of fear but ended up sitting behind a family that was coughing profusely.\n\nBack in Singapore, they decided to self-isolate at home together and cut off physical contact from their loved ones.\n\nAfter two days of a slight cough and a fever respectively, Ms Lim and her boyfriend consulted a doctor and checked themselves into NCID. There, they found out they both had contracted the disease.\n\nShe said: \"I feel so thankful to be in Singapore as it is much safer and better healthcare-wise than in the UK. I felt so privileged that I was offered a medical ward despite having only mild symptoms.\"\n\nThough the situation has improved from last year, Ms Lim warns against complacency and believes everyone must still follow the rules such as wearing masks and safe distancing.\n\n\"A lot of young people might think, 'it is okay if I get it', and that it will affect only them. But people breaching the rules (need reminding that they) are compromising their family members and risking their lives.\"\n\nBy\n\nClariss Chia\n\nRead articles by Clariss Chia\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/663a62912dad10d939998e187007287e39618cccb483ea3152d54ec606069f40/NP_20210122_CCCOVID992T_6279468.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ms Julie Ong, 54, is unsure about getting vaccinated as she still has antibodies from her infection to give her some immunity.

And when we are ready, we will highlight them.\"\n\nMr Wong and task force co-chair, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, were addressing reporters on Tuesday in an interview to mark one year of Covid-19 in Singapore.\n\nThe 90-minute interview covered topics ranging from the challenges faced over the past 12 months to the prospects ahead.\n\nThe country's response to the crisis reflected the resilience of its society, Mr Gan said, adding: \"When the challenges come our way, we are able to come together, look after one another, support one another and to emerge stronger at the end of the crisis.\"\n\nMr Wong said that in many ways, Singapore is in a stronger position to tackle the virus than it was before.\n\nIt now has better healthcare capabilities, improved testing and tracing capabilities and is rolling out vaccinations.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation remains highly unpredictable because the virus is still spreading in the wider world, he added.\n\nThe number of community cases is going up, and there is a sense of fatigue with all the rules in place.\n\nBoth ministers stressed that Singapore must remain vigilant, even though the end is in sight with the vaccination programme well under way.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, Singapore will have enough vaccines for all citizens and long-term residents by the third quarter of this year.\n\n\"But between now and the third quarter of this year, there are many months, and many things can happen during this period,\" Mr Wong said.\n\n\"So, let's stay alert, let's stay vigilant, let's rally together and complete our mission to defeat Covid-19 together.\"\n\nLINETTE LAI, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fd8a1f68ff2372f3af27d05aff49f5692e6265c6b99bb5e4f298e4066d94629f/NP_20210122_LLWRAP22_6279674.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Co-chairs of the multi-ministry task force, Mr Gan Kim Yong (left) and Mr Lawrence Wong.

But those statistics include strikes in amateur, unofficial and friendly matches.\n\nRonaldo's career tally includes goals for four top-flight clubs and Portugal. His closest active rival is Lionel Messi, who scored a single-club record 644th goal for Barcelona last month.\n\nThe 35-year-old Ronaldo, who is the leading goalscorer for his country with 102 goals, previously played for Sporting Lisbon (five goals), Manchester United (118) and Real Madrid (450). He has scored 85 goals for Juventus.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"The incredible @Cristiano has scored his 760th career goal tonight, overtaking Josef Bican as the highest goal scorer in the history of football. What an achievement,\" former England striker Gary Lineker posted on Twitter.\n\nWhile Ronaldo continues to enjoy a purple patch, the same could not be said of his former club Real.\n\nThe Spanish giants suffered an embarrassing defeat in the Copa del Rey yesterday morning (Singapore time), losing 2-1 to third-tier side Alcoyano, who scored an extra-time winner despite having a man sent off.\n\nReal took the lead on the stroke of half-time through an Eder Militao header, but Alcoyano equalised in the 82nd minute. A corner kick was flicked on by Ramon Lopez to the back post, where Vinicius allowed Jose Solbes to take the match into extra time with a simple finish.\n\nLopez picked up a second yellow card in the 110th minute for a foul on Casemiro. But, instead of clinging on for penalties, the home side burst forward five minutes later and snatched a winner when Juanan turned in a cross from close range.\n\nReal have now won only once in their last five games, with the latest loss piling more pressure on coach Zinedine Zidane.\n\nBut the Frenchman insisted his players still believe in him, saying: \"We have to work.

Until recently, those principles also applied to the midfielder and United.\n\nThey still do, off the pitch at least, with the Italian routinely touting his most high-profile client for an impending departure from the 20-time English champions. The only question had been whether his destination would be Real Madrid or back to Juventus.\n\nBefore this season, recouping a mere fraction of the 27-year-old's once record-breaking fee of £89 million (S$161.5m) appeared a tall order, with neither the reigning Spanish nor Italian champions seemingly willing to consider such largesse in the current climate.\n\nBoth will now be standing at the front of a growing queue of viable suitors, following his resurgent run of games which has eroded some long-standing doubts and even dissent.\n\nPogba is not alone in believing that leaving Old Trafford could avail a vicious cycle of poor form. Wayne Rooney briefly agonised over a move away in the 2010/11 campaign, before subsequently reneging and firing United to that season's EPL title at a relative canter.\n\nHistory may repeat itself with the France international truly coming of age in the match-winning outing at Fulham, where he was battling more than just the elements.\n\nBeing caught cold in the build-up to Ademola Lookman's opener as driving rain flew in off the River Thames hinted Pogba would again allow himself to go through the motions.\n\nToo often, he has resembled a petulant child than the player hailed a leader of men during his country's eventual coronation as world champions in 2018.\n\nFew realistically expected that contrasting persona trait to be reversed, not in a United shirt at least.\n\nPogba, however, went on to produce arguably his most complete performance at club level. A thunderous strike rounded off an all-encompassing midfield display which also boasted two successful take-ons, nine ball recoveries and 21 passes in the final third.\n\nSuch statistics, coupled with the match-winning strikes, mean Raiola's public pronouncements over his future are only set to grow louder in the coming weeks.\n\nIf Pogba can continue to rise above the noise of his outspoken representative, keeping United firmly in the conversation for their previous crown until the very last, he will finally be the master of his own destiny for a first time since returning in summer 2016.\n\nHe could either spearhead a potential new dynasty at the Theatre of Dreams or, at worst, end an eight-year wait to reclaim the EPL title as the ultimate parting gift.\n\nWhichever course he chooses, Pogba and United are currently in a no-lose situation.\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nGet free installation and consultation with 5Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/04603a590debbf6ab82e98d83da7ac5847f3ad53fb5fe1888f1a0a7ed1c241f3/NP_20210122_NEIL22_6279048.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Paul Pogba.

Freedman is also packing up about the same time.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nBrown, 51, gave three main reasons for his move - the drastic changes to the racing system, his children and his most recent star Inferno. All three have been triggered by Covid-19, directly or indirectly.\n\n\"Covid-19 has crushed the club, just like it has damaged a lot of other racing jurisdictions around the world. No-one is immune to its devastating effects,\" said Brown.\n\n\"When I came to Singapore, my business model was to win as many races as possible. With the many changes we've seen in the last year, many things have been taken away as a result. My business model won't work any more.\n\n\"The number of races has dropped, we can't get a run for our horses. That has greatly affected our income and our bottom line.\n\n\"(Youngest son) Felix is with us, but Jo and I haven't seen our two eldest kids for one year because of the closed borders and travel restrictions.\n\n\"Both Harvey and India are in university back home, and not seeing them for so long has been very hard, and I don't think travel will happen this year.\n\n\"Thirdly, Inferno going back is a big thing. Having him here now wouldn't make any sense and that's why we decided to send him to Australia.\n\n\"There's no guarantee that he'll be good enough in Australia. He may not be top level, but I would really like to see him there, and be part of that new journey.\"\n\nThe former juvenile champion is hot favourite for the 2020 champion three-year-old award. He won both legs of the Singapore Three-Year-Old Challenge.\n\nHe also won the Group 1 Lion City Cup and was invited to contest the prestigious Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Sprint last month. But he had to be withdrawn after not fully recovered from the heat stress he had to endure at Changi Airport on his way to take his Hong Kong-bound flight) because of a faulty air-con on his float from Kranji.\n\nBarree Stable's dual-Group 1 winner and eight-time winner will be trained by Jim Conlan in Mornington. Brown will take back the horse after he has secured his licence there.\n\nA successful trainer in Victoria before moving to Singapore, having trained 13 Group 1 and 2 winners in Australia, he has yet to choose a training base. He had sold his former Narbethong property a few years back.\n\nThe likeable trainer, who hopes to be operational in May, will bring a few of his 54 horses with him. The rest will be redeployed at Kranji, the same for his staff.\n\nHe said the first people he informed were his owners, who were understanding.

The numbers speak for themselves, the best striker in our history,\" manager Pep Guardiola said before their 2-0 win over Aston Villa yesterday morning (Singapore time).\n\nIn the absence of Aguero, who has missed four games, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Guendogan scored to make it nine successive wins in all competitions for City. They are set to make it 10 in a row on Sunday morning, when they visit fourth-tier Cheltenham in an FA Cup fourth-round match.\n\n\"We've lost just two games this season and the most important thing for me is the fact we are back to playing the way we have to play to be contenders,\" said Guardiola.\n\nSilva's goal angered Aston Villa manager Dean Smith, who was livid that City midfielder Rodri had come back into play from an offside position before taking the ball off Tyrone Mings and feeding Silva.\n\nAfter the match, the Professional Game Match Officials organisation explained that, by the letter of the law, Rodri had not gained an advantage because Mings played the ball first.\n\nThat didn't placate Smith, who raged: \"It was a farcical decision. I've not seen a goal like that given... He was 10 yards offside and come back and tackled our player, it's a pathetic law and a pathetic decision.\" - AFP\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nFree WiFi 7 router, installation & more with 5Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/86b83eeadb47cad9800b79088924d2c2f36a5951c628d5a1a5b3a2ba339cdb24/NP_20210122_CITY22_6279795.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Sergio Aguero.

They all can win.\n\nIt took a while before I finally settled for a top-form horse with a big weight advantage.\n\nThe Young Keah Yong-trained River Roca scored a Class 5 double over the course and distance in good times, clocking below 59sec on both occasions.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe is promoted a class but gets in with bottom weight.\n\nThe four-year-old New Zealand-bred is handicapped with only 51kg and his rider, apprentice jockey Iskandar Rosman, can still claim 3kg.\n\nThis means his mount will carry only 48kg.\n\nLast start on Dec 12, River Roca won with 54.5kg after Iskandar's 3kg claim. So this is a big drop in weight and that should put the speedster in good stead.\n\nThe Mark Walker-trained Sacred Gift, who won all three races over the 1,000m dash, is a class dropper who appears to be back in form.\n\nHe is back to his last winning class and won a trial for this assignment. But he will be humping the 59kg top impost.\n\nThat is a hefty 11kg more than River Roca. As they say, weight can stop a train.\n\nThe Tim Fitzsimmons-trained Radiant Success gets in as a 64-rated newcomer with 57.5kg.\n\nHe has been pleasing at the trials at Kranji - three in all- and in his gallops. He is a three-time Australian winner.

Paul Pogba then sealed all three points with a stunning strike.\n\n\"We've done better in tighter games. We've won loads of 1-0s and 2-1s. When you add those up at the end of the season, it means many points,\" said Solskjaer.\n\n\"That was a point we spoke about early on before the season had started, that we needed to stop getting draws and win more games. We've shown great improvement in mentality as well as physical robustness.\"\n\nIt was the second midweek running that Pogba had scored the winner, having also volleyed a decider at Burnley that sent United top for the first time this season.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nMuch of the praise was reserved for the Frenchman as United have now won eight away games in the league this season, seven having come from behind.\n\nBut Pogba insisted that it's not only about him, saying: \"Playing on the left or the right, as long as I play, I know I have the confidence of the guys. When I am on the pitch, I just want to win.\"\n\nSolskjaer, whose side have emulated Sir Alex Ferguson's Treble winners by going 17 away league games undefeated, is happy to be talking about Pogba's contribution on the pitch, rather than fielding questions about reports that the Frenchman wants to leave Old Trafford.\n\n\"I am very happy with his performances,\" said Solskjaer. \"I know what he can do. He does everything.\n\n\"Now he is putting all the elements together in his performances and it is great to see.\"\n\nHaving fended off questions about his future at the club after a woeful start to the season, Solskjaer is now fielding questions over a title challenge, but he refuses to be drawn on such talk.\n\n\"It is always going to be talked about that when you are halfway through and top of the league, but we are not thinking about this, we just have to go one game at a time,\" he added. \"It is such an unpredictable season.\"\n\nUnited's next game is an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Liverpool on Monday morning. - REUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of StarHub with 10Gbps Broadband deal\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1668dbcae143eeab1fe343f4b58c6c1c252969ee73b980a0a0fcb073a001f915/NP_20210122_UNITED22_6279831.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

The difficulty here is that even though we try our best and we throw everything at the patients, it just doesn't seem to be working,\" he said.\n\nDr Halliday echoed the view that it was tougher this time around.\n\n\"It's draining.

The picture did not show her face, the court heard.\n\nThe 24-year-old unemployed Singaporean man, who cannot be named to protect the woman's identity, admitted yesterday to one count each of cheating, unlawfully distributing his girlfriend's intimate image, and electronically transmitting an obscene picture of an unknown woman.\n\nHe also admitted to an unrelated charge of snapping pictures of the exterior and interior of Bedok Police Division Headquarters - a protected place - without permission.\n\nThe court heard that his male victim, 29, was browsing through Twitter on April 4 last year and came across Regina's profile. He decided to send a message without knowing that the profile, in fact, belonged to the conman.\n\nThe offender replied, offering services including sexting and the sending of sexually charged text messages, for $200 over 48 hours.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor M. Kayal Pillay said that initially, the victim declined to pay for such services as he was facing financial difficulties. The conman, however, managed to persuade him to fork out the cash.\n\nThe victim transferred $200 to the conman's bank account later that day and continued to stay in contact with \"Regina\".\n\nThe conman then took the opportunity to tell the victim sob stories about \"Regina's\" life to get more money from him.\n\nAmong other things, he said Regina was in debt, came from a broken family and had health issues. Believing the lies, the victim transferred nearly $9,000 to the conman on 14 occasions between April 4 and May 17 last year.\n\nTHREATENED\n\n\"Regina\" later threatened to publicly shame the victim when he refused to hand over more cash. The victim finally alerted the police on May 20 last year.\n\nThe conman's girlfriend also found out last year that the offender had uploaded her topless picture online without permission.\n\nThe DPP said the woman felt \"distressed, shocked and angry\" when she found out what her boyfriend had done.\n\nThe offender's bail was set at $15,000 yesterday and he will be sentenced on March 23.\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8c5c8af39e33e9228e05557b5f25fed88b69240802c5f24675ad7f110dab38d3/gavel1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But we will roll out and push out the vaccines regardless,\" he added in a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"If you want to wait, you must accept the consequence that perhaps if you wait... and you want to take it up later on, we may not have a ready supply.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\nSingapore's nationwide vaccination effort is now well under way, with priority going to healthcare staff, as well as those working in the aviation and maritime sectors.\n\nIt has received several shipments of Pfizer's vaccine and expects to get more vaccines from other manufacturers in the coming months.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, the country will have enough vaccines for all citizens and long-term residents by the third quarter of this year.\n\nAddressing reporters to mark one year of Singapore's battle with Covid-19, Mr Wong said Singapore sends out each batch of the vaccine as soon as it gets a fresh supply.\n\n\"We are not trying to hold back or ration the supply. It's not in Singapore's interest to do that,\" he said.\n\n\"Our interest is to get as many people vaccinated as soon as possible.\"\n\nAdded Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, the task force's other co-chair: \"We are not going to reserve some for you if you decide not to be vaccinated.\"\n\nIf the scientific evidence indicates that vaccines significantly reduce the risk of transmission, the Government could make changes to existing rules, Mr Wong said.\n\nFor example, the stay-home notice period for travellers might be reduced or eliminated, while workers who currently have to undergo routine testing could have this requirement reduced.\n\nSingapore might also further relax its safe management measures.\n\nAt present, however, it is not yet known how much the vaccine can reduce the risk of viral transmission, so these tangible and concrete benefits of vaccination cannot be reaped while the information is still pending, said Mr Wong.\n\nWhen asked how the Government would convince reluctant Singaporeans to take the vaccine, Mr Gan stressed the importance of public education.\n\nFor seniors, the authorities will probably go from house to house, explaining the benefits of getting vaccinated and helping people make bookings, he said.\n\nLINETTE LAI\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nUNIQLO\n\nThis season’s must-have jeans, from curve to straight styles\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8db46050da9983fe2c28b4b042c937c67570b06359ab3a264fb9036d69340c5c/NP_20210122_LLVAX2202TO_6279485.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO: EPA"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f8589a4800d9aa5f7b8b7dc643a920973b2ddbb4da2c1ed65642777a214001c6/IMGyaohui-yhsgh-9614111S4FNUJ.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Over 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fd0fcf4c471011020b77218458fb0d15174291d6a08645a533b8dfa4874721cf/2023-02-02T094222Z132361256RC2T2Z9Q4VK0RTRMADP3HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-CHINA.JPG?w=318", "alt_text": "Beijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I really don't want to go through the same thing again.\n\n\"After recovering, I completely avoided crowded places and have had no nightlife.

There, they found out they both had contracted the disease.\n\nShe said: \"I feel so thankful to be in Singapore as it is much safer and better healthcare-wise than in the UK. I felt so privileged that I was offered a medical ward despite having only mild symptoms.\"\n\nThough the situation has improved from last year, Ms Lim warns against complacency and believes everyone must still follow the rules such as wearing masks and safe distancing.\n\n\"A lot of young people might think, 'it is okay if I get it', and that it will affect only them.

The jingle takes inspiration from the sounds of local hawker culture.\n\nMr Goh, who also wrote other songs for the Chingay Parade this year, said of his jingle: \"The year 2020 saw a lot of changes to our lives but I realised one of the things that could stand the test of time, given whatever situation, was our hawker culture.\n\n\"Bustling sounds of order-taking, clanging plates, food sizzling on heated woks all make up a symphony of sounds which was the inspiration for the jingle.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 06:16am\n\nWhen is it acceptable to address a stranger as 'uncle' or 'aunty'?\n\nMore related stories\n\nFor the challenge, participants have to video themselves dancing to the jingle with as many household items as props as possible.\n\nThey will then have to use the hashtag #hawkerculturejingle, and nominate two friends to carry on the challenge.\n\nThe top 20 most-liked videos on the platform will each win a $100 Lazada voucher.\n\nParticipants can also submit videos of themselves doing the challenge on Feb 20 between 8pm and 9pm. Submissions are to be sent on WhatsApp to 8882-1004 in the following format: full name_last four digits of NRIC_e-mail address - for example, Tan Ah Meng_321A_ahmeng@gmail.com\n\nThree winners will be selected and each will receive a staycation worth $1,000.\n\nDIGITAL FORM\n\nThis is the first time in 49 years that the annual parade will take a digital form. A tradition unique to Chinese culture in Singapore and Malaysia, the Chingay Parade is a celebration of the birthdays of Chinese folk deities.\n\nThis year's digital parade will also include events such as singing and float-building, all done through virtual submissions.\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nGet Support From The SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support Scheme\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d1fd5b72c56b86a0bddbcc5534fd68cc38e9e77501d99d95a7851f6ddb570f2c/np_20210122_wkchingay_fntl_62796662.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(Above).One of the performers at last year's Chingay.", "caption": "(Above).One of the performers at last year's Chingay.

It is part of Singapore's ongoing push to go car-lite and promote walking and cycling.\n\nThe LTA said the trial in Woodlands will give residents and students from nearby schools more space to walk and cycle.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 06:16am\n\nWhen is it acceptable to address a stranger as 'uncle' or 'aunty'?\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt will also make access to Kampung Admiralty, Admiralty MRT station and other amenities more convenient for pedestrians.\n\nResidents who spoke to The Straits Times said they welcomed the move and hoped it would make the area, which is often filled with cyclists and food delivery riders, safer.\n\nBut others wondered if the changes were necessary given they would likely cause confusion and inconvenience to motorists.\n\nMs Candy Wong, 38, who cycles home daily, said: \"It might be troublesome for drivers, but pedestrians will feel safer. Riders too.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said there is rising pedestrian footfall in the Kampung Admiralty area, which has become popular with Woodlands and Sembawang residents.\n\n\"We have the opportunity to make Singapore a greener, car-lite city through a careful and sensible balance of trade-offs,\" he said, adding that more such projects are in the pipeline.\n\nAn LTA spokesman said the stretch being repurposed has low to moderate traffic volume so pedestrianising it would not adversely affect motorists too much.\n\nBut resident Sakun Mahalingam, 35, said there can be a lot of traffic in the mornings and evenings.\n\n\"There will definitely be more jams as drivers get used to the new roads,\" she said. \"But it is a good idea. We have a lot of elderly people and young parents with kids here.\"\n\nThe trial will last at least six months for the LTA to take in feedback and monitor the impact on traffic. It said it has been exploring potential locations for road repurposing and will continue to study other suitable areas.\n\nBy\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

There is also a limit of 250 seats for the show, on a first come, first served basis.\n\nOn whether he is concerned about the recent increase in community cases, Kumar, 52, told The New Paper: \"Our Government is doing a good job. Just be more vigilant and do what you are told.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"It is great that we are all getting tested before we go (on board). We also have to make sure we practise social distancing (during the cruise) because we don't want to start a cluster.\n\n\"It is not that hard to do. Everyone has to take responsibility and work together. If everyone does their part, we can get through this together.\"\n\nHaving shifted his work online during the pandemic, Kumar found himself yearning for physical connection, and he promises to bring his A game to the high seas. The funnyman is also looking forward to time off on the cruise with some of his friends tagging along.\n\n\"I miss being onstage, and I miss talking to people and making them laugh.\n\n\"Initially it was tough (to do shows online) because I couldn't really see the people. And even if I could, their reactions wouldn't be immediate because sometimes their Wi-Fi would lag.\n\n\"During the circuit breaker, I started talking more to my dogs and home appliances. Once you start talking to home appliances, that is when you know it is time for you to leave the house,\" he joked.\n\n\"I am excited because the audience is going to be (mainly) Singaporeans and heartlanders, and my jokes can be more relatable.\n\n\"I can even talk about policies, vaccines, social distancing and all that.\"\n\nKumar encourages passengers to retire their tech devices during the one-hour show that is only for those aged 18 years and above.\n\n\"Sometimes many aunties will walk around, go to the toilet or come in late, or take videos. I think everyone should put away their phones and just enjoy the time spent there,\" he said.\n\nBy\n\nClariss Chia\n\nRead articles by Clariss Chia\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Zheng quickly became the target of public criticism, with Weibo users calling her \"irresponsible\" and \"vicious\".\n\nThe controversy has over the past three days been a top trending item on the Twitter-like site, with 600 million views and more than 100,000 comments.\n\nThousands of users also left comments on Prada's Weibo account to question and ridicule the brand for hiring her.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zheng - a popular television star known for her roles in period dramas - said on her Weibo account that she had not violated laws in either China or the US but did not comment on whether any of the accusations were true.\n\n\"It's a very sad and private matter for me,\" she said.\n\nSurrogacy is forbidden in China but going abroad to have surrogate children in countries such as the US has increasingly become an option for some Chinese couples, especially wealthy ones.\n\nThe ruling Chinese Communist Party's political and legal affairs authority also weighed in on Wednesday, saying Zheng was \"by no means innocent\" and accusing her of taking advantage of a legal loophole to pay for surrogacy abroad. - REUTERS/AFP\n\nFashion\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 3, 2025, 02:46pm\n\n'I want my sister to live': Local fashion label The Closet Lover to shut amid co-founder's health scare\n\nAug 29, 2024, 09:01am\n\nWould you spend $820 on a lollipop holder?\n\nAug 8, 2024, 09:00am\n\nAfter Hong Kong to Orchard Road, next stop: Milan and Paris\n\nApr 21, 2024, 02:21pm\n\nStar Awards 2024 Walk of Fame: Best and worst dressed\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It is such an unpredictable season.\"\n\nThrilling race\n\nThe EPL race is shaping up to be a thriller, with just eight points separating United from seventh-placed West Ham.\n\nUnited knew they had to respond after City beat Aston Villa 2-0 a few hours earlier to leapfrog Leicester City, who topped the table after their 2-0 win against Chelsea the previous day.\n\nBut the defensive discipline they showed in their goalless draw against Liverpool on Sunday was absent in the early minutes and they paid the price.\n\nUnited were punished in the fifth minute when Lookman sprang the offside trap, collecting a ball over the top from Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa.\n\nThe forward had time to pick his spot and gave Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea no chance, striking the ball into the bottom corner with his right foot.\n\nThe away side settled and were level in the 21st minute through Cavani, moments after Bruno Fernandes had hit the inside of the post.\n\nFulham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola failed to hold a Fernandes cross from the left, spilling the ball into the path of the veteran Uruguayan, who made no mistake with a left-footed finish from close range.\n\nThe increasingly influential Fernandes tested Areola from distance as United began to flex their muscles without creating many clear-cut chances.\n\nFulham made a bright start to the second period as United again struggled to find openings.\n\nBut in the 65th minute, Pogba broke the deadlock, creating space before producing an unstoppable drive past a diving Areola.\n\nThe Frenchman said he had been \"really mad\" after failing to convert a late chance against Liverpool.\n\n\"It was a beautiful goal and beautiful win,\" he said. \"It wasn't my favourite goal ever but it was still beautiful.\"\n\nAs the second half wore on, United faced some nervy moments.\n\nDe Gea was forced to make a smart save with his legs from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who blasted another chance over the bar.\n\nAnd United had their hearts in their mouths when Aleksandar Mitrovic's header deflected off Eric Bailly and inches wide of the post deep into time added on.\n\nDefeat for Fulham leaves them third from bottom, four points from safety. -\n\nAFP\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/29677511abffc722c0d92f910e797332c5f44ff291d930a3b31b2d03e73c2e54/pogba.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Paul Pogba celebrates with Bruno Fernandes after scoring Manchester United's winner against Fulham.", "caption": "Paul Pogba celebrates with Bruno Fernandes after scoring Manchester United's winner against Fulham.

Farook was not allowed by Cut or MBS to receive any form of incentive or payment from vendors.\"\n\nAccording to court documents, Musoni later approached Lim with Farook's proposal and she agreed to it. Yip was also informed of the plan.\n\nDPP Thiagesh added: \"Kathy told the accused that the company would pay performance incentives to Farook on condition he conduct sommelier training for SWC.

Dr Sahin is chief executive and his wife, Dr Tuereci, is chief medical officer.\n\nExperts said the findings were reassuring and not surprising, and results from similar studies on the South African variant would be keenly watched.\n\n\"This makes it very unlikely that the UK variant will escape from the protection provided by the vaccine,\" said specialist in virus science Jonathan Stoye from Britain's Francis Crick Institute.\n\n\"It will be interesting to carry out the same experiments with the South African variant.\"\n\nMORE DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\nBioNTech has said it plans to publish a more detailed analysis of the likely effect of its vaccine on the South African variant within a few days.\n\nAstraZeneca, Moderna and CureVac are also testing whether their respective shots will protect against the fast-spreading variants. They have not released the results of those tests.\n\nMeanwhile, some British hospitals look like war zones with doctors struggling to cope with an influx of patients, the government's top scientific adviser said, as the death toll rose by a record 1,610 people on Tuesday.\n\nBritain's total death toll is now 91,470 - Europe's worst figure and the world's fifth worst after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. - REUTERS, AFP\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nInvestor Options Most Don’t Consider\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/58afd66442ab744d22a3f2a0996cfc657da5f2b42e09a029bacb652e2bd115eb/NP_20210121_VIRUS21_6276554.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A Covid-19 information sign at a bus stop in England which reads \"Act like you've got it\".

The safe was usually closed but not locked as the locking mechanism was faulty. Grine found out about the jewellery and the safe and decided to steal some of the items.\n\nFrom Feb 2, 2019, to Jan 3 last year, she stole 21 items - including nine gold bangles, six gold chains, four rings and the Tiffany silver necklace - with a total value of $9,790.\n\nShe pawned all of the items except for the necklace at various pawnshops for $8,835. The money was transferred to her family in the Philippines.\n\nOn Jan 17 last year, Ms Rakhi discovered that a pouch in the safe she used to keep all her gold chains was empty. She made a police report four days later.\n\nThe pawn tickets were recovered from Grine's possession or the pawnshops.\n\nYesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Delicia Tan urged the court to jail the accused for eight months, saying there was a clear breach of trust.\n\nGrine's lawyer Lolita Andrew asked the court for a sentence of no more than five months. She said her client stole as she was desperate to save the life of her niece in the Philippines who had cancer.\n\n\"It was not for personal benefit, though she did indeed take the items and pawn them at the pawn shop,\" Ms Andrew said. \"These are circumstances whereby she was consumed heavily with emotion, and acted in desperate need.\"\n\nBut DPP Tan pointed out that Grine was caught with the stolen Tiffany necklace she did not pawn.\n\n\"She admitted she stole it because she wanted to wear it, which is why the item was found in her possession,\" said the DPP. \"And while she did keep the pawn tickets, it is hard to believe that the accused wanted to redeem the items (to return them).\"\n\nFor theft as a servant, she could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined.\n\nBy\n\nDavid Sun\n\nRead articles by David Sun\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Focus, a Singapore Art Week event.\n\nHe said: \"NAC intends to launch a series of engagements and partner the arts community to co-create innovative new concepts and programmes in areas such as Tanjong Pagar Distripark.\n\n\"NAC is also exploring new ideas and collaborations with existing tenants in the distripark to grow its organic development as a cluster for multidisciplinary arts as well as other ancillary services.\"\n\nNAC will identify suitable spaces in the distripark for these innovations and ideas, he added.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 7, 2024, 05:10am\n\nHow a woman holds on to her promise - and a $70m plot of land\n\nMore related stories\n\nTanjong Pagar Distripark - which already had a reputation as an edgy arts hub a decade ago - is home to exhibition venue Artspace@Helutrans and Gajah Gallery, which promotes South-east Asian contemporary art.\n\nThe Singapore Art Museum (SAM), whose buildings in Bras Basah are undergoing a major revamp, is also using the distripark for an Art Week exhibition.\n\nS.E.A. Focus, which showcases art from galleries in the region, had been held in the Gillman Barracks art enclave since its launch in 2019. This year, it runs in Artspace@Helutrans.\n\nMr Tong said of the distripark: \"With its industrial vibe and large spaces, there is tremendous potential here as a dedicated space for creatives to experiment, to produce and to exhibit their works.\"\n\nHe added: \"This area is rich in heritage and also holds special memories for the arts community as the inaugural Singapore Biennale in 2006 was held at the historic Tanjong Pagar Railway Station just next door.\"\n\nMr Tong said: \"Our cultural infrastructure - including possible art spaces such as these - can contribute greatly to our urban landscape and value-add to the lifestyle offerings for everyone in Singapore, as well as our friends from around the world.\"\n\nSAM director Eugene Tan said the museum would like to use the distripark as a venue, at least until its revamp - targeted for completion in 2023 - is over.\n\n\"The space is really suitable for what we need as a contemporary art institution. The proportions, the size of the space, just the whole feel of it. It gives us the flexibility we need to do our projects and exhibitions,\" Dr Tan said.\n\nThe museum is presenting an exhibition by artist Choy Ka Fai at the distripark till Feb 21.\n\nDr Tan said they are exploring if they can use the space for a longer period, although he stressed nothing has been confirmed.\n\nHe added that they would try to make the distripark more accessible - by offering shuttle bus services from nearby MRT stations, for instance.\n\nGajah Gallery founder Jasdeep Sandhu, whose gallery moved to the distripark five years ago, welcomed the news.\n\nHe said: \"If you look around Singapore right now, you've got little galleries like Coda Culture in Aliwal Street, the museum cluster in Bras Basah, and I think it's exciting to have another (cluster).\n\n\"It will boost Singapore's position as an arts hub in South-east Asia.

So those will be prioritised.\"\n\nWhile stressing that front-line workers and seniors are \"in front of the queue\" to be vaccinated, he said the ministry is working to see what can be done for athletes who fit the criteria.\n\n\"We're looking at how we can, as a group, prioritise them so that when they leave, when they go overseas, they can be protected with a vaccination,\" said Mr Tong.\n\n\"And of course, we want to avoid the risk of them contracting Covid when they are overseas competing because that will derail their preparations for these major Games.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 3, 2025, 12:38am\n\n100 days to go: S'pore's swimmers gear up for World Aquatics Championships\n\nMore related stories\n\nSingapore will have Olympic representatives in swimming, diving, sailing, gymnastics, shooting and table tennis, while fencer Amita Berthier and badminton players Yeo Jia Min and Loh Kean Yew are in the running to seal their tickets to Tokyo.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach said last November that vaccination would not be a prerequisite to compete in the Tokyo Games, with Mr Dick Pound, the IOC's longest-serving member, advocating priority access to vaccines for athletes to stave off the prospect of the Olympics being cancelled.\n\nThe majority of athletes The New Paper spoke to were in favour of getting vaccinated.\n\nTokyo-bound diver Jonathan Chan said: \"I'm thankful to be considered to be fast-tracked. I think it'll be important to be vaccinated before travelling.\"\n\nHe is planning to take part in the Fina Diving World Cup in Tokyo in April.\n\nPaddler Yu Mengyu, who is already in Japan competing in the T.League, said she would have no qualms about taking the vaccine as it has been tested by local health authorities.\n\n49erFX skiff class sailor Kimberly Lim said she considers inoculation \"a protection from Covid for all our travels and potential exposure\".\n\nHer teammate Cecilia Low added that while she was in favour of getting vaccinated, \"one of the factors in the decision-making would be finding time in our busy schedule to actually take the vaccine\".\n\nThe Asian Games champion pair spent three months in Portugal from last September and will return to Europe on Saturday to train and compete.\n\nShuttler Loh, who is in Bangkok for the Thailand Open, where some players and their entourage have tested positive, said seeing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong getting inoculated boosted his confidence.\n\nBut he added: \"Hopefully, there are no side effects or anything that's potentially going to harm us as a human being or as an athlete.\"\n\nBerthier, who is studying and training at the University of Notre Dame in the US, said she would want to know if foreign athletes have taken the vaccine and \"what has the outcome been\" before deciding.\n\nAnother athlete, who declined to be named, would be opting out of getting vaccinated, noting: \"I'm not yet certain of possible side effects.\"\n\nBesides vaccination, another way Mr Tong hopes to help national athletes is by trying to cater a quarantine programme to their needs when they return from overseas.\n\nHe explained: \"Another aspect of protecting our athletes is to ensure when they travel and come back, they come back to a quarantine area that can also be specially designed for them...\n\n\"Can we 'bubble' them in some way to look at training (while they're at) the facilities?

After the driver called the police and pulled up at a bus stop to wait for them, the man attacked him.\n\nMr Clement Tan, 29, a financial consultant, who was at the bus stop, saw the assault and rushed into the bus with Mr Mu'tasim and an unidentified man to pull the assailant out of the bus and subdue him.\n\nFor their public spiritedness, Mr Mu'tasim and Mr Tan were commended by the police yesterday. While restraining the attacker, the men discovered he had a knife and quickly removed it, the police said yesterday.\n\nThe man was convicted and jailed for 16 weeks on Dec 16 for voluntarily causing hurt and possessing an offensive weapon.\n\nThere were about 40 cases of assault on public bus staff last year, with half of them over mask incidents.\n\nMr Mu'tasim and Mr Tan were among 10 people presented with public spiritedness awards at Bedok Police Division yesterday. The others include Mr Pu Zong Han, who chased and detained a teenage thief at Eunos MRT Station last March, and six Singapore Civil Defence Force officers who helped to arrest a man for molesting a female passenger.\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\n\nThe Bedok Police Division Commander, Assistant Commissioner of Police Julius Lim, said at the commendation ceremony: \"The recipients of the Public Spiritedness Award exemplify the sense of community responsibility that is required for all of us during these difficult times.\n\n\"From standing up to violent bullies to chasing down sex offenders, these individuals had put their safety on the line to uphold the rule of law.\"\n\nCHARLOTTE CHONG\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b58f0be442e7d7a2a9c2923a3cb010c739210ff65cdf3ca1cdd20669d813ea77/NP_20210121_CCPOLICEESFD_6276563.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(From left) Mr Clement Tan and Mr Muhammad Mu'tasim Kassim helped pull the attacker out of the bus.

It is otherwise identical in function.\n\nThe bank said the digital token saves users the hassle of having to replace physical tokens that usually run out of battery after around five years.\n\nDBS said yesterday that a large majority of its active digital banking users are already using the digital token.\n\nIt is not known how many users are still using the bank's physical token. DBS has more than three million mobile banking users in total.\n\nDBS head of consumer banking Jeremy Soo said feedback has been positive, with customers appreciating the \"added convenience\" of the digital tokens.\n\n\"As more customers take to mobile banking, our aim is to ensure access to our services is as seamless and fuss-free as possible, without compromising on security,\" Mr Soo said.\n\n\"Digital tokens save customers the hassle of carrying around a physical token, and of being unable to access our online or mobile services should customers accidentally misplace them.\"\n\nUOB was the first bank here to introduce digital tokens to customers in 2016, while OCBC launched its digital token in 2019.\n\nUOB and OCBC stopped issuing physical tokens in 2018 and 2019 respectively, although both banks said customers can still request for physical tokens.\n\n\"OCBC vice-president of digital business Andrew Chang said the bank has made a concerted effort to nudge its customers towards adopting digital tokens, with more than half of its active digital users using the digital token now.\n\nGuides on how DBS customers can set up their digital token can be found at www.dbs.com.sg/digitaltoken\n\nLESTER WONG\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b7207d36b4dc1ec5ccaa135eca01badfb775bcc27a1044dc09134f73e2776db9/np_20210121_lwdbs21_8_6276518.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The bank will stop issuing physical tokens on Feb 1.

In Singapore, the number of cars sold is determined by the COE quota - not by economic circumstances. - THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nTransport\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 8, 2024, 11:30pm\n\nSBS Transit equips 53 buses with AEDs to boost community first response\n\nMay 31, 2024, 06:11am\n\nSMRT to extend selected train and bus services on eve of Hari Raya Haji\n\nDec 10, 2023, 04:25am\n\nCab operator Strides Premier launches spruced-up fleet, some taxis offer free Wi-Fi\n\nOct 10, 2023, 06:54am\n\nWork starts on Cross Island MRT Line Punggol extension\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/546ac235d899b2666a908a370eef04aa75d15100b8efecbae4710fc76fa0447d/file7ubozdg9ev91au2olkxg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Smart commuter hacks: How to ride the MRT like a pro", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b2e98be32a803d7784c41228676813da3c9e7eb18b0c28117c5c4a1feacef9cb/busdriver.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "SBS Transit equips 53 buses with AEDs to boost community first response", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

We have to play our football at a high level.

We need to stay calm, greedy and make good decisions and the situation will change.\"\n\nStones scored for the first time in more than three years in City's 2-0 League Cup semi-final win over Manchester United on Jan 6 and twice in a 4-0 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nKlopp said Liverpool must strive to play \"close to perfection\" to retain the title, after Leicester City reached the summit yesterday morning, replacing United who had earlier taken over from Liverpool at the top.\n\n\"It changes all the time because it's so close. That makes it a different title race this year,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to be ready. I know that in this business, only results count. The last one was good (the draw against United).\"\n\nKlopp said centre-back Joel Matip, who sustained an adductor injury last month, could feature against Burnley after returning to full training, but forward Diogo Jota is a few weeks from returning after a knee issue.\n\nFacing a Liverpool side that have struggled to score is little comfort for Burnley manager Sean Dyche.\n\n\"Struggling in their world is slightly different to our world,\" he said. \"When they are really on it, they can find goals from different places...

It blossoms as the meal continues.\n\nThe ingredients are mostly predictable but some are presented in a way that will make you whip out your phone for a social media post.\n\nThe rose beef tongue ($18) arrives as a rolled-up length of protein. Just pop it into the soup and wait.\n\nTongue is not a common addition on a hotpot menu but I love it with the mala soup because the texture and that hint of spice works.\n\nI am not a fan of the rose tofu ($8), made from soya milk and egg whites with all-natural colouring.\n\nThere is an otah version that doesn't seem to work with any of the stock, but it looks gorgeous when you slide it into the broth.\n\nThe seafood lollipop ($12) - made of minced cuttlefish and shrimp paste - fares much better, while being just as pretty.\n\nAlthough your dining experience will not be cheap, the platters are of value.\n\nThe seafood platter ($68) should feed about three and is loaded with fresh ingredients such as wild abalone, tiger prawns and scallop.\n\nYanxi also offers a small selection of snacks, such as the crispy pork ($9). Don't order too much of this because although it is good when hot, if you leave it alone temporarily to concentrate on the hotpot, it will lose its crispiness and ends up a slightly hardened mess.\n\nAfter I posted about my meal on Instagram, I started hearing about the lack of service at Yanxi.\n\n\"Wrong items\" and \"No one picks up the phone\" seem to be the common complaints.\n\nPerhaps Yanxi did not think it would be generating such interest, but I hope it adjusts soon because if it takes too long to resolve this issue, the place won't have to worry about being popular anymore.\n\nYanxi Palace Steamboat\n\n175A Chin Swee Road Tel: 8858-9711; Opens Sunday to Thursday, noon to 12.30am; Friday and Saturday, noon to 2am\n\nBy\n\nYeoh Wee Teck\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Yeoh Wee Teck\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/daa997b8a54d672ca8e891e50213c897e22606c6a07735e824eb480458f0cc09/np_20210121_yeeatsjan21_s_627513522.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(Above) The broths at Yanxi with rose beef tongue", "caption": "(Above) The broths at Yanxi with rose beef tongue TNP PHOTO: YEOH WEE TECK"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I was a molecular biologist by training so I have a huge respect for scientists, but many countries did not pay enough attention to science and that is why we are in the huge mess we are in.\"\n\nHe flew to Shanghai on Jan 23 last year - the day China imposed a complete lockdown on Wuhan to contain the virus outbreak - to celebrate Chinese New Year with his parents, both of whom had recent cancer procedures.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe recalled how he spent the holiday in confusion, frustration and anger, as panic was setting in all over China.\n\nWu, who returned to New York before the US closed off air traffic from China, said: \"It became increasingly clear that the local government had lied and suppressed whistle-blowers to conceal the outbreak.\n\n\"I grew angrier still when my grandpa was diagnosed with late-stage liver cancer soon after Chinese New Year and passed away a month later. I was unable to say goodbye to him in person.\"\n\nWhen the pandemic reached New York in late March, a shocked Wu felt as if he was reliving the Wuhan stories all over again under the Trump administration - underprepared government, lying or scientifically ignorant politicians, scared residents and exhausted doctors and nurses with no protective equipment.\n\nHe said: \"Hopefully, with the incoming Biden administration, there will be stronger leadership and a more unified response in dealing with (Covid-19).\"\n\nWu was compelled to make 76 Days because \"Covid-19 is personal\" - and his efforts have paid off. Not only did it receive universal critical acclaim, working on the project provided him with \"therapy amid uncertain times\".\n\nWhile Wu edited the film remotely and in secret from New York, his co-directors Chen Weixi, a video reporter for Esquire China, and an anonymous Wuhan reporter were risking their lives shooting footage in Wuhan hospitals.\n\nHe said: \"It was physically demanding as they had to put on multiple layers of personal protective equipment while filming.\n\n\"Emotionally, to watch people get worse and die in front of their eyes and feel completely helpless was a really traumatic experience for them.\"\n\nHe added: \"Covid-19 is not just a bad flu. It kills, and destroys individuals and families.\n\n\"I hope people can understand that one of the things that enabled Wuhan to emerge really quickly was because people were willing to show kindness to one another, and there were many medical front-line workers who made a huge sacrifice.\"\n\nBy\n\nGracia Yap\n\nRead articles by Gracia Yap\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It is estimated that between 2 and 29 per cent of Singaporeans have latent TB infections.\n\nPeople with latent TB do not experience symptoms and are not infectious, but about 10 percent of this group may develop active TB over the course of their lives.\n\nSymptoms of an active infection may include a persistent cough that lasts at least three weeks, low-grade fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss and chest pain.\n\nClose contacts of all the 18 cases have already been contacted by the Singapore TB Elimination Programme for screening.\n\nAs a precaution, patrons who visited the Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre between Feb 12 and March 25 last year will also be contacted for screening.\n\nThis will be done free of charge at the Tuberculosis Control Unit at 142 Moulmein Road.\n\nVoluntary screening will also be offered to patrons who spent prolonged periods of cumulative days at the betting centre between 2018 and March 25 last year.\n\nCHERYL TEH\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/45c9f890038cbaabd238d068d6dffdbca5406ebd15fd5e2837b1280831c6fa1b/NP_20210121_CCTB_6276531.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Voluntary screening for tuberculosis will be offered to patrons who spent prolonged duration at the Bedok betting centre between 2018 and March 25, 2020.

Close to a quarter of the new openings will be in digital roles, such as cloud developers and software engineers.\n\nMr Chan noted that Singapore's focus is not solely on the investment amount secured or the number of jobs created.\n\n\"We want to secure investments that make us a critical part of the global value chain in different industries, so that we cannot be easily bypassed, so that we have the knowledge, we have the IP (intellectual property)... to make sure that we can entrench ourselves in the global value chain.\"\n\nFor the medium to long term, the EDB's yearly targets are fixed asset investments of between $8 billion and $10 billion, total business expenditure of $5 billion to $7 billion a year and 16,000 to 18,000 new jobs.\n\nMr Chan said while Singapore is optimistic about its prospects for the year, it cannot assume the road ahead will be a \"walk in the park\".\n\n\"We also need to be mindful that things can change very quickly... we must continue to be flexible and adaptable - Government, companies and workers.\"\n\nCHOO YUN TING\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c2ce1361864943bc0a50e235ababc3e14335c2965fa942a0c0de7d01e9cb1f58/NP_20210121_YTEDB21AA_6276430.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Chan Chun Sing says Singapore must entrench itself in the global value chain so that it cannot be easily bypassed.

This is also the only vaccine approved here so far.\n\nA total of 33 people in Norway aged 75 and older died after getting vaccinated, but all were reported to be already seriously ill prior to getting their shots.\n\nDr Steinar Madsen, medical director at the Norwegian Medicines Agency, told Bloomberg: \"We can't say that people die from the vaccine. We can say that it may be coincidental. It is difficult to prove that it's the vaccine which is the direct cause,\" adding the reported deaths make up \"well under one out of 1,000\".\n\nDr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist from Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital who has taken the first dose of the vaccine, said the Norwegian case could be an \"isolated\" one as countries like the United States and Israel have vaccinated significantly more people but have not reported similar findings.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe added it is important to ensure candidates are assessed for vaccination.\n\nIn Singapore, the health authorities have advised those with severe allergy to drugs, vaccines or food not to take the vaccine, he said, adding that some of the deaths in Norway are associated with allergic reactions.\n\nDoctors interviewed said the potential consequences of a Covid-19 infection for seniors far outweigh the risks from the vaccine's side effects. This is as seniors are particularly vulnerable to complications from Covid-19 and are at a much higher risk of hospitalisation and death if they are infected, compared with younger people.\n\nProfessor Paul Tambyah, senior consultant at the infectious diseases division of National University Hospital, said: \"The best advice I can give is to talk to your general practitioner or primary healthcare doctor.\n\n\"He or she will be able to provide you with the latest data from reliable sources and advise you on the risks versus benefits and the optimal timing for vaccination.\" - THE STRAITS TIMES\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f8589a4800d9aa5f7b8b7dc643a920973b2ddbb4da2c1ed65642777a214001c6/IMGyaohui-yhsgh-9614111S4FNUJ.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Over 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fd0fcf4c471011020b77218458fb0d15174291d6a08645a533b8dfa4874721cf/2023-02-02T094222Z132361256RC2T2Z9Q4VK0RTRMADP3HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-CHINA.JPG?w=318", "alt_text": "Beijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But he chooses to place his trust in the medical professionals in Singapore to assess its safety.\n\n\"The greatest fear is fear itself. Throughout history, there are often a lot of negativities surrounding a (new) inoculation at first.\"\n\nTHERESA TAN & MALAVIKA MENON\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bb02b7dedbc0d2e22d26ebdc65714b58987e12b0628c9f6b0f692cc2c8755b83/NP_20210121_THSENIOR__6276395.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "At MWS Nursing Home - Yew Tee, about three in four of its 185 residents have been medically cleared for vaccination.

First mooted in 1998, it failed to come to fruition, leading to scepticism of the Goal 2034 project.\n\nADAMANT\n\nHowever, Mr Tong is adamant that World Cup qualification is not the sole determinant of success for Goal 2034.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 12, 2025, 02:38am\n\nSingapore U-16 boys roar back with 3 goals in 8 minutes to stun Cambodia\n\nMore related stories\n\nSpeaking at a media engagement session on Tuesday, he said: \"Goal 2034 is something that is going to be at the forefront of attention in the immediate future, partly because the FAS elections are coming up soon, so that will inevitably become a topic of discussion.\n\n\"But also because when we look at Goal 2034, I know I wore two hats, first at FAS and now at MCCY, but I see this as a broad-based objective, a broad-based goal.\"\n\nMr Tong emphasised that it's not just about qualifying for the World Cup, it has to be a long-term objective that will benefit the sport in Singapore.\n\nHe added: \"What do I mean by that? I mean if we make it to the World Cup, good, but if we don't, then I want to see, at least, that we can improve our standards.\n\n\"Our training facilities, training regimen, quality of athletes, the base of players that we have, the programmes we have in school, in the grassroots, in our CCs (community centres), all should be enhanced, the quality of coaches coming through.\n\n\"If we can't improve on all this, but yet we somehow qualify, I would not see that as success... The point I'm making today is that we got to look beyond qualification. It's got to be an objective that is grounded in longer-term sustainability.\n\n\"If we qualify in '34, we want to make sure we continue to do so in '38, '42 and so on.\n\n\"If we don't qualify in '34, then we must be in a far better position in '38 thereafter.

I felt like the time was right for a new challenge in my career... I look forward to being part of a team that consistently challenges for honours not only in Singapore, but also in Asian competitions.\"\n\nThe Sailors also unveiled 32-year-old centre-back Jorge Fellipe, who joined from Saudi Arabia second-tier side Al-Tai on a one-year deal.\n\nSailors coach Aurelio Vidmar, who has the likes of last season's top scorer Stipe Plazibat, Player of the Year Gabriel Quak, and 2019 Player of the Year Faris Ramli at his disposal, believes both Lopes and Fellipe will give the Sailors the push the team need to achieve silverware.\n\n\"We wanted top-quality players with excellent technical ability and who were comfortable with playing a possession-based game,\" said Vidmar, whose side finished third last season. - NARENDAREN KARNAGERAN\n\nBy\n\nNarendaren Karnageran\n\nRead articles by Narendaren Karnageran\n\nSingapore Football\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 10, 2025, 10:45pm\n\nLions survive late onslaught to claim first win of Asian Cup third-round qualifiers\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:01pm\n\nLion City Sailors retain Singapore Cup to cement domestic dominance\n\nMay 18, 2025, 11:06pm\n\nLion City Sailors denied at final hurdle as Sharjah FC clinch AFC Champions League Two title\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:16pm\n\nACL2 trophy is 'something beautiful to fight for', says Lion City Sailors' Hariss Harun\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a151d61221e26398084a921f73744409219b9af77b792d90db6935f3a773f033/NP_20210121_NKSOC21_6276747.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Diego Lopes.

He raced 20 times. But on 11 occasions he's finished among the top three - winning five times.\n\nAnd he's only five, so there's still a ton of racing left in him and, as if to remind the forgetful that he's still around, Quadcopter won a good trial on Tuesday morning.\n\nRidden by Marc Lerner, Quadcopter was off in a jiffy but quickly surrendered the lead to Matthew Kellady's mount, Star Of Jupiter.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThat was the order - though narrowly - when they negotiated the 600m mark and when the field fanned out for that run home, Star Of Jupiter looked to have had the jump on Quadcopter.\n\nLittle did we realise that Lerner was riding with the \"hand brake\" still in the \"engaged\" mode.\n\nA furlong out and the fun began.\n\nLerner asked his mount for an effort and Quadcopter was more than willing to oblige.\n\nTaking the bit, the son of Zoustar raced to the front and, under his own steam, he pulled away, putting daylight between himself and the chasing pack.\n\nHe went on to score by three lengths from Kellady's mount with Chicago Star finishing off the trial rather stylishly to take third.\n\nBut it was all about Quadcopter. Hardly asked to raise his game, he almost broke the one-minute mark - clocking, instead, 60.04sec for the 1,000m.\n\nTrained by Hideyuki Takaoka, Quadcopter is a last-start winner, having taken the goodies in a 1,400m race in late November.\n\nFor one who is right at home on grass - his five wins has all been on the turf - Quadcopter's win on the Polytrack on Tuesday morning was worth taking note of.\n\nAlso showing off on Tuesday morning was, well, a horse we know as Tuesday.\n\nHaving a stall's test - which he passed with flying colours - the three-year-old was another runaway winner.\n\nRidden by Louis-Philippe Beuzelin, it was at the top of the straight that he elbowed Grand Fighter out of the lead and, while they did race together for some distance, the momentum was always with Tuesday.\n\nWith 150m to the finish, Beuzelin lit the burners and Tuesday took off. Grand Fighter seemed stranded as Tuesday ran right away.\n\nHe would eventually win by almost five lengths and in a time of 60.16sec.\n\nA rising star in champion trainer Michael Clements' yard, Tuesday won once and finished second once in three career starts.\n\nThe only blemish was when he took fourth at his last start.\n\nThen again, there were excuses.\n\nTuesday raced wide for some distance and, according to Beuzelin, the horse could not finish off the race as strongly as expected.\n\nTuesday is better than that and it could pay to keep tabs on his progress.\n\nFor sure, he is going to win more races.\n\nTRIAL 1\n\n1 Cassius\n\n2 Dimesso (I Saifudin)\n\n3 Whiz Fizz (JP van der Merwe)\n\n4 Beyond Compared (F Yusoff)\n\n5 Shylock (O Chavez)\n\n6 Our Lady Boss\n\nMargins and time:\n\nShd, ½, 1½, 1¼, 2¾ (1min 1.98 sec)\n\nTRIAL 2\n\n1 Tuesday (L Beuzelin)\n\n2 Grand Fighter (R Maia)\n\n3 Circuit Flyer (Chavez)\n\n4 My Horse (CC Wong)\n\n5 Lim's Rhythm (S John)\n\n6 Auspicious Day (N Zyrul)\n\n7 Lim's Moreready\n\nMargins and time:\n\n4¾, 1¾, nk, 5½, 1½, ½ (1:00.16)\n\nTRIAL 3\n\n1 Quadcopter (M Lerner)\n\n2 Star Of Jupiter (M Kellady)\n\n3 Chicago Star\n\n4 Super Posh (Yusoff)\n\n5 Salamence (T Rehaizat)\n\n6 Harbour Approach (S Shafrizal)\n\n7 Inherit (K Hakim)\n\n8 Salvador (Wong)\n\nMargins and time:\n\n3, 3, ¾, ¾, 3, 4, 8¾ (1:00.04)\n\nTRIAL 4\n\n1 Sage (Wong)\n\n2 Golden Teak (Yusoff)\n\n3 Paletas (Beuzelin)\n\n4 Terrific\n\n5 Star Empire (Chavez)\n\n6 Lim's Unique\n\nMargins and time:\n\n4, hd, 1, 5½, 1¼ (1:00.94)\n\nTRIAL 5\n\n1 Real Efecto (John)\n\n2 Make U Famous (Chavez)\n\n3 Atlantean (I Saifudin)\n\n4 Seson\n\n5 Our Secret Weapon (PH Seow)\n\n6 Nineteen Glory\n\n7 Winning Monster (Wong)\n\n8 Take A Chance\n\nMargins and time:\n\n1, ½, 1¾, 1¼, 2½, ½, 8½ (1:00.93)\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ab865f2e7d24cfe846a9d1253862759ae6f1ba596665a1299c2e35a8ea2f304c/np_20210121_bmtrial21_62722392.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Quadcopter winning Trial 3 easily at Kranji on Tuesday.

According to a survey by Randstad Singapore, 86 per cent of respondents are motivated to upskill and reskill in the next 12 months.\n\nOur internal Sparkline data also shows there is an increase in individuals taking the initiative to reskill themselves - there has been a 144 per cent increase in registration for digital courses compared with the beginning of last year.\n\nAdditionally, reskilling offers new opportunities for those seeking a mid-career change and a path to become part of the digital workforce.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Manpower, there are more than 12,000 jobs in the information and communications technology sector to help boost a growing digital economy in Singapore.\n\nMany of the roles available are tech-lite, making them suitable for applicants with basic digital skills that can be easily acquired through supplementary courses and programmes.\n\nBusiness to embrace the digital culture\n\nA key factor to effective digital transformation is having the right tools and internal processes to support the upward mobility of talent.\n\nAnd the responsibility to promote reskilling should not fall solely on the employees, but rather be a collective effort with a top-down approach, instilling a digital culture throughout the organisation.\n\nEmployers can create opportunities for staff to reskill and upskill by first identifying the skills needed to help elevate their business operations.\n\nFor instance, digital literacy training is on the rise and has become increasingly important in a data-driven business culture. In fact, a global Gartner report noted that data literacy will become an explicit and necessary driver of business value by 2023, meaning that employers must curate the suitable training programmes or deploy the right online learning platforms to achieve these goals.\n\nBusinesses also need to have the right platforms and technology in place to encourage employees to continuously learn and maximise their potential with newly acquired skills.\n\nA strong data foundation coupled with the right implementation of technology and resources means businesses can elevate their operations and boost overall productivity.\n\nAt the end of the day, reskilling the workforce plays a huge part in supporting and building a sustainable business, as well as acting as a motivation factor for talent.\n\nFor businesses in Singapore to forge ahead, they have to have the right combination of technology and people to enable success. This is the nation's best opportunity to shape a new generation of future-forward companies.\n\nThe writer is the chief executive officer and founder of Sparkline, a homegrown consultancy pioneering in digital analytics.\n\nALEETZA SENN\n\nEmployment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 10:34pm\n\nNearly 40 employers offer 450 roles at job fair for retrenched Jetstar Asia staff\n\nJun 11, 2025, 05:29am\n\nNTUC exploring options to match retrenched Jetstar Asia staff to roles at SIA Group\n\nApr 28, 2025, 03:33am\n\nSingapore's Q1 unemployment up slightly\n\nJan 30, 2025, 11:43pm\n\nEstate cleaners give manager kickbacks for fear of losing jobs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a64d0ae4bd8642dac9fc9955f8542a5a99c42801d36846b8543b9c56792966d5/np_20210121_views21_62752352.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Sparkline's CEO Aleetza Senn.

Since then, she had lost 11 straight singles and doubles matches, including last week's 21-15, 21-15 defeat by former world champion Ratchanok Intanon.\n\nAgainst the Indonesian world No. 35 Hartawan, Yeo trailed at the midway point of both sets, 8-11 and 7-11, but both times showed an extra gear in the closing stages.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 3, 2025, 12:38am\n\n100 days to go: S'pore's swimmers gear up for World Aquatics Championships\n\nMore related stories\n\nAfter the 23-year-old levelled to 18-18 in the second set, the Singaporean former world junior No. 1 rattled off three straight points to win the match.\n\nYeo told The New Paper: \"I am aware that I did not win in a few competitions last year, but I just continued to believe in the process...\n\n\"As compared to last week, where I was a little passive, this time I took more initiative on court. From last week to today, coach Kelvin (Ho) and I also had more focus on when to build rallies and when to attack more.\"\n\nNational singles coach Ho added that Yeo had maintained her intensity and applied her game strategy well, and praised her ability to \"overcome the pressure\" during crunch time.\n\nNext up for Yeo in the round of 16 today is South Korea's An Se-young, who is ranked world No. 9 at just 18 years of age.\n\nThe last time the pair met in a non-team tournament was in the final of the Hyderabad Open in August 2019, the last of the Singaporean's three titles on the Badminton World Federation circuit.\n\nMeanwhile, the other Singaporean in action yesterday, Loh Kean Yew, lost 14-21, 21-16, 21-10 to Thailand's world No. 29 and three-time world junior champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn, 19.\n\nJust like in his 13-21, 21-10, 21-16 defeat by world No. 7 Jonatan Christie last week, the Singaporean world No. 38 was comfortably the better player in the first set before fading away.\n\nSaid the 23-year-old Loh: \"I guess I still have much more to do. For instance, I have to work on my fitness a lot more...\n\n\"It's been long since I last played with world-class players, so I think it's good to know where I stand and what to work on.\"\n\nBy\n\nDilenjit Singh\n\nSub Editor\n\nRead articles by Dilenjit Singh\n\nTeam Singapore\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 31, 2024, 11:50pm\n\nWe must carry the Team Singapore spirit forward\n\nNov 21, 2024, 10:28pm\n\nYeo Jia Min beats former world champ to reach China Masters q-finals\n\nOct 23, 2024, 11:05pm\n\nMaeder to save, invest $250,000 earned for Paris 2024 bronze\n\nOct 21, 2024, 01:17am\n\nJason Teh suffers heartbreak in Malaysia\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e1e0d78d36427f123be7fe7560157425e83a5d93e0f5befef2402f210f9f4c94/NP_20210121_DSBAD21_6276455.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Singapore's Yeo Jia Min ended her 11-match winless run with a 22-20, 21-18 triumph over Ruselli Hartawan at the Toyota Thailand Open.

There's more chance of Macaulay Culkin taking over the White House because he worked with Donald Trump in Home Alone 2.\n\nRodgers has never been shy about his aspirations to manage an elite club again, but he never said anything about a dysfunctional club, run by an absentee owner with a penchant for swinging axes like a demented woodsman.\n\nWhatever happens to Chelsea incumbent Frank Lampard in the coming weeks - or days, if Abramovich reverts to type - there is no reason for Rodgers to leave Leicester City.\n\nTo paraphrase the old George Best joke, apart from being around the top of the table with a terrific squad and coaching set-up, along with supportive and generous owners, where did it all go wrong, Rodgers?\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nIf anything, the Northern Irishman has become a victim of his early success. When he swopped Celtic for Leicester in February 2019, he was arguably taking a step down.\n\nToday, the prospect of swopping the Foxes for the blundering Blues also feels like a step in the wrong direction.\n\nEverything that feels right about Leicester feels strangely wrong about Chelsea, beginning with a sense of calming stability around the King Power Stadium.\n\nIn an astute observation, midfielder James Maddison pointed out how content the Foxes were to be operating in the shadows of the erratic giants of Manchester and Liverpool, very much out of sight and out of mind (until now).\n\nCONSISTENCY\n\nBut there's nothing unremarkable about Leicester's consistency. For the 10th time this season, they scored first and went on to win the match, a testament to Rodgers' clear-headed focus.\n\nAgainst Chelsea, he picked the same starting XI that defeated Southampton, echoing the heroics of Leicester's 2016 title-winners, who were rarely rotated.\n\nIn stark contrast, Lampard scribbled down another messy list of names on the teamsheet, making four changes to the line-up that barely defeated Fulham.\n\nHis recent tweaks on the right side of defence - opting for Antonio Ruediger and Reece James instead of Cesar Azpilicueta and Kurt Zouma - was purplexing. Neither man excelled, struggling with the fundamentals, such as marking and cutting out crosses.\n\nSchoolboy errors are becoming a way of life at Chelsea. Despite the constant tinkering, Lampard still hasn't fixed the Blues' defensive failings (they've shipped more goals than any other club in the top half, apart from Manchester United).\n\nThis is not a coincidence. A glum image captured the crucial difference between Rodgers and Lampard. For most of Leicester's comfortable win against Chelsea, Timo Werner sat on the bench: cold, bored and largely unwanted.\n\nAbramovich is not renowned for his tolerance when it comes to managers spending his money. But Lampard has lavished more than £200 million (S$361.9m) on the likes of Werner, Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech, Edouard Mendy and Ben Chilwell, and Chelsea are stalling in eighth position.\n\nChilwell proved to be an unfortunate metaphor against his former club, providing a timely comparison between old and new. His replacement at Leicester, James Justin, a quick, versatile fullback, epitomises Rodgers' outstanding scouting and recruitment process.\n\nWorking closely with sporting director Lee Congerton, Rodgers signed Justin, Youri Tielemans, Timothy Castagne and the unheralded Wesley Fofana.\n\nThe French centre-back arrived in October and the 20-year-old gem is quickly forming a dependable relationship with Jonny Evans.\n\nWith the title-winning core of Kasper Schmeichel, Marc Albrighton and Jamie Vardy still around, Rodgers has leaned on their experience, tightened up at the back, turned Harvey Barnes and Maddison into genuine England prospects and transformed the Foxes into everything that the Blues are not.\n\nLampard, on the other hand, has resorted to mumbling something about his players' inability to handle the pressure. Jose Mourinho did something similar at Chelsea. He got sacked. Twice.\n\nThat's where every managerial appointment ends at Chelsea. There are no happy endings, only degrees of disappointment.\n\nRodgers won't get his head turned. He no longer needs to think about joining an elite club. He's built one of his own.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5abb870e18572ccb092048511bd3b197895f8d9587b30346b377420c273fc9c3/NP_20210121_NEIL21_6275192.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Brendan Rodgers' Leicester City are nine points ahead of Chelsea, who finished four points ahead of the Foxes last season.

Their tipsy magic act in the second episode is great fun.\n\nYet there, concurrent to the kitsch, is the mystery. Why are they there? Is Wanda a prisoner or a jailer?\n\nNext-door neighbour Agnes (Kathryn Hahn) seems to know more than she lets on. Some conversations stand out for their incongruity.\n\nAnd each episode is loaded and packed with clues.\n\nEvery prop, every logo, the fake adverts, the songs on the radio - even the second episode's theme tune, an outwardly fun riff on the Bewitched title animation - point to sinister goings-on.\n\nHalf the fun of WandaVision will be poring over episodes (there's already a wealth of YouTube deep dives).\n\nThe biggest question with any mystery tale is: Can the big reveal stick the landing?\n\nBut until that crash into reality, it's going to be a fun ride sleuthing.\n\nHopefully, there are no massive reveals until the series properly hits screens in Singapore.\n\nScore: 4/5\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nSERIES:\n\nWandaVision\n\nSTARRING:\n\nElizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Kathryn Hahn, Teyonah Parris\n\nDIRECTOR:\n\nMatt Shakman\n\nTHE SKINNY:\n\nMarvel superheroes Wanda Maximoff (Olsen) and Vision (Bettany) move into a new home in the idyllic 1950s suburbia of Westview, but all is not what it seems.\n\nSHOWING:\n\nPremieres Feb 23 on Disney+\n\nBy\n\nJonathan Roberts\n\nRead articles by Jonathan Roberts\n\nTV\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 14, 2022, 02:24am\n\nLocal actor Mark Lee's secrets to a strong marriage\n\nDec 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: The Wheel Of Time\n\nDec 2, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: Arcane\n\nDec 2, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTV review: Hawkeye\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nTransform your home affordably with IKEA Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/afbb3d79c18a822b8f2608355e5ea5d291666b8fc52257f0591286ff6e4b12f3/wandavision_digital_keyart.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany in WandaVision", "caption": "Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany in WandaVision PHOTO: MARVEL STUDIOS"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/183d03eb6dc93af73589b37063a29516853e3e53434589cb4d1f7f11515c0c4f/file7k79ekkwghd124580258.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Star-studded period drama Pachinko follows a Korean family in Japan", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/166a98141565ea681d6e63d7f2ce5598b7959aaea9900946e58f005413d262ad/marklee.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Local actor Mark Lee's secrets to a strong marriage", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

We had made all the preparations, including installing CCTV cameras in all our 37 rooms, and passed the inspection 10 days ago. We were looking forward to reopening,\" he said.\n\nMr Per, who is treasurer of the Singapore Entertainment Affiliation representing KTV operators, said the pilot had been a small step in a positive direction for karaoke operators.\n\nHe added: \"As the rest of Singapore is opening up and people can dine in groups of eight without masks, I do not understand why two people singing karaoke with masks on and using a disposable microphone cover is still not allowed.\"\n\nCash Studio Family Karaoke's managing partner, Mr Caine Poon, said: \"It's disappointing, especially because we do not have a definite date for when the pilot will start.\n\n\"We are still paying rent and salaries, and time is not on our side.

The officer had felt feverish after returning home from work last Monday.\n\nThe para-vet's wife, 28, was the second case added to the cluster last Saturday.The third and fourth cases were linked to the cluster on Sunday.\n\nA 44-year-old police administrative officer who also works at 2 Mowbray Road had developed a dry throat on Jan 7 but did not seek medical treatment.\n\nAs part of special testing operations, he was tested last Friday and a positive result came back the next day.\n\nHis family member, also 44 and a homemaker, did not seek medical treatment despite having a fever and chills on Jan 9, and losing her sense of smell and taste on Jan 13.\n\nUpon tracing the administrative officer's contacts, MOH contacted her last Saturday and she was tested after reporting her symptoms.\n\nOn Monday, two more family members of the administrative officer were added to the cluster as the fifth and sixth linked cases - his wife, who is 43, and a 66-year-old family member.\n\nBoth did not see a doctor despite experiencing symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat, diarrhoea and losing sense of taste and smell. They were tested after reporting symptoms last Saturday and were confirmed positive on Sunday.\n\nCONCERNS\n\nYesterday, the administrative officer's eight-year-old son was confirmed positive, making him the seventh case.\n\nThe emergence of this community cluster has raised concerns about complacency setting in.\n\nSpeaker of Parliament Tan Chuan Jin on Monday warned Singapore residents against complacency during the upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations.\n\n\"In many Western countries, extensive celebrations, without paying attention to safe measures, during the Christmas holiday period also exacerbated the situation,\" he said in a Facebook post.\n\nEducation Minister Lawrence Wong, co-chairman of the ministerial task force on Covid-19, urged similar caution as the new community cases emerged.\n\nIt was a point reiterated by medical experts, who said precautions are needed as the pandemic is not over yet.\n\nSaid Dr Ling: \"This is a reminder to us all that Covid-19 is still out there, so don't let up on the masking, hand hygiene and social distancing measures.\"\n\nnp_20210120_aqcluster20new_6273419.pdf\n\nBy\n\nAng Qing\n\nRead articles by Ang Qing\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fe0ce8160577ac8c524cb2108d1a01ee624abf353036ef96d3c9494a002dfff7/np_20210120_aqcluster20new_6273419.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Local cluster linked to police para-vet as at Jan 18", "caption": "Local cluster linked to police para-vet as at Jan 18"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f8589a4800d9aa5f7b8b7dc643a920973b2ddbb4da2c1ed65642777a214001c6/IMGyaohui-yhsgh-9614111S4FNUJ.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Over 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fd0fcf4c471011020b77218458fb0d15174291d6a08645a533b8dfa4874721cf/2023-02-02T094222Z132361256RC2T2Z9Q4VK0RTRMADP3HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-CHINA.JPG?w=318", "alt_text": "Beijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But future variations could also become less transmissible and cause either more serious or less serious disease.\n\nProfessor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said the infectiousness of a virus is measured by the reproduction number R0 (R-naught), or the average number of new infections generated by each case.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe R0 of Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, is hard to calculate accurately as it has never been left uncontrolled, noted Prof Cook.\n\nExperts, however, estimate that it is between two and 2.5. This means each new infected person passes the virus on to two to 2.5 others on average, and those with the new strains would pass it on to even more people.\n\nA more infectious strain means a smaller dose of the virus will be enough to cause disease, said Prof Fisher.\n\n\"Maybe if you're being exposed to a positive case, you don't have to be exposed for as long (to catch it).\"\n\nBut existing measures such as mask wearing and hand hygiene will still be key to fighting the virus, even if they are less effective against the new strains, he said.\n\n\"The bottom line is we just have to be a lot more vigilant,\" he added.\n\nBy\n\nRei Kurohi\n\nRead articles by Rei Kurohi\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1a4cb0bc3630c31fa75dd288d649fc786eb381364a26af65933996e0157afacd/NP_20210120_RKVIRUS20YBAU_6273440.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "SARS-CoV-2 virus particles are the small, roughly- spherical structures, found on the surface of the cell, which is exhibiting elongated, rod-shaped cell projections.

They are among the 888 lanterns lighting up the precinct, said the Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng Citizens' Consultative Committee yesterday.\n\nThe 880m light-up will also feature lanterns in the shape of pomelos, blossom trees and ingots.

It will be 10m tall, depicting a golden ox surrounded by gold coins and ingots, with a riverbank and water wheel next to it representing the flow of wealth and fortune.\n\nMr Vincent Tan, who heads the light-up organising committee, told reporters yesterday the budget for this year's light-up is similar to that of previous years.\n\nHowever, with the bazaar called off and no lion dance performances, the overall budget for the Chinese New Year celebrations is lower than it used to be, he said.\n\n\"Even though events such as the Festive Street Bazaar and Countdown Party had to be cancelled to minimise crowds, visitors can still enjoy the colours, sights and sounds of Chinatown with their family and loved ones,\" he added.\n\nWhile the committee welcomed visitors to observe the light-up, it reminded them to abide by safe management measures such as wearing masks at all times and keeping 1m apart from one another.\n\nPeople can also watch the light-up ceremony from their homes. It will be streamed live on Chinatown Festivals' Facebook page on Saturday at 8pm.\n\nThe lanterns were designed in collaboration with 12 undergraduates from the Singapore University of Technology and Design.\n\nBeyond the light-up, those who celebrate Chinese New Year can also look forward to short films about Chinese New Year delicacies.\n\nThe films will be streamed on the Chinatown Festivals' Facebook page over the next two months.\n\nBy\n\nJessie Lim\n\nRead articles by Jessie Lim\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/553b20a8b5ff0a3920e4070bf9c403ea32cbb3e7c384c059b63b6832676a943b/NP_20210120_LJCHINATOWN20_6273334.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Eighty-eight ox lanterns will illuminate Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road, while South Bridge Road will also be adorned with lanterns depicting the 12 zodiac animals.

Said the TACs: \"Doing so helps promote inclusive integration, equity, and capability development among employees.\"\n\nLastly, employers should support the learning and development of employees so they can acquire skills and attributes to do their job and be considered for leadership positions in the future, said the TACs. They should also consider all qualified current employees when looking for candidates for leadership roles, they added.\n\nEmployees, meanwhile, should take up development opportunities offered by employers, including accepting overseas work assignments.\n\nSpeaking during a media conference, SBF chairman Lim Ming Yan said the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in more pressures on the employment situation in Singapore, prompting the TACs to assure Singaporeans that employers remain committed to fair hiring practices.\n\nHe was joined by several heads of TACs at the media conference, including Singapore International Chamber of Commerce chairman Per Magnusson, who said Singapore must continue to allow companies to freely recruit talent based on merit if it wants to remain competitive globally.\n\n\"We should remember that 99 per cent, or even more than 99 per cent, of all companies in Singapore actually do hire fairly... We should focus on that majority that does it right,\" he added.\n\nCHARMAINE NG\n\nEmployment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 10:34pm\n\nNearly 40 employers offer 450 roles at job fair for retrenched Jetstar Asia staff\n\nJun 11, 2025, 05:29am\n\nNTUC exploring options to match retrenched Jetstar Asia staff to roles at SIA Group\n\nApr 28, 2025, 03:33am\n\nSingapore's Q1 unemployment up slightly\n\nJan 30, 2025, 11:43pm\n\nEstate cleaners give manager kickbacks for fear of losing jobs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/34e71f5f4d28a40093b65f3c75658a19a1e3c43e2b415420972668b45de73026/NP_20210120_CNSBF20_6273317.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(From left) Association of Banks in Singapore vice-chairman John Lee, president of the Restaurant Association of Singapore Andrew Kwan; Singapore Business Federation chairman Lim Ming Yan; SGTech executive director Yean Cheong; Singapore International Chamber of Commerce chairman Per Magnusson; and European Chamber of Commerce in Singapore president Federico Donato.", "caption": "(From left) Association of Banks in Singapore vice-chairman John Lee, president of the Restaurant Association of Singapore Andrew Kwan; Singapore Business Federation chairman Lim Ming Yan; SGTech executive director Yean Cheong; Singapore International Chamber of Commerce chairman Per Magnusson; and European Chamber of Commerce in Singapore president Federico Donato.

And collective sales are still nascent, with just four smallish ones in 2020,\" noted Ms Tricia Song, Colliers International's research head for Singapore.\n\n\"We believe the Government will wait out a few quarters and monitor prices.\n\n\"In the meantime, it is sending out messages that buyers should be prudent and that prices should not continue to move up significantly before an actual economic pickup,\" said Ms Song.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Monday the Government is paying close attention to the local real estate market to ensure it remains stable.\n\nAs the economic outlook remains very uncertain, he added that \"we do not want to see the property market run ahead of the underlying economic fundamentals\".\n\nMr Heng's comments at the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (Redas) came hours after National Development Minister Desmond Lee said at a BCA-Redas seminar that the Government is monitoring the property market \"very closely\".\n\nMr Lee had urged developers to remain prudent in their land bidding, and households to exercise caution when purchasing property, given the uncertain economic outlook.\n\nRACE LEONG, BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT\n\nProperty\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 30, 2023, 08:51am\n\nProperty taxes for most homes to rise in 2024; Govt to give one-off rebate to cushion impact\n\nAug 24, 2023, 12:19pm\n\nSengkang condo resident's doormat removed for 'encroachment'\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\n29 HDB resale flats sold for at least $1 million last month\n\nNov 21, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHDB to ramp up supply of BTO flats, with demand up by 70%\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Her estate sought $13.46 million in damages while the hospital offered $20,800.\n\nMs Noor Azlin had gone for treatment at CGH and X-rays of her lungs were taken in 2010 and 2011.\n\nBoth times, the radiologist recommended follow-up consultation, but this did not happen.\n\nBy the time she was again referred to the hospital by a doctor from Raffles Medical Clinic, her tumour had grown. In spite of treatment, her cancer progressed and she died on April 1, 2019.\n\nFAILURE\n\nThe Court of Appeal's judgment in February that year said: \"But for CGH's failure to diagnose her in July 2011... we find it unlikely that the lung cancer would have progressed to Stage IIA before resection.\n\n\"It was more likely than not that she would not have suffered from nodal metastasis and any consequences that may follow.\"\n\nBy the time her appeal was heard, the cancer had already spread to her brain.\n\nBefore the assessment of damages that was released by the High Court yesterday, her estate was awarded an interim payment of $200,000 in September 2019. CGH failed three times to prevent this last year.\n\nIn deciding on the amount, Justice Belinda Ang said shortcomings in the estate's claims \"have impacted the damages recoverable\".\n\nAs examples, she said \"no evidence has been led on Ms Azlin's expected full life expectancy'' and that \"no justification has been given for the calculation\" of her medical expenses post-trial.\n\nAnd \"a pleaded claim for loss of earnings has been retained when it should have been changed to a claim for loss of inheritance\".\n\nThe amount sought by her estate was also far higher than the $6.7 million Ms Noor Azlin had originally claimed.\n\nJustice Ang said since Ms Noor Azlin had died, the claims for loss of future medical expenses, transport costs, take-home earnings and Central Provident Fund, and cost of nursing care had all dwindled.\n\nThe higher claim \"is ostensibly making up for this shortfall\", the judge added, describing it \"as simply contrived in the absence of supporting evidence, among other things\".\n\nSALMA KHALIK, SENIOR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nWhy Outdoor Roller Shades Are a Game Changer\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/542f9091d67e3586c5881c54872be3208a1c53ee2c96f823bebe9becef95a96b/NP_20210120_SKCGH_6273560.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ms Noor Azlin Abdul Rahman sought damages from Changi General Hospital and three doctors.

He said that instead of buying Ms Lim's shares, Ms Neo Choon Sian \"embarked on a campaign with others to smear the plaintiff's reputation in a blatant attempt to drive her out of the industry\".\n\nHowever, Mr Jeffrey Beh, who is acting for the defendants, said the Neo sisters found out in February 2018 that Ms Lim had unilaterally increased her stake in PCC from 40 per cent to 62.55 per cent.\n\nMr Beh said in his opening statement that when the sisters confronted Ms Lim to regularise the shareholdings, she resisted their repeated requests and proposed to be bought out.\n\nIn May 2018, Ms Lim's father-in-law died and a wake was held for five days. Ms Lim said that on the first day of the wake, Ms Neo took the opportunity to disparage her in front of others.\n\nIn June 2018, Ms Neo and Mr Heng, who is a manager at PCC, went on a tirade against Ms Lim for changing the shareholdings and for using company funds to set up PCL in her sole name and to provide for her boyfriend, Mr Ng Boon Chong.\n\nMs Lim eventually transferred shares to the sisters in PCC and PCL, retaining 40 per cent of the shares. She was removed as director of PCC in March 2019.\n\nSELINA LUM, LAW CORRESPONDENT\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ce4b0744a54d5546ff1cad9fd7ff1caf75452f722aca4d69872d7be166099cbe/np_20210120_sedefame7bdb_6273421.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ms Lim Siew Ling (left) is suing her sister-in-law Neo Choon Sian and her husband Heng Hong Hing (right) for defamation at her father-in-law's wake and on two occasions at the office of their family-owned car dealership in 2018.

With the Eastern European accent, these moments also border on Borat territory.\n\nThankfully, this culture clash comedy doesn't just fall for obvious lines.\n\nThere's a surprisingly heartfelt moment when Herschel gets to experience the simple delight of seltzer water - something denied to him in the previous century, yet created in an instant in Ben's home.\n\nIt's small moments like these that help steer him away from being just a cartoon.\n\nThe film does have a problem in that it dithers about the exact story it wants to tell, flitting across scenarios without fully landing on one.\n\nAt times it feels like a series of sketches and you're just here to be buffeted along to the conclusion.\n\nThat said, Rogen's excellent performances make An American Pickle worth spending time with.\n\nAN AMERICAN PICKLE (PG13)\n\nBy\n\nJonathan Roberts\n\nRead articles by Jonathan Roberts\n\nMovies\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It was not until 11 March that WHO used the term,\" the report said.\n\n\"The global pandemic alert system is not fit for purpose\", it said. \"The World Health Organisation has been underpowered to do the job.\"\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the US has accused the WHO of being \"China-centric\", which the agency denies.\n\nEuropean countries led by France and Germany have pushed for addressing the WHO's shortcomings on funding, governance and legal powers.\n\nThe panel called for a \"global reset\" and said that it would make recommendations in a final report to health ministers from the WHO's 194 member states in May.\n\nChina defended its handling of the pandemic but said it would \"strive to do better\".\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying yesterday said Beijing had imposed early measures, including the announcement of a hard lockdown on Wuhan weeks after the virus was detected, that had \"reduced infections and deaths\".\n\nMs Hua said at a regular press briefing that while \"we should of course strive to do better,\" that did not mean China's response had been inadequate.\n\n\"As the first country to sound the alarm against the pandemic, we took prompt and decisive measures even though we had incomplete information at the time,\" Ms Hua said.\n\nChina yesterday reported more than 100 new cases for a seventh day.

And so I binged.\n\nThe eight-episode reality TV series on Netflix centres on the super rich in Los Angeles and the people who hang around them.\n\nIf you know about the Instagram and TikTok account Influencers In The Wild, Bling Empire is like that, on loop.\n\nThe rivalry between two socialites - Anna Shay and Christine Chiu - is at the heart of the show, with penniless Korean male model Kevin Kreider providing the \"reality\" and narrative from an outsider's point of view.\n\nCirculating around them are DJ Kim Lee, TV and movie producer Kelly Mi Li (who is in a predictable on-off relationship with a Power Ranger), flamboyant real estate developer Kane Lim (his billionaire dad is in oil and gas), denim empire heiress Cherie Chan and rising fashion star Jaime Xie.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 24, 2022, 10:00pm\n\nStar-studded period drama Pachinko follows a Korean family in Japan\n\nMore related stories\n\nThere are lots of diamonds and couture, childbirth, fortune-telling and existential crises to get through, and (mostly regressive) lessons on expected Asian behaviour weaved in.\n\nIt seems like a wild ride but comes across as hollow. Situations the cast go through feel forced and the conversations scripted.\n\nThe feud between Shay and Chiu also fizzle out. Showing each other up with diamonds and sexy yoga? Yawn. Give me a brawl worthy of The Real Housewives Of Atlanta.\n\nBut there are some positives.\n\nIn many areas around the world, so many see a Chinese person as the image of an Asian.\n\nIn Bling Empire, there is some level of diversity. There is a Japanese/Russian (Shay), Vietnamese (Lee), Taiwanese (Chiu) and people from China.\n\nEven Singapore is represented, thanks to Lim (who may or may not have been overly enthusiastic about his cheek fillers).\n\nThen there is Xie, the daughter of tech billionaire Ken Xie. I love this quirky girl for her one-liners, delivered with a bewildered face and her amazing wardrobe. She needs her own show.\n\nAs the series wound down, I waited for a twist or some sort of redemption, but got nothing.

That helps explain why it seems to be spreading around 50 per cent quicker than previous versions, leading South African epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim said.\n\nThe 501Y.V2 variant was identified by South African genomics experts late last year.\n\nIt has been the main driver of a second wave of infections in the country, which hit a new daily peak above 21,000 cases earlier this month.\n\nIt is one of several new variants found in recent months, including others first discovered in England and Brazil, which scientists worry are hastening the spread of Covid-19.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S. Korea protest against vaccine pass rule for kids\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Convalescent serum studies suggest natural antibodies are less effective,\" Professor Abdool Karim said introducing the research, but current data suggest the new variant is not more severe.\n\nBritish scientists and politicians have expressed concern that vaccines currently being deployed or in development could be less effective against the variant. Scientists said there was not yet a clear answer to that question and that studies were continuing.\n\n\"We have reason to be concerned because the virus has found a way to escape from previous antibodies,\" virologist Alex Sigal at the Africa Health Research Institute said.\n\n\"The world has underestimated this virus. This virus can evolve, it... is adapting to us.\"\n\nEarlier, South African researchers said that since vaccines induce a broad immune response, it was unlikely the mutations in the spike protein of the variant would completely negate their effect.\n\n\"Our immune systems are extraordinarily clever,\" team member Willem Hanekom said.\n\n\"There may be compensation through other arms of the immune system that allow vaccines to still work.\"\n\nThe 501Y.V2 variant has spread to nations in Europe, Asia and the Americas, as well as several other African countries. - REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2483d7acca2c963171b3516bf0c10580864d59ad049551c8feac4b4b879927be/NP_20211210_PROTEST10_7055858.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Parents' groups in S.

It was an inspiring piece of work from the five-year-old, whose earnings from 13 starts have surpassed the $300,000 mark.\n\nSurpass Natural looks the type who can improve even further. However, he's been asked to carry 58kg which means he'll be giving some handy kilograms to his rivals on Saturday.\n\nAnd, it's a mighty competent field which includes the likes of Fame Star, Grand Koonta and Nowyousee.\n\nBut, in the past, Surpass Natural has carried big weights - 59kg and 58.5kg - and won races. He might just defy topweight and do a race-to-race double. It'll be tough but it's not beyond his capabilities.\n\nAlso impressive on the training track was Luck Of Master. Noh Senari did the steering when he breezed over the 600m in a fast 35.5sec.\n\nA four-time winner from 15 starts, Luck Of Master has been a good horse for trainer Desmond Koh. Last time out, which was some 11 days ago, Luck Of Master ran a decent race, finishing fifth - some three lengths behind the winner Vittoria Perfetta.\n\nKoh has found a winnable sort of race for this chestnut gelding, who has won over Saturday's race distance of 1,800m.\n\nThat was four starts back in October and, on the day, he came from near last at the 250m mark to put his rivals to the sword.\n\nLike Surpass Natural, Luck Of Master must also defy topweight to put another win on the board. Aside from the 59kg that he must carry, there's nothing else to suggest he cannot win.\n\nThe same could be said of Lucky Imperator, who will see action in the Class 4 Division 1 sprint over the 1,400m.\n\nFrom Lee Freedman's yard, he had Rosman Iskandar in the saddle when working over the 600m in 37.2sec.\n\nOwned by the Lucky Unicorn Stable, Lucky Imperator was a winner over the 1,400m on Nov 15 and, following that, he ran second to Whistle Grand over the same trip.\n\nSaturday's assignment will be his first for the 2021 season and, on the back of yesterday's work, he should turn in a good show.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

When one or two things drop a little, it is difficult to get it.\"\n\nDespite still challenging for trophies in four competitions, Guardiola has ruled out making any more additions to his squad in the January transfer window.\n\nA run of eight straight wins in all competitions has reinstalled City as favourites for the EPL title and they can move top of the table for the first time this season when they host Aston Villa tomorrow morning (Singapore time).\n\nVilla's senior players will be in action for the first time since a coronavirus outbreak closed the club's training ground nearly two weeks ago, causing games against Tottenham Hotspur and Everton to be postponed.\n\nVilla manager Dean Smith said he was taken aback by the speed of the coronavirus outbreak at the club but added there would be no excuses as they prepare to return to action.\n\nNine players and five employees tested positive for Covid-19 and the club's training ground was closed.\n\nSmith's side, in 11th place, now find themselves at least two games behind the rest of the league and four fixtures behind some teams.\n\n\"Experience has taught us that it can hit you very quickly, but I'm very thankful that our doctor was quick to deal with it,\" he said yesterday.\n\n\"I'm not going to make any excuses - the players are ready to play. We are looking forward to this game and we don't feel that we are handicapped.\n\n\"We'll have had a three-day build-up for the Manchester City game. The first day was almost like the kids' first day back in the playground and they were full of energy and enthusiasm.\"\n\nVilla now face a gruelling schedule of six games in 18 days, starting with the trip to the Etihad.\n\n\"The players that I've got here have got that hunger and desire to play football games,\" Smith said.\n\n\"I'm sure the majority of them would admit that six games in 18 days is better than 12 days on the training ground.\" - AFP\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Liverpool were the latest to limit the spaces that he routinely occupies.\n\nDowngrading him from a preferred No. 10 position to that centralised midfield role in such encounters means that he must work harder, instead of smarter.\n\nBut tomorrow morning's trip to Fulham offers a chance for him to be unshackled once more.\n\nUnited's new-found status as flat-track bullies is indisputable, with the anomaly of an opening-day humiliation by Crystal Palace constituting their sole dropped points against teams residing in the bottom two-thirds of the EPL table in this campaign.\n\nAffording Fernandes a free rein in the game with the lowly Londoners is a perfect opportunity to provide a much-needed confidence boost - as well as ensuring history does not repeat itself ahead of facing Liverpool in the FA Cup fourth round on Monday morning.\n\nIf United are serious about sweeping all before them, Solskjaer needs to start learning to again help, rather than hinder, the one Red Devil capable of making it truly attainable.\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He knows he might be laughing all the way to the English Premier League title.\n\nManchester City are coming. They're quickening their stride and preparing for a finishing kick. In a weary season mired in its own mediocrity, City look the least mediocre.\n\nIf that sounds like damning the title challengers with faint praise, then take stock of where we really are.\n\nLiverpool and Manchester United's dull draw was only the latest anti-climactic example of a tiring season littered with erratic performances in silent stadiums.\n\nLiverpool haven't scored in three league games and still remain in the title race. United spent much of the contest - and the season - sheltering behind the ball and still remain in the title race.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nAnd Leicester City may be the poster boys for consistent inconsistency, beating the likes of Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur, whilst losing to Aston Villa and Fulham. They still remain in the title race.\n\nWith a title race like this, who needs a relegation battle?\n\nPECULIARITIES\n\nIt's easy to be flippant, but the decision to persist with a gruelling fixture list during a pandemic means the peculiarities cannot be ignored. They will decide the title.\n\nFor example, the strain on Liverpool's resources, thanks to the ongoing loss of matchday revenue, has clearly affected the spending plans of a club with no fit centre-backs.\n\nJordan Henderson and Fabinho performed heroically in defence, but the Reds pulled two midfielders from the line-up, which removed an established link between the lines, cutting supply to those sputtering forwards.\n\nThe Reds' front three are undoubtedly struggling, but a different formation, style and tempo have been imposed upon the club out of frantic necessity.\n\nThiago Alcantara, a sublime master in possession, may eventually encapsulate Liverpool's Plan B. But it's too much to ask him to execute a new blueprint overnight with a patched-up defence and exhausted forwards.\n\nIndeed the theme of sagging strikers is hardly unique to Liverpool. At United, Marcus Rashford failed the No. 9 audition again, either drifting offside or losing possession. On Rashford's left, Anthony Martial reasserted his status as the club's baffling enigma.\n\nThe Frenchman meandered towards his inevitable substitution within an hour.\n\nLeicester's Jamie Vardy and Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus also endured off-nights, despite the convincing victories of their respective clubs.\n\nIf only there was something to explain the sudden lethargy among players whose entire game is built around bursts of speed at regular intervals.\n\nMaybe something happened to deny them regular rest and stop their managers from using - or buying - other strikers of a similar calibre.\n\nCovid-19 is forcing every club to mostly make do with existing resources in the hope that the foundation holds.\n\nAnd at the Etihad Stadium, that foundation is built on stones. As comeback stories go, the rise and fall and rise again of John Stones is one of the finest.\n\nA year ago, the Englishman had fallen behind Fernandinho, a midfielder, in the pecking order of centre-backs. Now, he seems irreplaceable.\n\nStones' first league goals for City against Crystal Palace in a 4-0 win were arguably less important than another clean sheet - his fifth in six games alongside Ruben Dias. Between them, they've conceded just once in 10 matches in all competitions.\n\nGuardiola still has No. 9 problems. Jesus spent more time running out of the Palace box than towards it and Sergio Aguero is no longer the force he once was.\n\nBut City's newfound defensive solidity gives them a marginal edge over their rivals and a confidence to attack with greater intensity.\n\nUnlike Liverpool, who still look inhibited without the calming presence of Virgil van Dijk, City are rediscovering some of their characteristic swagger, safe in the knowledge that Dias and Stones are on hand if a move breaks down.\n\nKevin de Bruyne looks close to his best, spraying works of art across the pitch like Banksy let loose with a stencil set. The Belgian picked up his 100th assist for City against Palace.\n\nEven Raheem Sterling seems liberated again.\n\nThey are not quite the Citizens of old, but a repeat of yesteryear's heroics is virtually impossible in front of a virtual crowd.\n\nBut Guardiola's men appear the most stable in an unstable season. It's always easier to make a case for the best defence.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dc6d369e3e038cafad2350db98b2bea4bf7d6946193c851861005bbcb8c4cf73/NP_20210119_NEIL19_6270534.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Manchester City centre-back John Stones (in light blue) gets two goals in his side's 4-0 EPL win over Crystal Palace.

The sports fraternity is one of seven functional groups, such as social service organisations and tertiary education institutions, invited to submit candidates for the role.\n\nChay's name was floated late last year and, after some deliberation, it was the Covid-19 pandemic that convinced him that he had causes to champion in Parliament House.\n\nHe said: \"What made me decide was really the Covid-19 situation and how sport actually has an important part to play...\n\n\"Sport is that vehicle for social change. Sport can really ignite and rally a nation.\n\n\"We've seen that with Joseph Schooling... at the Olympics. We've seen that every time our Team Singapore athletes wear our national colours.\n\n\"There's something intangible that sport has. And when you participate in... mass participation (sports) events... you not only build that mental resilience when you go through a process of training... (and) achieving goals, you also go through that (process of) physical resilience.\n\n\"With Covid-19, we see a lot of social isolation, a lot of mental health issues and really sports can be that vehicle to help people out of these situations.\"\n\nBesides Yip, another person Chay sounded out when he was ruminating about becoming an NMP was ex-national fencer and triathlete Nicholas Fang.\n\nVARIED PORTFOLIO\n\nFang, 45, who served as an NMP from 2012 to 2014, believes that the former Olympian is well suited to be the voice of the sports community because of his varied portfolio.\n\nAfter a swimming career that yielded multiple SEA Games golds, a Sportsman of the Year gong and outings to the Athens and Sydney Games, Chay has built up a diverse CV.\n\nIt features chef de mission appointments at two major Games, chairmanship of the Singapore National Olympic Council Athletes' Commission and a stint as the chief executive of the Singapore Hockey Federation.\n\nHe is also currently the director of administration at the Global Esports Federation.\n\nChay is also a sports business owner, serving as director of swim school X Lab Pro and, beyond the sporting arena, he was the chief executive of Coleman College for over seven years.\n\nSaid Fang: \"When he speaks about sports, he genuinely has looked at it from the entire spectrum - from an athlete to an administrator to a business owner and he has contributed a lot of his time as a volunteer...\n\n\"He can see it from a very holistic point of view... and he'll be able to share the benefits of this experience with other members of the House. We can all agree that sports doesn't necessarily have the highest profile at the national level.\"\n\nChay said he wants to highlight the plight of a sports sector badly hit by Covid-19; the importance of sport being a safe and inclusive space; and the potential to harness e-sports as a platform to engage youths and position Singapore as a global e-sports hub.\n\nBeyond sport, he also hopes to champion the accessibility and funding of SkillsFuture courses to help Singaporeans remain employable.\n\nBy\n\nDilenjit Singh\n\nSub Editor\n\nRead articles by Dilenjit Singh\n\nOTHER SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 8, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHill wary of past final race controversies\n\nDec 7, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nThird time's the charm for world No. 2 paddler Sun Yingsha\n\nDec 1, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nKey figure skating event hit by Covid fears\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nEx-pro footballer among 8 teacher-coaches given awards\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/81bb29c94f47b0b74c422e0a533d4b77736097ba834d756b20b124c86fae0d62/NP_20210119_DSCHAY19_6270619.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mark Chay and ex-NMP Yip Pin Xiu, who encouraged him to be an NMP.", "caption": "Mark Chay and ex-NMP Yip Pin Xiu, who encouraged him to be an NMP.

This season will be a tough race for the top four.\"\n\nThe German also said there are no easy answers to why Liverpool have failed to score in three consecutive league games for the first time in 16 years, which have contributed to a run of four league games without a win.\n\n\"We always missed chances, even in the games we won, we just had another one...\" said Klopp, who felt his side deserved to win.\n\n\"You have to create and create and create, then you will score.\"\n\nUnited manager Ole Gunnar saw the draw as a \"missed opportunity\" to extend their two-point lead at the top, as they look to win the title for the first time since 2013.\n\n\"It's only a good result if we win the next game... We grew in the game and towards the end it was there for us to win,\" he said.\n\n\"We created two massive chances through Bruno (Fernandes) and Paul (Pogba), it was two brilliant saves by the goalkeeper (Alisson Becker).\n\n\"It's not just the result we're disappointed with, it's some of the performances. I know these boys can play better. We have improved and progressed.\"\n\nFormer United captain Roy Keane does indeed feel that the Red Devils have made progress, but added that for them to emerge EPL champions, they have win these kind of games.\n\n\"To even discuss that United are at the top of the table... there's been real progress,\" Keane, who won seven EPL titles with United, told Sky Sports.\n\n\"If you want to win the league, you have to win these tight games.

A doctor answered and told me that she was in the hospital. I was very shocked and scared.\"\n\nSong Ching and his 15-year-old sister then went to the hospital where they met their relatives.\n\nSong Ching had wanted to discuss his future plans with his mother on the night of the accident.\n\n\"She was happy with my results. We thought I was not going to do well, but it was good enough for me to apply for the course I want.\"\n\nHe said his mother had always given him the freedom to choose his own path in his education and would be happy as long as he was happy.\n\nMs Or's younger sister, Ms Samantha Or, 42, said a scan had revealed severe swelling in the brain, and the doctor told the family - including their parents in their 70s - that she was in critical condition.\n\nWhen asked, they agreed to donate Ms Or's organs, including her kidneys, liver and corneas.\n\nSong Ching said: \"This is something that we knew my mother would have wanted. She was a generous person who liked to help others.\"\n\nRecalling his mother fondly, Song Ching described her as an active person who loved nature and the outdoors.\n\nMs Or enjoyed rearing caterpillars at home - up to 50 at a time - and releasing them as butterflies, he added.\n\nShe actively volunteered at the Bukit Panjang Butterfly Garden, which was set up in 2013.\n\nSong Ching said his mother also enjoyed sculpting balloons.\n\nWorking as a freelance balloon sculptor, she provided services to schools and private celebrations.\n\nSome friends who sculpted balloons with Ms Or built a butterfly-themed sculpture comprising 3,000 balloons for her wake.\n\nOne of them, who wanted to be known only as Ms Wong, said: \"It is a good way to send her off.\"\n\nMs Samantha Or said her sister always kept herself busy, and her latest interest was baking.\n\nThe Singapore Armed Forces defence executive officer said: \"She always wanted to upgrade herself and learn new skills.\"\n\nThe police said a 69-year-old male lorry driver had been arrested for careless driving causing death. Investigations are ongoing.\n\nThe younger Ms Or said her family has forgiven the driver for the fatal accident.\n\nShe said: \"It was difficult for our family, but we are doing what my sister would have done. She was forgiving and helpful.\"\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nACCIDENTS FIRE FLOOD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nOtter attack leaves man with more than 20 wounds\n\nNov 29, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nFour people, including two kids, taken to hospital after PMD fire\n\nNov 22, 2021, 10:00pm\n\n200 evacuated after fire breaks out at Shaw Centre eatery\n\nNov 21, 2021, 10:00am\n\nCertis officers among group who lifted car, helped victims in accident outside Parliament House\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of connectivity with 5Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4becd7352ae36caf54c10215a93531f91f146c4b81d79c059a2eb187e27ddf88/NP_20210119_SDDONOR19A_6270646.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ms Or Cheng Khim, 52, a pre-school teacher's assistant, freelanced as a balloon sculptor, providing services to schools.

Passenger traffic at Changi saw a 98 per cent year-on-year decline in November last year.\n\nIf a substantial number of aviation and maritime workers are vaccinated, \"whoever comes through will know that it is safe, (that) our people are cohesive and we work as a team\", Mr Ong said.\n\n\"This is a huge advantage in terms of our brand name,\" he stressed.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Singapore Airlines (SIA) can be the first vaccinated international airline of the world.\"\n\nInoculating front-line workers will also protect Singapore, he added, noting that while the situation here is under control, the virus is \"raging like wildfire\" abroad.\n\n\"All our 37,000 front-liners, they're defenders of our borders because the borders are a key vulnerability,\" he said, as he urged these front-liners to step forward.\n\nThe T4 centre will vaccinate up to 2,000 people a day and capacity can be further expanded, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) in a statement.\n\nPriority will be given to 20,000 front-line workers, including cabin crew, cleaners, security screeners and baggage handlers, who may come into contact with travellers from high-risk countries, as well as their belongings.\n\nThe vaccination centre at Raffles City Convention Centre, where maritime workers get their jabs, will inoculate 1,000 people a day.\n\nThe Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said more than 10,000 port workers, harbour pilots, cargo officers, and marine superintendents will be vaccinated by the end of the month.\n\nMr Ong said there will be some workers who are reluctant to take the vaccine, due to personal considerations. But the majority are willing to step forward, he said, adding: \"So just start vaccinating those who are willing first, and over time, I think, the momentum will grow... As of now the national policy remains that we are not making it compulsory, even at the sectoral basis.\"\n\nMr Ong, SIA chief executive Goh Choon Phong and Mr Alex Hungate, president and chief executive of Sats, got their jabs yesterday.\n\nFOR MORE, READ THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nBy\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bf17de4855d936dcee9a5a1bdc9fdb992d379e2b95fa989b1b31bf4eb7f7ac39/NP_20210119_YFVACCINEFDZ3_6270464.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung interacting with front-line workers from the aviation industry who have registered for vaccination against Covid-19 at Changi Airport Terminal 4.

The nurse told Ihsan, who approached the patient and sprayed hand sanitiser on his face three times. He also tried to hit the victim with his elbow.\n\nThe victim, a long-term patient who had been diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia, later created a disturbance in the lounge. The accused, along with two other colleagues, restrained him.\n\nAs they were doing so, the victim became agitated. Ihsan then punched him in the face twice and kicked him in the shin.\n\nThe victim suffered bruising around his right eye and the accused reported the injuries to IMH management.\n\nThe victim was taken to Singapore General Hospital, where he was found to have suffered bruising and a toe fracture.\n\nA human resource manager at IMH made a police report five days later, stating that the accused and his two colleagues who helped restrain the victim had physically assaulted the patient.\n\nIhsan was terminated as an IMH employee on Jan 9 last year.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Phoebe Tan urged the court to jail the accused for 10 weeks, saying he abused the trust placed in him.\n\nSpeaking through an interpreter, Ihsan asked for leniency, saying he had a family in Johor Baru depending on him.\n\nDistrict Judge Teo Guan Kee said nothing in his mitigation justified a reduction in the sentence asked by the prosecution.

The gains were led by specialised machinery, non-monetary gold and measuring instruments.\n\nThe bulk of the specialised machinery shipments went to South Korea, in line with robust global semiconductor demand.\n\nNon-monetary gold exports were helped by the spike in the precious metal's international price, which rose above US$1,900 (S$2,530) per ounce last month amid reports of stimulus measures in the United States.\n\nA new wave of lockdowns in Britain also lent support to the safe haven asset's demand.\n\nOVAIS SUBHANI, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

If successful, this dashboard project will be extended to all developers.\n\nOther issues require sustained investment and effort over many years to yield an impact, he added.\n\nRedas president Chia Ngiang Hong, who also spoke at the event, called last year a \"time of awakening\" for the industry.\n\n\"Some businesses will have to think anew about how best to crisis-proof their operations and strategise sustainable business practices that can prepare them for the new normal and take them to a better future,\" he added.\n\nLINETTE LAI, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\n\nProperty\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 30, 2023, 08:51am\n\nProperty taxes for most homes to rise in 2024; Govt to give one-off rebate to cushion impact\n\nAug 24, 2023, 12:19pm\n\nSengkang condo resident's doormat removed for 'encroachment'\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\n29 HDB resale flats sold for at least $1 million last month\n\nNov 21, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHDB to ramp up supply of BTO flats, with demand up by 70%\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Financial institutions that do not allocate sufficient financial resources may be more open to unknown third-party suppliers,\" he said.\n\nThe hacking of Texas-based SolarWinds, a leading provider of IT management software, had subjected hundreds of thousands of firms and government entities around the world to risks.\n\nSolarWinds' IT management tools are common components in the products of many large vendors including Microsoft, FireEye and Cisco Systems.\n\nAn assessment of third-party suppliers was previously not required under the MAS Technology Risk Management (TRM) guidelines, although due diligence on technology vendors was a must.\n\nThe screening of component suppliers is now clearly spelt out in the revised TRM guidelines, which cover a wide range of topics to help firms fend off and recover from cyber attacks and system failures.\n\nThe guidelines elaborate on the mandatory requirements set out in the MAS TRM notice, which carries a fine of up to $100,000 for non-compliance under the Banking Act.\n\nIn the case of a continuing offence, a further fine of up to $10,000 daily may be levied.\n\nIRENE THAM, TECH EDITOR\n\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He also blasted vaccine manufacturers for chasing regulatory approval in rich countries rather than submitting their data to the WHO to green-light vaccine use globally.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the WHO executive board meeting, Dr Tedros said 39 million doses of coronavirus vaccines had been administered in at least 49 higher income countries.\n\nMeanwhile, \"just 25 doses have been given in one lowest income country. Not 25 million; not 25,000; just 25,\" said the WHO director-general.\n\n\"I need to be blunt. The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

He said 44 such deals were struck in 2020 and at least 12 have been signed this year.\n\n\"The situation is compounded by the fact that most manufacturers have prioritised regulatory approval in rich countries where the profits are highest, rather than submitting full dossiers to WHO,\" he said.\n\n\"Not only does this me-first approach leave the world's poorest and most vulnerable people at risk, it's also self defeating.\n\n\"Ultimately, these actions will only prolong the pandemic, prolong our pain, the restrictions needed to contain it, and human and economic suffering.\"\n\nThe WHO has only approved emergency use validation for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and Dr Tedros urged other manufacturers to come forward with their data for regulatory review.\n\nCovax, the WHO co-led globally-pooled vaccine procurement and distribution effort, has struck agreements with five manufacturers for two billion vaccine doses.\n\nIt aims to secure vaccines for 20 per cent of the population in each participating country by the end of the year, with funding covered for the 92 lower- and lower-middle income economies involved. - AFP\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

They will be dealt with at a later date.\n\nHe had molested her in mid-2016 by hugging her tightly.\n\nThe woman became \"emotionally traumatised\", to the extent that \"the mere mention of his name\" or an e-mail from him would cause her to \"freak out\".\n\nHEALTH PROBLEMS\n\nAt the end of 2016, she developed a \"host of serious health problems\", including a persistent cough that affected her lungs, heart palpitations and a chronic migraine.\n\nShe even became suicidal at one point, the court heard.\n\nThe offence came to light when in March 2018, the older woman suddenly asked the younger woman if she had a problem with him \"touching her\".\n\nThe younger woman then claimed that the man had also touched her in a similar way.\n\nThe pair had a meeting with their seniors on March 28, 2018, and the police were alerted.\n\nThe man's bail was set at $15,000 and the pre-trial conference for his remaining charges will be held on Feb 8.\n\nFor molestation, an offender can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned.\n\nThe man cannot be caned as he is over 50 years old.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8c5c8af39e33e9228e05557b5f25fed88b69240802c5f24675ad7f110dab38d3/gavel1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He clocked a smart 1min 10.22sec, despite a slow sectional of 25.53sec for the first 400m.\n\nDeputising for Clements, assistant trainer Michael White was clearly a relieved man at the winner's circle. But he stood by his spontaneous assessment that Starlight is one of the best he has dealt with at Kranji.\n\nThe Australian also reiterated his fears about the flip side of the exciting prospect - his jittery mannerisms.\n\n\"I'm still very nervous when he heads out there. He's still nowhere near the finished article. We haven't done much with him and he still doesn't know what he's doing,\" said White.\n\n\"But he's beaten a handy horse in Be You. The day his brain is linked to his engine, he'll be a much better horse.\n\n\"With time, he will get longer and I believe he doesn't necessarily have to lead. When he learns to relax, I think he'll be a good chaser.\n\n\"But, from barrier two, we took advantage of his good gate speed to let him dictate.\"\n\nWhite was equally impressed with Sincerely, who stepped up on his third behind Super Dynasty in the Group 3 Colonial Chief Stakes over the Poly 1,600m to take the $85,000 Class 2 race over 1,400m on turf.\n\nBut he admitted the low handicap - 48.5kg after leading apprentice jockey Hakim Kamaruddin's 1.5kg claim - was the decisive factor.\n\nAfter travelling just behind Nepean and Muraahib, the Falcon Racing No. 7 Stable-owned Sincerely hit the front 150m out for a 1/2-length win from the late-closing Per Inpower in a good 1min 21.77sec.\n\n\"This horse has really improved. He ran well in the Colonial Chief Stakes,\" said White.\n\n\"He had a few issues when he first came, but the thing we found about horses from Europe is they need about 12 months to run to their best. So, the long time off was a blessing to him.\n\n\"The distance was a bit of a concern today, as he's more of a miler, but the 48.5kg helped him. That gave him a licence to burn up early when he sat behind the lead.\n\n\"Hakim rode a clever race by putting him in a handy spot throughout. He needs more ground. I think he can even go up to 2,000m.\"\n\nIt was Sincerely's second success in six starts.

Messi's goalbound effort was blocked, falling to the feet of forward Antoine Griezmann, who netted the first of his two goals.\n\nBilbao responded as Oscar de Marcos met Inaki Williams' cross two minutes later to send the sides  level at half-time.\n\nHowever, France international Griezmann looked to have won it for the Catalan side with a goal against the run of play 13 minutes from time, only for substitute Villalibre to volley home in the 90th minute to send the game into the extra period.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nThree minutes into the additional half hour, Williams curled a stunning effort into the far corner from the edge of the box to give Bilbao the lead for the first time in the tie.\n\n\"What a goal it was,\" said a beaming Bilbao coach Marcelino.\n\n\"It was a great piece of skill and you couldn't produce a better finish. In general, I don't think Barca deserved to take the lead, especially in the first half, anyway.\n\n\"The lads were so focused on this game and I'm so proud of them. They make your job easy and enjoyable.\"\n\nMarcelino was named as coach only this month after Gaizka Garitano was dismissed and the 55-year-old has now beaten Barca in the last two finals they have reached after his success over them with Valencia in the 2019 Copa del Rey final.\n\n\"It's going to be impossible to keep up that record,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know how many semi-finals I had to play before actually reaching a final, it was eight, but now I've won in two finals.\"\n\nA third Super Cup title is Bilbao's first silverware since they claimed the same trophy in 2015 with a 5-1 aggregate win over Barcelona.\n\nBarca coach Ronald Koeman, who missed the chance to grab his first silverware since taking over in the summer, defended his star man over the sending-off.\n\n\"I can understand what Messi did,\" the 57-year-old said.\n\n\"I don't know how many times they fouled him and it's normal to react when they keep trying to foul you as a player who is looking to dribble with the ball, but I need to see it again properly.\"\n\nGiven the red card was shown for violent conduct, Messi is likely to face a four-game ban across La Liga and the Copa del Rey.\n\nBarcelona face neighbours Cornella in the Copa del Rey Round of 32 on Thursday, while they sit third in La Liga, seven points behind leaders Atletico Madrid having played two games more. - REUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nbarcelona\n\nathletic bilbao\n\nLionel messi\n\nRonald Koeman\n\nmarcelino\n\nSpain\n\ncup\n\nsuper cup\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Add yoga to your routine to increase suppleness and strength.\n\nTNP FILE PHOTO\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 18, 2021, 11:48am\n\nHow to stay healthy and fit in your 40s and 50s\n\nShare this article\n\n40s\n\nIn your 40s, you may start to experience some subtle midlife changes, such as having trouble sleeping or squinting to read small text.\n\nHere are the best ways to implement damage control in this phase of your life.\n\nKeep moving\n\nYour body will naturally slow down, but maintaining mobility is important to reduce the rate of bone loss and strengthen the muscles around the joints.\n\nSlipping into a sedentary lifestyle can lead to stiff joints, which in turn restricts movement. Lifting weights at least twice a week can help maintain bone and muscle mass. Add yoga to your routine to increase suppleness and strength too.\n\nHormone hijack\n\nMost women enter perimenopause in their 40s. This is where the body reduces the amount of estrogen and eggs it produces. You may start to notice changes in your menstrual cycle - heavy bleeding is a common symptom.\n\nSimple and convenient measures, such as endometrial ablation, exist. Discuss your symptoms with your gynaecologist if your period is interfering with your daily activities.\n\nSleep tight\n\nSleep problems are common during times of hormonal change. Symptoms, particularly hot flushes and night sweats, can disturb sleep and set off insomnia. Relaxation techniques may help.\n\nKnow your boundaries\n\nAs life becomes more demanding and you are bouncing among teenage children, elderly parents and career, respect your own needs and know what it takes for you to thrive - whether that is more sleep, spending time alone or with friends.\n\nLearning to ask for support and showing self-compassion are also essential self-care strategies.\n\nBrain drain\n\nIt is easy to become consumed by family, work and bills, but it is important to have fun. These stressors can contribute to cognitive decline over time, mainly due to high levels of stress hormones.\n\nWhen you reduce stress, brain cells can regenerate. Start identifying daily stressors and look at ways to add fun into your day. Also, consider some form of daily relaxation to give your brain a chance to rest and recuperate.\n\nTarget kilos and eat better\n\nMost women complain about their weight - with the average female weight gain at 500g per year. A drop in estrogen can cause weight to shift from your hips to your abdomen.\n\nDietitian Bronwen Greenfield said: \"This is where your metabolism starts to decline, so focus on portion control, increase your intake of protein, and high fibre and low-GI (glycaemic index) foods to make it easier to prevent unwanted weight gain.\"\n\nEating a wide variety of fruit and vegetables to boost your antioxidant intake can help protect against the development of certain chronic diseases, as your risk of developing health conditions such as heart disease increases in your 40s.\n\nChronic inflammation is also associated with the development of chronic diseases, so focusing on minimising inflammation levels through diet is crucial.\n\nReduce the intake of pro-inflammatory foods - refined carbohydrates and foods high in added sugars, saturated and trans fats - and eating more anti-inflammatory foods such as oily fish, extra virgin olive oil, avocado, nuts and seeds, plant-based foods, fermented foods and turmeric.\n\nDrink more water\n\nThe health benefits of staying hydrated become even more important. Water prevents dehydration and increases blood circulation - two factors that can keep cognitive decline and nerve damage at bay.\n\nAim for eight glasses of water a day. Fill up on water-rich fruits such as citrus, berries, tomatoes and watermelon, and veggies, including cucumbers and leafy greens for an added nutrient-rich boost.\n\nListen to your heart\n\nEarly heart disease usually has no symptoms, and you may not be aware that you are at risk. See your doctor regularly to ensure your heart is healthy.\n\nBlood test results will identify if you have high (more than 15 per cent), moderate (10 per cent to 15 per cent) or low risk (less than 10 per cent) of a heart attack or stroke.\n\nThe Singapore Heart Foundation strongly recommends having a heart health check if you are over 45 while HealthHub recommends that a heart health check-up should be done every five years starting from the age of 18.\n\nThis article was first published in The Singapore Women's Weekly (www.womensweekly.com.sg)\n\nHow to take care of your health in your 50s\n\n50s\n\nYour 50s is the perfect time to make your health even more of a priority, and this usually means making a few tweaks to your lifestyle. Generally speaking, what you need at this age is more movement, mentally stimulating activities and calcium. Here are five ways to take care of your health in your 50s.\n\nDo not stop moving\n\nPrevent injury by doing longer warm-up sessions when you work out. You need to maintain muscle mass and strength and preserve bone density, so you can consider combining walking with regular strength-training exercises for at least two to three days a week.\n\nPlay footsies\n\nDedicating a few minutes every day to your feet will help prevent common problems. Check your feet for any redness, swelling, blisters, dry patches, bumps and sores, moles and freckles as well as discolouration underneath the nails.\n\nSeek help from a health professional if you are concerned and keep your feet and leg muscles and joints flexible with regular stretching.\n\nHeel pain is common at this age and is very often caused by plantar fasciitis when tissue is damaged or torn from too much pressure. See a physiotherapist to help stabilise the ankle and heel.\n\nBone age\n\nOn average, women lose up to 10 per cent of their bone mass in the first five years of menopause. The good news is you can reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis with a few lifestyle changes, such as avoiding excessive alcohol intake and not smoking.\n\nBoost your mind\n\nLearning a new language or taking on other mentally stimulating activities has been shown to strengthen brain cell networks and help preserve mental functions. The effects of common life factors like chronic illness or loss of loved ones can lead to depression and anxiety.\n\nDo not suffer in silence - seek help from a therapist and keep up with relaxation techniques. Yoga has been shown to have a positive effect on anxiety and depression, largely from the deep-breathing techniques, which reduce levels of stress hormone cortisol and regulate your heart rate.\n\nWork it out\n\nRegular exercise has many proven health benefits and can help prevent, delay or manage many of the most common chronic diseases - think heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and obesity - which affects adults 50 and older.\n\nThis article was first published in The Singapore Women's Weekly (www.womensweekly.com.sg).\n\nWELLNESS & BEAUTY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

If time is a flat circle, then it's only fitting that a second Liam Neeson movie is ruling over the US box office during the pandemic.\n\nMonths after his action thriller Honest Thief led domestic charts, another Neeson action thriller The Marksman has debuted at No. 1 with US$3.2 million (S$4.3m) in ticket sales.\n\nRobert Lorenz directed The Marksman, about a rancher and retired Marine living in Arizona who helps a young boy escape a Mexican drug cartel.\n\nThe film, which premiered in 1,975 locations, should rake in US$3.7 million through the Martin Luther King holiday on Monday.\n\nOpen Road, the distributor behind The Marksman, also backed Honest Thief.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe latter bowed to US$3.7 million last October and ended its theatrical run with US$14 million in the US and US$28 million globally.\n\nThe Marksman joins the company of Honest Thief and Robert De Niro's The War With Grandpa as some of the lowest-grossing box office toppers in modern history, highlighting the bleak reality that movie theatres are facing amid the country's latest Covid-19 surge.\n\nOverall, around 65 per cent of US theatres are closed due to the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, Wonder Woman 1984 slid to second place after besting the (albeit muted) competition for three straights weekends.\n\nWarner Bros. did not provide a three-day total, but the studio projects the Gal Gadot-led superhero sequel will generate US$2.6 million through the extended holiday weekend.\n\nHowever, Wonder Woman 1984 could drop to third place behind The Croods: A New Age when Martin Luther King day sales are finalised on Monday.\n\nWonder Woman 1984, a DC Comics adaptation that cost US$200 million to produce, released simultaneously on the fledgling streaming service HBO Max.\n\nIt will be taken off the platform next Sunday, and the film will only be available to watch in theatres until it reaches its traditional home entertainment window.\n\nIt's expected to return to the streaming platform a few months later.\n\nInternationally, where HBO Max has yet to launch, the follow-up brought in US$5.2 million, boosting foreign revenues to US$105.9 million for a worldwide total of US$141.7 million. -

We created two massive chances and it was two brilliant saves by the 'keeper.\"\n\nSolskjaer's disappointment, though, is a sign of how far United have come in the year since they last suffered an away defeat in domestic football on their last trip to Anfield.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nA massive 33 points divided the sides last season as Liverpool ended a 30-year wait to win the title.\n\nUnited are now looking to end their own drought as for the first time since former manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired eight years ago, they have forced themselves into contention on the back of a 12-game unbeaten run.\n\nLiverpool were again without any fit senior centre-backs, forcing Juergen Klopp into partnering midfielders Fabinho and Jordan Henderson in defence.\n\nYet, despite the absence of the talismanic Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip to injury, it is scoring goals, not conceding them, that has been the root of the Reds' struggles in recent weeks.\n\nKlopp's men have failed to score in three consecutive league games for the first time since 2005 and are now winless in their last four in the EPL.\n\n\"What we miss is the goal,\" said Klopp. \"For all the things said before the game, they are flying and we are struggling, I think my boys played a really good game.\"\n\nThiago pulls the strings\n\nKlopp recalled Xherdan Shaqiri to add a creative spark, while Thiago Alcantara made his Anfield debut, four months on from his arrival from Bayern Munich after a long injury layoff.\n\nThiago pulled the strings as United struggled to gain a foothold in the opening half hour.\n\nHowever, Liverpool failed to make their dominance count as Roberto Firmino slashed their best chance well wide from Sadio Mane's layoff.\n\nA turnaround in United's fortunes dates back a year to Fernandes signing shortly after the sides last met. The Portuguese international midfielder quickly established himself as the Red Devils' talisman and again provided his side's biggest threat.\n\nHis free-kick that curled inches wide was as close as either side came to breaking the deadlock before the break and he then had the visitors' first shot on target 25 minutes from time that Alisson comfortably collected.\n\nHowever, as the game became stretched late on, United began to pick Liverpool off on the counter-attack.\n\nFernandes had his best chance to win the game 15 minutes from time, but Alisson was equal to his low shot from Luke Shaw's cutback.\n\nMoments later, Liverpool's Brazilian goalkeeper made an even better save to turn Pogba's fiercely struck shot behind and prevent United opening up a sizeable gap over their rivals.\n\n\"We can't deny Man United for 90 minutes with the quality they have,\" added Klopp. \"They had two big chances and Ali made two big saves.\" -\n\nAFP\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/920196d26cf4315681dc261833605d26854c39ab18e171fd2252d05d165e89dc/sol.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (right) greets Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara and manager Juergen Klopp after both sides drew 0-0 at Anfield.", "caption": "Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (right) greets Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara and manager Juergen Klopp after both sides drew 0-0 at Anfield.

Rescuers may not be as familiar with performing CPR on women, said the Singapore Heart Foundation (SHF), which developed the manikin vest.\n\nSome also hesitate to perform chest compressions on women for fear of being accused of molestation if they touch a female patient's breasts. Likewise, worries about outrage of modesty may stop them from using an automated external defibrillator (AED) to revive a woman.\n\nSHF board member Chee Tek Siong said such worries may lead rescuers to placing their hands too low on the chest, below a woman's bust-line, which may cause injuries when performing chest compressions during CPR.\n\nBut the female manikin vest can help familiarise first-aiders with where to correctly place their hands on a woman's chest - on the lower half of the sternum, just like for men.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 20, 2021, 02:02pm\n\nMan jumps out of window to escape fire\n\nMore related stories\n\nTrainees can also learn how to paste AED pads without unnecessarily exposing a woman's chest.\n\nWithout intervention, a person's chances of survival drops by 10 per cent for every minute that passes after cardiac arrest.\n\nDr Chee said: \"If you have a manikin that looks like a female, you can practise on it and you'll be more confident.\"\n\nThe manikin vests were distributed starting yesterday, which was National Life Saving Day, and will be issued to 60 CPR and AED training centres.\n\nThe number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases in Singapore has been increasing and is now at about 3,000 a year, said the Health Ministry's Unit for Pre-Hospital Emergency Care (Upec). This is due to the country's rapidly ageing population and a rise in chronic diseases - diabetes, hypertension and heart conditions - that increase the risk of cardiac arrest.\n\nBut the number of bystander CPR performed has also increased - from 22 per cent in 2011 to 61.8 per cent in 2018.\n\nProfessor Marcus Ong, the medical director of Upec, attributes this to the dispatcher-assisted CPR programme launched in 2012 - where someone who calls 995 when witnessing a person suffering cardiac arrest is guided by the dispatcher over the phone on performing chest compressions.\n\nIn light of Covid-19, Prof Ong also said Singapore's emergency services will instruct people to perform \"hands-only\" CPR and not mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.\n\nnp_20210118_cccpr18g_6268029_0.pdf\n\nCHARLOTTE CHONG\n\nACCIDENTS FIRE FLOOD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nOtter attack leaves man with more than 20 wounds\n\nNov 29, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nFour people, including two kids, taken to hospital after PMD fire\n\nNov 22, 2021, 10:00pm\n\n200 evacuated after fire breaks out at Shaw Centre eatery\n\nNov 21, 2021, 10:00am\n\nCertis officers among group who lifted car, helped victims in accident outside Parliament House\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It may continue to fulfil bookings made before yesterday.\n\nA joint operation by STB and the police last Friday found that 19 people had gathered in two adjoining units at the resort, which was formerly known as Costa Sands.\n\nAll 19 were fined $300 each for breaching the maximum group size of eight people allowed under Singapore's phase three restrictions.\n\nHotels here are currently not allowed to have gatherings of more than eight people in a room or adjoining rooms, except where the gathering consists of people from the same household.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\nCherryloft had also failed to conduct entry screening and ensure its guests performed SafeEntry check-ins for contact tracing, STB added.

There was blood all over her face.\"\n\nAn employee from a nearby nursing home told Shin Min that he heard screams and went to investigate. By the time he arrived, five or six other people were already there to help.\n\nThe 53-year-old man, who wanted be known as Mr Zhou, said his colleague used cotton wool to stem the bleeding.\n\nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force told The New Paper an ambulance took a person to the National University Hospital.\n\nMs Sathiya said her daughter underwent surgery on her eye on Friday. A second operation is expected on Jan 25, she added.\n\nWhile the girl's condition is stable, it is unclear if she has suffered any permanent damage.\n\nMs Sathiya, who came to Singapore from India with her husband 12 years ago, said her daughter had nightmares and could not sleep after the incident. The couple also have a 16-month-old daughter who is in India.\n\nPolice investigations are ongoing. A Grab spokesman told TNP the suspect is a Grab delivery-partner.\n\n\"Grab is aware of the incident and has suspended the said delivery-partner.

And millions of Americans who back Mr Trump refuse to recognise Mr Biden as the legitimate president.\n\nMr Biden this week unveiled plans to seek US$1.9 trillion (S$2.5 trillion) to revive the economy through new stimulus payments and other aid and plans a blitz to accelerate the stumbling Covid-19 vaccine roll-out.\n\nMeanwhile, protesters are expected to descend on statehouses across the US over the weekend as law enforcement officials girded for violence.\n\nTROOPS\n\nMore than a dozen states have activated National Guard troops to help secure their capitol buildings after an FBI warning of armed protests, with right-wing extremists emboldened by the deadly siege at the US Capitol in Washington on Jan 6.\n\nWhile many states have erected fences or other barriers to secure their capitols, Texas and Kentucky have taken the further step of closing their capitol grounds to the public.\n\nConnecticut has activated its National Guard in preparation for as many as 2,000 mostly Trump supporters expected at its capitol complex in Hartford yesterday, a state police spokesman said.\n\n\"We are preparing possibly for anything to happen,\" said trooper Pedro Muniz, adding that there had not been any specific threats. \"We won't tolerate any acts of violence.\"\n\nIn a nod to both the coronavirus pandemic as well as security concerns, festivities around Mr Biden's inauguration will largely be held online, though he still plans to be sworn in and deliver his inaugural address at the Capitol. - AFP, REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

A few days later, she peeked into the letter boxes at Block 124 Kim Tian Place and saw that one had two sets of vouchers.\n\nThese belonged to a man and his wife, who had moved to another address.\n\nAsmah, who was then working as a food delivery rider, improvised a contraption to retrieve the vouchers, which she subsequently spent.\n\nThe man later called the Health Promotion Board to inquire about his vouchers.\n\nHe was informed they had been mailed to his old address and had been used. He then made a police report.\n\nAsmah also stole grocery vouchers belonging to a resident of the housing block, who learnt after speaking to staff at Tiong Bahru Community Centre that her vouchers had been used. She made a police report on Oct 14 last year.\n\nAsmah was traced through closed-circuit television footage and arrested two days later.\n\nCourt documents state that no restitution has been made, and the victims have since applied for replacement vouchers.\n\nIn written submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutor Joseph Gwee urged the court to jail Asmah for at least 10 months. He highlighted her previous theft convictions, including one in 2015 when she stole an electric bicycle worth $1,300.\n\n\"The accused's antecedent record clearly evinces a pattern of offences without any sign or acknowledgement of contrition or remorse,\" said DPP Gwee, who added there was premeditation and preparation in this case, as Asmah had used an improvised device.\n\nShe is expected to be sentenced on Feb 19. For each count of theft, Asmah can be jailed for up to three years and/or fined.\n\nDOMINIC LOW\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nCombat Siege\n\nDo you have a mouse?

This was followed by the dead fish and the waters turning shades of plum from Jan 12.\n\nSDC and NEA, together with Sentosa Cove Resort Management (SCRM), studied water samples collected between January 6 and Jan 13.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 2, 2025, 02:22am\n\nWarm, humid nights and rainy mornings expected in first half of July\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe National University of Singapore's Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI), which was tapped by SDC and SCRM, found high amounts of picocyanobacteria - a form of algae - in the water samples.\n\nThe colour of the bloom depends on the species of the algae form and their pigment composition, and the algae bloom could have occurred even before the visible change in the colour of the waters, the SDC-NEA statement said.\n\nIn line with what experts told The Straits Times in earlier reports, TMSI's evaluation suggests that the fish could have died from the low level of oxygen caused by the cyanobacteria's respiration or decomposition, or suffocation because of gill clogging.\n\nThe statement added another possible cause - irritation caused by the algae bloom.\n\nThe unpleasant odour of the waters was likely from decomposing fish, said the statement.\n\nRAINFALL\n\nTMSI senior research fellow Sandric Leong said heavy and regular rainfall causes the salinity of sea-surface water to decrease and may cause high-nutrient run off from land into the waterway. Rainwater, he said, was also a source of nutrients.\n\nIn response to queries, a spokesman for SDC said that surface run-off from the Sentosa Golf Club did not drain into the waterway, altering water conditions.\n\n\"As part of irrigation design, surface run-off from the Sentosa Golf Club's courses does not drain into the South Cove waterway. The lakes and fishes at the courses have also remained unaffected,\" she said. - THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nEnvironment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 1, 2025, 11:46pm\n\n'Pig-faced' rare bat sighting at Lower Peirce sparks buzz among nature fans\n\nDec 10, 2024, 03:22am\n\nEven corals grow up in HDB-style homes in Singapore\n\nNov 8, 2024, 03:55am\n\nEverything you wanted to know about water heaters but never asked\n\nMay 22, 2024, 04:27pm\n\nCetta expands into new sectors by acquiring stake in EAS.ai\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But it was not without some nail-biting moments.\n\nThe Archer, the second of his three runners for the day, came storming home under former two-time champion apprentice jockey Wong Chin Cheun to finish deadlocked with the favourite and newcomer Malibu Beach.\n\nIt took a while to study the photo-finish before the Falcon Racing No. 5 Stable-owned three-year-old was declared the winner - by a mere short head in the $20,000 Open Maiden event over the Polytrack 1,200m. He paid $42 for a win.\n\nRacegoers have been wondering about Tan's recent poor fortunes - his worst since he started his training career in 2010 with 38 winners. He won the champion trainer's title with 90 winners in 2016.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nLast year, he garnered only five winners - the first time his winning tally dropped to single digit. His previous lowest was 25 winners in his second season.\n\nSo, to break the four-month drought with The Archer for his milestone success was certainly a huge relief for the down-to-earth trainer.\n\n\"To get the winner today is a big relief and a big motivation for myself and my staff, who have worked so hard. Hopefully, we can look forward to more winners from now on, and more support,\" said Tan.\n\n\"We've waited many months for that winner. The long wait was mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\n\nLike many trainers, the 59-year-old Singaporean has been affected by the pandemic, which shut down Singapore racing for three months from early April to July 11.\n\nWith few new horses and quite a number of horses transferred out, his string was depleted to just over 20 horses. He found some new Hong Kong owners, but the pandemic has put their plans on hold.\n\n\"We were already going through hard times, but the pandemic made it even harder for us,\" he said. \"By October, I was feeling very lost, as we still had no winners after Victory Joy won back in September.\n\n\"But, thanks to the owners who have never stopped supporting me, I kept believing in myself and my staff.\n\n\"I have to thank my loyal owners for having stayed with me through these hard times. Hopefully, we will have a better season this year.\n\n\"I believe the worst is behind us. Even when I was going through my darkest period, I never thought of giving up, as I've always believed with hard work, we can turn things around.\"\n\nTan knew The Archer was his best chance. The horse had run well with a second to Relentless on debut and was checked in his second start, when seventh.\n\nWith the second-run syndrome over and a gelding operation, the bay/brown gelding was third-time lucky.\n\nParked around midfield early, he was still some distance behind as they swung for home.\n\nHappy Friday moved up to join the tiring leader Global Spirit on straightening. Malibu Beach also challenged and hit the front with only 50m left.\n\nBut he found no answer to The Archer's powerful run on the outside.\n\nWong reckoned the horse \"is still a baby\" and was not fully focused for most the of the race.\n\n\"I think he'll get better as he becomes more mature,\" he said.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/059994b1fac05c65c2926d1c3630dc5cbd6446b87461b7baba3562e233903aff/NP_20210118_TLROUND18_6266033.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Archer (No. 12) scoring a last-stride victory over the grey newcomer-cum-favourite Malibu Beach in Race 2 on Saturday.", "caption": "The Archer (No. 12) scoring a last-stride victory over the grey newcomer-cum-favourite Malibu Beach in Race 2 on Saturday.

The scooter, accessible to Class 2B licence riders, is in the luxury scooter segment with an emphasis on design, technology and performance.\n\nUp close, the X is not an \"off the shelf\" scooter.\n\nThe components, like its 14-inch wheels, single-sided swingarm, bodywork right down to the hand grips, were built in-house by the marque's team of engineers.\n\nSpeaking of the hand grips, they look like short katana swords made of rubber, designed to allow minimal rider input to turn the throttle.\n\nIt is always refreshing to see more of the rear wheel, thanks to the space between the rear of the scooter and the single-sided swingarm.\n\nThe overall scooter shape is a mix of curves and sharp angles.\n\nIts features - such as the strip-type dual rear brake lights and its day-running light on the head lamp - appear like something from the sci-fi movie Tron.\n\nAstride the unveiled version of the X, my feet rest flat on the floor.\n\nIt is not too wide and seems compact, with plenty of leg room.\n\nThe handlebar reach is natural, although I was told the handlebars will be lowered to give it a less aggressive stance.\n\nThe designers will also be extending the length of the prototype X to give it more \"maxi-scooter\" presence.\n\nGiven that design considerations are still fluid, I wonder if the production model of the X will come with carbon fibre component protectors, upgraded brakes or even premium suspension?\n\nWhile my questions were left unanswered, they were met with a knowing smile by one of the brand's representatives.\n\nThe X, which can be expected to hit 60kmh in four seconds, has a top speed of more than 100kmh and a range of 200km, and will have a 5kW motor powered by a 5kWh battery.\n\nIt will take roughly four hours to fully charge it using a household socket.\n\nI can imagine the X being perfect for city riding.\n\nHopefully by the time it is ready for the Singapore market, the infrastructure needed to support EV motorcycles will be in place.\n\nBy\n\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Zaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nMOTORSPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew-look Ducati Monster still as playful like before\n\nNov 21, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nQatar GP winner Hamilton reduces Verstappen's lead\n\nNov 16, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAlfa Romeo's Zhou becomes China's first F1 driver\n\nNov 15, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nHamilton hails best weekend as he keeps title hopes alive\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

You could see him trying to figure out the best way to play early on. I felt we all were over-passing, trying to make everybody comfortable,\" said Durant, who set a franchise record by scoring at least 25 points for the ninth straight game as the Nets won their third straight.\n\n\"Then he got into his mode, being aggressive to score. That opened up the whole game for all of us. Glad he got his feet up under him, he's got to keep plugging away, keep getting better each day.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 22, 2022, 02:18pm\n\nAfter cardiac arrest, Jurong Pioneer JC basketballer Xu bounces back for A-levels\n\nMore related stories\n\nDurant said he was impressed with Harden in the point-guard role, with Kyrie Irving missing his sixth straight game due to personal reasons, and health and safety protocols.\n\n\"James played the same way he always plays... the same way he was playing in Houston. Handling the ball, being a pass-first guard, trying to get his guys good looks,\" Durant said.\n\n\"Coach put him at the point... that's his natural position. Point, combo guard. For him to come out and get 14 assists, 12 rebounds for us at the point guard was key.\"\n\nHarden, who shot eight of 18 from the field, also added four steals and made 13 of 15 free-throws in 40 minutes.\n\nIn his post-game interview, Harden deflected questions about his dazzling debut.\n\n\"Those stats don't mean anything. I'm just happy we came away with the win,\" he said.\n\nNikola Vucevic scored a season-high 34 points for Orlando, who dropped their fifth straight despite playing their most competitive game of the skid.\n\nTerrence Ross added 23 and rookie Cole Anthony contributed 16, as Orlando shot 46.3 per cent while playing without Evan Fournier (back spasms) for the eighth straight game.\n\nROCKETS PLUMMET\n\nThe Rockets' fortunes continued to plummet following Harden's departure, as they lost 103-91 to San Antonio Spurs.\n\nDeMar DeRozan scored 24 points to lead San Antonio in a home victory.\n\nDejounte Murray notched a double-double with 18 points and 10 rebounds, while Jakob Poeltl also added a 13-point, 11-rebound double-double for the Spurs in the victory.\n\nThe Rockets were led by Christian Wood and Mason Jones, who both scored 24 points. Wood added 18 rebounds, while Jones' scoring output was a career high.\n\nOver at the Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida, Norman Powell sank six three-pointers en route to a team-high 24 points, and the Toronto Raptors scored their second win over the Charlotte Hornets in as many games, 116-113.\n\nPowell was one of four Raptors to knock down three or more three-pointers along with OG Anunoby, Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet. Toronto shot 21 of 49 from long range as a team compared to Charlotte's 15 of 36. - AFP, REUTERS\n\nBasketball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 8, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nLeBron stars as Lakers beat Celtics\n\nDec 1, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSuns beat Warriors for 17th straight win\n\nNov 30, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nJokic's return sees Nuggets end losing run\n\nNov 29, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nCurry stars ahead of clash with Suns\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Stakes for the German international, however, are far higher after faltering again in a late 1-0 win over Fulham yesterday morning (Singapore time).\n\nWerner is still the Blues' joint-top scorer this season, with nine in all competitions, yet a barren run in the English Premier League has now stretched to around 11 hours without a goal.\n\nBy personal admission, he is struggling to come to terms with the physicality of his new surroundings and expectations heightened by a £47.5 million (S$85.8m) price tag.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nBeing shunted out wide in a three-man attack has also done little to help his case, with RB Leipzig's penchant for a two-pronged frontline allowing him to plunder goals at will.\n\nMore than that, though, Werner's inability to find the target in the EPL is a clear sign of a player shorn of confidence in situations where he had previously flourished.\n\nAt Craven Cottage, he spurned several opportunities to break his domestic duck that vindicated Frank Lampard's reluctance to persist with the 24-year-old in a starring role.\n\nHistory is potentially dissuading the former midfielder from repeating the mistakes that he witnessed first-hand in the west Londoners' dressing room with Torres in particular.\n\nPersistence failed to overcome resistance for the ex-Liverpool talisman as his own eight-figure move to the capital a decade ago was hardly prolific.\n\nThe Spaniard's failure to fire consistently became a punchline that delighted Chelsea's many detractors at the time and left a succession of managers tearing their hair out.\n\nLampard's change in approach has yet to kick-start Werner on the goal trail and could soon carry far-reaching implications for the one-time Leipzig marksman as Germany coach Joachim Loew keeps tabs on his development in the build-up to this year's European Championship.\n\nPressure continues to mount on both Die Mannschaft's coach and his Chelsea counterpart, with the former already facing calls for his head from World Cup winner Lothar Matthaeus, if things do not go according to plan again at this summer's Finals.\n\nLoew ruthlessly discarded Thomas Mueller, alongside several Germany veterans, two years ago in the belief that Werner and others were adept enough to step into the fold.\n\nBut if the striker continues to flounder at the Bridge, the mop-topped Svengali might be forced to swallow his pride and consider handing Mueller a recall in the coming months.\n\nLampard's belief that the goals will flow for Werner once more may not be enough to keep his place for club and country as both aim to deliver overdue statements of intent.\n\nTime is not something which Chelsea's all-time top scorer will be afforded in the dugout with hopes of an EPL title bid already disintegrating into a European qualification scrap.\n\nWerner is likely to be granted that same courtesy if he remains incapable of making the best of what Lampard described as \"bread and butter\" scenarios in front of goal.\n\nUnless he finds a way to start gorging again, begging for scraps will not be an option.\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

They haven't lost for many, many years so of course it's a great test for us. Can we go there and cause an upset?\"\n\nAsked if United beating Liverpool would really be an upset, the Norwegian said: \"If you look at the last few seasons, I think it would be an upset and it would be a shock.\n\n\"Our position at the moment is a product of all the hard work that we've done in the training ground and what the players are putting down every single day.\n\n\"We probably deserve to be where we are at the moment, but I don't think many would have thought another word for it than an 'upset' if you go six weeks back (and asked) if we beat Liverpool at Anfield.\n\n\"But we're looking forward to the game and hopefully we can cause that upset.\"\n\nSolskjaer is yet to win against Liverpool as United boss after three failed attempts so far.\n\n'Reality check'\n\nUnited face the tough task of becoming the first visiting side to win an EPL match at Anfield since April 2017.\n\n\"I think every team goes into every game thinking that they can win it,\" he said.\n\n\"We know that we can beat anyone anywhere on any given day, so to go into a game like this feeling that, if we play to our best we can win, is a good feeling.\n\n\"But we know we have to perform to our best and we don't really think consequences after that. We just think about the performance.\"\n\nUnited's surge to the top of the table has come after a rocky start to the season put Solskjaer under severe pressure.\n\nThere was talk he could be sacked after United crashed out of the Champions League at the group stages and the Norwegian admits his side are still to deliver their best on a consistent basis.\n\n\"It's a test and reality check of where we're really at because we've won many, many tight games, scored a few goals in injury time, showed that mentality,\" he said.\n\n\"We've not really set the world alight too many times and to win away at Anfield you really need to be at your best level.\"\n\nLiverpool are winless in three EPL games, while United have won nine matches during their current 11-game unbeaten league run.\n\n\"Form goes out the window when you play your rivals but our form gives us confidence so we're confident going into the game,\" Solskjaer said. -\n\nAFP\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But the man continued to make Maria feel unsafe at work, and she decided to quit.\n\nThen there is Jonathan (not his real name), whose male supervisor made comments about his private parts, among other acts of harassment.\n\nJonathan reported the matter to his company's human resource department, but his complaint was dismissed.\n\nCalling on the Government to introduce legislation against workplace harassment, Aware said there should be regular anti-harassment training across industries and the universal adoption of grievance-handling policies.\n\nTHERES TAN, SENIOR SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT\n\nEmployment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 10:34pm\n\nNearly 40 employers offer 450 roles at job fair for retrenched Jetstar Asia staff\n\nJun 11, 2025, 05:29am\n\nNTUC exploring options to match retrenched Jetstar Asia staff to roles at SIA Group\n\nApr 28, 2025, 03:33am\n\nSingapore's Q1 unemployment up slightly\n\nJan 30, 2025, 11:43pm\n\nEstate cleaners give manager kickbacks for fear of losing jobs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b053455acac4b8e073fab229c9fae4f33c55bca81f0c286984368929ff4d9070/NP_20210115_THHARASS_6262603.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Only one in three reported the harassment to an official authority at work.

He also kicked and stamped on her body, pulled her hair and threatened to cut all her fingers with a knife.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Lim Woon Yee said the assault stopped only after Madam Tsang relented and revealed her PIN.\n\n\"As she was badly injured and in great pain, the victim was unable to call for police assistance after the assault. She then lay down in her room to rest,\" Mr Lim said.\n\nYap left at about 3am the next day and withdrew $2,000 from his mother's bank account.\n\nMadam Tsang later sought assistance from her neighbours, who called the police after noticing the injuries on her face.\n\nShe was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was found to have injuries such as rib fractures.\n\nDPP Lim said the woman became fearful of going out alone after the incident, for fear of being beaten up. She also had recurrent thoughts of Yap's assault.\n\nHe was arrested on Oct 26, 2018, and released on a personal bond the next day.\n\nAs a condition of the bond, he was required to report to Tanglin Police Station on Nov 9 that year but failed to do so. He was arrested again on Aug 5, 2019.\n\nUrging the court to sentence Yap to five years and three months in jail, DPP Lim noted how Yap had assaulted his mother who was \"frail, helpless and unable to retaliate\".\n\nYap's lawyer, Mr Ng Shi Yang, said in mitigation that there was no premeditation to his client's assault.\n\nDistrict Judge Gwee backdated Yap's sentence to Oct 31, 2019, when he was first remanded.\n\nWhen The Straits Times went to the unit yesterday, neighbours said Madam Tsang had moved out about a year ago.\n\nA domestic worker, who did not want to be identified, said she was the first person to see the elderly woman early in the morning after the assault.\n\n\"She asked for help and I was scared so I quickly called my employer, who called the police,\" the maid said.\n\nShe added that Madam Tsang lived with her elderly husband who was hard of hearing. Both of them needed to use walking aids.\n\nAnother neighbour, who looked to be in her 60s and did not want to be identified, said the couple moved out with a woman who is believed to be their daughter.\n\nThey mostly kept to themselves and the unit has been vacant since, she added.\n\nDOMINIC LOW AND DAVID SUN\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I have previously queued for three hours for this bak kwa, it is worth it because I love the taste.\"\n\nA Kim Peng Hiang spokesman said: \"We are a traditional brand and are unable to pivot to online platforms like other brands.\"\n\nFor customers who still prefer to make their purchases in person, safe distancing measures are in place.\n\nA spokesman for Kim Joo Guan, located at 257 South Bridge Road, said: \"We allow only one walk-in customer at a time in shop premises.\n\n\"We also have a pre-order service to spread out customers from the usual walk-in purchase peak period.\"\n\nWhile some find that queueing for bak kwa is a Chinese New Year tradition, others have gone online to satisfy their craving.\n\nSaid Ms Yee Choy Fang, 59: \"I plan to order 3kg of bak kwa online as it is a waste of time to queue. Covid-19 will not go away soon so we must enjoy eating during Chinese New Year and keep the festive mood going.\"\n\nDELIVERY\n\nKim Hua Guan, which was established in the 1960s and now has outlets in a few locations, started its e-commerce and delivery services this year to avoid crowding and any possible violation of safe distance rules.\n\nIts spokesman said: \"This year's orders have increased by 5 per cent to 8 per cent compared with previous years.\"\n\nKim Joo Guan has also seen an 80 per cent increase in online sales compared with previous years.\n\nThe Peng Guan brand is also experiencing an uptick in business, with its spokesman saying: \"Sales have increased 15 per cent since last year, for both physical and online sales.\n\n\"Our online sales have sold out and delivery slots are fully booked.\"\n\nBy\n\nGracia Yap\n\nRead articles by Gracia Yap\n\nClariss Chia\n\nRead articles by Clariss Chia\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/99fb131824d7b8a46b22825ad0cebcde93196a53f8565983ee835d06038466c1/NP_20210115_GYQUEUE_6262055.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The queue at Kim Peng Hiang, at 465 Changi Road, started at 9am on Tuesday, although the shop began taking orders only from 11.30am.

Its opening will also mark Nojima Corp's first overseas venture into a large-format store concept in a central location of Singapore, said Courts yesterday.\n\nThe Japanese consumer electronics giant had acquired Courts in 2019.\n\nOn Courts' choice of The Heeren as its newest location, Courts Singapore chief executive Hoang Duc Thanh Matthew said: \"The Heeren is still a symbolic landmark located right in the heart of Orchard Road and we believe it holds great potential as a central location within the shopping belt.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 13, 2025, 05:01am\n\nLocksmith under fire for charging elderly woman $80 despite cancelled service\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Coupled with the Urban Redevelopment Authority's long-term plans to rejuvenate Orchard Road as a lifestyle destination, we envision that the new flagship store will contribute to the vibrancy of the retail sector.\"\n\nPERFORMING WELL\n\nCurrently, Courts has one outlet in Orchard, at 228 Orchard Road. A Courts spokesman told The Straits Times that the outlet has been performing well and will remain in operation for now.\n\n\"We will review our plans again once the flagship store is up and running,\" said Courts.\n\nThe shopping belt was also home to its first store which opened in 1974.\n\n\"We are looking forward to expanding our presence in Orchard Road to where it all began and raise the bar further in offering Singaporeans innovative and experiential retail experiences while shopping for electronics and home furnishings,\" said Courts.\n\nIn 2017, the URA said in a joint statement with Singapore Tourism Board that they are looking into implementing an \"actionable Orchard Road Blueprint\".\n\nThe authorities said the blueprint was to guide the precinct's development over the next 15 to 20 years.\n\nCourts' announcement comes after retail stalwart Robinsons closed its flagship store at The Heeren on Dec 16.\n\nThis was followed shortly after by the closure of its last outlet at Raffles City last Saturday.\n\nThe department store announced on Oct 30 the closure of its last two outlets here, saying the decision to liquidate was prompted by a range of factors, including changing consumer tastes and cost pressures such as rent. - THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nCONSUMER ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 28, 2022, 02:23pm\n\nUse taxi apps, not platform like Gojek, says passenger who was charged $10 booking fee\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTNP goes fully digital\n\nNov 25, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nVegetable prices here rise due to wet weather in M'sia\n\nNov 25, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nDBS restores digital banking services, rules out cyber attack\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It is also moisture-wicking and great for those who sweat easily at night.\n\n\"Cotton, on the other hand, is highly breathable and durable, and is a classic fabric that can withstand multiple washes.\"\n\nAlso, how frequently you wash your linen can impact the type of bedding you choose.\n\nFor those who sleep with pets or kids, cotton or French linen is more fuss-free and durable, which means it holds up well to frequent washing.\n\nWhat is the best way to store bedding in Singapore?\n\nOur humidity and high moisture levels can encourage the growth of mould, mildew and musty smells if we don't store our bedding properly.\n\nBefore we put any of our duvet inserts, quilts or sheets away, they should be clean and completely dry, and rid of any leftover moisture.\n\nThe ideal place to store any bedding is to fold them on a shelf in a closet where there's airflow.\n\nFold and stack your sheets as neatly as possible, to prevent them from becoming wrinkled.\n\nCloth bags are the best choice because they protect bedding from dust and bugs but allow moisture to escape.\n\nHow does one put bed sheets on beds more efficiently?\n\nMake sure you buy the right sized sheets for your bed - check the dimensions to be sure.\n\nOur (Sunday Bedding) sheets are aligned to Australian sizes so they're slightly bigger than standard Singapore sizes, and can accommodate larger beds.\n\nAll our sheets are fitted for easy fitting, but if you use flat sheets, try learning how to create hospital corners. The method is used in hotels too, to create a crisp, tight look.\n\nThis article was first published in The Singapore Women's Weekly (www.womensweekly.com.sg).\n\nShopping\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 31, 2025, 01:40am\n\nCai fan merch label PointyRice calls out Uniqlo keychain's 'uncanny' likeness\n\nMay 19, 2025, 05:45am\n\nDon Don Donki brings back plastic bags after 7 months of discontinuance\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:28pm\n\nHow to cut $100 from your monthly bills\n\nMay 4, 2025, 02:08am\n\nWhy was there a jam at Causeway on May 3?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nYour dream home, now more affordable with IKEA home design ​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3af4b6566b7a02ea8732797adb5ab1e5f2c6b51941a329cb76d2ae146fe54a3a/NP_20210115_BEDDING154P0C_6261075.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "How and where you sleep and how frequently you wash your linen factor into the type of bedding you should opt for, says Sunday Bedding's Ms Clara Teo.

A typical cotton towel, including the ones in hotels, weighs between 300 and 600GSM, and 700GSM is the sweet spot for that dense, luxurious towel that you typically get at spas or hotels.\n\n\"But be careful not to go too high - some towels can weigh up to 900GSM - as it can take longer to dry, especially in Singapore's humidity. On the other hand, for gym towels, you may want to select a lower GSM as they dry off faster and are lighter.\n\nCotton is best\n\nIn general, cotton is the gold standard for bath towels because it is durable, soft and absorbent. Look for towels that are 100 per cent cotton, as they are the ones to pass the tests on softness, absorbency and durability. The material is breathable and comfortable so it doesn't irritate the skin.\n\nGo organic\n\nTextile manufacturing can be full of hazardous chemicals as they are used in the dyeing, treatment and washing process. Look for organic-certified towels that can be less harsh on your skin. Global Organic Textile Standard-certified towels mean no toxic chemicals have been used throughout the production process.\n\nAvoid decorative trimmings\n\nWhile towels with these extras may add a design element to your bathroom, the delicate trimmings or embroidery are more subject to wear and tear over time.\n\nYour towels will feel different after the first wash\n\n\"Fret not, as the cotton fibres typically 'open up' after the first wash and dry. This maximises the absorbency of the towel so the cotton fibres are ready to soak up all the water from your next shower. A good quality towel should still feel soft and absorbent after the first use.\n\nThis article was first published in The Singapore Women's Weekly (www.womensweekly.com.sg)\n\nShopping\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 31, 2025, 01:40am\n\nCai fan merch label PointyRice calls out Uniqlo keychain's 'uncanny' likeness\n\nMay 19, 2025, 05:45am\n\nDon Don Donki brings back plastic bags after 7 months of discontinuance\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:28pm\n\nHow to cut $100 from your monthly bills\n\nMay 4, 2025, 02:08am\n\nWhy was there a jam at Causeway on May 3?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nYour dream home, now more affordable with IKEA home design ​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/78b8d8bb5e0e06dc0bdd4662da5c86f2100887a86d38b752eeaa7d759ce77247/NP_20210115_BATH15_6261165.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Cotton is the gold standard for bath towels.

Imagine this year's European Championship and Foden, coming together at the right time, just as vaccines and global optimism spread.\n\nFootball might be coming home after all, tucked nicely under Foden's arm.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nOK, let's not get carried away. The Manchester City midfielder doesn't turn 21 until May and is still a work in progress, according to Guardiola.\n\nBut what a work in progress he's turning out to be. Foden's rise is teasing a grateful audience desperate for any kind of teasing. For City, he's already morphed into a dependable utility man, but one that brings artistry as well as an exceptional work rate.\n\nHe popped up with a third winner in the English Premier League this season in City's 1-0 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion yesterday morning (Singapore time), but this time from an inside forward position.\n\nOr maybe he was an inverted winger. It's hard to tell with Foden, as he has an enthralling habit of not standing still.\n\nFor his goal, he nipped around a defender like an over-eager puppy scampering around an owner's leg, before slipping home a shot with his weaker foot.\n\nNot that Foden really has a weaker foot, or even a weaker position. As Guardiola pointed out, his protege is comfortable with either foot in any area of the pitch.\n\nThrough the middle, left or right, behind a striker, or sitting deeper, Foden continues his tuition under a teacher that's taken a shine to his favourite pupil.\n\nFor a couple of years now, Guardiola has ignored the demands from a jingoistic English media to make Foden a regular before he started shaving regularly.\n\nThe City manager ignored the tired criticism that he wasn't giving homegrown players a chance. By taking a long-term view with the youngster's development, he was doing just that - giving Foden's career a chance.\n\nVERSATILITY\n\nGuardiola wanted more shades to Foden's game, calling on the young Englishman to play in different positions and at different speeds - a rare, intuitive skill that City lost when David Silva left the club.\n\nUntil recently, Guardiola didn't make him a regular starter, making his expectations clear. Midfielders cannot just feature in City games. They must dominate them.\n\nAn outstanding performance against Arsenal before Christmas seemed to be the turning point. Foden was heavily involved across the pitch. He didn't follow the play. He controlled it.\n\nGuardiola had clearly seen enough.\n\nFoden started his fourth consecutive game against Brighton, a run that coincided with City's mini-renaissance. He's plugging gaps and compensating for absent friends.\n\nThe winner against Brighton was his eighth goal of the season, already equalling his career-best total for a campaign. More importantly, his goals are steering the club through a largely forgotten crisis.\n\nOnly recently, Covid-19 spread through the club and left City without a recognised striker when (Gabriel Jesus tested positive. Sergio Aguero has struggled with fitness all season).\n\nGuardiola's campaign threatened to come off the rails.\n\nBut Foden stepped up. Against Brighton, he secured another narrow victory in the kind of close, gritty contest that may be the norm in an unusual European Championship.\n\nSitting in the Etihad stands, Southgate had to be delighted at the serendipity.\n\nAt this stage, no one has a clue what the postponed Euros will look like. As Covid-19 continues to devastate Europe, there's no guarantee the tournament will even proceed.\n\nA YEAR OLDER AND WISER\n\nBut if it does, Foden will be ready, a year older and twice the footballer. This time last year, he was a bright kid with an uncertain future and a manager behaving like a cautious blind date. Guardiola didn't want to rush things.\n\nToday, Foden has established himself as a versatile, unflappable presence in a title race, adding those different speeds to his game, just as his manager expected.\n\nAnd what's good for Guardiola is potentially great for Southgate. The England manager may soon enjoy the fruits of the Spaniard's labour.\n\nPostponing Euro 2020 was the worst news for the football industry. But it may be the best thing that ever happened to Foden.\n\nBy\n\nNeil Humphreys\n\nSports Columnist\n\nRead articles by Neil Humphreys\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nTransform your home affordably with IKEA Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b94fd0f0b374038e9e1d5150c800d9527fa42c1742322ecc1c64250f4c4db127/np_20210115_neil15_6261755.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Manchester City's Phil Foden (second from right) scored the winner against Brighton & Hove Albion.

On Wednesday, Rafael Nadal's coach Carlos Moya also announced that he would not be travelling to Melbourne due to the coronavirus restrictions.\n\nThe Spaniard is aiming for a 21st Grand Slam title in Melbourne, which would put him ahead of Roger Federer's record of 20, with the Swiss skipping the tournament, citing a need to regain fitness following two knee operations.\n\nBesides Massu, former world No. 1 Andy Murray also returned a positive Covid-19 test recently, casting doubt on his participation in the Australian Open, local media reported yesterday.\n\nMurray, who is self-isolating and in good health, was awarded a wildcard to play in the main draw and still hopes to compete at the tournament, the reports added.\n\nHowever, that could prove difficult, with players and officials required to arrive in Australia during a 36-hour window from today to serve their quarantine.\n\nOne of those heading to Melbourne is world No. 50 Tennys Sandgren, who was granted special permission to board a chartered flight from Los Angeles, despite testing positive for Covid-19 earlier in the week.\n\nTennis Australia said in a statement the decision to allow the American to fly had been made after a review by medical officials, as Sandgren's positive diagnosis was deemed to have been from a previous infection.\n\nSandgren, a quarter-finalist at Melbourne Park last year and in 2018, said on Twitter he had tested positive last November and returned another positive test on Monday.\n\nA spokesman for Covid-19 Quarantine Victoria said it was common among people who had previously tested positive to \"shed viral fragments for some time - which can trigger another positive result\".\n\n\"There's not a single documented case where I would be contagious at this point,\" Sandgren added.\n\nTennis Australia said Sandgren's medical file had to be reviewed by Victorian health authorities before he was cleared to fly. - AFP, REUTERS\n\nTennis\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 1, 2022, 02:42am\n\nSerena Williams retirement on hold after win over world No. 2\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 02:25am\n\nChinese tennis player Peng Shuai denies making accusation of sexual assault\n\nFeb 4, 2022, 08:01am\n\nBarca official resigns after calling Spanish tennis star Nadal an 'enemy of the state'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4970c4c6a8dea0e975b70d9cb8dfb9b49f9b53486a3e6e6a8aa4b5403c2b1d57/np_20210115_ten15_6262516.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "World No. 3 Dominic Thiem could be without his coach at the Australian Open.

He had been convicted last month of one count of voluntarily causing hurt and two charges of criminal intimidation.\n\nThe man and his victim cannot be identified to protect the woman's identity.\n\nCourt documents state they became a couple in mid-2018, but by Nov 29 that year, they had broken up. In her written submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutor Shana Poon said the man was unhappy with the victim over the break-up.\n\n\"This was a relationship marked by considerable inequality in power - the accused did not like (the woman) using social media, made her write down 'mistakes' he thought she had made, and agreed that (the woman) was the one who was begging for his affection and attention,\" added the DPP.\n\nOn Nov 29, 2018, when they were on an afternoon shift at the headquarters of a police division, the man asked the woman to meet him at the staff pantry.\n\nThere, he punched and kicked her, said DPP Poon.\n\nThe man spoke to the victim over the phone later that dayand threatened to kill her. He threatened her over the phone again the next day, said the DPP.\n\nThis time, he told her he would disseminate nude photographs of her online if she did not cooperate with him. She lodged a police report later that day.\n\nThe man, who was represented by lawyer Lim Tean, had earlier argued that the incident in the pantry unfolded differently. He claimed he had pushed the woman's right shoulder in irritation, causing her face to hit against a metal locker. He also said the woman had tried to stop him from leaving the pantry by \"locking\" his ankle with her legs, and he had to use his leg to \"push\" her ankle away.\n\nThe man claimed he had uttered the threatening words only during the first call without any intention of actually killing the woman.\n\nMr Lim yesterday urged the court to impose a fine on his client, noting that he was supporting his family in Malaysia. - THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The 62-year-old man and his colleagues were trying to catch a leopard ray at around 2.30pm on Oct 4, 2016, when it suddenly attacked him.\n\nThe stingray's venomous barb on its tail pierced his chest and he was pronounced dead later that day. On March 1, 2017, then State Coroner Marvin Bay found Mr Chan's death to be a tragic misadventure.\n\nUWS, which was owned by Haw Par Leisure, admitted in a district court yesterday that it had failed to take necessary measures to ensure its workers' safety. It pleaded guilty to an offence under the Workplace Safety and Health Act.\n\nUWS ceased operating in June 2016.\n\nMinistry of Manpower prosecutor Mohd Rizal said that it was in the process of vacating its premises in Siloso Road when the tragedy occurred four months later.\n\nMr Chan and his colleagues were trying to capture the leopard ray in a reef tank to be transferred to another tank.\n\nAfter the ray stung him, he was taken to Singapore General Hospital where he died of a \"penetrating injury to the chest by a stingray barb\" at around 3.30pm that day.\n\nFollowing this tragedy, investigations revealed that UWS did not document the safe work procedures for the capture of marine animals.\n\nMr Mohd said: \"The said activity was mainly undertaken by (Mr Chan) and he would plan and execute the capturing works which included briefing on the capturing methods he had devised, the allocation of manpower required, equipment needed and the foreseeable risks and precautions to take during capturing.\n\nNO STANDBY\n\n\"Investigations further revealed that no standby diver was appointed in the case of an emergency... Should a diver encounter an emergency situation, such as loss of consciousness, it would not be picked up by the buddy diver immediately as there was no line of sight or any form of lifeline provided.\"\n\nUWS will be sentenced on Feb 25.\n\nFor committing the offence, UWS can be fined up to $500,000.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d4d15e2fb4f494a593cfc6130e393dcfe8a92dbea550c3e814fa55181e3b5448/NP_20210115_SQMOM__6262240.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Chan Kum Weng's death was found to be a tragic misadventure.

There can be up to nine NMPs each term.\n\nLeader of the House Indranee Rajah, who is Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and was on the eight-member committee, hopes the new NMPs will bring fresh perspectives and ideas as Singapore works to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic and emerge stronger.\n\nThe others in the committee were Ministers Chan Chun Sing, Gan Kim Yong, Maliki Osman and Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister of State Gan Siow Huang, and Workers' Party MP for Aljunied GRC Leon Perera.\n\nPresident Halimah will present the Instruments of Appointment to the NMPs at the Istana next Thursday, and the NMPs will take their oath at the next sitting of Parliament next month.\n\nTHAM YUEN-C, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\n\nSingapore Politics\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 5, 2025, 12:36am\n\nPAP scouting early for next GE to give candidates more time on ground: PM Wong\n\nMay 21, 2025, 10:39pm\n\n5 key takeaways from PM Lawrence Wong's Cabinet reshuffle\n\nMay 13, 2025, 02:43am\n\nPAP to set up new branches in at least 6 locations, including Punggol, Tampines and Tengah\n\nMay 4, 2025, 11:49pm\n\nPAP leaders pledge to draw lessons from GE2025, focus on unity and global risks\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,\" Mr Trump said in a five-minute video on YouTube.\n\nMr Trump said the mob violence goes against everything he believes and everything his movement stands for.\n\n\"No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence,\" he said.\n\nHis comments are in stark contrast to what he said on Jan 6, which incited his supporters to attack the Capitol.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nParents' groups in S.

But even if he has left the White House, a Senate conviction of Mr Trump could lead to a vote on banning him from running for office again.\n\nMr Biden said it was important that a Senate impeachment trial in the early days of his term not delay work on his legislative priorities, including Cabinet confirmations, and urged Senate leaders to find a way to do both at the same time.\n\nUnder the US Constitution, impeachment in the House triggers a trial in the Senate. A two-thirds majority would be needed to convict and remove Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans in the 100-member chamber would have to join the Democrats. - THE STRAITS TIMES, REUTERS\n\nWORLD\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nAustralian couple to hire private jet to fly stranded pet dog home\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nNew Zealand to ban cigarettes for future generations\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nSub-variant of Delta may be helping to keep Japan's Covid numbers low\n\nDec 9, 2021, 10:00pm\n\nTracing app a must for most adults in bars, eateries in HK\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Yet easy chances missed by Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Son Heung-min were punished by Ivan Cavaleiro's headed equaliser for Fulham midway through the second half.\n\n\"In the second half, we had the biggest chance to kill the game but when you don't do it, you cannot concede goals the way we did,\" said Mourinho.\n\n\"This is the same story basically since the beginning of the season. We can talk about not killing the game yes, we can speak about that, and today was a clear situation where we could and should have killed the game in the first half.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"But then you go back to the goals that we concede and it's not also easy to assimilate that.\"\n\nIt was far from a vintage performance for Spurs defenders Davinson Sanchez and Eric Dier, who were both beaten in the air by Cavaleiro for Fulham's goal. Mourinho did not name names but pointed the finger at \"individual\" mistakes.\n\n\"There are some things they have to do with organisation of the team. But other things they have to do with individual skills, individual ability, and it's as simple as that,\" the Portuguese said when asked about his side switching off.\n\nMeanwhile, Fulham manager Scott Parker said he owes no apologies for fielding a strong side after Mourinho had voiced doubts over the seriousness of their Covid-19 issues.\n\nSpurs had been scheduled to face Aston Villa but that match was postponed after a Covid-19 outbreak forced the closure of the Villa's training ground.\n\nInstead, Spurs' home game with Fulham, itself postponed two hours before kick off on Dec 30 after an outbreak in the Fulham squad, was squeezed in.\n\nMourinho said on Monday if Fulham arrived for the match \"with their best team, I think they should apologise to all of us\", while Parker said it was \"scandalous\" to confirm the match only two days before kick-off.\n\nSaid Parker: \"Myself and this football club owe no one an apology because you can talk from the outside and people can see what they want to see and work out what the script was but it was far from that.\"\n\nSeveral players' preparations for the game had been impacted by the virus and health protocols, he said, adding: \"People need to understand the predicament we were in. We are not making it up.\" - REUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

We get to be the charm as well as the emotional sincerity.\"\n\nOdd things happen that let the audience know this is a sitcom unlike any other, and suddenly what started like a Bewitched episode turns into something from The Twilight Zone.\n\nOlsen said: \"There is a game that we're playing where the reality is fighting with the sitcom, and we maybe get a sense that something's not right.\n\n\"We did a sitcom boot camp. For me, a lot of it had to do with the placement of my voice, the rhythm and delivery of the dialogue, because it's not that we're depicting life in the 50s or 60s - we are depicting the sitcom version of the eras, and so it's so specific to the style and the physical comedy.\"\n\nBettany, 49, calling in from New York, calls WandaVision \"really bonkers\", and watched every episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show for his prep.\n\nHe said: \"The thing that's extraordinary is how gifted they are and how much work has gone into the skill that they have in physical comedy. They can play the guitar, they can play a ukulele, they can sing, they can dance, they can make jokes.\n\n\"I think Lizzie and I looked at each other and went, 'Woo, we've got a lot of work to do'. And so, we knuckled under and sort of rehearsed and practised doing those things.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is not an arbitrary decision that it's set in sitcoms. It will absolutely make sense as the two worlds collide.\"\n\nBettany revealed Episode 4 is the one that reveals more.\n\n\"It's quite a shift and so it's a really fun perspective swap and I think a lot gets understood at that moment.\"\n\nThe attention to detail and the resources expended is the same for Marvel whether it is a movie or TV show, according to Olsen.\n\n\"The only thing that felt different from filming a Marvel movie was the speed in which we had to film, because we had to film about three times more content than we do in these Marvel movies so we were always racing against time with this show,\" she said.\n\nBettany has been in lockdown with his US actress-wife Jennifer Connelly and their kids, Stellan, 17, and Agnes, nine.\n\nWhen asked what he's learned about quarantine, he said: \"To give each other space. I was really happy and proud of how we all weathered it together and we came out of it in very much the state we went into it.\n\n\"We didn't get into any rows and we stayed very calm. There was enough going on that was frantic and terrifying that it seemed stupid to make the house feel like that too.\"\n\nOlsen, on the other hand, is chafing at the lockdown restraints in London, where she will be for the next four months as the city faces its worst weeks of the pandemic.\n\nShe said: \"We're paused for a bit because the hospitals here are being overwhelmed and hopefully we get to go back (to filming the Doctor Strange sequel) in a couple of weeks.\n\n\"Everything's closed. The moment restaurants were open for like two weeks, I was like racing to them. I couldn't wait to get out.\n\n\"I've been really frustrated by the lack of human connection. The grocery store is like my favourite journey. In our normal lives, we try and get our groceries done once a week, but here during lockdown, I think, I'll save that for tomorrow so I have something to do.\"\n\nBy\n\nMeher Tatna\n\nEntertainment Columnist\n\nRead articles by Meher Tatna\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\n4\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\n1\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\n4\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\n1\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I have no complaints - this is my favourite (job). I can't get a better job.\"\n\nHo lauded Mr Medici, Hong Kong's champion stayer in the 2009/10 season.\n\nHis charge finished sixth behind Descarado in the 2010 Caulfield Cup and 10th behind Americain in the Melbourne Cup the same year.\n\n\"I learnt so much from Mr Medici,\" said Ho. \"Hong Kong racing is the best and I've learnt a lot here. Thank you to the Jockey Club for giving me the chance, the opportunities to learn from everybody, to learn from owners, learn from horses.\n\n\"Actually, I started in 1997 with seven horses - seven lame horses. Now, in 2021, I look back and I really appreciate the (fact) the Hong Kong Jockey Club looked after me so well.\n\n\"This (Baby Storm's win) is a good memory for me. Joao did a good job and he deserved it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, trainer Paul O'Sullivan hailed Chad Schofield's initiative after the Australian launched a decisive mid-race move to win the Class 4 Verbena Handicap over 2,200m on Victorious Seeker.\n\n\"He's like every jockey here in Hong Kong - they're world-class, they take their opportunities where they see them,\" said O'Sullivan.\n\n\"There was no discussion about those tactics before the race. But if you look at the sectionals, they ran the first 1,000 metres pretty quick and then, naturally enough, they buttoned off and, as they did, he got going.\n\n\"He's (Schofield) ridden the horse a few times - he's a pretty one-paced horse - and I think the fact he knew the horse pretty well is why he made that decision.\n\n\"You're a hero or zero when you make those decisions. He had enough experience to know that when he did take off, you keep going.\"\n\nThe victory continued Schofield's upward trajectory after Sunday's success on Speed Fay Fay at Sha Tin.\n\n\"Nice to get a winner for Paul, I haven't had one for a while,\" said Schofield.\n\n\"They went pretty quick the first bit and, when they slowed down, there was just no point me coming back with them, because I was out the back last and he just mathematically had no chance from where he was.\n\n\"So, when the pace slackened, I just let him bowl right around the field. Once he got to the lead, it was just a matter of keeping him going.\" - HKJC\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The last line also has to be more solid and we must train that,\" said Flick, who has yet to find his ideal defensive set-up with Suele, David Alaba and Benjamin Pavard all playing well below their best.\n\nKiel, who next face Darmstadt 98, kept their cool in the shoot-out to knock Bayern out at this stage of the German Cup for the first time since 2000.\n\n\"We believed throughout that we could spring a big surprise here tonight,\" Bartels said.\n\n\"We said we will convert all our penalties and we did.

His mounts are for six different trainers, proving his popularity with the support that he is getting.\n\nBut, while it looks a busy day, See may have wait until the Lucky Last to land his second winner since his comeback.\n\nLim's Bestbreaker, trained by Steven Burridge, is his best ride.\n\nOwned by the powerful Lim's Stable, which strongly supported See before his time out, the four-year-old New Zealand-bred is in top form.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\n0\n\nMore related stories\n\nWith a handy 53.5kg handicap and a middle lane, the bay gelding should prove hard to beat in the $50,000 Class 4 Div 1 event over the Polytrack 1,200m.\n\nWhat's more, he rounded up his preparations with a winning gallop with See aboard on Tuesday morning. He looked picture-perfect and pulled up on his toes. That was the best hit-out the whole morning.\n\nLim's Bestbreaker has hit a purple patch after four average runs. He has a second, a win and a second in his last three starts.\n\nHis win two starts ago on Nov 15 was very impressive. He came from slightly behind midfield to beat Mr Showman, who franked the form by winning subsequently in another Restricted Maiden race over the Poly 1,200m.\n\nLim's Bestbreaker himself went on to beat all but Water Rocket by a length in Class 4 on Dec 19. His pulverising run from the rear was eye-catching.\n\nWith his vast improvement, he should win again tomorrow.\n\nWith luck, See may also score on the Young Keah Yong-trained last-start runner-up Decreto in Race 6. He knows the horse like the back of his hand, having won three times on him.\n\nWho knows, See may also spring a couple of surprises, like he did on the Jerome Tan-trained Beer Garden last week.\n\nGood luck, Troy.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\n0\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\n0\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\n0\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c48f3268f896371dc26f004f8b65c9dd96cae11c3fa08700e2dc7c54ee5b922d/np_20210115_tlbest15_6259674.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jockey Troy See has nine rides in tomorrow's card of 10 at Kranji, with Lim's Bestbreaker in the final event as his best chance.

The swops are in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.\n\n\"While we are excited to welcome James and his family to the Nets, we also want to thank the players who are departing,\" Marks said.\n\n\"Caris, Jarrett, Rodions and Taurean were instrumental to the team's success and have made an enormous impact on our organisation. It has been a pleasure watching them grow both as players and as people and they will always be part of our Nets family.\n\n\"We wish each of them and their families all the best in the future.\"\n\nHarden, 31, held out of training camp and told the Rockets he wanted a trade.\n\nHe said he was frustrated by the direction of the team without team president Daryl Morey and head coach Mike D'Antoni, who left the franchise following the 2020 play-offs held in the bubble in Orlando.\n\nD'Antoni is an assistant to first-year head coach Steve Nash with the Nets. Harden also reunites with Durant, his teammate for his first three NBA seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nHarden has led the NBA in scoring in each of the past three seasons with averages of 30.4, 36.1 and 34.3 points. The timing of the deal could boost the Nets' offence with Irving missing five consecutive games due to personal reasons. - REUTERS\n\nNBA\n\nBasketball\n\nHOUSTON ROCKETS\n\nbrooklyn nets\n\njames harden\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 20, 2023, 08:38am\n\nNBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar pokes fun at 'great fall' that broke his hip\n\nJul 13, 2023, 08:56am\n\nLA Lakers star LeBron James says no intention of retiring yet\n\nJun 21, 2023, 05:46am\n\nAll eyes on 'game-changer' Wembanyama at NBA Draft\n\nJun 16, 2023, 11:32am\n\nConor McGregor accused of sexual assault at NBA game\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8135520156fa9fc493309bcb2978431f314fcfa6ed10fb5a7631522a2dcbe254/harden15.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "James Harden, who joined the Brooklyn Nets from the Houston Rockets on Thursday, has led the NBA in scoring in each of the past three seasons with averages of 30.4, 36.1 and 34.3 points.

He was issued a notice of composition for $200.\n\nNParks is also investigating a man for feeding more than 10 wild hornbills at a condominium.\n\nOutreach and education efforts to raise awareness of the harm caused by feeding will be stepped up, added NParks.\n\nAmong these plans is a partnership with the National Environment Agency and Singapore Food Agency to reduce food sources for wildlife at establishments such as hawker centres and coffee shops.\n\nAnother plan will see three young people, mentored by NParks, studying the public perception of feeding wildlife to develop initiatives that encourage human-wildlife coexistence by the third quarter of this year.\n\nNParks reminds the public that if they encounter a wild boar, they should remain calm and move slowly away from the animal.

Users outside of Europe who do not accept the new terms of service will be booted from the app.\n\nAmid privacy concerns, many users across the globe, including in Singapore, have migrated to alternative messaging platforms, with Telegram and Signal seeing major boosts in new downloads.\n\nOn Tuesday, WhatsApp reassured users that it would still respect their privacy, and neither it nor Facebook can access users' private messages or calls as message content is encrypted end to end.\n\nIt added that the changes are related to messages between consumers and businesses over WhatsApp, a feature available in Singapore since August 2018.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 06:16am\n\nWhen is it acceptable to address a stranger as 'uncle' or 'aunty'?\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut some companies can now choose to store the messages securely on Facebook's servers to help them manage the chats.\n\nAnd while Facebook will not automatically use a user's chats with businesses to shape advertisements targeting the user, a business can use the chat data for its marketing purposes, including ads on Facebook.\n\nA check on the Apple App Store also shows that user data harvested by WhatsApp includes purchase history, payment info, coarse location, e-mail address, phone number, contacts, and user ID and device ID, much more than what Telegram and Signal collect.\n\nA local user, Miss Geraldine Mark, 27, told The New Paper: \"The data they intend to share is an infringement on my privacy. I feel uncomfortable knowing it will be shared across platforms and have no say in opting out without deleting the app.\" The financial adviser said she has moved several of her conversations to Telegram.\n\nBut, like many users, she has found it is not so easy to part ways with WhatsApp, which has two billion users worldwide, unless one's contacts migrate to another app in tandem.\n\nAs she uses WhatsApp mainly for work and relies on it for important information that is difficult to move to other platforms, Miss Mark sees herself reluctantly accepting the new terms before the deadline.\n\nMadam Lok Chee Yun, 63, fears what may happen in the longer term.\n\n\"The information we allow them to collect may end up being used to bombard us with advertisements in the future,\" the auditor said.\n\nWhile she finds WhatsApp convenient to keep in touch with her extended family and friends, she will consider switching to other apps after discussing with her close contacts if they would do likewise.\n\nExperts TNP spoke to said the changes are aimed at helping the marketing strategies of Facebook and Instagram, which the former acquired in 2012.\n\nDr Ori Sasson, director of cyber intelligence firm S2T, said: \"If you have Facebook or Instagram but use WhatsApp more, the other two platforms can gain more information about you with access to data on how you use WhatsApp.\"\n\nMr Jonathan Kok, a tech lawyer at Withers Tech, said: \"As a social media platform that relies on advertising revenue, having more precise information about its users will attract more advertisers to sign up.\"\n\nDigital communication executive Muhammad Jazly, 27, has concerns whether his data will end up being used for purposes other than targeted advertising.\n\nWhile noting WhatsApp's assurance to users, he said: \"There is always a possibility their position might change in the future. I will consider deleting WhatsApp and relying on other messaging platforms.\"\n\nMr David Alfred, co-head of data protection, privacy and cyber-security practice at law firm Drew & Napier, said a user's view on privacy will ultimately decide whether he sticks with WhatsApp or moves on.\n\nHe said: \"Some may see this as a beneficial development - Facebook trying to understand them better to offer them better or new services in the future.\n\n\"But others will see it as an intrusion on their privacy and do not want a commercial organisation to have more information about them than it already has.\"\n\nFOR MORE, READ THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nCOURTS\n\nBosch x Courts SG60 Sale: Hero Bundle at $5,199 (U.P. $13,794!)\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8d5a3d102d787b77fe2c45b0076a7d78718771eb10e95a12e3a9459589e4b3a9/NP_20210114_SDDATA14_6259268.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO: AFP"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1e653987afb4de41d0b5d0d702be61ec9c3391f84524d15abdeafe77ef55c1d8/uncleaunty.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "When is it acceptable to address a stranger as 'uncle' or 'aunty'?", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2d1bba61851db6bb810f774a0c5e36d866faeea662523e916696e917e19f7b68/494499996_10161367538978494_7655410508476495392_n.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Wheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

To say the decor was once dated is being kind.\n\nThe hotel bar just underwent a revamp - it reopened in November - and while it still carries a 1920s vibe, it is a lot trendier now. I love the dramatic oval tungsten lamps that hug the ceiling. They make the place Insta-worthy.\n\nLooks aside, the bar programme at Club 5 created by head bartender Ong Jun Han is another draw. There are cocktails inspired by the heritage of the area.\n\nNASI LEMA'R TIPPLE\n\nInteresting choices include the Nasi Lema'rgarita ($20), featuring housemade coconut tequila shaken with spicy pandan syrup and served with peanuts and anchovies.\n\nThe Boogie Street ($22) is also noteworthy. It is a smoky London dry gin sour shaken with mezcal, apricot liqueur and agave syrup, and served in a vintage coupe glass with an ice ball on a sequinned coaster.\n\nBecause I am a lousy drinker, my bar experience is more about the food than the alcohol, and my visit to Club 5 kicked off instead with Asian Chips with Balado Sambal ($10).\n\nIt was a great start because although chips at a bar is hardly new, the sambal did appeal to me. It was not too spicy and packed with aroma and savoury notes.\n\nExtreme flavours will mute the drinking experience, so this struck a good balance.\n\nMuch stronger in flavours was the Crispy Lamb Ribs with Mint Sauce ($15), and it ended up as my favourite dish of the night.\n\nThe braised lamb ribs are deep fried and accompanied by a homemade Thai green mint sauce.\n\nI like that the fattiness of the meat is present, which gives a hint of gaminess when you bite into it.\n\nAlso good was the Homemade Wagyu Satay with Hazelnut Dip ($15). The meat is marinated with turmeric and local spices, then grilled on a skewer. The meat is tender, and while the dip is good, it was not at all needed.\n\nI have a shortlist of places that sell good har cheong gai (or prawn paste chicken). The version at Club 5 - named Our Signature Chicken Wings ($15) - is nice but will not make my list.\n\nThe wings are marinated in prawn paste sauce for 36 hours, then served with chilli and tamarind sauce. The meat retains its juiciness but lacks depth in flavour.\n\nThe bar food menu is tiny but even so, not all are winners.\n\nThe Chicken Kuih Pie Tee with Buah Keluak Dressing ($15) left no impression on me, except that it is beautifully presented.\n\nBut Club 5, after all, is not a restaurant, and the fun cocktails should rightfully get the limelight - which they do.\n\nThe combination of aesthetics, tipple and good eats will hopefully restore Club 5 back to its former glory.\n\nAnd even if the crowd does not turn up, you now know of a place you can imbibe and take pictures in peace.\n\nClub 5\n\nParkroyal on Beach Road Tel: 6505-5699 Open Wednesday to Sunday, 11am to 10.30pm\n\nBy\n\nYeoh Wee Teck\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Yeoh Wee Teck\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Supervisors could take a more understanding view and allow employees to come in during off-peak hours,\" said Associate Professor John Wong Chee Meng, a mental health expert at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.\n\nHe was among those who spoke at the a panel discussion moderated by Singapore Kindness Movement general secretary Dr William Wan.\n\nGiven that many have already been working from home for months, Prof Wong said: \"It's a good time, during the pandemic, for all workplaces to consider how they may recalibrate work arrangements to provide better work-life balance for employees.\"\n\nCiting a survey in August last year by Engagerocket, an employee engagement and performance software provider, which found that most Singaporeans wished to continue working from home, professional speaker and entrepreneur, Ms Wong Su-Yen, said companies should think about how best to support their employees in doing so.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:21am\n\n'I still can't get over it': Flight, cabin crew mull over new course after Jetstar Asia closure\n\n1\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"It might require a shift in budget from real estate to support in other ways,\" said Ms Wong, adding that employers could ensure the right ergonomics for their employees and good Wi-Fi connections when they work from home.\n\nBeyond working arrangements, the panellists also highlighted the importance of providing emotional support to employees by creating a more empathetic work environment.

SCRM will continue to monitor the waters,\" added the spokesman.\n\nDr Sandric Leong, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Tropical Marine Science Institute, said the coloured water was caused by picocyanobacteria bloom - a form of algae bloom.\n\nA bloom is caused when a large amount of algae or cyanobacteria accumulates in the water, resulting from high amounts of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen.\n\nHe added that the heavy and persistent rain over the past couple of weeks may have contributed to the bloom.\n\nThe NEA said there is no indication of any industrial or marine pollution that could have impacted the waters in the surrounding area.\n\nAlgae blooms can remove dissolved oxygen from the water, causing marine life to suffer. But it is unclear if the fish deaths and coloured water are linked, the experts emphasised.\n\nCommon causes of fish deaths include oxygen deprivation, toxins produced by algae blooms and high concentrations of algae species that can damage the gills of fishes, said Associate Professor Federico Lauro from Nanyang Technological University's Asian School of the Environment.\n\nMr Dan Paris, 54, a resident of South Cove's Turquoise condominium, bemoaned how lifeless the waterway has become this past week.\n\n\"In Sentosa Cove, you have this marine life around you - fish, heron, otters. I didn't see any otters last weekend,\" said Mr Paris, who works in marketing.\n\n\"And the herons, eagles and kingfishers were picking up the dead fish floating in the waters. Those fish might be contaminated.\"\n\nSHABANA BEGUM\n\nEnvironment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 1, 2025, 11:46pm\n\n'Pig-faced' rare bat sighting at Lower Peirce sparks buzz among nature fans\n\nDec 10, 2024, 03:22am\n\nEven corals grow up in HDB-style homes in Singapore\n\nNov 8, 2024, 03:55am\n\nEverything you wanted to know about water heaters but never asked\n\nMay 22, 2024, 04:27pm\n\nCetta expands into new sectors by acquiring stake in EAS.ai\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Many question their capabilities and think that any success is a fluke, and often feel inadequate and unworthy.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:21am\n\n'I still can't get over it': Flight, cabin crew mull over new course after Jetstar Asia closure\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Female entrepreneurs specifically will downplay their success, over-consume information to feel like they know more, and constantly refine their work to make sure it is 'good enough'.\"\n\nShe added: \"Sometimes this leads to overwork and burnout for more established entrepreneurs, but it can also lead to analysis paralysis and procrastination when they are just starting out.\"\n\nThere are ways to help work through this form of dysfunctional thinking and allow your self-worth and self-belief to catch up with achievements.\n\n• Find out where you are on the impostor scale\n\nStart by taking the Clance IP Test to see where you rank and to what extent you are suffering from impostor syndrome.\n\nIt is designed to measure one's fear of evaluation, fear of not being able to repeat success and fear of being less capable than others.\n\n• Gender norms may contribute to impostor syndrome\n\nConventional gender norms do play a part in women feeling especially susceptible to impostor syndrome.\n\nMs Parekh singles out the subconscious programming that starts from young and naturally shapes one's belief system and definition of self-worth.\n\nShe said: \"While the research shows that women and men suffer from impostor syndrome at varying degrees, women may feel more fraudulent because of experiences from childhood and societal/cultural norms and expectations with regard to how women should think and act.\n\n\"So many of us are taught as young women to be seen and not heard, not to boast about our accomplishments so others don't feel bad, and to base our worth on external validation instead of looking for it within ourselves.\"\n\n• Not all 'impostors' are the same\n\nIt is not unusual for women to experience both ends of the spectrum depending on the stage of their life.\n\nFor instance, tendencies to overconsume information and procrastinate tend to affect beginning stage entrepreneurs/career women and sometimes manifests as self-sabotaging emotions of feeling not good enough.\n\nThe senior manager who always comes across as a superwoman?\n\nMs Parekh cautions that she might be that way because she never feels good enough and continually seeks external validation.\n\nAnother telltale sign? Extreme emotional highs and lows depending on if she feels like she is doing well or poorly.\n\n• The root of impostor syndrome\n\nAs with most dysfunctional behaviours, the negative patterns usually take root from childhood.\n\nWhile working through the past can be messy business, it is also a reservoir of solutions, and when done right, can permanently bring about positive changes.\n\nMs Parekh said: \"I like to remind my clients that when they are feeling low and negative towards themselves, to envision themselves as their childhood self, inherently worthy without the need to perform or produce for external validation.\n\n\"Overcoming impostor syndrome is routinely challenging your negative thoughts and subconscious programming with factual evidence and the understanding that these thoughts and feelings are not factual, they are simply stories you are allowing to stand in the way of what you truly want to achieve.\"\n\nSimple strategies to deal with impostor syndrome:\n\nKeep an accomplishment journal\n\nRead or update it on a daily basis. People who suffer from impostor syndrome are always looking at what they have to accomplish to be good enough instead of assessing the evidence as to why they already have so much to be proud of.\n\nName your inner impostor\n\nGive this persona a different name than your own so you can decipher between yourself and your negative thoughts. By doing this, you can monitor what things \"she\" says to you on a daily basis, specifically around worthiness and the work you are producing. And whenever a negative thought creeps in, ask yourself - is this me, or is this her?\n\nKeep a journal or start voice notes\n\nThis will help you become aware of how negative and subconscious your thoughts are and you can work to shift these beliefs.\n\nPractise belief-bridging\n\nThe brain will do what it is told, so if you tell yourself - \"I am not a good public speaker\" - this does not leave room for the brain to think otherwise and it will look for evidence to support this belief. Try to think: \"I am open to seeing how I can be a good public speaker.\"\n\nThis will give you a subconscious reason to look for evidence to support this belief through conscious thought.\n\nThis article was first published in Her World Online (\n\nwww.HerWorld.com\n\n).\n\nCHARLENE FANG\n\nEmployment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 10:34pm\n\nNearly 40 employers offer 450 roles at job fair for retrenched Jetstar Asia staff\n\nJun 11, 2025, 05:29am\n\nNTUC exploring options to match retrenched Jetstar Asia staff to roles at SIA Group\n\nApr 28, 2025, 03:33am\n\nSingapore's Q1 unemployment up slightly\n\nJan 30, 2025, 11:43pm\n\nEstate cleaners give manager kickbacks for fear of losing jobs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nCombat Siege\n\nThe most realistic game 2025.

Every setback magnifies his deficiencies to coach at the highest level.\n\nLast week's League Cup semi-final defeat by Manchester City further exposed the ongoing flaws in his managerial make-up when it comes to cup competitions, as did the humiliating manner of United's departure from the Champions League group stages.\n\nBut the Norwegian has put together an unbeaten stretch in his past 11 EPL matches, and could well and truly silence the naysayers if he extends the run against Liverpool.\n\nAfter suffering a home loss to Arsenal in early November, United have taken 29 points out of a possible 33 with only Leicester City and Pep Guardiola's side denying them.\n\nFRED RESTED\n\nAt Turf Moor, Solskjaer demonstrated qualities which promises to serve his side well on Merseyside with Nemanja Matic chosen to weather the midfield contest ahead of Fred.\n\nThe Brazil international will be unleashed against a Liverpool team fighting to defend their crown while down on their luck domestically, after a winless run of three top-flight games.\n\nWith Fred fresh, the 20-time EPL champions look primed to frustrate their hosts.\n\nMore than most, Solskjaer knows that United are approaching a critical juncture in the campaign with a wide-open title race that leaves increasingly little margin for error.\n\nBesides the Reds, he must contend with as many as four other clubs prepared to pounce, with City still appearing best placed to take advantage of the slightest slip-up.\n\nShould City defeat Brighton this morning and win their other game in hand, they will move to within a point of United.\n\nLeicester and Everton, while very much outsiders, also remain in reach of the pinnacle with just one win fewer than the current leaders.\n\nIf United are still clinging to the top spot by season's end on May 23, they are set to go down as one of the most uninspiring EPL champions in recent memory, with a projected tally of 80 points mirroring Ferguson's class of 2010/11 that were dubbed the \"Unconvincibles\".\n\nA favourable run of fixtures after this weekend, facing just two top-half opponents in their next seven games, affords United a perfect opportunity to build momentum as well as staving off credible threats posed by several members of the chasing pack.\n\nEmerging from Anfield still in first place will confirm Solskjaer's men as true title-contenders.\n\nBy\n\nRichard Buxton\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Richard Buxton\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

In the current climate where the game is so sanitised, he gets a little bit of the ball but certainly goes over the top and catches him.\"\n\n\"That is reckless and dangerous. He is really lucky,\" added Redknapp, who believes Brady should have been sent off too had play not been brought back.\n\nWhile agreeing with Redknapp over Shaw's foul, fellow pundit Gary Neville has also told United fans to \"get carried away\".\n\n\"I don't think anyone is saying Manchester United will win the league, but the fact that they are in a title fight… wow. I never would have imagined it,\" said Neville on Sky Sports.\n\n\"It's a strange season. Why shouldn't Manchester United fans believe? Why shouldn't this side believe?\" - AFP, REUTERS\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 28, 2024, 06:55am\n\nBen Davis' ASEAN Cup participation threatened by NS default\n\nJul 29, 2024, 12:41am\n\nSingapore physiotherapist flying the flag in London\n\nMay 15, 2024, 03:14am\n\nMbappe will join Real Madrid\n\nMay 14, 2024, 02:44pm\n\nOnly captains will be permitted to speak to referees at Euro 2024\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/881b822cb05c9bb6d38a7d82fc546964a655196c4731e743c49ba3f191172dba/NP_20210114_UNITED14_6259508.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.", "caption": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
