MOH did not reveal how many had tested positive for influenza.\n\nMOH said it is in contact with the school to advise on infection control measures.\n\nThis comes after some classes at Nanyang Primary School were put on home-based learning on Tuesday and Wednesday, with several cases of fever, cough and sore throat detected since Jan 26.\n\nThe school's principal Wong Li Peng told The Straits Times on Monday that pupils were strongly encouraged to wear masks in school this week as a precautionary measure, and the school had since stopped physical morning assemblies and reduced group activities.\n\nParents were notified that the school would clean and disinfect classrooms and common areas, and teachers would remind pupils to practise good hygiene, including washing their hands frequently and wiping down surfaces.\n\nThe ministry said it routinely monitors the virus through avenues such as the average daily number of patients seeking treatment in the polyclinics for acute respiratory infections.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the number of cases in the past four weeks, from Dec 25 to Jan 22, has remained stable.\n\nAccording to MOH's weekly infectious bulletin on its website, the average daily number of patients seeking treatment in the polyclinics for acute respiratory infections was 2,336 from Dec 25 to Dec 31, 2,560 from Jan 1 to Jan 7, 2,400 from Jan 8 to Jan 14 and 2,405 from Jan 15 to Jan 21.\n\nInfluenza activity in Singapore typically increases in the middle of the year, from May to July, and at the end of the year, from November to January, MOH said.\n\nThe ministry advised the public to maintain good hygiene by washing their hands regularly with soap and water, especially before touching one's eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nPeople who are unwell should also seek medical treatment promptly, wear a mask when going out and avoid close contact with others.\n\nYong Li Xuan\n\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH)\n\nINFLUENZA\n\nPRIMARY SCHOOLS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/edb4eaac20cac4bb98ac5667b64b45f660e7d3d29e11e5b63f0e7cf11b21e8b1/2023013187220045b2da6148-f216-4248-87a1-c648239856bc.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Based on information from the school, none of the cases have tested positive for Covid-19. \n", "caption": "Based on information from the school, none of the cases have tested positive for Covid-19.

Because you think it's not appropriate right?\"\n\nThe man disagreed, saying the amount was what he was \"comfortable\" with.\n\n'Insufferable'\n\nThe post attracted a flurry of comments, with most calling out the girlfriend's actions.\n\nOne Redditor pointed out that the greater impropriety is the girlfriend's willingness to \"sour the relationship\" and stir trouble between the man and his parents over a hongbao.\n\nOthers simply cut to the chase; one simply warned the man not to \"upgrade\" his girlfriend to become his wife.\n\nhongbao\n\nchinese new year\n\nDATING/RELATIONSHIPS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9c781b28d8321cee86e880f8d3365c96ae97492179a92d35403f3df43e0320b8/red2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "ST PHOTO: JOYCE FANG"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5099ed2b7992d2339bbf56d1cd6105d238f820091a102ab1a69200c79bff839e/reddit-angbao-6-1.jpg?w=295", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2ce89032b28ece1ca2f88ebb010f14fa1ff8249d30efbec318635486fb7a7938/reddit-angbao-2.jpg?w=137", "alt_text": "759", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But it happens in top football. We wish (it didn't) happen but it did and you have to deal with it,\" he said.\n\n\"As you said, on deadline day is difficult (to sign a replacement), you can't make policy on bad injuries. We have good players in the midfield department, players who can fill the gap.\n\n\"I think you can never fill that gap (completely) because very player has his own characteristics. Another player will always fill in a different way, but it doesn't mean you have to be less successful.\n\n\"It's quite clear Christian Eriksen brings top quality to our squad and he has some specifics that are hard to replace, such as his impacts in the final third with his final ball.\"\n\nThe United boss also said that Fred would be the midfielder who will benefit the most from Eriksen's absence.\n\n\"He's playing together with Casemiro in the Brazil squad... Brazil have so many choices they can make, but they play together and that tells you something about the quality Fred has and what he can contribute to the team.\n\n\"He has a lot of qualities, and they're a good combination, Casemiro and Fred.\"\n\nOn the bright side, ten Hag is now potentially only two games away from winning United's first trophy since they won the Europa League under Jose Mourinho in 2017.\n\nThe 3-0 victory at the City Ground last week meant he is able to rest his first-team players with three Premier League matches - against Crystal Palace and Leeds twice - coming up in the next 10 days.\n\nNo team who have held a three-goal lead from the first leg of a League Cup semi-final have ever lost, so the odds are looking good for United.\n\nForest, meanwhile, are suffering from a flu bug in their squad and a long injury list, which will make it even harder for them to conjure up a miracle on Wednesday.\n\nLast week's defeat was their eighth in a row against United in all competitions, and not since the 1994-95 Premier League season have Forest won at Old Trafford.\n\n\"We were obviously disappointed with the first leg, but that's the situation,\" said Forest boss Steve Cooper.\n\n\"It's obviously an incredibly tough task to qualify.\" - REUTERS\n\nLEAGUE CUP\n\nManchester United\n\nerik ten hag\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/37115bcbef9da9477640a73f82795c3cb21ed8073290716a08c94998de441f9f/2023-01-28T211535Z1115695494UP1EJ1S1N1WX2RTRMADP3SOCCER-ENGLAND-MUN-RDG-REPORT_3.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Manchester United's Christian Eriksen (left) was injured by Reading's Andy Carroll during their FA Cup clash on Jan 28.", "caption": "Manchester United's Christian Eriksen (left) was injured by Reading's Andy Carroll during their FA Cup clash on Jan 28.

His local form before that was useful. (1) VICTOR RAIL raced greenly in a smart debut and would have come on from that effort. He meets a weak field. (6) COTTON RON has been knocking on the door and is as one of the top contenders. (12) TIGER IN RED was much improved on the Poly last run. The colt meets a weak field on the turf and should have a strong chance.\n\nRace 3 (1,400m)\n\n(4) SEA OF TEARS was a beaten favourite last run. With cheekpieces fitted, the filly could make amends. (9) KITTYBOYS GIRL has been knocking on the door and it looks as if it may open although there are others looking to keep it closed. (13) APPROACHABLE LASS has put in two smart efforts on Poly and turf. Still improving, the filly should be competitive. (3) KABON KAPI has had only two outings, both on Poly, and did not finish far behind. The filly is back from a lengthy break but looks promising.\n\nRace 4 (1,500m)\n\n(9) PRINCESS JO shed her maiden tag second-up. She started favourite in her handicap debut and was not far back. This is a weak field. (4) SEA EAGLE backs up quickly after her last start in which she was in need of a run. The mare takes a big drop in class. (3) FAMILY FAVOURITE has been trying further but was a promising second over the trip on the Poly last run against much stronger company. (5) VALERIAS DREAM takes a small drop in the ratings but has been well supported in the market since her maiden win. Watch.\n\nRace 5 (1,750m)\n\n(7) PARIS PIKE is the best rated in this Graduation Plate and is in top form. He rates the one to beat. (5) EL REY VIENE showed up well first run in a handicap after a most impressive maiden victory. He looks to have some class. (1) MEETATTHEWINDSOR made steady improvement leading into his maiden win. He looks progressive and has the best draw. (8) LILLYBELLE is having her third run after a break. The filly finished close-up in both starts. She gets a 1.5kg allowance and can give the boys a run for the money.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nRace 6 (1,000m)\n\n(2) ONE TOO MANY has smart Poly form over the trip and has dropped in class.

With Keagan de Melo staying on board, he should be competitive. (8) PHILISPIEL has consistent form over the trip and goes well on turf.

Do not leave out.\n\nRace 7 (1,200m)\n\n(4) DONQUERARI is down in class. With a 2.5kg claimer aboard, he should be competitive. (6) QUEST FOR THE BEST took a 10-point hit in handicap for his last win. He has always promised to deceive but may have just found his best. (2) PETIT VERDOT was not far back in her first run out of the maidens. This is not a strong field and she could finish in the money. (9) NORTHERN WARRIOR is never far off and his two best recent efforts have been down the Scottsville straight. Chance.\n\nRace 8 (1,200m)\n\n(12) THERE SHE GOES comes with useful Highveld form over the trip. The two-time winner could be the one to beat. (9) SPIRITED FLIGHT was a narrow winner second-up, after starting favourite on debut. Both her starts have been over this course and distance. She could follow up. (2) GRUE OF ICE has her first run for a new stable. She has shown potential and the change of routine could bring out her best. (4) TRIPTOROYALTY has steady form over a shorter distance on Poly. Her turf form is not great but that was in August 2022.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9ca8551ed865e47a825b6334cf14ab48e71d62ca3266eedf8f83d44dd54c12a6/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 14 & 15", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6119828eb9a0fcd6d3eb1e0471fdc0361632ff03246080fb7448db765b775510/JohnSize.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "All hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment", "caption": null}]}

The previous high was 25 in 2005.\n\nA total of 32,325 dengue cases were reported in 2022, according NEA's quarterly dengue surveillance data for October to December 2022, which was released on Tuesday.\n\nThis is the second-highest number of cases in a year - the record high being 35,315 cases in 2020.\n\nMost of the cases in 2022 were of the DenV-3 serotype, or strain, of the dengue virus, which made up 62.3 per cent of the cases reported in December.\n\nNEA had previously identified DenV-3 as one reason for the high number of cases last year as the population here has lower immunity against the strain.\n\nAs at 3pm on Monday, 1,019 cases of dengue have been reported in 2023.\n\nIn January,\n\nthe agency warned of a potential dengue outbreak here this year.\n\nAs at Jan 30, there are 50 active dengue clusters, of which 13 clusters had 10 or more cases. NEA noted that the DenV-3 strain had been detected in 10 of these 13 clusters.\n\nDengue expert Tikki Pang - a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine - had previously told The Straits Times that vaccination could help protect the elderly and the vulnerable, noting that the majority of deaths from the disease here are among those aged 65 and above.\n\nIn a written parliamentary reply in July last year, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical had submitted its dengue vaccine candidate for registration in Singapore, and that the Health Sciences Authority was reviewing the application.\n\nMr Ong described the vaccine, named Qdenga, as the \"most advanced\" among six dengue vaccine candidates in various stages of clinical development.\n\nIn December, Qdenga - which provides protection against all four dengue strains - was authorised for use in the European Union.\n\nZhaki Abdullah\n\nDengue fever\n\nNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY\n\nDISEASES\n\nShare this article", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/25b853d6c48076262106a4cebf53e0abe9e026285068748b4bc622bcdc058698/20230102505741790ec70894-63ad-4424-8963-6ee3d43026ff_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "This is the second-highest number of cases in a year - the record high being 35,315 cases in 2020.", "caption": "This is the second-highest number of cases in a year - the record high being 35,315 cases in 2020.

So far, 44 people have come forward to say they could not get their refund.\n\nStudent Min Khant, 21, who contacted Mr Goyal, said: \"As soon as I realised that the event was cancelled, I tried to get a refund instead of using the redemption code for the other event that has yet to be confirmed.\n\n\"After I didn't get a reply, I assumed that I was being scammed and made a police report.\"\n\nThe police have confirmed that reports have been lodged and they are looking into the matter.\n\nResponding to queries by The Straits Times, Sentosa Development Corporation said that D1 Racing booked the space on Siloso Beach in October.\n\n\"Upon being informed of the event's cancellation, SDC immediately requested the event organiser to inform all ticket holders of the cancellation as they were solely responsible for all marketing, ticket sales and execution of the event,\" SDC said.\n\nRasif said she had pulled out of the event for personal reasons.\n\nShe told ST that she found out that she was one of the featured acts only on D1 Racing's Facebook advertisement, and that she then asked the organiser for payment and assurance that it had the necessary licences for the event.\n\nShe added: \"We reminded the organisers that my attendance was not confirmed until we received a deposit and conducted due diligence, and requested they stop using me in ads until then.\n\n\"We ceased any further negotiations with D1 after realising some inaccuracies in their contract.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old, who is also a social media influencer, said that the organiser did not have permission to use pictures of her in its promotion, and was told four times to remove them, but it was not done.\n\nReplying to ST queries, D1 Racing said that the event had to be cancelled due to drastic changes, adding that it was \"left stranded and had no choice but to cancel the event\".\n\nD1 Racing said it will provide free VIP tickets for its next event regardless of the ticket tier that customers bought for the Siloso beach party.\n\n\"We will be issuing wallets to all guests and topping them up with the amount that each guest paid,\" it said.\n\n\"This will enable them to purchase other products or tickets to other events as well.\"\n\nGabrielle Chan\n\nsentosa\n\nNew Year's Day\n\nCONCERTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 13, 2025, 02:39am\n\nChinese tourist's daughter cuts toe while playing at beach club during holiday\n\nNov 4, 2024, 11:04pm\n\nMoney launderer Su Baolin's former Sentosa Cove plot sold for $22m\n\nOct 22, 2024, 11:12pm\n\nBukom oil spill cleanup nears end, no new slicks spotted\n\nOct 21, 2024, 03:25am\n\nNo sign of oil at Sentosa beaches, waters near desalination plants\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e4e95649b2ded0b46f7c1d1da79e1edb0c32a6396f2ab7fbf8be91ae0a69f21f/IMG20221203100199150111UJ12JJH_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "ZoukOut, a two­-day dusk-­to-­dawn electronic dance music festival, makes a return to Sentosa’s Siloso Beach after a three-year hiatus. ", "caption": "ZoukOut, a two­-day dusk-­to-­dawn electronic dance music festival, makes a return to Sentosa’s Siloso Beach after a three-year hiatus.

He's the optimal fit in our system with his attacking style of play and dynamism, and his mentality and experience fit very well in our team.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 28, 2024, 04:58am\n\nHarry Kane receives European Golden Shoe in Munich\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We have now brought in Yann Sommer, Daley Blind and Joao.

I'm also driven by the hunger for success. I'll give my best for FC Bayern.\"\n\nBayern, who top the Bundesliga but have failed to win since the restart after the World Cup, have also been boosted by the return of forward Sadio Mane, ahead of their upcoming Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain. The 30-year-old trained with the ball in the Tuesday morning session, one week after his return to the training pitch.\n\nMane injured a tendon in his leg during his side's 6-1 win over Werder Bremen in November and required surgery that forced him to miss Senegal's World Cup campaign in Qatar.\n\nBayern travel to the Parc des Princes for the first leg of the Champions League last 16 tie on Feb 14, with the return fixture in Munich on March 8.\n\nCoach Julian Nagelsmann previously said he \"would not count on\" the reigning African Player of the Year to be available for the first leg.\n\nMane, who signed for the Bavarian giants from Liverpool in the summer of 2022, has scored 11 goals in 23 games in all competitions this season. - REUTERS, AFP\n\nbayern munich\n\nmanchester city\n\nepl\n\nPortugal\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 26, 2024, 08:52am\n\nVincent Kompany praises Bayern's 'outstanding mentality'\n\nMay 15, 2024, 02:14am\n\nAncelotti confident for Champions League final\n\nMay 7, 2024, 07:50am\n\nReal must 'improve' to overcome Bayern in Champions League\n\nApr 28, 2024, 02:38am\n\nKane double steers Bayern 2-1 past Frankfurt ahead of Real clash\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/49824d28d3d6ee6cdc283267a2b3776410ba7e8fffad909cf1c283e244e70766/joao_cancelo.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The versatile 28-year-old Joao Cancelo has predominantly played as a left back but can also operate on the right flank.", "caption": "The versatile 28-year-old Joao Cancelo has predominantly played as a left back but can also operate on the right flank.

He gets another shot in Class 4, which could prove decisive over the concluding stages.\n\n2 Compassion Super notched his second success in nine starts last time. Remaining in Class 4, he can go on with it again.\n\nRace 8 (1,200m)\n\n9 Sugar Sugar rises to Class 3. He has shown previously that he appears capable of competing in this grade. Expect him to do exactly that with the light weight from an inside gate.\n\n5 Humble Star appears to have a nice future and must be considered a serious chance with the booking of de Sousa.\n\n11 Howdeepisyourlove is in superb form. He was competitive last start at his first try in Class 3.\n\n1 Adios knows what it is all about. He should be fighting out the finish.\n\nRace 9 (1,200m)\n\n3 Armour Eagle was strong to the line last start when scoring in this grade. He draws ideally and, if he gets a cheap run throughout, should get every chance to go back-to-back.\n\n7 Gold Gold Baby is looking for a fifth hurrah this term. He draws the right gate, too.\n\n1 Excellent Peers has to overcome a wide gate and hefty weight but he has champion jockey Zac Purton as his pilot.\n\n11 Science Patch has the right form and he should get the right run. Next best.\n\n*Comments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/86ecd51197ab6514ebc089aad85efee98b19bc2ec06dc8a25322bdc80096928a/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "After two runs in Class 2, Tianchi Monster (No. 3) is back in Class 3, the level of all his six wins.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nNewcastle had all the momentum, sweeping forward in a black and white wave that left Southampton powerless to stem the tide.\n\nOnce again it was Longstaff who provided the finishing touch to a breathtaking raid in the 21st minute.\n\nExposing Southampton's fragile wing-back system, Joe Willock sprinted into space behind James Bree and found Miguel Almiron, whose cutback was drilled home by Longstaff.\n\nNewcastle keeper Nick Pope had kept 10 successive clean-sheets, but his unbeaten streak ended in the 29th minute.\n\nCompletely against the run of play, Willock gifted possession to Adams and the striker smashed a superb shot into the far corner from outside the penalty area.\n\nIn a symbolic passing of the torch, Jonjo Shelvey - a veteran of Newcastle's darker days - waved farewell to fans on the pitch at half-time ahead of his move to Nottingham Forest.\n\nShelvey has been left behind by Howe's revolution, an overhaul that has given Newcastle a much stronger spine.\n\nIn the past, Newcastle would have wilted when Southampton pushed hard in a tense second half, but they are made of sterner stuff now.\n\nPope's brilliant save from Adam Armstrong ensured Newcastle's long-awaited return to Wembley wasn't derailed despite Guimaraes' 82nd minute red card for stamping on Samuel Edozie. - AFP\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: Newcastle shocked by third-tier Sheffield Wednesday in FA Cup\n\nFootball: Newcastle's Joelinton charged with drink-driving\n\nLEAGUE CUP\n\nnewcastle united\n\nFOOTBALL MATCHES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 24, 2024, 01:38am\n\nChelsea thrash Middlesbrough 6-1 to reach League Cup final\n\nNov 2, 2023, 02:12am\n\nMan United booed off after Newcastle loss, West Ham knock out Arsenal\n\nOct 10, 2023, 11:44am\n\nFormer Real Madrid and Chelsea winger Hazard retires at 32\n\nSep 28, 2023, 11:20am\n\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp lauds 'top performance' after beating Leicester City\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6bcf39a0c6598b356b583f41b6970c35d1e4774951f7cf45e8ce5f80fd4b069c/2023-01-31T203132Z1447706211UP1EJ1V1L0J4BRTRMADP3SOCCER-ENGLAND-NEW-SOU-REPORT_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Newcastle United's Sean Longstaff celebrates scoring their second goal.", "caption": "Newcastle United's Sean Longstaff celebrates scoring their second goal.

A promoter at the club offered to send the girl home, but Neo insisted that he would send her home, and booked a taxi.\n\nThey arrived at the block of flats where the girl lived alone at about 3.30am.\n\nAfter entering her unit, she told him to lock the gate and to throw the keys through the gate onto the sofa.\n\nShe went into her bedroom, and thinking that Neo had left, she took off most of her clothes, got into bed, and fell asleep.\n\nAt some point, Neo asked her for various sexual acts, but she said no and fell back into sleep.\n\nAt about 3.45am, he texted a female friend to say that he was in the victim's home and that she was naked on the bed. Close to 4am, he texted another female friend, saying, \"I might be a devil soon\".\n\nIn spite of his friends' advice, Neo raped the victim. When she woke up during the rape, he asked her if it was \"nice\" and continued even though she pleaded with him to stop.\n\nWhen he eventually stopped, the victim chased him out of her flat, as he repeatedly asked if she was okay and told her not to tell anyone what had happened.\n\nThat evening, Neo texted the victim and apologised for making her uncomfortable. When she replied that he had raped her, he did not deny her accusation but asked how they could settle the matter.\n\nOn her friend's urging, the victim called the police in the early morning of Nov 22 to report that she had been raped. Neo was arrested on the same day at around 11.40am.\n\nA psychiatric report from the Institute of Mental Health stated that Neo has a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and adjustment disorder, which were in remission at the time of the rape.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nsexual assault\n\nteenager\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c9af9f36ca6572c287063c4f21cee179d87dcfe868647e07400d84e77eb17cac/tnp1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "TNP PHOTO ILLUSTRATION"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

And rightfully so.\n\nTogether, they have won 20 races, with Lim Kosciuszko taking 11 of those. Well, either one can bring home the goodies.\n\nIn preparation for the event, both were out on the training track on Tuesday morning, putting the finishing touches for the opening feature of the Singapore racing calendar.\n\nBoth are in immaculate condition.\n\nLim's Kosciuszko, a winner two starts back when beating the very-talented Golden Monkey in a 1,200m sprint, had bang-in-form jockey Wong Chin Chuen aboard when out for a spot of cantering.\n\nIt will be the dual-Group 1 winner's first race since his last placing in the Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Sprint (1,200m) on Dec 11, 2022.\n\nTrained by Daniel Meagher, the five-year-old, who has so far amassed $800,000, could not be in better racing condition.\n\nCome Saturday, he will have a trainload of fans.\n\nThen there was that other marvel, King Arthur.\n\nHe had a more serious hit-out.\n\nWith Kranji's champion hoop Manoel Nunes in the saddle, he ran out 600m in 39sec.\n\nIt was a fine piece of work, indicative of a good horse ready for the task ahead.\n\nTrained by Donna Logan, who opened her 2023 season with a double (Aftermath and newcomer Knippenberg) last Saturday, King Arthur has all the credentials to lift the trophy.\n\nA son of I Am Invincible, he was a gallant second to Lim's Kosciuszko in the Group 1 Lion City Cup (1,200m) on Aug 14, 2022.\n\nHe notched his ninth victory two starts later in October in a Kranji Stakes A event over 1,200m on turf.\n\nIt was on Jan 23 that he opened his season with a sixth-place finish in a similar race.\n\nOwned by Fortuna NZ Racing Stable, which races Knippenberg, King Arthur will be right at home under the Merlion Trophy conditions.\n\nHe has won over the track and trip and the 57.5kg that he and the rest of his male rivals will have to carry will not be much of a bother.\n\nCelavi, the only mare in the capacity field, will shoulder 56kg.\n\nBack at Kranji after a disappointing adventure in South Korea in September, the Michael Clements-trained six-year-old clocked 42.7 for her 600m gallop.\n\nIt was on Jan 7 that Celavi had her first start for the 2023 season.\n\nThat day, when ridden by apprentice jockey Ibrahim Mamat, she had it tough all the way, having to race wide and without cover.\n\nTo her credit, at the finish of that Poly 1,100m scurry, she still managed to get to within three lengths of the three-figure winner and stablemate, Ocean Crossing.\n\nCelavi is an honest sort of galloper who loves the alternate surface.\n\nHer claim to fame has to be her gutsy win in the 2021 edition, which she won rather easily.\n\nThen ridden by Louis-Philippe Beuzelin, Celavi found the front at the get-go and never looked back, easily holding off Starlight.\n\nFame Star took third.\n\nGold Star, who ran fourth in that contest, will be having another tilt at the Trophy and he was another of the star workers, running the 600m in 39.6.\n\nAnother of trainer Tim Fitzsimmons' gems, he had one win in 2022.\n\nThat was on April 30 and, to his credit, he beat Lim's Kosciuszko over 1,400m.\n\nAlready a seven-year-old, Gold Star still has loads of racing left in him.\n\nIn addition to Tuesday's hit-out, Fitzsimmons has, in the new year, already sent his charge to two trials, the latest being last Thursday.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3630a2e55fe5303e5313f395d09c38e8a27aa1da9c986f8f67834ae08a222e62/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Lim’s Kosciuszko (Wong Chin Chuen) asserting his superiority over King Arthur (Blake Shinn) in the Group 1 Lion City Cup over 1,200m on Aug 14, 2022.

A fourth man, Mr Noor Shah Ryzqa Azman, was with them.\n\nThey ordered a bottle of whisky to share and left the bar at about 10.30pm, as Wong carried the bottle of whisky and drank from it while they walked around.\n\nThe four men, who were intoxicated, ended up near Riverside Point in Merchant Road and wanted to buy cigarettes. They approached a security officer who pointed them to a 7-Eleven store in Keng Cheow Street.\n\nMr Chua, who was drinking at a bar nearby with his friends, was also walking to the 7-Eleven alone when Amirul felt Mr Chua was staring at him.\n\nAmirul and Wong attacked Mr Chua from behind, with Wong\n\nusing the whisky bottle to hit his head a few times,\n\ncausing a patch of his hair to fall off.\n\nThey also punched Mr Chua who had fallen to the ground. Dani Zulastri, who heard the commotion, ran towards them to punch and kick Mr Chua with Amirul.\n\nThe three men and Mr Ryzqa, who was watching the attack from a distance, then fled towards the State Courts near Havelock Road.\n\nMr Chua, whose head was bleeding, walked back to the bar to seek help and one of his friends called for paramedics.\n\nHe was taken to the emergency department at Singapore General Hospital and found to have cuts on his scalp. He was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome with giddiness and memory loss, and was given medical leave for 17 days.\n\nSaid DPP Chu: \"After the assault, the victim suffered giddiness and headaches, especially when bending down, until around May 2022. He would occasionally still suffer from giddiness and headaches, had bad memory, and was fearful of going out at night.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Straits Times a few days after the attack, Mr Chua, a financial adviser, said he had no clue who was behind the attack.\n\nHis girlfriend said he was celebrating a friend's birthday with four others at a restaurant near Clarke Quay, and was going to a convenience store to buy a drink when the assault occurred.\n\nIn her sentencing submissions, DPP Chu, who sought a sentence of between six months and eight months' jail for Dani Zulastri, cited his violence-related antecedents as an aggravating factor.\n\nIn January 2021, he was convicted of being armed with a dangerous weapon without lawful purpose, joining in an unlawful assembly while armed with a deadly weapon on two occasions, and one count of carrying a scheduled weapon.\n\nWong, 20, is expected to plead guilty on Wednesday while the case against Amirul, 23, is still pending. Mr Ryzqa was\n\ngiven a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in August 2022.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nclarke quay\n\nattack\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0970743b8a440e2e2cc922da2df05936c99cc204376e482052a9cc2622404400/svstitches310123.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Dani Zulastri Mohamad Salim was part of a group that attacked a man in Clarke Quay on March 20, 2022, leaving the victim with cuts to his scalp.", "caption": "Dani Zulastri Mohamad Salim was part of a group that attacked a man in Clarke Quay on March 20, 2022, leaving the victim with cuts to his scalp.

Two other forgery charges were taken into consideration during his sentencing.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor David Menon said Liaw became acquainted with the victim in January 2020 after he sent her a message on Instagram.\n\nUsing the name Trevor in his interactions with her, he propositioned the victim to be his sugar baby and solicited sexual services in exchange for a monthly stipend of between $8,000 and $15,000.\n\nThe victim, who had not entered into a similar arrangement before, declined his offer.\n\nOn July 17, 2020, Liaw tried again, increasing his offer to $22,000 a month. He then gave the victim one of his own contact numbers, claiming it belonged to his former sugar baby, in a bid to convince the victim of his credibility.\n\nWhile posing as his former sugar baby, he had also tried to obtain nude pictures from the victim.\n\nThe victim then met Liaw to discuss his proposal, and he promised to increase the stipend to $25,000 if she booked a hotel room for their next meeting, saying he would transfer her the first payment before that.\n\n\"Unemployed and financially constrained, the victim agreed to this proposal,\" said DPP Menon, who added that Liaw never intended to transfer any money to the victim and that he did not have enough money to do so.\n\nOn July 25, 2020, Liaw sent a photo of the forged bank transaction to the victim via Telegram and used a function on the app that caused the image to disappear after a few seconds to conceal his deception.\n\nThe victim repeatedly checked her bank account throughout the day, but the purported transfer was not reflected.\n\nAfter she expressed some hesitance about meeting him, Liaw responded by rebuking her for lacking trust in him. He implied that she would run off with his $25,000, and complained that she had inconvenienced him as he had rearranged appointments to accommodate their meeting.\n\nLiaw promised the victim that he had already transferred $25,000 to her. Believing this, she booked and paid for a hotel room at Aqueen Hotel.\n\nThe same day, the pair met at the hotel where the victim provided Liaw with sexual services, including intercourse.\n\nLiaw did not pay the victim for the services, nor did he reimburse her as promised for the condoms he wore during sex at her insistence.\n\nDPP Menon said the incident traumatised the victim and negatively affected her relationships with men.\n\nLiaw's lawyer S.S. Dhillon said that his client, who has a seven-year-old daughter, was remorseful and suffered from depression.\n\nLiaw could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both for dishonestly obtaining services.\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nforged\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ef9807349f7b40d2f51968d039c93110111ab38d3a91b90044d02941d4fecd7a/gavel.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Kawshigan still could not accept that Ms Nora Tan did not want to be in a relationship with him.\n\nAfter she cut off contact with him, he filed two lawsuits against her - a $3 million High Court claim for allegedly causing \"damage to his stellar reputation\" and \"trauma, depression and impacts\" to his life, and a $22,000 magistrate's court claim for allegedly breaching an agreement to improve their relationship.\n\nThe latter suit was struck out in January by State Courts deputy registrar Lewis Tan, who said Mr Kawshigan's claim was \"manifestly groundless and without foundation\" and amounted to an abuse of the court process.\n\nIn a judgment published on Saturday, Mr Tan said: \"Considered in totality, I find that the present action was intentionally initiated by the claimant with the ulterior motive of vexing or oppressing the defendant by requiring her to defend various claims that fundamentally stem from the same factual matrix in different forums.\"\n\nHe added: \"This court will not be an accessory to his calculated attempt to compel engagement from the defendant who, after years of massaging the claimant's unhappiness, has finally decided to stand up to his threats rather than cower and give in to his demands.\"\n\nMs Tan and Mr Kawshigan met in 2016, and became friends over time.\n\nIn September 2020, problems began to arise when they became misaligned in how they saw their relationship. While Ms Tan regarded Mr Kawshigan only as a friend, he considered her to be his \"closest friend\".\n\nMs Tan asked for their interactions to be reduced, which displeased Mr Kawshigan, as he felt it constituted taking a step back in their relationship. Nevertheless, she emphasised the need for boundaries and urged him to be \"self-reliant\".\n\nOn Oct 22 that year, Mr Kawshigan issued her a letter of demand, threatening legal action for \"monetary damages arising from negligent infliction of emotional distress and possible defamation\".\n\nMs Tan tried to reason with Mr Kawshigan. She told him in a text message that her \"discomfort (was) genuine\". He responded by saying she could either comply with his demands to deepen their relationship or suffer \"irrevocable\" damage to her personal and professional endeavours.\n\nMr Kawshigan's counsellor then asked Ms Tan to participate in their sessions. She agreed, as she thought it would help him come to terms with her decision not to pursue a romantic relationship with him.\n\nAfter 1½ years, Ms Tan stopped the sessions as she felt they had become futile.\n\nIn April 2022, she started harassment proceedings against Mr Kawshigan. In response, he alluded to a potential claim against her in a text message peppered with terms like \"damage that has strong legal basis\" and \"make your liability worst\".\n\nAfter back and forth discussions on the steps to be taken to better align their relationship, Ms Tan decided on May 14, 2022 to cease communications as she felt she could no longer deal with his requests for increased interaction and his inability to respect her personal boundaries.\n\nOn July 7, 2022, he filed a High Court claim against her. He alleged that due to certain remarks and negligence on her part, he suffered a loss in earning capacity and business partnerships, as well as costs incurred in rehabilitation and therapy programs to overcome the trauma he suffered.\n\nMs Tan then obtained an expedited protection order against him and engaged lawyers to file her defence and counterclaim to the suit.\n\nOn Aug 27, 2022, Mr Kawshigan filed the magistrate's court claim for alleged breach of the steps to better align their relationship.\n\nHe claimed that as a result of the breach, his earning capacity as an \"active high-capital trader by night and a busy CEO by day\" has been negatively affected, and that he has had to \"source for deeper psychological assistance\".\n\nMs Tan then applied to strike out this claim.\n\nThe $3 million High Court claim is fixed for a pre-trial hearing on Feb 9.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nlove\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwww.airwallex.com\n\nHow Motherswork handles financial complexity while expanding across borders.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/12e97905788f0a8703d028340f37769b18f18f8dc79e6d3a5a73aa3f8bf8257f/supreme20court20ph_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Another scheme offered a two-year investment with an annual return of 17 per cent.\n\nThe DPPs had said: \"PT Abby claimed that the teak trees were grown in two Indonesian plantations located in Sulawesi and Jogjakarta and that they would maintain the trees until maturity before selling them to timber mills at a minimum sale price.\"\n\nThe investment agreements assured investors of a guaranteed return of the principal sum at the end of the investment periods.\n\nUpon investing, they received a sale and purchase agreement as well as a certificate of ownership over the share of teak trees.\n\nA total of 92 investors signed 131 investment agreements with PT Abby, and paid a total of $2,260,000 to invest in the schemes offered. They were not aware they had been duped to join the schemes.\n\nAmong other things, the agreement falsely represented that PT Abby owned two Indonesian plantations, and that it was the sole owner of the teak trees.\n\nThe prosecutors said: \"(Matthew Goh) admitted knowing that PT Abby did not own any teak plantations and that Prosperity Ventures had made false representations to the investors when they marketed the... investment schemes.\"\n\nBetween December 2014 and November 2015, he dishonestly misappropriated more than $1.1 million of the investors' monies.\n\nHe transferred the cash to his bank account as well those belonging to his family members, including his father. None of the cash was used for to buy teak trees and teak lots\n\nIn July 2016, investors began lodging police reports saying that PT Abby had defaulted on the promised returns.\n\nMatthew Goh left Singapore in June 2017 and returned in June 2018.\n\nHe was later charged with criminal breach of trust in a district court.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nCRIMINAL BREACH OF TRUST\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dc551eda353edf870aebb09b546d7458ddad2c9ca003e95f2e8649e5197a2dce/IMG334520copy_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Matthew Goh Tian Si was the director and shareholder of a firm called Prosperity Ventures Global.", "caption": "Matthew Goh Tian Si was the director and shareholder of a firm called Prosperity Ventures Global.

The Italian has joined London rivals Arsenal on a £12 million fee until 2024 with an option for a further year.\n\nElsewhere in the Premier League, Manchester City defender Joao Cancelo has left for German Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich on loan after a reported bust-up with manager Pep Guardiola.\n\nBayern will also have a £61.5 million buy option for the Portuguese, according to reports.\n\nCancelo fell out of favour after returning from the World Cup, starting in just three of City's 10 matches.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that the fall-out between player and manager occurred at the club's training ground and Cancelo was also said to have been furious not to be named in the starting line-up in last Friday's FA Cup win over Arsenal.\n\nThe relationship became so bad that he threatened to leave, and Guardiola has since allowed him to depart.\n\nLeeds United, meanwhile, have signed United States midfielder Weston McKennie on loan from Juventus until the end of the season.\n\nMcKennie moved for a reported £1 million loan fee. The 24-year-old has made 41 appearances for the USA and started all four of their World Cup matches in Qatar.\n\nMcKennie is the third USA international to team up with Leeds' American boss Jesse Marsch after Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson joined the club in the close-season. - AFP\n\nepl\n\nPLAYER TRANSFERS\n\nchelsea\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwww.airwallex.com\n\nWhy Mighty Jaxx needs tech-first financial operations to power its global growth\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nAd\n\nAirwallex Singapore\n\nSingaporean business, Saturday Club, expanded to 7 markets with Airwallex\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nRECOMMENDATION", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8d1165eb7dcc88859a42c343e23fca2f2ef9aef3aa1554251e4027051d7b666f/FBL-POR-LIGA-PACOSFERREIRA-BENFICA-215403_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chelsea had been in talks to sign Enzo Fernandez (right), but Benfica had refused to budge unless the release clause was met.", "caption": "Chelsea had been in talks to sign Enzo Fernandez (right), but Benfica had refused to budge unless the release clause was met.

There, they allegedly stabbed her to death.\n\nA spokesman for German police, Andreas Aichele, told German tabloid Bild that \"the victim was killed with over 50 thrusts of the knife, the face completely disfigured\".\n\nThe body was found in the backseat of Shekir K and Sharaban K's car by the banks of the Danube River by the victim's parents on Aug 16.\n\nArrest warrants against the pair were issued on Jan 26 and 27 and they face life in prison if convicted.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nGerman teacher gets life for cannibal murder\n\nGerman jailed for life after killing cashier who asked him to wear a mask\n\nMURDER/MANSLAUGHTER\n\nGermany\n\nsocial media\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/080901748667f2243d15ddb6ff0558dd5beb05439c6ec2f90e0c28e409d76565/ackhadidja310123_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The victim was eventually named as Khadidja O, an Algerian beauty blogger who was also 23.", "caption": "The victim was eventually named as Khadidja O, an Algerian beauty blogger who was also 23.

Lisa Marie is also mother to 14-year-old twin daughters Harper and Finley Lockwood.\n\nPriscilla pointed out that her name had been misspelt in the filing and Lisa Marie's signature in the amendment appeared to be \"inconsistent\" with her usual signature. She added that there were also no witnesses or notarisation of the changes.\n\nPriscilla requested the court to invalidate the 2016 amendment, as she said in the filing that the 2010 version is still \"the authoritative and controlling document\".\n\nShe added that as Siegel \"has already or will soon resign\", she and Riley are slated to be the co-trustees, according to prior terms of the trust.\n\nA friend close to Lisa Marie told People magazine that the late star wanted her children to inherit her trust as she \"did not have a relationship\" with her mother by the time she made the amendment in 2016.\n\n\"Lisa's intent was very clear,\" the friend said. \"Lisa really didn't feel that Priscilla was doing anything in her best interest.\"\n\nLisa Marie died on Jan 12 at the age of 54. Her cause of death has not been revealed by the Los Angeles County coroner, who is investigating the case.\n\nShe was laid to rest at Graceland on Jan 22 after a memorial in which Priscilla and Riley, among others, paid tribute to her.\n\nCelebrities\n\nMusic\n\nWILLS, INHERITANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ce2d25a793bd552aae67377b86494e594054a7f5df08834214dd40f942582dcf/2023-01-13T001908Z1030046387RC2AWU9EJESSRTRMADP3PEOPLE-LISA-MARIE-PRESLEY_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "FILE PHOTO: Lisa Marie Presley (left) and her mother Priscilla Presley place their handprints in cement at TCL Chinese theatre in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 21, 2022.

She had borrowed money from them and asked the man to make the transfers as repayments.\n\nThe victim transferred another $32,030 to multiple bank accounts between Nov 30, 2018 and Nov 19, 2019.\n\nThe DPP said: \"(One of the accounts) belonged to the accused's boyfriend...She had asked the victim to transfer monies to this bank account, as she had asked her boyfriend to help her to buy daily necessities or food.\"\n\nThe transfers to the other bank accounts were repayments to her friends, he added.\n\nCourt documents did not disclose how Seah's offences came to light, but she was later handed cheating charges in a district court.\n\nTo date, she has made a restitution of $10,000.\n\nSeah's bail was set at $15,000 on Tuesday, and she is expected to surrender herself at the State Courts on Feb 21 to begin serving her sentence.\n\nFor each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncheating\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nAirwallex Singapore\n\nHow EU Holidays expanded to over 180 staff with Airwallex\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9c2c0676a564ef678071dd0689bee13478aff40f66f78a7c31b347ee1cfcdea0/ac1i016120copy_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Seah Bee Leng, 60, pleaded guilty to two cheating charges and was sentenced to a year in jail.

I just told Nunes to ride his own race,\" he said.\n\n\"It's true he's never sat on the horse, but we had nothing to worry about. He knows what to do.\n\n\"He had a good opinion of the horse from his work and trials.\n\n\"We were also confident, and credit to Nunes for another perfect ride.\"\n\nThe Tavistock six-year-old was returning after a six-month layoff.\n\nWith Deception, Strong N Smart and Lim's Stable's much-hyped newcomer Invincible Tycoon in the $50,000 Class 4 Division 2 race over 1,200m, the task of scoring a first-up victory for a fourth overall win looked daunting.\n\nBut, making full use of the carte blanche Ong handed him, Nunes brushed aside all these concerns with a zipping move on the outskirts of the field.\n\nFrom barrier No. 9, War Pride ($27) whipped around to easily find the paint.\n\nFrom that point onwards, Nunes just controlled the pace to a nicety, paving the way to a one-act affair in the straight.\n\nThree lengths away, a cluster of four horses battled for the minors.\n\nStrong N Smart (Amirul Ismadi) won the fight by a short head from Be You (Matthew Kellady).\n\nWar Pride clocked 1min 09.49sec for the 1,200m on the long course.\n\n\"He was first-up after six months. All the credit to Jason and his team,\" said Nunes.\n\n\"We drew a tricky barrier, but he's a straightforward horse. He jumped well and put himself there.\n\n\"I expected Be You to lead, but we decided to go forward when nobody else was keen. We controlled the pace from there.\n\n\"He scored a very impressive win. He's a lovely horse who can get to Class 3, no problem.\n\n\"I was just telling Jason's father how famous those silks are with War Affair and how I wished they can get another good horse.\"\n\nWith a name and silks that brought shades of the Ong family's pride and joy, War Pride has not quite lived up to the early promise shown in his Kranji racing career.\n\nHe even earned a Group 2 berth in the second leg of the Singapore Three-Year-Old Challenge, off the back of two wins in a row.\n\nBut he was soundly beaten by Inferno in the Singapore Three-Year-Old Classic (1,400m) in 2020.\n\nA win in Class 4 company rekindled hope, but overall, he thereafter showed chequered form, interspersed with a lot of downtime.\n\nTo Ong, the issue was not a lack of ability, but more maturity.\n\n\"The horse has no issues, but I was just not happy with his condition. He was too immature,\" said the Australian-trained handler.\n\n\"He's the sort of horse who's not able to take too much work. He loses weight, he's too light.\n\n\"That's why I put him off work for six months to build some mass. He needs time to mature.\n\n\"He put on 14kg for Saturday's race and was in a good condition. I think he'll run well from now on.\"\n\nIf Ong was confident he had found the missing puzzle piece to War Pride, he hopes he will soon find the same inspiration at the New Zealand Bloodstock's 2023 National Yearling Sale.\n\n\"The sale is quite strong and there are some nice horses going around.,\" he said.\n\n\"I have a few horses on my shortlist, but I've been outbidded a few times already.\n\n\"I'm still looking around. But we're only at Day 2. So, we've got three more days to get a horse.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6241ce7034ac6af8d0e61afa30d13fdee38362353a614f7c73e3f271b0c65c0c/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "War Pride (Manoel Nunes) scooting clear to an easy three-length win in the Class 4 Division 2 race over 1,200m on Saturday.

(3) PROMETTERE may have more to offer as a gelding. He showed enough in three starts with his previous stable to warrant consideration. (6) THEWOLFOFWOLSELEY made a pleasing stable debut over a shorter trip and ought to have come on for that comeback run. The gelding should also be competitive with the extra distance. (9) RELEASE ME and (13) INSIDE STORY are open to improvement after being gelded. (11) MARSHALL FIELD and (12) RAINBOW COLOURS have claims, too.\n\nRace 3 (2,000m)\n\n(9) AUTUMN MOON finished ahead of (1) SELUKWE over 1,600m and is 5.5kg better off. He should be competitive in his first attempt over 2,000m. Selukwe was drawn widest that day and could reverse that form with the extra 400m from an inside barrier. (6) MADISON BLUES has improved with experience and could pose the biggest threat over the longer journey. (3) RUN RUDOLPH RUN and (4) DONDER STORM have shown enough to make their presence felt.\n\nRace 4 (1,600m)\n\n(3) BEYONDTHEBOUNDARY made a winning comeback over a shorter trip and would have tightened up. He ought to be competitive over this trip. The progressive (8) FUTURE SWING won over the track and trip last time. The colt has run well in a similar contest and should make his presence felt. (4) SPRING HIGH and (1) SILENT TRIGGER could stake a claim trying the extra distance in their peak. (5) CHOLLIMA is favourably treated by the conditions and is also capable of playing a minor role.\n\nRace 5 (1,600m)\n\nStable companions (4) DOUBLING UP and (5) PREVALENCE have acquitted themselves well in stronger post-maiden races. They are likely to have a say in the finish. Prevalence appears the pick of the Justin Snaith-trained runners on riding arrangements, but concedes weight to all. (9) PONTE PIETRA will appreciate the step-up in distance. The colt is fitter following his pleasing sprint comeback. (7) MONTIEN is likely to make further progress after his maiden success over this track and trip. The promising galloper should also be competitive.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nRace 6 (1,400m)\n\n(4) DESERT ROSE has rediscovered her best form in two starts during the Cape summer. She led all the way for a dominant victory over 1,600m last time. She could repeat the feat over the shorter journey despite the five-point hike. (5) TREASURE HUNT beat Desert Rose over this track and trip two starts back. Better off by 2kg, the mare could bounce back from her last-start unplaced showing in a stronger race. (8) SHANTASTIC arrives with good form over a shorter distance but could be looking for the extra distance. The filly is likely to put up a good show. (2) PERFECT TRUST and (6) JAM JAM are consistent. Drawn well, they are unlikely to be far off the action either.\n\nRace 7 (1,800m)\n\n(8) HOLD MY HAND was outclassed in a Grade 1 race over this track and distance last time. This looks a lot easier. She will be hard to beat at level weights if she runs to her Cape Fillies Guineas fourth performance.

These include shisha tobacco, smokeless tobacco, chewing tobacco such as Gutkha, Khaini, Zarda, e-vaporisers and their components.\n\nAny person convicted of an offence is liable to a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment of up to six months or both for the first offence. A second or subsequent offence could see a fine of up to $20,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both.\n\nIt is also an offence to purchase, use and possess such products. The penalty is a fine of up to $2,000 per offence. All prohibited tobacco items will also be seized and confiscated.\n\nInformation pertaining to prohibited tobacco products in Singapore is available on the HSA website.\n\nMembers of the public who have information on the illegal import, distribution, sale or offer for sale of e-vaporisers can contact HSA's Tobacco Regulation Branch at 6684-2036 or 6684-2037 during office hours.\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nCorrespondent\n\nE-CIGARETTES/VAPING\n\nSmoking\n\nSecondary School\n\nPrimary School\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/44f55e1dcb5360450c9d1c279f095c8f96b9ad94be3b01fc58d0b0225e279742/ace-vape310123_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The HSA said it had acted on a tip off that a retail outlet at a neighbourhood shopping mall had been selling the items to students.", "caption": "The HSA said it had acted on a tip off that a retail outlet at a neighbourhood shopping mall had been selling the items to students.

We make steps but we have to improve, we have to improve further and that's what we will do.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"After we came back from the World Cup break, we wanted to go for it. So far, it didn't happen properly. But it just means we have to keep working.\n\n\"I am not over the moon about this performance but, again, the only thing that happened really is that we lost against a good side, who we lost (to) two weeks ago in a horrendous game.\n\n\"Today was much better... Last game here we couldn't have won, but this today, nobody would be surprised if we had won. We will not fall apart, I can tell you.\"\n\nLiverpool have just one win in their last six games after coming close to winning the quadruple last season, before ending up with the League Cup and FA Cup. They finished one point behind champions Manchester City in the English Premier League and lost the Champions League final to Real Madrid.\n\nHowever, this season has seen a drop-off. They are ninth in the league, have been knocked out of both domestic Cups but are in the last 16 of the Champions League after recovering from a chastening 4-1 defeat by Napoli in their opener.\n\nLiverpool legend Mark Lawrenson conceded their chances of finishing in the Premier League top four are all but over, telling talkSPORT: \"I just don't see it. It's sheer inconsistency...\n\n\"They've not got great legs in midfield and they lack experience. They're going through that change a little bit. They haven't become a bad side and the manager is not a bad manager - he's outstanding.\n\n\"He's said it already, it's one of those where they get to the summer and the revolving door will open: there will be people coming out and people coming in.\"\n\nHowever, former Liverpool and Scotland midfielder Don Hutchison cautioned that his former team's interest in Jude Bellingham in the summer won't solve their issues.\n\nHe told ESPN: \"If anyone thinks that Liverpool are going to sign Jude Bellingham tomorrow and he's going to be the answer... it ain't gonna happen.\n\n\"They need a major rebuild in midfield. Backline's not too bad, front men are sensational going forward when they're all fit. But it's not just a one-man fix.

I think they'll be celebrating a fair bit in New Zealand,\" said fellow New Zealander Logan, who took over Fortuna's and Te Akau Stable's horses from Walker.\n\nLogan credited Galvin for his talent-scouting acumen.\n\nKnippenberg's record of one third from two starts in the countryside in New South Wales, Australia, would have been missed by many.\n\n\"Once again, John is the best at picking these horses at the Inglis Digital sale,\" said Logan.\n\n\"This horse ticked all the boxes for him, and he was quite certain he would make it in Singapore. But it's still early days, so we'll take it one race at a time.\"\n\nThe I Am Invincible three-year-old did not give much away at his one barrier trial on Jan 19 either, when a rather plain third to Watery.\n\nBut Knippenberg ($30) was a lot more dynamic on Saturday, sitting right on the hammer of leader and the better-fancied ($16) fellow debutant Star North (Louis-Philippe Beuzelin).\n\nHe waited for the home straight to turn the tables.\n\nStar North did not shirk the fight, but Knippenberg finally wore him down and skipped away.\n\nThe long stalemate between the duelling pair proved costly for the $12 favourite, Popeyethesailorman.\n\nHopelessly snookered in behind, the Manoel Nunes-ridden, Tim Fitzsimmons-trained galloper needed fresh air more badly than a can of spinach.\n\nHe had to switch across two pairs of heels to bust out. But Knippenberg was already safely home by 1 3/4 lengths. Star North was third, another length away.\n\nThe winning time was 1min 10.32sec for the 1,200m on the long course.\n\n\"He could have led but the long course was a concern. We then decided to put him behind the speed and Ronnie rode him a treat,\" said Logan.\n\n\"I wasn't worried about the wet as he's raced over such tracks in Australia.\"\n\nThen prepared by Australia's leading trainers Ciaron Maher and David Eustace, Knippenberg ran seventh on debut on a soft track at Goulburn.\n\nHe then improved with a third placing over a similar surface at his next start in Bathurst.\n\nLogan was more worried about the quality of opposition her newcomer was testing his mettle against.\n\n\"He had a nice draw (barrier No. 3), but there were some nice horses from Tim Fitzsimmons and Mike Clements (Mewar, 7th) in it,\" she said.\n\n\"I would have been satisfied if he finished in the first five, but he's won, which is great. There's still improvement to come out of him, though.\"\n\nWhile the runner-up to reigning champion Fitzsimmons was at her second 2023 winner, after Aftermath saluted earlier, Stewart was also bringing a slugglish start to an end.\n\n\"He was well prepared and he handled the surface very well,\" said the Australian of his account opener.\n\n\"He looks a nice horse who can go through his grades.

I asked her to lower her voice but she continued to shout,\" said Hou.\n\nFrustrated, Hou said she took the phone away from the helper and asked her to take the call outside the flat.\n\nThe tussle over the phone at the doorway turned violent, and Hou claimed the helper slapped her.\n\nHou claimed that at one point, the helper rushed back into the living room and hit one of her children.

Her allegation made national headlines in Taiwan, to the dismay of Thai tourism operators.\n\nThe 33-year-old actress said police stopped their Grab taxi at a checkpoint close to the Chinese Embassy on Ratchadaphisek Road at about 1am on Jan 5 and detained the group for two hours. She said police eventually released the group in return for a payment of 27,000 baht (RM3,500).\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Bureau (MPB) has denied the claims of extortion, saying that CCTV footage of the incident does not back up the actress's story. Police have contacted Taiwanese authorities in a bid to question An, who has since returned to Taiwan.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 10, 2025, 12:30am\n\nSingaporean fugitive arrested in Thailand for alleged drug trafficking\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn a Facebook post on Monday, Chuwit said a Thai friend who was part of An's group had paid the 27,000-baht bribe to police.\n\n\"The Thai friend had joined a drinking party with Taiwanese actress,\" he said, adding that she also had a video clip as evidence.\n\nChuwit also claimed that MPB chief Thiti Saengsawang had ordered Metropolitan Police Division 1 commander Pol Maj-General Attaporn Wongsiripreeda and Huai Khwang police station chief Yingyos Suwanno to take four steps to cover up the incident.\n\nChuwit alleges they were ordered to:\n\n- Delete footage from the Chinese Embassy's CCTV cameras and police body cameras.\n\n- Persuade the Grab taxi driver to say that he stayed at the checkpoint for 40 minutes, had no video of the incident, and that the Taiwanese actress was drunk.\n\n- Release video clips to discredit An.\n\n- Counter the extortion claim by declaring that she had made up the story.\n\nChuwit said police scandals over collusion with Chinese triads and extortion of the Taiwanese actress had damaged Thailand's reputation.\n\n\"Most importantly, the police made up a story, destroyed evidence and retaliated against the Taiwanese actress.\"\n\nHe added that he expects the police to confess to extortion of the actress soon. - THE NATION/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nthailand\n\nextortion\n\nactress\n\ntaiwan\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:20am\n\n2 Singaporeans among 3 arrested in Thailand in joint anti-vice sweep\n\nJun 4, 2025, 11:28pm\n\nS'pore businessman nabbed before flight at Bangkok airport over suspected tax evasion\n\nMay 21, 2025, 12:24am\n\nActor Mark Lee urges hairstylist Addy Lee not to be too harsh on host Quan Yifeng\n\nMay 6, 2025, 02:06am\n\nSingaporean man in Thailand nabbed for being part of illegal vape network\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6ba8aba6a5e0bb104855918512988e621bbbdf388720e6fbcf2a7a5a51947722/1919248.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTOS: THE STAR"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c8dfff1f1a51e769427c5a561e85c62f12824017e1ded49d59202b34d24fd8e3/rrcnb1007.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Singaporean fugitive arrested in Thailand for alleged drug trafficking", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/695e9e7b89e7dd294f5d48d52ab28801ebf428f5f572e2708fe275265d789999/photo2025-06-1913-30-51.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "2 Singaporeans among 3 arrested in Thailand in joint anti-vice sweep", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He was sentenced to 32 months' jail and three strokes of the cane.\n\nThey both cannot be named as there are gag orders to protect their victims' identities.\n\nAfter arriving in Singapore in 2019, the Vietnamese man had his work permit cancelled on March 7, 2020, said deputy public prosecutors Victoria Ting and Matthew Choo.\n\nAs he could not return to Vietnam due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he was given a special pass that allowed him to stay here until Sept 6, 2021.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the victim's mother, who ran a restaurant in Geylang, offered fellow Vietnamese workers stranded in Singapore free food and the accused started going to the restaurant.\n\nThe man and his victim became acquainted as the girl would help out at the restaurant after school.\n\nIn March 2021, after the man was asked to leave the shelter he was staying in, the victim's mother allowed him to stay in the restaurant.\n\nBut some time in July 2021, the man was told he could not stay in the restaurant as he was unvaccinated.\n\nOut of goodwill, the victim's mother allowed him to stay with her and the girl in a two-room condo unit she was renting in Bedok.\n\nThe unit's other occupants were the mother's stepbrother and a restaurant worker. The Vietnamese slept on a sofa.\n\nOn or about Aug 8, 2021, the Vietnamese told the girl he had romantic feelings for her despite knowing that she was 11 years old.\n\nThen some time in August, the man raped the girl in the condo unit.\n\nThe victim's mother found out when the restaurant worker living in the unit told her that he suspected that the girl and the offender were romantically involved.\n\nWhen he was confronted, the Vietnamese admitted to having touched the victim inappropriately. The girl then confirmed that he had raped her.\n\nThe mother made a police report and the man was arrested on Aug 26, 2021.\n\nIn the other case, the Malaysian man started a relationship with his victim's mother in 2010, and soon moved in to live with the victim's family, said DPP Wong Shiau Yin.\n\nSome time in 2011, while the victim was watching television in the living room, the offender asked her to go with him into the toilet.\n\nThere, he pulled down his trousers and rubbed his private parts against hers for about 10 minutes. Her mother was asleep at the time.\n\nSaid DPP Wong: \"The victim did not understand what was happening and therefore did not shout for help. Instead, she kept silent throughout the ordeal.\"\n\nBut her mother suddenly appeared outside the toilet and told the victim to leave the room.\n\nDPP Wong said the victim did not know what transpired between the offender and her mother, but remembered seeing him kneeling on the floor begging for forgiveness.\n\nBut some time later, the man had also attempted to perform oral sex on the victim.\n\nThe offences were brought to light when the victim, who is now 17 years old and suffers from major depressive disorder, confided in an intern at a clinical and health psychology centre, who then referred the matter to the Ministry of Social and Family Development.

She was paid about $1,000 for her efforts.\"\n\nShe was one of several people charged in 2022 over their alleged links to the phishing scams, which led to victims losing some $12.8 million.\n\nSome of the offenders, including Mark Teo Sin Yan, 32, and Leong Jun Xian, then 21, were dealt with in court earlier.\n\nThe cases involving several others, including Kong Jia Quan and Muhammad Khairuddin Eskandariah, both 20, are pending.\n\nDPPs Chua and Ronnie Ang said in court documents that the girl and other accused persons had sourced for and provided control of bank accounts to members of crime syndicates believed to be based overseas.\n\nThey opened bank accounts and gave the syndicates the account credentials.\n\n\"Some of these bank accounts were subsequently used to receive and dissipate funds from the (scams involving OCBC customers), while other bank accounts were used to receive and dissipate funds from victims of other scams,\" the prosecutors added.\n\nThe syndicates also told the group to withdraw cash from ATMs, by giving them instructions on messaging platform Telegram.\n\nThe girl, who opened a DBS bank account with her Singpass details, was a member of three Telegram chat groups used by the offenders.\n\nIn all, the group provided at least 16 bank accounts to the syndicates in the Telegram group chats between December 2021 and February 2022, receiving nearly $600,000 from different scams, including\n\nthose involving OCBC customers.\n\nBetween Dec 8, 2021, and Jan 19, 2022, the police received 768 reports from OCBC bank account holders who had fallen prey to phishing scams.\n\nOCBC said in January 2022 that it had\n\nmade full goodwill payouts to all victims.\n\nThe girl, who pleaded guilty to giving a false statement, had lied to the police on Dec 30, 2021, when she claimed that she had withdrawn cash on behalf of a fictitious person named \"firewin888\", whom she said reached out to her on Telegram.\n\nClaiming that she had been threatened by firewin888, she said the cash was kept in a red paper bag which was placed outside her home for collection by the Telegram user.\n\nAs a result of the false statement, officers from both the Criminal Investigation Department and Yishun North Neighbourhood Police Centre were diverted to review footage from devices such as police cameras around her estate to try to spot a person carrying a red paper bag.\n\nAs the statement was false, the police were unable to find anyone carrying a red paper bag, and they had to interview the girl again.\n\nShe is expected to be sentenced on Feb 13.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nSCAMS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9cc84ab313bc64406950e13181ca4a2b5bd5c87c6a20974446e3627797fb1b06/tnp16.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "TNP PHOTO ILLISTRATION"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

This will especially help to reach out to the uninformed and the elderly.\"\n\nCompanies that use third-party services - or aggregators - to send their SMSes may find that their texts are flagged as \"likely scam\" if the service provider is not in the registry.\n\nIMDA urges firms to choose aggregators that are part of the registry to avoid this problem.\n\nAt least 2,600 SMS sender IDs have been registered with the IMDA, which has reached out to organisations through associations, such as the Singapore Business Federation, Singapore International Chamber of Commerce and Association of Banks in Singapore, to encourage them to sign up.\n\nAfter the registry was set up in March 2022, the Republic saw a 64 per cent reduction in scams through SMS from the last quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2022, said IMDA.\n\nIt added that scam cases perpetrated via SMS made up around 8 per cent of scam reports in the second quarter of 2022, down from 10 per cent in the same period of 2021.\n\nHow the SMS Sender ID Registry works\n\nAll organisations that send SMSes using alphanumeric sender IDs are required to register with the Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry, or will have their messages labelled as “likely scam” from Jan 31, 2023. PHOTO: IMDA\n\nCurrently, organisations register their protected sender IDs but scammers are still able to use lookalike IDs that are not registered.\n\nFrom Tuesday, all unregistered sender IDs will be marked as \"likely scam\" for a transition period of six months. After this period, messages with these unregistered IDs will be blocked and not delivered to users.\n\nThis will cover all sender IDs that come from local and overseas sources, but does not apply to person-to-person texts.\n\nThere will be a one-time set-up fee of $500 per firm and an annual charge of $200 per registered sender ID.\n\nOrganisations keen to register can contact the Singapore Network Information Centre at\n\nsmsregistry@sgnic.sg\n\nBy\n\nOsmond Chia\n\nRead articles by Osmond Chia\n\nInfocomm Media Development Authority\n\nCYBER SECURITY\n\nINTERNET CRIMES AND SCAMS\n\nSCAMS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 17, 2022, 09:06am\n\n#LookAtMe film by Ken Kwek barred from being screened in S'pore over potential to cause social division\n\nDec 16, 2021, 08:24am\n\nHigh Court dismisses TOC's bid to challenge IMDA's orders to shut its Chinese site, social media channels\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3ebdb63a5dee2b31a2dd1f61780e5a6269398a814641bfc34047c9dd52ffa279/yaohui-pixgeneric-7973_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Companies that are not part of the registry will have their text messages labelled as “likely scam”.", "caption": "Companies that are not part of the registry will have their text messages labelled as “likely scam”.

Phang reciprocated, to continue to lead her on.\n\nOn Nov 8, 2020, at the request of 'Leon', the victim agreed to be his girlfriend for the first time. Though Phang had initially promised the victim to spend time with her in-person, she never fulfilled any of those promises and would give various excuses not to meet her.\n\nWhen they were in a relationship, DPP Shen said Phang, as 'Leon', groomed the victim to be subservient to her by telling her that she should be loyal and obedient.\n\nPhang then deceived the victim into buying items like food and game credits for her. She also made the victim resign from her job without notice, which resulted in her having to pay her company $1,566.\n\nPhang caused the victim to incur a total monetary loss of at least $4,705.64. The victim initially paid for the purchases with her own money, but later had to get money from her sister and father.\n\nSome time before Nov 19, 2020, Phang conceived the idea of procuring nude photographs and videos from the victim, for the purpose of extorting money from her.\n\nShe asked the victim to prove her love by sending her nude material over Whatsapp. The victim expressed her discomfort as she had never met 'Leon' in person.\n\nOn Feb 12, 2021, after repeated requests, the victim sent two photographs of her bra and panties respectively to her and sent two nude videos over Instagram the next day after more pressure.\n\nAfter receiving more material, Phang attempted to extort $1,000 from the victim, by threatening to post her nude material online and distribute them to her friends, family, and ex-employer if she failed to pay her the money.\n\nWorried her nude videos who be distributed, the victim eventually blocked 'Leon' on social media.\n\nOn May 18, 2021, the victim lodged a police report stating that a person known to her only as Leon had threatened to distribute her nude photographs and claimed to have already done so to a friend.\n\nThe police managed to establish Phang's identity, and an operation to track and detain her.\n\nShe was arrested at her home on May 18, 2021 at about 5.30pm.\n\nFor cheating, Phang could have been jailed for three years with a fine.\n\nShe could have been jailed for up to two years with a fine for criminal intimidation.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nextortion\n\nnude pictures\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/00b9e05dd5af79c972284c97914681d4c6f26b55fda7091bfad3bed89cc77a63/extort.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Janelle Phang Minxuan caused the victim to lose over $4,000.", "caption": "Janelle Phang Minxuan caused the victim to lose over $4,000.

The unsuspecting Mr Sivanesan authorised payments totalling nearly $4,200 to her between December 2019 and November 2020.\n\nTeo also owned a firm called TKW that performed maintenance, repair and painting work. He did not tell the other RN members he was the firm's owner when the group engaged its services.\n\nDPP Gan told the court: \"He also sought to further conceal his ownership of TKW to members of the RN by using a variety of signatures, including one which read 'Shirley', on invoices issued by TKW.\n\n\"Had the accused disclosed... his ownership of TKW to members of the RN... TKW would not have been engaged to render services to the RN.\"\n\nBetween December 2019 and December 2020, Teo dishonestly induced Mr Kian and Mr Sivanesan to authorise payments totalling $2,840 to TKW.\n\nHe also made bogus payment claims over purported reimbursements for purchases and services, including air-conditioning servicing.\n\nTeo made such claims on multiple occasions between July 2020 and August 2021. As a result, Mr Kian and Mr Sivanesan were duped into approving payments totalling some $3,800.\n\nThe pair had trusted the veracity of Teo's payment claims, and did not inquire further into the claims beyond ensuring the amount in the supporting documents he provided tallied with the amount to be disbursed to him, said DPP Gan.\n\nTeo's offences came to light after an officer from the director's office of Sembawang GRC conducted a review of the RN's finances.\n\nThe police were alerted on Nov 30, 2021, after several financial irregularities were discovered.\n\nTeo's bail has been set at $15,000, and he is expected to surrender himself at the State Courts on Feb 20 to begin serving his sentence.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncheating\n\nShare this article", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/29378fbdb3e1a499a1d4126135950fbf4076e27cf7a6310d51b5be25747120a1/ac1i980020copy_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Teo Kum Weng made bogus claims for purported reimbursements for goods and services because he was facing financial difficulties at the time.", "caption": "Teo Kum Weng made bogus claims for purported reimbursements for goods and services because he was facing financial difficulties at the time.

The couple have since divorced.\n\nThe man, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim's identity, married her mother in 2014.\n\nTwo years later, he and the victim were in the living room of their flat when they started teasing each other.\n\nShe ran into her bedroom and tried to close the door in an attempt to hide from her stepfather. He pushed open the door and wrestled with her on her bed.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Colin Ng said: \"The accused rested his body on top of the victim's body. The accused then bit the victim on her (chest) over her clothes.\"\n\nWhen she screamed for help, he immediately left the bedroom. The mother, who was in the kitchen, went to the bedroom after hearing the scream.\n\nHowever, the girl did not reveal what had happened.\n\nOn or around March 19, 2018, the man was in the kitchen with the girl when he tried to kiss her lips.\n\nThe DPP said: \"However, the victim resisted and struggled. During the struggle, the accused pinned the victim down on the floor (and touched her genitals).\"\n\nShe screamed for help and told him to stop, then left the flat soon after.\n\nThree months later, she told her boyfriend about the incident, but stopped him from making a police report.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n4 men charged over molestation of kids at various locations\n\nNearly 5 years’ jail for man who repeatedly molested daughter, victim-shamed her during trial\n\nThe offender struck yet again at around 8.30am on Feb 20, 2019, when he grabbed her right breast while her mother was in the master bedroom. The mother rushed out when she heard screaming.\n\nAt first, the victim - who was then 20 - refused to tell her mother about what had transpired, but did so later that evening. The police were alerted.\n\nThe man was represented by defence lawyer S.S.

If convicted, he would be the latest example of how South Korea has tried to crack down on sex crimes as the country continues to grapple with the reverberations of the #MeToo movement.\n\nProsecutors charged Oh Young-soo, 78, in November 2022, after a woman filed a complaint accusing him of inappropriately touching her in 2017.\n\nIf a district judge in Suwon, about 32km south of Seoul, convicts Oh, he would face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to about US$12,000 (S$15,800).\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:48am\n\nKia launches its first Singapore-assembled EV\n\nMore related stories\n\nFew additional facts are known about the case and the incident. Court documents are unavailable by law, and authorities have declined to offer more details about the accuser, citing their policy not to disclose any information about victims of sex crimes.\n\nOh has denied any wrongdoing, but he has already faced fallout since being charged.\n\nHe has been excluded from the cast of a South Korean play called Love Letter, in which he had been scheduled to perform on Jan 14. The country's Culture Ministry has also stopped airing a government commercial that had featured him.\n\n\"I rushed to request replacements as soon as I heard the news,\" said Mr Lim Dong-sik, head of advertising at the broadcasting network sponsoring the play in which Oh had been cast. Mr Lim added that the allegations had tarnished Oh's reputation.\n\nIn 2022, Oh became the first South Korean to win a Golden Globe, for best supporting actor. He was also nominated for an Emmy for his performance in Squid Game, a dystopian drama that chronicles South Koreans down on their luck who join a secretive, deadly contest in hopes of winning a life-changing fortune.\n\nThe show struck a pop-culture nerve worldwide - becoming Netflix's most-watched new series ever - and featured Oh portraying an older competitor known as \"Player 001\" in the game. Netflix did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nProsecutors in Suwon pressed charges on Nov 25 after initially dropping the case.\n\nA police station in Seongnam, a nearby city, had originally received the complaint from the woman in December 2021 and had immediately begun investigating the case, said Ms Jang Shin-mo, a division leader at the station. That station sent the case to the prosecutors in February 2022, but authorities decided two months later not to press charges, she said.\n\nThe woman appealed and asked police to reopen the case in May 2022, Ms Jang said. After gathering more evidence, prosecutors pressed charges in November 2022.\n\nPeople convicted of indecent assault in South Korea become registered sex offenders who are monitored by police even after completing their prison terms. First-time offenders can receive reduced sentences, such as five years, or simply a fine.\n\nIn the wake of the charges, Oh had become a particularly poor fit to appear in the play Love Letter, said Mr Lim.\n\nThe play is a romance featuring a pair of actors who take turns reading love letters to each other. Each character is married to someone else, but they exchange intimate letters throughout the span of their lives.\n\nMr Lim said his company had decided to drop Oh from the play the day the charges were announced. Oh and the other actor who had been scheduled to appear as a pair were replaced by two other performers.\n\nAfter the Culture Ministry cancelled the government advertisements featuring Oh, it said in a statement that it had done so to avoid \"unnecessary controversy\". The e-mailed statement did not explicitly mention the accusations against Oh.\n\nThe ads, which had promoted regulatory reform, disappeared from government websites, official social media channels and subway stations only 11 days after they went up.\n\nThroughout his career, Oh has played supporting roles in film and television, including a part as an ageing Buddhist monk in the 2003 romance film Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring. That portrayal earned him the moniker \"monk actor\", a role he would reprise in other films, television shows and commercials. - NYTIMES\n\nSouth Korea\n\nactors\n\nTV series\n\nSTREAMING - MUSIC/VIDEO/CONTENT\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 28, 2025, 01:14am\n\nWoman left in vegetative state by botched procedure returns to S'pore\n\nJan 13, 2025, 09:32am\n\nFans wait 7 hours in the rain for (G)I-dle's Minnie at Chagee opening\n\nDec 31, 2024, 02:48am\n\nWhy is there a concrete wall near the end of Muan Airport runway?\n\nDec 29, 2024, 11:41pm\n\nGrief fills Muan Airport as families wait for victims to be identified\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7bb5eb673711703fed27b7373f7b0a6762e46cf08be6aeef58ee418bd012c0fe/svsquidgame271122_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Squid Game actor Oh Young-soo has been removed from ads by the South Korean government following his indictment for indecent assault.", "caption": "Squid Game actor Oh Young-soo has been removed from ads by the South Korean government following his indictment for indecent assault.

The occasion is traditionally marked by the Hokkiens, a Chinese dialect group in Singapore.\n\nCompared with previous years, this year's celebration was the first without restrictions since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nDevotees were allowed into the temple till about 2am, unlike the past two years when it was closed earlier due to pandemic restrictions, said the temple's event coordinator Jeffrey Tan, 66, who has worked for the temple for 26 years.\n\nAt the altar, temple staff placed a spread of longevity buns, longevity noodles, roast meats, cooked crabs, fresh fruits, red eggs and traditional sweets and confectionery.\n\nDevotees had arrived as early as 8pm on Sunday to write their name, home address, prayers and well wishes on joss paper.\n\nMr Ko Woei Hin, 45, who owns a construction business, makes offerings yearly for the Jade Emperor's birthday.\n\nThis year, Mr Ko, accompanied by his wife, offered 30 sets of joss paper as well as headwear, clothing, pineapples, buckets of ingots and a ship with sails - all made of paper - to the deity.\n\nThis year's visitors also included a 101-year-old matriarch accompanied by her family.\n\nThe devotees' stacks of joss paper will be burnt at about 3pm on Monday, which will mark the end of the celebration.\n\nMichelle Chin\n\nFESTIVALS/CELEBRATIONS\n\nreligion\n\nculture\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b4eda0a0af81e7a7e9bbd18acc28f9ffb1efc5c7663351d96ea74f222fd3e18c/tpk.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Devotees turning out in force at the celebration of the Jade Emperor’s birthday at Loyang Tua Pek Kong temple on Jan 29, 2023.", "caption": "Devotees turning out in force at the celebration of the Jade Emperor’s birthday at Loyang Tua Pek Kong temple on Jan 29, 2023.

Class 2A and 2B licences allow the supply of beer only, and permitted hours under them are from 6am to 11.59pm or as indicated on the licence.\n\nFailure to display the required notices could result in a fine of up to $10,000 for liquor licensees.\n\nThere are no changes to rules for liquor consumption, which allow licensed outlets to sell alcohol only within their premises and during permitted hours.\n\nPatrons found to be drinking in a licensed outlet after its permitted hours may face a fine of up to $1,000. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $2,000, jailed for up to three months, or both.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nRegular alcohol use most common in older men, binge drinking in young adults: Survey\n\nDrinking too much?

The remaining three floors are set to open in the next few months.\n\nNevertheless, there is more than enough to explore at the soft launch, such as a tinkering space on the second floor that the National Library Board has set up in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution of the United States.\n\nAimed at getting children to tackle hands-on problems independently, it encourages them to invent solutions to engineering challenges - such as how to construct an item to hover in a wind tunnel, or how to build structures around a teetering table without them falling.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:01am\n\nLocal author traces evolution of Singaporean Chinese names\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn addition, a Stories Come Alive room on the first floor features interactive screens that animate Singaporean poems across the four official languages.\n\nFor instance, in a rendition of Singaporean lawyer and writer Ronald Wong's poem Punggol, children are able to tap on accompanying pop-ups to explore the locations featured in the work, such as the all-but-forgotten Babujan Zoo that was a neighbourhood fixture in the 1930s.\n\nOther features aimed at children include NLB's first permanent toy library, which offers puppets, costumes and props to experiment with, and a Storyteller Cove that provides prompts for children to come up with their own tales.\n\nSaid Ms Catherine Lau, deputy chief executive of NLB: \"When we plan the space, we want it to spark imagination and curiosity.\n\nThe Stories Come Alive Room uses moving images, text, and light and sound effects to make storytelling an immersive and interactive experience for children aged four to 10 years. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nWe want them to learn through using our book collection, through playing at the toy library and the other interactive activities.\"\n\nIn line with NLB's Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025 (LAB25), which aims in part to make libraries more inclusive to all, the new facility incorporates numerous accessible features to serve the needs of people with disabilities.\n\nThe Storyteller Cove, a space with animations, illustrations, and activity stations including for prop-making, aims to inspire to children to create their own stories. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nFor instance, one feature to make the library more friendly for wheelchair-bound patrons is the \"Borrow-n-Go\" passageway, which utilises Ultra-High Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to enable users to borrow their desired titles without having to place them on a table-top, as is the case at traditional borrowing kiosks.\n\nThe library also offers Calm Pods, quiet and safe spaces with wall and floor padding, as well as sensory aids, for users with disabilities to go to should they need privacy to calm down.\n\nA staff demonstrating the usage of Borrow-n-Go during the media preview on Jan 27. It allows wheelchair users to borrow books easily by going through this passageway. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nMulti-coloured keyboards with large keys have also been installed at the new library, so that people with visual impairments can access the library's catalogue with greater ease.\n\nThese accessible features were created with inputs from the Singaporean disability community, including the NLB's Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee which includes experts on child development and the CEOs of local social service organisations.\n\nAssistive technology devices such as coloured keyboards with larger keys are available to aid visually impaired patrons. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nSpeaking to The Straits Times, Ms Verena Lee, assistant director of the Punggol Regional Library said: \"We want to welcome persons with disabilities in and make sure they feel accepted... We want to continue to shape how we deliver our services, to think of new ways to engage our community.\n\n\"So come, use the library, and give us feedback.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nWant to read books and make friends?

A fourth fish, Lala, died in September.\n\nIn this instance, the fishy incident took place earlier this month where Mutekimaru was live-streaming a game of Pokemon.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMutekimaru had stepped away for a break after the game crashed due to a system error and the console returned to the home screen.\n\nThe fish however carried on swimming - as what fishes do - and seemingly continued to control the console remotely from its tank.\n\nDuring the next seven hours, CNN reported that the fish managed to change the name of its owner's Switch account, downloaded a new avatar, set up a PayPal account and sent an email about the process as well as read a set of terms and conditions on the Nintendo eShop.\n\n\"Fish eagerly read the terms and conditions. Many of us humans don't read the terms of service, but fish are smarter than we are,\" a caption in the recap video of the incident said.\n\nIn a budding shopping spree that would make any shopaholic proud, the fish also added 500 yen (S$5) to Mutekimaru's Switch account and in the process, exposed the owner's credit card details.\n\nBy then, the livestream has attracted thousands of comments from amused followers. The incident went viral on Twitter as well.\n\n\"I can only imagine having to explain to customer service that your pet fish made purchases on your account,\" wrote a commentator, while another said: \"Never leave your pet fish unattended.\"\n\nCNN reported Mutekimaru as saying later that he had contacted Nintendo to explain what happened and asked for a refund of his 500 yen.\n\nNintendo declined to comment to CNN, citing customer confidentiality.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nNintendo breaks sales record with new Pokemon games on Switch\n\nDad saddled with $20,000 bill after daughter's in-game spending spree\n\nJapan\n\nfish\n\nVIRAL VIDEOS\n\nGAMING/VIDEO GAMES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22, 2025, 07:40am\n\nFormer S'pore basketball coach's wife, missing for 2 years, confirmed dead in Japan\n\nMay 20, 2025, 12:18am\n\nS'pore man arrested in Japan for allegedly committing indecent acts involving boy in onsen\n\nApr 6, 2025, 04:16am\n\nSingaporeans believed to be among 47 injured in bus collision on Tokyo expressway\n\nApr 3, 2025, 12:30am\n\nMFA officer who took nude photos of male customers in Tokyo bathhouse dismissed\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bcc3f0f09dc63c0a2a753773b69d23329deab4120347a672b6b75edb06c41070/affish300123_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The fishy incident took place earlier this month where Mutekimaru was live-streaming a game of Pokemon.", "caption": "The fishy incident took place earlier this month where Mutekimaru was live-streaming a game of Pokemon.

I will be continuing to support Sailors as always.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:01pm\n\nLion City Sailors retain Singapore Cup to cement domestic dominance\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe 1.96m striker, who scored 16 goals in 56 appearances for his country and featured at the 2014 and 2018 World Cups, is close to agreeing a move to Hong Kong Premier League side Kitchee SC, according to media reports.\n\nKim is the latest highly paid Sailor to leave the club after a disappointing 2022 season, in which the big spenders lost the SPL title to Albirex Niigata and crashed out of the Singapore Cup at the group stage.\n\nThe exodus began in November 2022, when the club announced the departure of six players, including Hassan Sunny (now with Albirex), Gabriel Quak, Shahdan Sulaiman (both Hougang United) and Faris Ramli (Tampines Rovers), who were believed to be among the highest local earners at the club.\n\nA host of backroom staff also departed and chief executive Chew Chun-Liang also left the club in December.\n\nEarlier in January, Singapore midfielder Song Ui-young also announced that he was moving out of his \"comfort zone\" to pursue new challenges with Thai League 1 side Nongbua Pitchaya.\n\nSailors owners Sea Limited, Singapore's largest consumer Internet company, has since late-2022 been buffeted by a perfect storm of an economic slowdown, inflation, increasing competition and a broader tech sell-off. The parent of e-commerce giant Shopee and gaming firm Garena has suffered a US$150 billion plunge in its value since late 2021 and there has been at least three rounds of layoffs at Shopee's local and international offices.\n\nWhile Kim's record of 24 goals in 35 appearances for the Sailors in all competitions makes for good reading on paper, he failed to impress fans here due to his lack of mobility up front.\n\nThe former K. League and Asian Champions League (ACL) winner was brought in for his experience at the top tier of Asian football, but started only two of the Sailors' six matches during their ACL debut in 2022 and failed to score.\n\nThe Sailors' December signing of reigning SPL Player of the Year Kodai Tanaka, who racked up 33 goals and 11 assists for Albirex in 2022, was the first sign that Kim's time was up.\n\nThe 23-year-old Japanese striker's arrival meant that there were five foreigners on the Sailors' books, more than the SPL quota of four. Their other imports are centre-back Pedro Henrique, playmaker Diego Lopes and winger Maxime Lestienne.\n\nSailors captain Hariss Harun said of Kim: \"He was a consummate professional, a good presence in the dressing room, and a fighter out on the pitch. We wish him the best in the next chapter of his career, and we'll be following him closely too.\"\n\nThe Sailors will kick off their new SPL campaign on Feb 24 against Tanjong Pagar United. As last season's top local side, they will also compete in the play-offs for a place in this season's ACL. If they fail to progress, they will then take their place in the second-tier AFC Cup.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: Sailors sign SPL Player of The Year Kodai Tanaka\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nSingapore Premier League\n\nSingapore Football\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nWounded Sharjah up for revenge to 'get the trophy they deserve' in ACL2\n\nMay 7, 2025, 12:10am\n\nScalpers take to online platforms to resell ACL Two final tickets\n\nApr 28, 2025, 10:50pm\n\nCan Forrest Li replicate Sailors' success on national level?\n\nApr 23, 2025, 02:05am\n\nLion City Sailors get provisional approval to host Asian Champions League 2 final at Bishan Stadium\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bc079b64fd299d43a2b23dd9a87fd1632e11aa46a7472ed17c018283136dea7c/20220219100010976d478697a-f927-437d-a949-57d9bb07c5aa_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Lion City Sailors’ Kim Shin Wook (in white) scoring a goal against Albirex Niigata during the Singapore Premier League Community Shield match at Jalan Besar Stadium on Feb 19, 2022.", "caption": "Lion City Sailors’ Kim Shin Wook (in white) scoring a goal against Albirex Niigata during the Singapore Premier League Community Shield match at Jalan Besar Stadium on Feb 19, 2022.

However, he applied for post-doctorate jobs in the medical industry because of his passion to help people. Unsurprisingly, no one would hire him because his field was unrelated to medicine.\n\nBut he remained committed to his calling, and was advised by an older scientist to try Dr Judah Folkman, a Harvard University professor and surgeon-in-chief at Boston Children's Hospital who was known for hiring people with unusual backgrounds.\n\nProf Langer landed a job as Dr Folkman's assistant and began working at the hospital in 1974.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 3, 2025, 05:38am\n\nS'pore partially shielded from Trump's tariffs, but global trade slowdown looms\n\nMore related stories\n\nDr Folkman was studying metastasis, the process of how cancerous tumours grow and spread throughout the body. He theorised that tumours stimulated angiogenesis, or the growth of blood vessels, to provide them with nutrients and allow them to spread.\n\nHe tasked Prof Langer to find a method to deliver angiogenesis-inhibiting drugs to the tumour.\n\n\"I spent years in the laboratory experimenting with different materials and different designs to deliver the drugs. I found 200 different ways not to get this done.\" said Prof Langer at the summit.\n\n\"But eventually, I was able to make tiny little nanoparticles which could deliver molecules of any size, including nucleic acids and mRNA.\"\n\nHe innovated a way to encase drug molecules within an ultra-small particle, which could attach to the tumour and release the drug over time via diffusion. He published his findings in 1976 in Nature, a prestigious scientific journal.\n\nRidiculed\n\n\"When I first presented this work, it was ridiculed. I was 27 years old, the youngest person in that room.\n\n\"When I finished the talk, I thought all these older people would encourage me as a young researcher. But as I stepped off the podium, a bunch of them came up to me and said, 'We don't believe anything you just said'.\"\n\nScientists dismissed his work, believing that large molecules were too big to exit the nanoparticles.\n\nUndeterred, Prof Langer sought a faculty position in a university to obtain more funding to continue his research, but no one would take him.\n\n\"No chemical engineering department in the world would hire me. They said, 'All this biology stuff you're doing doesn't make any sense for a chemical engineer. You should be doing oil and energy'.\"\n\nProf Langer eventually managed to land a job in the MIT nutrition department. However, he was later advised to leave by his colleagues when they found out about his unusual field of research.\n\n\"One evening, I went to a faculty dinner at a Chinese restaurant with some senior MIT professors. A senior scientist sat quizzing us while smoking a cigar. When he heard my concept for drug delivery, he blew a cloud of smoke in my face and said, 'You better start looking for another job',\" said Prof Langer.\n\nBut he persisted in his research, and his work slowly gained traction in the scientific community. He then tried to file a patent for his drug delivery idea.\n\n\"Five years in a row, the patent examiner rejected it,\" he said. \"But you can tell by now (that) I don't like to give up, so I started to think about how could we convince the examiner to approve it.\"\n\nProf Langer compiled citations from eminent scientists who commended his work over the years, and finally secured a patent in 1983. This would mark the start of an illustrious series of successes.\n\nHe went on to file over 1,200 patents, licensed to more than 300 pharmaceutical, biotechnology, chemical and medical device companies. He also became the most cited engineer in history, with more than 380,000 citations from the myriad research papers he authored or co-authored.\n\nHe founded or co-founded 41 companies. He co-founded Moderna in 2010.\n\n\"Once I was able to deliver large molecules over long times, I thought this might be a great way to deliver vaccines,\" he told The Straits Times in an e-mail interview on Jan 20.\n\n\"I published my first paper on this in the Journal Of Immunological Methods in 1979. But it was not until I helped start Moderna that I contributed to the industrial development of novel vaccines.\"\n\nModerna made mRNA-based medicines using Prof Langer's drug delivery method, which eventually became the foundation for the development of Moderna's Covid-19 mRNA vaccines.\n\n\"I'm highly prejudiced but I think Moderna's future will be incredible,\" he said.\n\n\"The scientists and leadership (at Moderna) are superb... The company has some 50 programmes being developed for new vaccines and new therapies.\n\n\"Moderna has changed the world and the medical field, and I believe it will continue to do so.\"\n\nAsked at the summit what kept him going and believing in his idea despite the repeated rejections and setbacks, Prof Langer replied: \"I was very lucky that Judah Folkman went through a lot of the same things as I did, where people didn't believe in what he was doing, and yet he kept trying and believing. He was a great role model.\n\n\"In my upbringing, my dad ran a tiny liquor store in Albany (New York), and he worked all the time - another great role model. Maybe some part of it is genetics. I am a really stubborn person.\"\n\nThe summit, organised by the National Research Foundation, was held from Jan 17 to Jan 20. It featured lectures and panel discussions with 21 eminent scientists, including Nobel laureates and winners of the Millennium Technology Prize, awarded by independent foundation Technology Academy Finland.\n\nLucas Tan\n\nPHARMACEUTICALS SECTOR\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 29, 2024, 11:15pm\n\nZyrtec-D no longer available due to health risk concerns\n\nDec 8, 2023, 02:37am\n\nSome shops run out of ART kits as number of Covid-19 cases rises\n\nNov 14, 2022, 09:44am\n\nWatch out for these supplements with potent substances: HSA\n\nOct 31, 2022, 12:01pm\n\nIndonesia revokes firms' fever syrup licences amid probe into 150 deaths\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/31427bcdc9ff6bc0e0623fe4e6f948e01926f482cc1ba6f0a71b59a4f395e9b7/robert20langer2028129_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Professor Robert Langer founded or co-founded 41 companies, notably being the co-founder of Moderna in 2010. \n", "caption": "Professor Robert Langer founded or co-founded 41 companies, notably being the co-founder of Moderna in 2010.

Monday's figure also was around 20 percent lower than the number logged a week earlier.\n\nThe country added 30 Covid-19 deaths, bringing the death toll to 33,420. The number of critically ill patients came to 402, down from 420 the previous day, the KDCA said.\n\nIn May, South Korea\n\nlifted the outdoor mask mandate\n\nin a major step toward supporting people's return to normalcy.\n\nAs mask requirements were eased, confusion lingered among students, teachers and workers demanding accurate and detailed guidelines for schools and workplaces.\n\nA second grade elementary school student named Lee Sang-hyun who lives in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, has never experienced mask-free school life as he entered elementary school during the pandemic. He said: \"I will keep wearing masks because I think it will be dangerous. I've been used to it for two years, so it's not that uncomfortable.\"\n\nSome teachers said there won't be a dramatic change at schools as some students, especially those in teenage groups, have not been following the rules from months before.\n\n\"This easing of mask obligations doesn't feel like such a dramatic change,\" said Ms Jang Hwa-kyung, a high-school teacher in Incheon, adding that she thinks it is about time to ease the regulations.\n\n\"In the early days of Covid-19, children followed the rules, but as time went by, their awareness decreased. As I recall, the mask mandate has not been strictly followed since last summer,\" she said, adding that there are many obstacles to fully monitoring her students.\n\n\"Teachers can make students wear masks during class time, but honestly, it is impossible to keep it that way during break times.

An association of private institutes in Gangnam recommended the students to wear masks by February.\n\nA teacher at DaechiPL Academy in Gangnam-gu said that opinions are divided among teachers. \"Some teachers say they will encourage everyone to wear masks, while others say they will only ask children with cold symptoms to wear it. But as it is not an obligation anymore, it will be hard to enforce if children resist.\"\n\nHe also hinted that to adolescents, masks are sometimes considered a way to cover one's face rather than as a protective measure against the virus. \"Some children said they would keep wearing masks to cover their faces because they are worried about their appearance, aside from Covid-19,\" he said. - THE KOREA HERALD/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nSouth Korea to require Covid-19 tests for HK, Macau travellers; new Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 detected\n\nSouth Korea’s education success is faltering in evolving economy: Report\n\nSouth Korea\n\ncovid-19\n\nPrimary School\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 28, 2025, 01:14am\n\nWoman left in vegetative state by botched procedure returns to S'pore\n\nJan 13, 2025, 09:32am\n\nFans wait 7 hours in the rain for (G)I-dle's Minnie at Chagee opening\n\nDec 31, 2024, 02:48am\n\nWhy is there a concrete wall near the end of Muan Airport runway?\n\nDec 29, 2024, 11:41pm\n\nGrief fills Muan Airport as families wait for victims to be identified\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e0807fa63ffa485cf398f6c8a13af3dc84d7a65a11da51faa3775feddb649c7e/2023-01-30T042609Z1534755381RC2R0Z9XPH5NRTRMADP3HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-SOUTHKOREA.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Starting Monday, people can visit most places, including schools, kindergartens and gyms, without masks.", "caption": "Starting Monday, people can visit most places, including schools, kindergartens and gyms, without masks.

It was the three-year-old's first start on turf, having finished second in three Polytrack outings.\n\nST PHOTO: SHAHRIYA YAHAYA\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 29, 2023, 03:26pm\n\nItalian Revolution runs riot\n\nBridesmaid's tag is shed as Baertschiger's three-year-old finally goes one better\n\nShare this article\n\nAfter knocking on the door for a while, Italian Revolution finally broke through for his first hurrah on Saturday.\n\nA first test on grass proved to be the winning formula, even if the Caravaggio three-year-old was no slouch on Polytrack, as evidenced by his three seconds from as many starts.\n\nBut, convinced that turf is still his strongest suit, trainer Shane Baertschiger must have felt vindicated when the on-pace galloper led from barrier to box in the $75,000 Restricted Maiden race over 1,200m.\n\n\"I was looking for a first run on turf for him at the last meeting in 2022, but he couldn't get a run. He's better on turf,\" said the Australian.\n\n\"But he's actually beaten by some pretty good horses at his three starts, especially that handy horse (Mykyta) at his last start.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nBesides a surface switch, a change of pilot was the other new element thrown into the equation.\n\nBut again, Baertschiger qualified that the booking of top jockey Vlad Duric in lieu of stable rider Matthew Kellady was purely tactical.\n\n\"Matty did nothing wrong on this horse, but he's had three chances on him. So I thought I'd give Vlad a try and see how we go,\" he said.\n\nThe four-time Singapore champion jockey modestly played down his contribution, though, bouncing off all the credit to the conveyance he was legged up on.\n\n\"Shane has been wanting to take a seat with this horse for a while. But not today, as it was a small field,\" said the Australian hoop.\n\n\"He stood there for a long time, but he sprung the gates very well. He controlled the race and had no pressure.\n\n\"He was good today, he pricked his ears, so I had plenty of horse. But, if there is some pressure in front, he can be vulnerable.\n\n\"Going forward, he can also sit off a high-pressure race as he has a good turn of foot.\n\n\"But I think he's just a sprinting type. He's a neat horse who will win plenty of races.\"\n\nDuric has seldom been seen since racing resumed on Jan 7, with Italian Revolution being only his sixth ride.\n\nBut, as the heavyweight rider cannot cut his arm off, he has learned how to make the best out of a weighty situation.\n\n\"After six weeks off (during the December break), I struggle with my weight at my age, but I chipped away,\" he said philosophically.\n\n\"Those good horses come up now and again, though, and I'm happy to get my fair share of winners.\"\n\nPicking and choosing quality rides that fit his weight range is one thing, but he still has to steer them home.\n\nHe duly turned up with a copybook front-running ride on Italian Revolution.\n\nThough the $8 favourite was not out like a scalded cat at barrier rise, Duric just had to bustle him up for that perfectly dosed early burst to find the front.\n\nOnce the rail was secured, the pair enjoyed a soft lead, even with debutants Nimbus Cloud (Krisna Thangamani) and Star Express (Louis-Philippe Beuzelin) three abreast for most of the way.\n\nWith the other fancies like Diaz (Manoel Nunes) and Tantheman (Wong Chin Chuen) not making their presence felt in the straight, it was left to the leading trio to fill the trifecta.\n\nItalian Revolution strolled in virtually uncontested with 2¼ lengths to spare from Nimbus Cloud. Star Express stuck on for third, another ½-length away.\n\nThe winning time was 1min 11.03sec for the 1,200m on the long course.\n\nDuric was right on the money again on the Stephen Gray-trained Prioritize ($16) in the $30,000 Class 5 race over the Poly 1,700m, for a riding double from only four rides.\n\nBaertschiger was incidentally opening his account for 2023, aptly with a new charge shedding his maiden status for a loyal customer of his.\n\n\"MA Racing is my biggest supporter. It's good to get a winner for them early,\" said Baertschiger, who has trained Group winners Bestothelign, Faaltless and Nepean for the local outfit.\n\n\"I got this horse as a yearling for only A$70,000 ($65,300) in Melbourne. I think he's won over $80,000 now, so he's paid for himself, and whatever he does from now on is a bonus.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d51a2e31db68b470b863c146338b336e16614743590fed84145eddb8d2a18bed/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Italian Revolution (Vlad Duric) leading from pillar to post to give trainer Shane Baertschiger his first winner for 2023.

But the point now is that we need to set aside a time of reflection.\"\n\nShe goes on, speaking to the viewer: \"Guys who just collected your O-level results, you are more than your results, all right?\"\n\nShe even plugs her social media account: \"Stay tuned for what happens after O levels.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 24, 2025, 12:59am\n\nThose who were hit as kids are more willing to physically punish their own children: S'pore study\n\nMore related stories\n\nThough she tried to focus on a positive message at the end, many netizens felt she had crossed the line. Some slammed her for being disingenuous in consoling her daughter when at her most vulnerable, while others suggested she was exploiting the moment for social media likes.\n\nView post on TikTok\n\n@sarahxmiracle\n\n#miraclefamilie\n\n#holdup\n\n#players\n\n#coileray\n\n#momlife\n\n#momof4\n\n#momsoftiktok\n\n#bigfamily\n\n♬ Players - DJ Smallz 732 - Jersey Club Remix - Coi Leray\n\nThe new social media mum\n\nTo be fair, while the Singaporean singer-songwriter's social media presence is centred around her family content, it rarely involves embarrassing moments of her children.\n\nHer daughter was also quick to post a video rebutting the idea that she had been used as \"crying bait\" by her mother, which went some way to assuage concerns that the teenager had been filmed without her consent entirely.\n\nBut the episode begged the question of whether children, even in innocent and non-embarrassing situations, should be used for social media content. After all, all over the Internet, many mumfluencers (a hybrid term that refers to mums who are social media influencers), and sometimes dad influencers, have grown their following by posting pictures of their children.\n\n\"The rise of mum/mom/mommy bloggers has been a worldwide trend, with some mum bloggers now earning a significant income from their personal 'brand' and role as social media influencers,\" wrote Dr Catherine Archer, a senior lecturer specialising in social media and strategic communication at Edith Cowan University, in 2019 in the Media International Australia journal.\n\nOne well-known example is Californian photographer Laura Izumikawa (@lauraiz), who found Internet fame by posting cute shots of her sleeping daughter Joey dressed as pop culture icons and celebrities.\n\nOf course, influencers are not the only people to post photos of their children. Social media is awash with pictures and videos of babies and toddlers, many obviously too young to give consent or know what consent means.\n\nPerhaps it's easy to get caught up in the sharing frenzy. Many of us can forget about boundaries.\n\nFor one thing, where is the line? A photo of your baby in a diaper looks cute, but what about a photo of a toddler who is potty training, or a child taking a bubble bath? Such photos are ripe for exploitation and could be used in ways beyond your control.\n\nIn 2020, Ms Amanda Morgan found photos of her then six-month-old daughter taken from her Facebook and Instagram pages and shared on websites featuring paedophile content. Lurking on the Internet are all kinds of danger - voyeurs, predators and other unsavoury characters.\n\nAnd since what goes on the Internet stays on the Internet, even deleting the photo after experiencing \"posting remorse\" does not preclude the possibility that someone has already saved the picture on his desktop and is storing it away for some nefarious use some time in the future.\n\nHow social media replaced conversations\n\nWith social media, we live a large part of our lives in a public space. We can easily sleepwalk into oversharing, without realising the content we share can compromise the privacy of others, beyond our immediate family circle.\n\nThere are people who feel compelled to post when they quarrel with their partners or while waiting for their parents to be treated at the accident and emergency department.\n\nAnd when there is a stranger misbehaving or a child having a meltdown on the MRT, many automatically click record and share the video of the incident with others, with no regard for the person whose behaviour might be caused by deeper problems, a mental illness or developmental disorders.\n\nWhy then do we still continue with such thoughtless actions?\n\nDr Brandon Koh, an industrial-organisational psychologist and lecturer at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, has an inkling. He said in a blog post on the university's website that social media provides people with \"a shroud of anonymity, lowering the barrier to initiate or participate in public shaming\", and \"magnifies the reach of such public-shaming acts to a wider audience\".\n\nSo is Cheng-De Winne comforting her daughter after her O levels a private moment requiring a more human response, not to be shared with faceless followers? Perhaps.\n\nWhen dealing with stress, pain and heartbreak, time is needed for wounds to heal. Turning the experience into social media fodder can interrupt this crucial healing process.\n\nIs it that we have forgotten how to connect with others without using our phones? If so, how will our children learn to cope with the complicated feelings they might go through in times of conflict, loss and distress - apart from picking up the instinct to pick up a phone and broadcast them to others? Would posting a Stitch to their video on TikTok help them deal with their emotional needs?\n\nNot living for the likes\n\nSocial media has rewired the way we communicate and process our emotions, so it's understandable that digital natives want to document moments of the day.\n\nIndeed, from food to love to travel, we seem to be unable to live life to the fullest without our smartphones and data plans. Our camera \"eats\" before us as we snap photos of our lunch before digging into it, and our holidays are spent chasing Instagrammable moments.\n\nBut by living for the \"Likes\" and \"Share\" instead of for the moment, are we becoming more detached from the actual experience?\n\nChildren are being initiated into this world much sooner. A global study by international think-tank DQ Institute in 2018 showed that 85 per cent of Singapore children aged eight to 12 are active on social media. I have friends whose children as young as three or four are allowed to scroll through TikTok videos. While children cannot be totally protected from online dangers, parents can take the lead and set a good example by demonstrating healthy social media habits.\n\nFirst, show how we can live outside our smartphones and social media. Take the time to help your child communicate better and learn how to have a heartfelt conversation and establish meaningful connections.\n\nSecond, when posting on social media, consider what content is worth posting, and set boundaries on what you share publicly, especially photos that feature any form of nudity or show your children or other people in vulnerable situations, and make that distinction clear to your children.\n\nWhen they are old enough, get your children involved in the decision to post content. As they get older, they might develop an informed attitude towards social media, with a perspective on how to regulate their exposure, resist the pressures of comparison that come with its use, and establish a healthy relationship with it.\n\nDear parents, think before you post that picture or video. Instead of capturing the moment for the world, why not relish the moment and savour that rare experience of being with your daughter as she goes through a rite of passage, such as the pivotal moment when collecting O-level results? Surely, this special bonding moment is worth more than likes and shares.\n\n*Annie Tan is a mother of two and a freelance writer who writes on women's issues.\n\nAnnie Tan\n\nparenting\n\nsocial media\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 16, 2025, 08:55am\n\nDad's emotional support after her mum's death helps taekwondo champ fly high\n\nMar 27, 2025, 10:40am\n\nParents to get 6 weeks shared leave for babies born on or after April 1\n\nMar 23, 2025, 12:00am\n\n'I needed to protect her against dark thoughts': Father of 5, whose wife had postnatal depression\n\nMar 22, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nMore fathers in Singapore seeking help for postnatal depression\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6aab16928a46bd6f2af0bd3172e946390f532c46269e1487fce08fe13b4a0bc4/acbabiesvid220123.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Social media is awash with pictures and videos of babies and toddlers, many obviously too young to give consent. \n", "caption": "Social media is awash with pictures and videos of babies and toddlers, many obviously too young to give consent.

Only my team and family know what we have been through in the last four or five weeks and this is why I'd probably say this is the biggest victory in my life, considering the circumstances,\" added Djokovic, who was more emotional than usual.\n\nThere had been an air of inevitability about Djokovic triumphing again. After his three-year ban from Australia was lifted, he won the lead-up Adelaide International before reinforcing his status as an all-time great in Melbourne.\n\nHis dominant win drew him level with Nadal on a record 22 Slams, two clear of the now-retired Roger Federer. The Spaniard made a second-round exit with a hip injury, one of a series of shocks which upended the men's and women's draws during the first Major of the year.\n\n\"I guess we always find the A-game on the Slams,\" Djokovic said, of equalling his old rival Nadal. \"This is what I feel both Nadal and myself probably still fight for.\n\n\"It is still what motivates us the most, winning the biggest titles in our sport and trying to keep up with the young guns.\"\n\n\"Tennis is in good hands,\" he added. \"But we're still not going anywhere.\"\n\nNadal and Djokovic have won 16 of the last 19 Slams. The 36-year-old Spaniard though is set to slide down the rankings when they are released on Monday, in contrast to Djokovic. The Serb will dethrone Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz and return to world No. 1 for the first time since June 2022. Tsitsipas will climb one place to third.\n\nBoth men were back on a court that helped them rise to stardom.\n\nCheck out this tweet!\n\nlink\n\nJanuary 29, 2023\n\nDjokovic won his first Grand Slam in 2008 on Rod Laver Arena while Tsitsipas burst on the scene in 2019 when he stunned defending champion Federer in the last 16.\n\nMoving freely with only minimal strapping on his troublesome left hamstring, Djokovic opened with a comfortable hold after being greeted by huge cheers.\n\nHe worked two break points on Tsitsipas's opening serve, to no avail, but kept probing and the Greek handed him a break for 3-1 with a careless double fault. Tsitsipas, 24, in only his second Grand Slam final to Djokovic's 33rd, appeared nervous, losing the first set.\n\nBut he battled back into contention in a much closer second set as his confidence grew, earning his first break point - and set point - when Djokovic blasted a backhand wide.\n\nBut the Serb clung on to keep the set on serve and it went to a tiebreak, where his greater experience roared to the fore.\n\nAgainst the odds, Tsitsipas broke for the first time on Djokovic's opening serve in set three, only to relinquish the advantage immediately after a gripping rally.\n\nIt again went to a tiebreak, where Djokovic once again raised a level.\n\nNovak Djokovic (right) shaking hands with Stefanos Tsitsipas after winning the final match at the Australian Open on Jan 29, 2023.

I don't think there's any reason for me to be affected by today's loss.\"\n\n\"It is a step forward. I'm looking forward to scoring more points during this season, making bigger results, fighting for bigger trophies.\"\n\nHe added: \"Getting our asses kicked is for sure a very good lesson every single time... I don't see any reason to be lowering my expectations or my goals.\n\n\"I am born a champion.

Here is a look at some of them:\n\nPenny stock crash masterminds John Soh Chee Wen and Quah Su-Ling\n\nJohn Soh Chee Wen and Quah Su-Ling were found guilty of market manipulation that led to the October 2013 penny stock crash that wiped $8 billion in market capitalisation from the Singapore Exchange.\n\nThe duo had manipulated the share prices of three investment companies: Blumont Group, Asiasons Capital and LionGold Corp.\n\nSoh and Quah had engaged in \"wash trading\" - a form of market manipulation in which a trader buys and sells a stock simultaneously. This creates an illusion of demand and artificially inflates the price of the stock.\n\nThe case was described as the \"most serious case of stock manipulation in Singapore\" by the prosecution.\n\nOn Dec 28, 2022, Soh was sentenced to 36 years' imprisonment, while Quah was sentenced to 20 years' jail.\n\nFormer Agritrade CFO Lim Beng Kim\n\nLim Beng Kim, former chief financial officer of commodities trader Agritrade International, defrauded over a dozen banks, causing almost US$500 million in losses.\n\nAccording to the charge sheets, Lim deceived 16 financial institutions into believing that financial statements for Agritrade and its units were audited.\n\nShe also instructed her subordinate to insert a copy of the auditor's signature into a document that was falsely claimed to be the audited statements.\n\nOn Jan 17, 2023, she was sentenced to 20 years' jail for her crime.\n\nOver a dozen individuals linked to the Shell oil heist\n\nMore than a dozen individuals were arrested after a series of raids uncovered the theft of about US$150 million worth of oil from Shell's biggest global refinery over several years.\n\nThe Shell oil heist involved around 340,000 tonnes of gas oil that was siphoned from the oil major's Pulau Bukom site in Singapore, in incidents dating back to 2014.\n\nProsecutors described it as the largest and most sophisticated marine gas oil heist in Singapore's history.\n\nThe Shell oil heist involved at least three former Shell employees, and 12 former surveyors who took bribes to conceal the crime.\n\nFormer Shell employee Juandi Pungot was jailed for 29 years in March 2022 for siphoning nearly $128 million worth of gas oil, while another key player, Tiah Kok Hwee, was sentenced to over 16 years' jail.\n\nSouth-east Asia is a hot spot for illicit fuel trading, with its island-dotted waters providing cover for small-scale smuggling of oil products across borders. But the regularity and audacity of the thefts at Shell's refining facility - some of which took place during working hours - made it stand out.\n\nFormer Asia Pacific Breweries (APB) finance manager Chia Teck Leng\n\nThe authorities estimated that Chia Teck Leng lost $62 million feeding his gambling habit. PHOTO: SINGAPORE POLICE FORCE\n\nFormer APB executive Chia Teck Leng used his position as finance manager to swindle four foreign banks out of $117 million from 1999 to 2003. Only $34.8 million was recovered.\n\nAt the time, the case was Singapore's biggest involving commercial fraud.\n\nChia had been a compulsive gambler, and secretly led a double life as a high-rolling hustler with a lavish lifestyle. The authorities estimated that he lost $62 million feeding his gambling habit.\n\nChia submitted forged documents to open accounts in APB's name, with himself as the sole signatory. He transferred money drawn from three of the accounts into a fourth, and then transferred the funds to his two personal accounts.\n\nIn 2004, he was sentenced to 42 years in jail - the longest for a case of commercial fraud.\n\nSunshine Empire's James Phang Wah\n\nJames Phang Wah swindled some 20,000 Singaporeans of nearly $190 million through a Ponzi scheme. PHOTO: SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS\n\nSunshine Empire owner James Phang Wah swindled some 20,000 Singaporeans of nearly $190 million through a Ponzi scheme from 2006 to 2007.\n\nThe scheme, which promised high yields through the company's investment plan, tricked victims into purchasing nearly 26,000 \"lifestyle packages\" costing anywhere from $240 to $12,000.\n\nSunshine Empire paid earlier investors using the money paid up by new investors in what became Singapore's biggest Ponzi scheme.\n\nOf the huge sums paid to the company, only $21 million was recovered.\n\nPhang was sentenced to nine years' jail and a $60,000 fine.\n\nBarings Bank's Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson\n\nNick Leeson was caught in Germany and eventually extradited to Singapore, where he was sentenced to 6½ years in prison. PHOTO: ST FILE\n\nSingapore-based derivatives trader Nick Leeson brought down Britain's oldest merchant bank, Barings Bank, in 1995 after betting on Japanese stock and bond derivatives - and covering up the huge losses when the bets failed.\n\nIt was estimated at the time that Leeson, who wrote the book Rogue Trader about his experience, incurred losses amounting to US$1.3 billion.\n\nThe scale of those losses came as a shock to Barings and regulators. Their failure to salvage the crisis led to Barings' eventual collapse.\n\nBefore the full scale of his crimes was exposed, Leeson fled Singapore. This sparked a global pursuit of around a week, before he was caught in Germany.\n\nHe was later extradited to Singapore, where he was sentenced to 6½ years in prison. - THE BUSINESS TIMES\n\nBernadette Toh\n\nSINGAPORE COMPANIES\n\nFINANCIAL CRIMES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2f83ff3b029048e71f0c6bb9acec4fd6daa9d0aa1c762c691bc4620b32bd06cd/imgjohnsohqsl218m1choj_7.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "John Soh Chee Wen and Quah Su-Ling were found guilty of market manipulation that led to the October 2013 penny stock crash. \n", "caption": "John Soh Chee Wen and Quah Su-Ling were found guilty of market manipulation that led to the October 2013 penny stock crash.

Back on the Poly, a repeat will see her go close again. (5) PIXIE IN LOVE ran well last start with blinkers off. The filly has a chance if she stays. (7) GIMME A DREAM is better than his last run suggests. The gelding has shown some improvement first-up on the Poly. (4) SALIENT POINT was a close third at long odds last time. He has fair Poly form.\n\nRace 2 (2,000m)\n\n(5) HEY BILL is consistent and was a beaten favourite against stronger rivals last time. The drop in class should see him home first. (2) RICCARDO finished a neck behind Hey Bill. Slightly better off on weights, he will go close again. (4) QUESTION MASTER is way better than his last effort indicates. He goes well for jockey Jason Gates. (1) LORD MINVER is never far back and has a light weight. He loves the Poly.\n\nRace 3 (1,600m)\n\n(4) CORSICAN looks the obvious choice. He has been consistent on the Poly and is distance suited. He will not get a beater chance to shed his maiden status. Stablemate (1) MISTER LINCOLN started at long odds in his sprint debut and was a well-beaten third. Stepping up to a more suitable trip and with improvement, he is the biggest threat. (2) DUKE OF AFRICA is lightly raced and is back after a short break. His best form has been on the Poly and he would not be a surprise winner. (6) LAW COURT is also lightly raced but has shown some ability. The Poly could suit.\n\nRace 4 (1,000m)\n\n(5) ADDIENA won very well over the course and distance last start. She got a six-point rise in handicap but that should not stop her from scoring again. There will be a good pace on from the jump with stable companions (6) MAGICALLEE and (1) PUFF OF SMOKE in the race. Puff Of Smoke has come good and has stable rider Kabelo Matsunyane aboard with a handy weight. (2) RUSSIAN DOLL has yet to finish out of the money in four starts. Her best form is on the Poly. Although giving weight to all, she is the class horse and should put in another good effort.\n\nRace 5 (1,400m)\n\n(3) CRESTED EAGLE has not finished far behind in his recent outings. With a big drop in class, the gelding appears the one to beat with apprentice jockey Rachel Venniker's 1.5kg claim. (1) ALLAROUNDTHEWORLD is consistent but finally shed his maiden tag only at his last outing. He looks capable of scoring again now that he has struck winning form. (4) JUSTFORTHEEPENNY has been dropping in the handicap and is overdue for another win. This is his best trip. (7) GIAMBATTISTA comes from a very much in-form stable. Having won over this course and distance, he cannot be left out of any calculations.\n\nRace 6 (1,400m)\n\n(3) MOVIE MAGIC found traffic last run but his form before that was solid. The gelding is best over this course and trip. (5) MAC HARDY was disappointing last run but now gets blinkers to spark him up. Lightly raced, he could still have more to come. (7) QUIZ MASTER has been knocking on the door and is better off on weights with (4) CAPETOWN AFFAIR for a length's beating. There should be very little between the two.\n\nRace 7 (1,700m)\n\n(4) ZAKHO was an impressive maiden winner when tried on the Poly and is returning from a short break. He stays the trip and looks progressive. (3) ICE KINGDOM took time to get off the mark but both his recent wins were on the Poly, with two turf runs separating. He takes another step up in trip and a drop in class. (1) BARBATTI shed his maiden tag last run. He is up in trip but has shown before that he could stay the extra distance. (9) LOU LOU THE LEGEND is lightly raced and is having his second after a break.

Both have since changed ownership, with Hamama even transferred to Mahadi Taib.\n\nPairing off from a long way out, the eye-balling duo gave each other no quarter well into the Polytrack home straight.\n\nBoth could be vulnerable to a swooper but neither buckled under pressure, even if they were running on fumes.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nAs Simon Kok upped the ante on Qaidoom, Hamama matched her grey challenger stride for stride under Saifudin Ismail's urgings.\n\nIt was only inside the last 100m that the war of attrition finally unveiled a winner.\n\nQaidoom slowly gained the ascendancy as a gallant Hamama eventually surrendered to the even-money favourite to run sixth, creditably less than two lengths astern.\n\nLim's Craft (A'Isisuhairi Kasim) and Hyde Park (Jerlyn Seow) pounced late but they could not lower the boom on Qaidoom.\n\nA neck split the Pacific Stable's new acquisition and Lim's Craft, with Hyde Park third, another ½-length away. The winner clocked 59.49sec for the 1,000m on the all-weather track.\n\nWith Clements away at the Karaka yearling sale in New Zealand, assistant trainer Michael \"Chopsy\" White was on hand to lead in the yard's sixth winner that cemented their current first place on the log.\n\n\"She is a bread-and-butter speedy mare and she's got down to the right weight in the handicap,\" said the Australian.\n\n\"The owners have started to invest heavily in horses. They want to become big players.\n\n\"This mare has come up for sale and she fitted the bill, even if she's no star.\"\n\nWith Qaidoom's two previous wins recorded on debut in Open Maiden company and in a Class 5 event, White was keeping things in perspective.\n\n\"I think she's just a genuine Class 4 1,000m type,\" he said.\n\n\"It'll be harder for her now as she may end going up and down in the ratings.\"\n\nKok said the win might not have looked pretty but he had to think on his feet when Plan A did not come off.\n\n\"I discussed with Clements before he left, and Chopsy in the parade ring. They both told me she was a mare who likes to go forward,\" said the Malaysian jockey.\n\n\"We studied the form and thought Hamama would be up there, and to track her up in second.\n\n\"But my horse began so well. I tried to make her come back but she was always working onto the bridle.\n\n\"Hamama set a very fast pace. I was happy to sit on the outside but I didn't want to use my horse too much.\n\n\"But at the 450m, I was a bit worried when she hit a flat spot. I had to ride her hands and heels to hold my position.\n\n\"She then kicked clear but, in the last 50m, Lim's Craft was coming in fast. Luckily, she stayed on well to the line and we hung on.\n\n\"I'm lucky enough to have got a winner at my first ride for the owners. They have a lot of quality horses coming up.\n\n\"CC (Wong Chin Chuen) rides most of their horses but I pick up whatever I can.\n\n\"I've now ridden three winners all up. So I can't complain with the way my season has gone so far.\"\n\nThe day's riding honours were shared between Kranji's current leading hoops, Wong and last year's title holder and four-time Singapore champion Manoel Nunes, both well clear of the rest.\n\nWong scored aboard Big Day, Star Empire and Nineoneone while Nunes hit back with Aftermath, War Pride and Takhi.\n\nThey are tied on 11 winners, with Nunes keeping the yellow jersey on a countback for seconds.\n\nSaturday's Singapore Results:\n\nsares29.pd\n\nf\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a72851a407dffadadc9a69f706fe147da448f0657906f1b57a2b23827f067cd7/unnamed_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Qaidoom (Simon Kok) holding her rivals at bay in the Class 4 event over the Polytrack 1,000m in Race 11 on Saturday.

The Smart Missile three-year-old trialled thrice before that for another third and a second.\n\nPHOTO: STC\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 27, 2023, 09:38pm\n\nTantheman, not the name Tan meant, but it will do\n\nThunder Man or otherwise, Kranji trainer is unfazed; he just hopes horse goes boom\n\nShare this article\n\nLocal trainer Jerome Tan is well known around Kranji for his great sense of humour.\n\nWhen a new horse he owns and trains was recently unveiled as Tantheman, it is not hard to imagine how he would have been the target of some light banter.\n\nBut as much as the Singaporean has a jocular side, even the slightly chest-thumping namesake seemed out of character to his media-shy nature.\n\nIt turned out Tantheman was never the name he had intended to register the Smart Missile three-year-old as.\n\nFans might be disappointed, but Tan does not harbour illusions of grandeur or dreams of himself in spandex.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nAs is sometimes the case, a simple admin error was the culprit, and phonetics the root cause.\n\n\"I wanted to call him Thunder Man, but somehow, the officer heard wrongly and wrote his name down as Tantheman,\" said Tan.\n\n\"By the time I found out, it was too late to change. So I decided to leave it as Tantheman.\"\n\nWhether Thunder Man has a nicer ring than Tantheman is a case for conjecture, but this is how the A$20,000 (S$18,600) purchase as a yearling will now be known as.\n\nAfter all, horses cannot spell, and if they are to take the racing scene by storm, it does not really matter if they are named Thunder, Trigger or Tumbleweed.\n\nBesides, the racing world has hatched many happy endings to such typo-induced misnamed horses.\n\nAmerican Pharoah, the 2015 US Triple Crown winner, is a famous case in point. The misspelling of \"Pharoah\" (instead of Pharaoh) also arose through an inadvertent mistake.\n\nTan has graciously moved on from the \"Thunder Blunder\" - so long it was not a mistake made at the sale ring of the Inglis HTBA Yearling Sale in Sydney in 2021.\n\n\"I really liked the horse. He had a nice conformation,\" he said.\n\n\"I got him as a yearling for A$20,000. In the end I kept him for myself.\"\n\nTan had to wrap his new ward up in cotton wool for a while, though.\n\n\"He had some issues when he came, he had a stress fracture. That's why he took a little longer to get ready,\" he said.\n\n\"But he's very well now. I was very happy with his trials.\n\n\"I think he will run a good race. He's got a chance.\"\n\nThe top of the market of the $75,000 Restricted Maiden race over 1,200m on Saturday is likely to be hogged by Italian Revolution and debutant Diaz, while, interestingly enough, the other horse who may \"steal the thunder\" is another newbie who goes by the name of Thunder Hero.\n\nIn-form jockey Wong Chin Chuen, who was aboard at all of Tantheman's four barrier trials, keeps the reins.\n\nRunner-up to Manoel Nunes in 2022, Wong shares the same number of winners (eight) as the Brazilian, but the Malaysian hoop sits in second place on a countback for seconds.\n\nOn the other hand, Tan, who finished mid-table in 2022 with a decent haul of 24 winners, has yet to get on the scoresheet after three meetings.\n\nThe 55-year-old, who relocated to his home turf in 2019 after cutting his teeth as a trainer in Penang for 10 years, will be banking on either Tantheman or his other two runners Big Day ($30,000 Class 5 race over 1,400m) and Savvy Command ($50,000 Class 4 race over 1,000m) to break the deadlock as soon as possible.\n\nIn 2022, he had to wait for two months before he led in his first winner Sacred Gift on March 5. When it rains it pours, though. Tan racked up 10 more winners in the next eight weeks.\n\nTan does not dwell on the past, but would rather look ahead instead.\n\nHe is currently taking care of the future at the New Zealand Bloodstock's 2023 National Yearling Sale, which takes place in Karaka from Sunday to Tuesday.\n\n\"I haven't seen anything yet. Hopefully, I can find a nice horse,\" he said.\n\nIf he does, he may well get another chance of getting his Thunder Man for real this time.\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ec1f48fe2747733629bf0bd02f593de60859b5516d8b7b48d9a365c6118e9f01/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Tantheman (Wong Chin Chuen, No. 4) finishing third to Sirbring Colt in a barrier trial on Jan 17.

They chatted normally initially, but the girl soon became annoyed with Teo for teasing her, and she blocked him from contacting her on the platform.\n\nSome months later, Teo messaged her on Instagram and asked her to meet him. She initially refused, but Teo persisted and she relented.\n\nNothing out of the ordinary happened during their first meeting, but when they went to watch a movie a few days later, Teo asked her to perform a sex act on him. She was 11 or 12 years old then.\n\nDespite her refusal, Teo unzipped his trousers and exposed himself.\n\nAs she walked out of the cinema in anger, Teo followed her and apologised, offering to take her home. On their way to her home in a taxi, Teo tried to get the girl to touch him again.\n\nSome time in October 2020, Teo contacted the girl, who was 13 by then, and offered her $100 to send him naked photos of herself, but she refused.\n\nHe then offered her $150 to expose herself on video, and she agreed to it. During the video call, Teo, who was also exposing himself, recorded the video without the girl's knowledge.\n\nOn Jan 17, 2021, at about 3.30pm, Teo called the older sister, then 15, and asked if she wanted to be friends with him. He kept quiet when she asked who he was before he started moaning and making other sexual noises.\n\nWhen the girl ended the call, Teo asked her in a message if she wanted to see his penis. She ignored the message. He then told her about his exchange with her sister and sent her a recording of the conversation.\n\nThe older sister then spoke to her sister and told their mother about Teo. The mother made a police report.\n\nTeo was arrested in his home on Jan 24, 2021, and officers found a thumb drive containing 502 pornographic videos, 354 of which were related to child abuse.\n\nWhile he was out on bail, Teo joined a WhatsApp group that was created to let students from a girls' school talk about their school life.\n\nHe found the group through a link on a social media profile page and sent lewd messages to several girls whose numbers he had obtained via the chat.\n\nTeo will return to court on March 10 for sentencing.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/32af7b2e3239da53c0b05d38ab2fcdd14a8d5ace2bb13754f76a4d21345c11bb/ac1i792520copy_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Teo Jun How pleaded guilty to nine charges on Friday.

The Thai vendors come from different provinces and 30 of them will operate food stalls.\n\nFor instance, visitors can tuck into Thai kway chap from Lopburi province in central Thailand, cha chak (Thai teh tarik) from Satun province in southern Thailand and Thai otah from Phrachuap Khiri Khan, a town in western Thailand. The otah come in flavours of crab, prawn, fish and squid.\n\nThere will also be 50 food stalls run by local vendors selling Thai fare such as moo ping (Thai grilled pork skewers), boat noodles, grilled giant river prawns and coconut shake.\n\nChatuchak Night Market Singapore is not officially linked to Bangkok's Chatuchak Weekend Market, but 20 of the Thai vendors are from there, including King Octopus, which sells grilled baby octopus.\n\nSome of the Thai vendors were last in Singapore in 2020 for the inaugural edition, which launched on Feb 4 with 200 stalls and was originally slated to run until May 3 that year. But the market had to be prematurely closed in March because of Covid-19 restrictions.\n\n(Clockwise from left) Cha chak (Thai teh tarik), Thai otah from Prachuap Khiri Khan and Thai kway chap from Lopburi province. PHOTOS: CHATUCHAK SG\n\nMr Keith Tay, 40, the company director of event organiser Chatuchak Sg, says he incurred financial losses then, but declined to disclose the amount. But in the last three years, he had always hoped to bring the event back.\n\nWhen pandemic measures were eased in Singapore, he started planning six months ago. He made four trips to Thailand to source for vendors and iron out the logistics and accommodation for them.\n\nHe says: \"Even though travel restrictions have been lifted and many Singaporeans have visited Thailand in the last few months, the Thai food we have here is still limited. The night market will feature popular Thai food that is not commonly available here.\"\n\nDishes include leng saap moo (spicy pork spine ribs) and luk chup, a Thai marzipan dessert shaped like miniature fruit.\n\nChatuchak Night Market Singapore\n\nWhere\n\n: The Grandstand, 200 Turf Club Road\n\nWhen:\n\nFeb 7 to April 2\n\nOpen\n\n: 4 to 10pm, Tuesdays to Sundays\n\nHedy Khoo\n\nSTFood Online Editor\n\nTHAI FOOD\n\nBangkok\n\nStreet food\n\nflea market\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d6caf707c61301e347a7218f0b4874051ff20452be38cc8555f5a9e01f71e611/2.20chatuchak20night20market_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The open-air night market will feature 180 vendors, of which 60 are from Thailand. \n", "caption": "The open-air night market will feature 180 vendors, of which 60 are from Thailand.

Expect him to roll forward and, if he remains unchallenged, it would not surprise to see him prove very difficult to reel in. 4 All Joyful is worth an each-way ticket. He can improve sharply.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\n8 Eason can turn it around here. The step back in trip is more than suitable and chances are he uses the inside draw to roll forward and press for the lead under a light weight. One to beat. 7 Beauty Tycoon is chasing a fourth win from his last five starts. He is still improving and it would not surprise to see him take another step forward here. 1 Ima Single Man is holding his condition and gets 4½ kg taken off with Angus Chung's booking. 5 Power Koepp is doing everything right. Keep safe.\n\nRace 4 (1,200m)\n\n13 Double Show is consistent albeit without registering a win yet. Still he gets another chance and can improve, following his latest effort which saw him travel wide and without cover. 5 Goal Oriented was hardly given a chance on debut in a race that saw the field strung out. He is worth an each-way ticket. 6 Happy For All caught the eye in a recent trial and he must be kept safe with James McDonald hopping up. 4 Further Forward clearly has the necessary ability with Purton booked to ride.\n\nRace 5 (1,650m)\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\n9 Royal Bomb can mix his form at times. He has had several difficult runs this term but the good gate and booking of Jamie Kah will ensure he gets every chance. He can win. 1 Handsome Twelve has a significant class edge over his rivals. He has turned into a dominant force on the dirt and he may well bounce back following his latest effort. 2 True Legend is expected to roll forward and lead. Expect him to take running down from out in front. 13 Beauty Champ is after back-to-back wins. Next best.\n\nRace 6 (1,000m)\n\n10 I Give is steadily coming to hand and chances are he was allowed to press forward by his connections. He has a bit of class and the addition of pacifiers should suit. 4 Innoconstruction surprised on debut with his slashing second. Purton hops on and a repeat of that effort will see him go close. 3 Cheval Valiant gets his shot. 5 Juneau Flash catches the eye. He has the right experience to improve and his pairing with Ryan Moore is a big plus.\n\nRace 7 (1,600m)\n\nTHE STEWARDS' CUP\n\n2 Romantic Warrior was devastating last start over 2,000m in the Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Cup. Not expecting the step back in trip to pose much of a threat, although, perhaps the race map and tempo could challenge him. One to beat. 4 Waikuku always comes good at this time of the season. He is worth taking an each-way ticket on at a big price. 1 Golden Sixty is still brilliant and could easily pinch this one. 3 California Spangle is the likely leader and will remain there a while. Tough race overall.\n\nRace 8 (1,400m)\n\n7 Courier Marvel steps out for his second start. This is not an overly strong race and his debut effort will have done his experience a world of good. Prepared to take a chance on him, especially as he pairs with Alexis Badel. 10 Indigenous Realm can mix his form at times, but has the class when required. 4 Beauty Mission pairs favourably with McDonald. He is so close to a first win. 3 Good News can bounce back. He is much better than what his last-start effort suggests.\n\nRace 9 (1,600m)\n\nTHE HONG KONG CLASSIC MILE\n\nChallenging Hong Kong Classic Mile to kick off the Four-Year-Old Classic Series. Siding with 10 Tuchel who was impressive last start in Class 2 when travelling wide without cover before winning. Expect him to be over the odds. 2 Keefy just keeps on turning up. He will do the same and give this race a big shake. 9 Viva Chaleur has the ability and should be finishing fast once more. 3 Packing Treadmill will put himself on the speed. Purton hops up and this horse has ability to win and must not be underestimated.\n\nRace 10 (1,400m)\n\n7 Stunning Impact is holding his form and he looks well placed. He was caught too far back last time out but to his credit, he managed to close off with merit. One to beat. 1 Amazing Victory has both consistency and the ability to win on his side. Bears close watching on Purton's booking. 6 Copartner Ambition is racing well and has claims. The 4½kg dip in weight with the apprentice aboard holds him in good stead once more. 10 Parterre mixes his form but does have a bit of ability. Keep safe.\n\n(Comments courtesy of  The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7f0f3e8bd83b8d0a755dff1dee9d28e9c45f6ad984c95e37fdb2c53c807595c8/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "James McDonald driving Romantic Warrior to a stellar win in the Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Cup (2,000m) at Sha Tin on Dec 11.

The rats can be seen climbing on top of one another while scrabbling for the air spaces.\n\nTagging Mandai Wildlife Group - which manages the zoo - in its 'public service announcement (PSA)' on Thursday (Jan 26), HSS appealed for more air holes for the rats.\n\nIn its Instagram post, HSS said it was notified of \"a family of more than 20 rats\" under the care of the Singapore Zoo that were \"acting abnormally, putting their noses to breathe through the fine holes and gaps in the edges\" despite living in a large enclosure.\n\n\"At times they can be seen climbing on top of each other to do so,\" HSS added.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:24am\n\n'We cannot halt time': Vet advice on caring for a senior pet\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"The staff explained that the rats were 'looking for fresh air', and as the rats are confined, the staff will open the acrylic box for 30 minutes a day. We think this is not enough! Air is not an option. Air is NECESSITY to live. We hope this gets heard by the appropriate people, who will be able to make immediate changes to rectify this situation.\"\n\nThe post sparked outrage among netizens, with some slamming the zoo for \"cruelty\".\n\nHowever, the behaviour of the rats is \"not uncommon\" as the videos were taken close to feeding time, Mandai Wildlife Group told Stomp in response to queries. All 13 fancy rats, which were born in the Singapore Zoo, are also in good health, it added.\n\nDr Heng Yirui, a veterinarian at Mandai Wildlife Group, said: \"Since being made aware of the social media video circulating about our fancy rats at Singapore Zoo's Rainforest Kidzworld, we conducted an internal review to get to the bottom of what happened.\n\n\"The behaviour of the rats in the video is actually not uncommon because it was taken close to the rats' feeding time.\n\n\"By nature, rats are also highly curious animals and rely on sniffing to investigate and inspect their surroundings. The inquisitive sniffing that is seen in the video is part of how they explore new scents in the environment, including when guests go close to their home.\n\n\"All 13 fancy rats at Rainforest KidzWorld are in good health condition, with no signs of respiratory distress or laboured breathing. None of the rats in the current housing have ever been diagnosed with respiratory issues or any other medical issues relating to poor ventilation for over two years.\n\n\"Animal welfare and care of the animals are not compromised. Nevertheless, we appreciate the care and concern of all netizens who have been following this today.\"\n\nMandai Wildlife Group responding to the Hamster Society's Instagram post.\n\nDr Heng added: \"The exhibit in the video is home to 13 fancy rats and consists of two large connecting chambers, with ample space for the rats to move about. Each of these chambers is also fitted with fans to circulate air and ensure ventilation at all times. The exhibit is also cleaned daily.\"\n\nDr Heng did not directly address a question posed by Stomp about whether it is true that the enclosure is opened for 30 minutes daily.\n\nResponding to queries by Stomp, HSS said its initial concerns were based on the videos it received and comments that zoo staff had supposedly made, particularly about the \"30-minute opening of the enclosure's lid for air\" and that \"the rats were looking for fresh air\".\n\nHSS added: \"As we primarily handle hamsters, their behaviour can differ from rats. While it is not uncommon for animals to push their noses out of holes to sniff exciting smells, they also do that when there is a lack of air, which was why we were concerned.\"\n\nHSS noted that while Mandai Wildlife Group has clarified how the rats have sufficient ventilation, \"the staff's comment about the rats still needing daily lid-off ventilation for 30 minutes was not touched on\".\n\nHSS told Stomp: \"I do believe it was the part that shocked most people.\"\n\nANIMAL WELFARE\n\nSingapore Zoo\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:52am\n\nWill you give Frodo the Singapore Special a fur-ever home?\n\nJun 30, 2025, 09:34am\n\n'It was never smooth sailing': Dog welfare group ex-president reflects on 13 years at the helm\n\nJun 27, 2025, 07:49am\n\nKitten allegedly rolled in container at Tuas adopted, NParks investigating\n\nJun 26, 2025, 06:52am\n\nNParks probing case of kitten allegedly stuffed in container, rolled around\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ac270b278a10ead3292d12d97b5426971e21b656cabe1e448c7252d6416aadd3/ratsmain.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "Mandai Wildlife Group responding to the Hamster Society's Instagram post."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/22b25b4eb2260868a007fc78b4739884d4257c8f6a28018b2dd29ab60861d59c/Azmi-pixgeneric-4.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "'We cannot halt time': Vet advice on caring for a senior pet", "caption": "Mandai Wildlife Group responding to the Hamster Society's Instagram post."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/57df6de94795e5a83e431ff4ec9e9bbaffc16e1169334834b866f3016146cb13/whatsapp_image_2023-01-27_at_12.22.54_am.jpeg?w=742", "alt_text": "787", "caption": "Mandai Wildlife Group responding to the Hamster Society's Instagram post."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b7edfbb1045e2e097281c57cb5ece7818eafb56b0424ac1a1548435b95a7e143/imgonline-com-ua-FrameBlurred-SOqvliMSc5DX.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Will you give Frodo the Singapore Special a fur-ever home?", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

There she found her father, who had been drinking beer at night, asleep on the sofa. She also noticed a few cans of beer in the living room.\n\nAt that time, Kshivadarrshini's mother had left for work and her sister was asleep in her own room.\n\nSaid DPP Koh: \"The accused had previously told the victim not to drink alcohol at home, as he might urinate on himself after he was intoxicated and the accused or her mother would have to clean him up after.\n\n\"The accused then felt very angry with the victim for drinking at home even though she had told him not to. She thought that she did not want her mother and her younger sister to go through the same matter over and over again.\"\n\nShe then went to the kitchen and took a 34cm-long hammer from a drawer.\n\nWhile her father was still sleeping, she swung the hammer - which had a wooden handle and a metal head, and weighed about 700g - and struck his head three to four times.\n\nKshivadarrshini's father awoke in pain from the blows, with his head bleeding.\n\nWhen Kshivadarrshini noticed the extent of the bleeding, she called the police and said she had smashed her father's head with a hammer and that he was bleeding but conscious.\n\nAfter Kshivadarrshini was arrested, her father was taken to the emergency department at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where a doctor documented his injuries, including a 4cm cut.\n\nA scan showed that he had a fracture in his skull, and he was admitted for observation.\n\nHe was discharged on Jan 9, 2020, and was prescribed antibiotics and painkillers.\n\nOn Friday, both DPP Koh and Kshivadarrshini's lawyer, Ms Tay Xi Ying, said the case was an exceptional one.\n\nCommenting on the psychiatric report obtained by the defence, Ms Tay said that it highlighted a link between Kshivadarrshini's state of mind and her actions.\n\nKshivadarrshini will return to court on April 5 for sentencing.\n\nThe offence of voluntarily causing hurt carries a jail term of up to three years, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e8d43e80f1699e1368a8645e71d1a9317ebc713bb81c4360157ccaa7a990c999/img7006_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Kshivadarrshini Karunanethi pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt.

No details have been given about whether he was then driving for an operator.\n\nA kindergarten later engaged him to transport children with special needs. In 2011, an autistic boy, whom he found to be \"cute\", became one of his passengers.\n\nThough Tan's contract ended in 2012, he continued to be engaged privately by the children's parents to ferry the youngsters to and from school.\n\nThe boy was between four and six years old when Tan first targeted him.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, the boy was released early from kindergarten. While he was in the front passenger seat, Tan made the child perform a sexual act on him. Tan committed other similar offences against the boy during that period.\n\nOn May 4, 2016, Tan rang up a maid whom he had befriended and offered her some food. She met him with her employer's daughter, whose age was not mentioned in court documents. The maid went behind Tan's vehicle to eat after he volunteered to take care of the girl.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMan tried to rape daughter when she was four, victim ‘blames herself for everything’\n\n'Dangerous paedophile' who sexually abused 11 schoolboys gets 42 years' jail, 24 strokes\n\nHe took the girl to the front cabin of the vehicle and took an upskirt shot of her, as well as pictures of her sitting on his lap. The maid later retrieved the girl, oblivious to what Tan had done.\n\nHe also asked two other maids he had befriended to send him sexually explicit pictures of little girls. One declined, but the other agreed after he told her such pictures would arouse him.\n\nOn at least 22 occasions between May 5 and Nov 1, 2016, Tan instigated the maid to send him explicit pictures of her employer's prepubescent daughter.\n\nOn at least another eight occasions, she also sent Tan 51 photos of another prepubescent girl and three photos of her employer's prepubescent son naked.\n\nThe ages of the three children were not disclosed in court documents.\n\nAfter becoming a school bus driver in 2017, Tan used a nine-seater van to ferry children who had been victims of alleged acts of abuse.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n20 years' detention for paedophile who sexually abused 2 grand-nieces\n\nTimely to review age limit for caning rapists, say some lawyers\n\nDPP Chong said Tan knew they were under care arrangements, and he had signed an undertaking to safeguard information linked to them.\n\nOne of them was an eight-year-old girl who had allegedly been physically abused and, as part of her care arrangements, had to live with her aunt and maternal grandparents.\n\nAfter dropping off the other children on Jan 12, 2017, he molested the girl and took a video of himself committing the offence. He molested her again on Jan 16, 2017, and shot a video of the acts.\n\nThree days later, he showed the girl pictures of himself clad in underwear.\n\nLater that month, the girl felt uncomfortable about what Tan had done. She told her aunt and grandparents, who alerted her mother.\n\nThe mother alerted the police on Jan 26, 2017. Officers arrested Tan later that day and seized his phone, which contained upskirt videos of many victims.\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nCRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN/MINORS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/41957d9b6f2d15f7b5fa38fb19aad738440ce72d14917d3c7bfda944afbebd11/rrgaryalexandertan2701_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Gary Alexander Tan pleaded guilty in December 2022 to six charges, including multiple counts of molestation.", "caption": "Gary Alexander Tan pleaded guilty in December 2022 to six charges, including multiple counts of molestation.

But in the midst of towing, the actor's snow plough began to \"slide sideways\" and then \"roll down the hill\", forcing him to leap out of the vehicle.\n\nWhen he realised it was heading directly toward his nephew, he tried to divert the vehicle but was \"immediately pulled under the left side track\" and \"completely crushed\" under the snow plough.\n\nThe nephew administered aid to him until help arrived, but Renner was left with \"30 plus broken bones\", according to his most recent Instagram post on Jan 21.\n\nHowever, he remained upbeat, saying the broken bones would \"mend, grow stronger, just like (how) the love and bond with family and friends deepens\".\n\nRenner is an Oscar-nominated actor best-known for playing superhero archer Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2011.

It will also acquire 374 accessory parcels at the mall, including al fresco and multi-purpose areas spanning a total of 1.28 million sq ft, and all 2,181 carpark spaces.\n\nMustafa's managing director Mustaq Ahmad said: \"Having established ourselves in Singapore as a mega one-stop retail store for everything from fast-moving consumer goods to fashion, cosmetics and electronics, we believe the time is ripe for us to get into Malaysia.\"\n\nHe added that Capital City Mall meets many of the requirements for its first flagship store in Malaysia, including its close proximity to Singapore and ample floor area.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 26, 2024, 10:53pm\n\nMustafa Jewellery customer becomes a millionaire\n\nMore related stories\n\nBoth the Mustafa department store and Capital City Mall are expected to open for business in the second half of 2023.\n\nCapital City Mall was completed in April 2018 and opened in October that year.

These are expected to include a 315-room hotel, an 18-storey tower with 630 serviced suites, and 690 serviced apartments.\n\nThe company said it will also pursue other real estate opportunities, including helping Mustafa's identify potential sites in Malaysia and Indonesia to develop its mega stores.\n\nTrading in Capital World shares has been suspended on the Singapore Exchange since Feb 14, 2020. It has until April 30 to submit a trading resumption proposal to the exchange.\n\nCapital World chief executive Hoo Khee Leng said the deal with Mustafa's \"will fast-track Capital World's turnaround and restore value to shareholders as we work towards getting the company's share trading suspension lifted\".\n\nKang Wan Chern\n\nAssistant Business Editor\n\nMustafa Centre\n\nmalaysia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 15, 2024, 09:23am\n\nMustafa Centre to go back to staying open 24 hours\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/91b643d0e644e9e09ccce32f3aad92871e9380933e53023fe91de5b86f00951f/desweevelittleindia12108051_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The department store in Johor Bahru is expected to open for business in the second half of 2023. \n", "caption": "The department store in Johor Bahru is expected to open for business in the second half of 2023.

The victim said she was kicked because the offender was angry at her for putting on the socks wrongly. Tan also pinched the other maid.\n\nThe accused, who used to be a director and secretary at Novena Medical Centre,\n\nhad claimed trial to eight assault charges involving\n\nMs Joan Lozares Lizardo and Ms Jenefer Vegafria Arangote, both Filipinas.\n\nDistrict Judge Salina Ishak on Friday also ordered Tan to give $2,500 to Ms Lizardo and $5,100 to Ms Arangote as compensation.\n\nBefore sentencing her, the judge, who convicted Tan on seven assault charges in December 2022, said: \"All maids should be treated with dignity and respect... The victims ought to be compensated for their pain and suffering.\"\n\nThe judge gave a discharge amounting to an acquittal on one of Tan's charges involving Ms Lizardo. This means Tan cannot be charged again with the same offence.\n\nThe prosecution will be appealing against this discharge.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutors Kumaresan Gohulabalan and Ng Jun Chong stated in their submissions that Tan's husband, Mr Sim Guan Huat, had employed both domestic helpers.\n\nTan assaulted Ms Arangote on five occasions in September 2018 by pinching the woman's abdomen, chest and limbs.\n\nDuring the trial, Ms Lizardo testified that Tan had hit her many times between October 2015 and October 2018. Ms Lizardo was unable to recall the details of most of these incidents.\n\nHowever, she remembered that in October 2018, Tan was wearing a ring on her finger when she hit the maid hard on the head.\n\nMs Lizardo's accounts of abuse were corroborated by two other maids - Ms Gaborne Clayrimae Balasa and Ms Zin Mar Phyo - who had also worked for Tan.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nWoman accused of maid abuse acquitted on all charges\n\nWoman convicted of maid abuse after attempting to cover victim’s bruises with make-up\n\nThe DPPs told Judge Salina: \"She felt pain when the accused hit her.

She explained that the accused was very angry and had been screaming for her socks.\"\n\nOn another occasion, Ms Lizardo testified that she was on the front porch of the Paradise Island house on Oct 12, 2018, when Tan kicked her chest because the maid was putting on the offender's socks wrongly.\n\nThe prosecutors said: \"The kick was painful and she could still feel the pain after five days.\"\n\nMs Arangote corroborated Ms Lizardo's account.\n\nA doctor who examined Ms Lizardo five days later found that the maid had tenderness over her sternum, consistent with injury inflicted by a kick to the chest.\n\nAccording to the doctor, Ms Lizardo said that her employer had kicked her.\n\nCourt documents did not state who alerted the police, but officers later came to Tan's home and statements were taken.\n\nThe prosecution said that Ms Arangote and Ms Lizardo were credible and candid witnesses whose evidence should be given full weight.\n\nThe DPPs added: \"We highlight that neither Jenefer nor Joan actually reported the abuse to the police, that Joan informed (a policewoman) that she did not know why the police officers were at the house, and that Jenefer had no idea the police were coming.\"\n\nTan denied all the charges, claiming to be shocked when she was prosecuted for the offences.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nWoman who joined daughter in torturing Myanmar maid to death gets 14 years’ jail\n\n24 years’ jail for man who repeatedly raped maid while his wife, kids were not at home\n\nShe also claimed that she had never caused any hurt to any of her maids and did not abuse any of them.\n\nAccording to court documents, she even provided officers at Clementi Police Division with the contact details of some of her other maids in a bid to prove her innocence.\n\nThe DPPs said: \"However, it is jarring that the clear and consistent evidence from her previous domestic helpers (Ms Balasa and Ms Zin Mar Phyo) was that she had been abusive towards Joan on many occasions.\"\n\nOn Friday, defence lawyer Derek Kang told the court that Tan intends to appeal against her conviction and sentence.\n\nHer bail has been set at $15,000.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nMAID/DOMESTIC WORKER\n\nassault\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/522cea3ddca57a83dbe5edf33e01af9743dd3f4e6f94f87a7ae7e39fde3faf00/btmaid20230127_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Tan Lee Hoon was convicted on seven assault charges involving her domestic helpers in December 2022.", "caption": "Tan Lee Hoon was convicted on seven assault charges involving her domestic helpers in December 2022.

I didn't ride trackwork so much last year,\" he said.\n\n\"Last time, I would ride three to four every morning. I would say that number has doubled now.\n\n\"I've changed to a positive mindset when facing the highs and lows of racing. I used to just sit back and expect things to improve by themselves.\n\n\"Now I put myself out there so trainers know I'm available. I just want to contribute more to the rides, so I go knocking on more doors.\n\n\"These days, I get a lot of support from KY (Keah Yong) Young, Leslie Khoo, Tim Fitzsimmons, David Kok, CT (Cheng Tee) Kuah.\n\n\"It's a two-way traffic. I help them with their horses and they help me back with more support.\"\n\nThe upshot was a larger book of rides right off the bat in the new campaign.\n\nOn Day 1 at the season opener on Jan 7, Amirul was set down for seven rides - a significant uptick to his usual handful.\n\nGranted, quality was not quite there, as none placed, but that is where an ounce of luck also plays a part.\n\n\"I was actually already happy with seven rides, and didn't mind taking one more when Simon Kok was injured and stood down - and I got a winner,\" as he recalled about his pinch-hitting turn for that fortuitous 2023 opener.\n\n\"I thought Ocean Crossing was just a backmarker and the distance was a bit short for him.\n\n\"But, in the race, I could feel the horse had a nice turn of foot. I rode a patient race on him and he won.\n\n\"Hard work pays off, but a bit of luck can also go a long way. That win was like a turning point for me.\"\n\nRacing is littered with shortlived wins, but Ocean Crossing was no flash in the pan for Amirul. One week later, he doubled up with Bionics.\n\nTo observers, the last-gasp win showcased his undeniable skills yet again. But, to Amirul, it meant much more.\n\n\"You have no idea how happy I was to beat (Manoel) Nunes (on January) that day,\" he said.\n\nBesides getting lucky - and a kick out of beating a four-time champion, Amirul conceded that he had also been making hay while the sun shone.\n\n\"I also took advantage of a lack of jockeys. Many jockeys were suspended like Saifudin (Ismail) and Krisna (Thangamani) or injured like Simon, (Mohd) Zaki and Yusoff (Fadzli),\" he said.\n\n\"I put myself there and I got rides I wouldn't normally get. More importantly, I'm really enjoying my riding.\"\n\nAmirul's resurgence can continue this Saturday. Though he has no standout, he can make a case for a couple from his even spread of eight rides.\n\n\"This week, I got eight rides. I think Strong N Smart is my best chance. I've ridden him three times, and he went around well at his last start,\" he said.\n\n\"I think Wild Bee is my second-best chance. He won his last start and has drawn well like Strong N Smart.\"\n\nMicheal Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7f2f42e7a4b913d456cd02f459f1caeb181b9131e67012e9c84f1b4ef2979748/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Amirul Ismadi is all smiles as he returns to the winner's enclosure astride pick-up ride Ocean Crossing on Jan 7. \n\n", "caption": "Amirul Ismadi is all smiles as he returns to the winner's enclosure astride pick-up ride Ocean Crossing on Jan 7."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 14 & 15", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6119828eb9a0fcd6d3eb1e0471fdc0361632ff03246080fb7448db765b775510/JohnSize.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "All hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Today it was a bit tougher for me because it was different conditions,\" said Rybakina, 23.\n\n\"I couldn't play really aggressive tennis. The ball was not going so much, but I'm happy that in the end I managed to win.\n\n\"I'll try my best in the final of course.\"\n\nAzarenka's fellow Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka took on Magda Linett of Poland in the second semi-final. She won 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 and will face Rybakina in the title-decider on Saturday.\n\nSabalenka is the highest-ranked player left in the women's draw at fifth in the world and is favourite to win her first Grand Slam.

awards for deeds ranging from busting crooks to helping businesses\n\nShare this article\n\nHe began his career as a Singapore Customs officer in 2010 overseeing raids on suspects who had stashed contraband cigarettes in tissue boxes in cars at the checkpoints and in lockers at worksites.\n\nSince 2020, Deputy Chief Superintendent of Customs Muhammad Suffyan Tumadi, assistant head of Schemes and Engagement, has been a trade facilitator who assists companies in their application of the various Customs schemes.\n\nIn conjunction with International Customs Day on Thursday, Mr Suffyan was among more than 300 customs officers who received Singapore Customs Good Service Medals and Long Service Medals.\n\nMr Suffyan, 38, a former prosecution officer, was awarded the Customs Service Medal (10 years).\n\nHe noted that his current role is not much different from his previous job, which was people-oriented as he had to deal with lawyers, judges and investigators.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 08:19am\n\nMan arrested over 1,550 cartons of contraband cigarettes\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Similarly, in my current job as a trade facilitator, I have to understand the needs of companies - different companies have different needs and different challenges,\" he told The Straits Times.\n\nTwo investigators from the Trade Investigation Branch and Special Investigation Branch respectively, who wanted to be known only as Mr Ang, 38, and Mr Lee, 33, because they often go undercover as part of their work, received a Staff Award, Outstanding Project (Enforcement).\n\nThe pair led an investigation against a parallel importer who had allegedly evaded more than $3 million in duties and goods and services tax (GST) on more than 1,800 imported cars.\n\nMr Lee said that picking up the evidence trail of suspects who try to dodge taxes or make fraudulent declarations is not always easy.\n\nWhen the investigators make surprise visits, suspects can become uncooperative and refuse them entry into the premises despite the officers identifying themselves and producing search warrants.\n\n\"Usually, we work the ground to look for evidence to build our case,\" said Mr Lee, noting there are also operational considerations such as the security of the place they are in and the safety of their personnel.\n\nDifferent modus operandi\n\nHe added that offenders have different ways of keeping track of their own finances, with some relying on the old-school pen and paper while others have progressed to high-tech spreadsheet software.\n\nCustoms officers are known to bust peddlers of contraband cigarettes by disguising themselves, such as wearing a sarong to blend in with foreign workers, and using surveillance techniques to keep track of large shipments of duty-unpaid cigarettes until their final destination.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Singapore Customs uncovered a trend of syndicates attempting to smuggle duty-unpaid cigarettes by concealing them in a container among shipments belonging to multiple consignees.\n\nIn 2021, Singapore Customs collected $10.14 billion in revenue from customs and excise duties on tobacco, liquors, petroleum, motor vehicle, and GST from imports.\n\nFor new companies wanting to expand their business, they would need to understand the procedures and product codes of goods being shipped to Singapore.\n\nThis is where Higher Superintendent of Customs Muhammad Firdaus Roslan, 38, and Chief Superintendent of Customs Yeo Ban Meng, 48, come in.\n\nThey each received a Staff Award, Outstanding Project (Trade), for their work on the review and implementation of the Asean Harmonised Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN) in 2022.\n\nIn simple terms, every product is assigned a code and, depending on the code, traders would know which products are subject to excise duties or need to follow various regulations.\n\nThe AHTN was jointly developed by Asean member states (AMS), such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, to promote uniform classification of goods and facilitate trade within Asean.\n\nThe review took into consideration amendments to the Harmonised System (HS) by the World Customs Organisation, technology changes, international trade patterns and proposals submitted by AMS.\n\nNineteen project teams and four individuals were also recognised with various staff awards such as Service Excellence, Trade, ProEnterprise, Enforcement and Innovation.\n\nMr Tan Hung Hooi, director-general of Singapore Customs, said during the ceremony at the NTUC Auditorium that in the next year, Singapore Customs will continue with its efforts to \"build a future-ready workforce, and push ahead with capability-building, especially in data and digitalisation\".\n\n\"As we transform our work and upskill our officers, it is also important that our officers find purpose in their work, and we continue to deliver on our mission,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nZaihan Mohamed

His last race was on Sept 3, 2022.\n\nThe chestnut New Zealand-bred gelding with the prominent broad blaze has resumed fresh.\n\nHe won his trial impressively with blinkers on Jan 19.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nRidden by stable jockey Matthew Kellady, he crossed in nicely from his wide berth to eyeball the Tim Fitzsimmons-trained and Manoel Nunes-ridden Diaz on settling down.\n\nThe pair drew away to lead by six lengths at the bend and by eight at the top of the straight.\n\nAlthough kept well in check, Watery beat Diaz by half a length in 1min 00.32sec.\n\n\"Yeah, he trialled well. It will be his first time running in Class 5 and first time with blinkers. Should be hard to beat,\" said Baertschiger.\n\nThe affable horseman added that he gave Watery a break because the gelding was a \"tired horse\" from his eight-start campaign in 5½ months in 2022.\n\nThe rest has certainly done wonders to his charge.\n\nBaertschiger started the new season slowly.\n\nHe had only seven runners in two of the three meetings for a second and a third, and has wisely engaged rising apprentice jockey Ibrahim Mamat for the ride.\n\nTrainer Michael Clements' protege's 4kg allowance will bring Watery's handicap down - from 59kg to 55kg.\n\nThis will give the horse every chance, not forgetting that he will also be aided by an inside barrier (Gate 3) and the first-time blinkers which have sparked many horses to victory.\n\nWatery's best effort from eight starts was his good second behind Deception in a $75,000 Restricted Maiden event over 1,200m on turf on May 14, 2022.\n\nOn Saturday, the Tornado Stable-owned galloper is contesting the $30,000 Class 5 Division 1 event over the Polytrack 1,200m.\n\nHe just has to bring his trial form to the race to account for his seven rivals.\n\nWhile Watery gets a claiming rider to reduce his handicapped weight, Italian Revolution has the services of the forceful four-time Singapore champion jockey Vlad Duric.\n\nKellady had ridden the three-year-old well three times but luck denied him of victory on each occasion. His mount just found one to beat at the winning post.\n\nPerhaps the riding switch could bring a change of luck for the MA Racing Stable-owned Australian-bred gelding.\n\nDuric will partner Italian Revolution, one of the star performers on the training track on Tuesday, and complete their task with distinction in the $75,000 Restricted Maiden Division 1 event over 1,200m on turf.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9d36e6fb1a2564094d9ce72422ed2614500c590a80cd5884da50c7e4ba9e0337/unnamed.png?w=965", "alt_text": "The Shane Baertschiger- trained Watery (Shafrizal Saleh) finishing second to the Donna Logan-trained Deception (Hakim Kamaruddin) over 1,200m on May 14, 2022.

I was underwater, gulping a lot of the water. I couldn't feel the floor... the current was very strong,\" he told The Straits Times in a phone call on Thursday.\n\nHis wife, carrying their four-year-old son, stood above them in shock.\n\nMr Hussain used his free arm to hold onto a stable plank on the bridge and his right leg felt concrete - the submerged pillars of the bridge.\n\n\"To fight the current and climb back to land, I pressed my leg against the concrete and pushed up, while holding my daughter. A group of passers-by who were a few metres behind us on the bridge grabbed Ashley.\"\n\nMr Hussain then hauled himself up back onto the bridge, suffering a large bruise on his ribs, scratches on his arms and cuts on his thigh. Ashley was unhurt.\n\nThe whole ordeal lasted at most two minutes, but it felt like a lifetime, he said.\n\nHis family and the passers-by stayed at the bridge to warn visitors about the hole. They also tried to cover it up with stray planks, but the wooden pieces kept floating away on the flooded walkway.\n\nHe said: \"I'm a strong swimmer, trained as a lifeguard, but I would not have survived in that water. I think the hole was bigger than a manhole.\"\n\nThey then walked to the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve Wetland Centre, but found it empty on the public holiday. The family learnt later that the only employee on duty that day was on the other side of the wetland reserve, attending to other visitors.\n\nSeveral calls to an available hotline number went unanswered.\n\n\"I then rang 995. It was the only number we could think of. But the SCDF (Singapore Civil Defence Force) operator said if they did not need an emergency ambulance, we should address this to the right agency.\"\n\nMr Hussain later posted an update on social media that SCDF apologised to him for how the operator had handled the call.\n\nFinally, their call to the hotline went through. The staff member came rushing back to speak with the family and check on the walkway.\n\nMr Hussein's wife also emailed NParks about the incident. He said on Wednesday night, he received a call from an NParks director to inform him that the site had been cordoned off and engineers engaged to repair the bridge. The director also said the wetland reserve would implement longer term preventive measures to avoid structural problems caused by inclement weather, and that they would work on displaying a helpline number more prominently in the park.\n\nThe walkway crosses a sluice gate that controls discharge from the Buloh Besar River into the sea.  PHOTO: SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS\n\nMr Lim said the overflowing waters during the peak of the spring tide, coupled with heavy rain, had dislodged the floor panels, creating the hole.\n\nHe said: \"We have reached out to the family to thank them for helping to inform other park visitors about the gap and notifying our staff of the situation to rectify it.\"\n\nOn Thursday morning, a section of the bridge was cordoned off with cones and tape, with most of the missing wood planks back in place as repairs had been underway since Wednesday at around 5pm, said one of the workers. Two workers were sawing planks to fit the gap.\n\nWhile Mr Hussain's wounds and cuts are healing, he remains shaken by the ordeal.\n\n\"I've been through many dangerous close calls growing up that have not affected me as much. But this involved my daughter and family.\n\n\"I keep replaying in my head how things could have gone wrong.\"\n\nShabana Begum\n\nand\n\nThomas Loke\n\nsungei buloh\n\nACCIDENTS\n\nPARKS/NATURE RESERVES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2024, 02:55am\n\n5 taken to hospital after hornet attack at Sungei Buloh\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a68e705eaf4b6ccdb414b4cf3e1b804610fc070e73074bff3d1415439e886f46/202301267755737859bef6fa-db8d-4c91-88a0-8eb61afed45e_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Workers patching up the hole in the bridge on Thursday. \n", "caption": "Workers patching up the hole in the bridge on Thursday.

And though his ex-wife, who lives in Thailand, gives him about $1,000 monthly, it is not enough to feed the both of them.\n\nConsidered relocating\n\nAt one point, he considered moving his stall to another location with higher footfall, but found the higher rental an obstacle.\n\n\"There was a stall for rent at a coffee shop in Toa Payoh, but the rent is $3,000 a month. I don't even dare to think about it.\"\n\nIn an effort to supplement his reduced income from his stall, Andrew said he worked part-time as a hotel security guard the last two months.\n\nHe would work at the hotel from 8pm to 8am the next day, then return home for a two- to three-hour nap before getting up to sell rojak.\n\n\"(That routine) was making me very tired.

I can accept that.\"\n\nHow long can Yen, who is married to former beauty queen Cissy Wang, 41, continue in action films?\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\n0\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I have told my wife many times that I would retire at the age of 55,\" he said. \"I already had this idea when I was filming Big Brother (2018).\" He was hoping to act less and bring in more newcomers.\n\nYen can currently be seen in the martial arts film Sakra\n\n, in which he plays Qiao Feng, head of the Beggar's Gang martial arts group and one of the main characters of late writer Louis Cha's wuxia novel Demi-Gods And Semi-Devils.\n\nThe star added: \"I can still fight a bit now, but when the audiences are no longer interested in seeing me do so, I will not stop the world from turning.\"\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nIn feudal China, Donnie Yen’s hero fights to save himself from getting cancelled\n\nDonnie Yen's wife sends her love to him via social media on his 59th birthday\n\nLim Ruey Yan\n\nCelebrities\n\nMovies\n\nhong kong\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\n4\n\n0\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\n1\n\n0\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\n4\n\n0\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\n1\n\n0\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a87100579611390a1acd4b29125b93a39eaebc7486c8008bfd0d7e4cadcab61a/SAKRASTILL202212237_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Donnie Yen is currently starring in the film Sakra.

The friends alerted the authorities about the incident.\n\nA search party involving multiple agencies including the police, Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA), Fire and Rescue Department and Civil Defence Force, was subsequently launched following the 6am incident.\n\nHowever, efforts were made difficult due to the choppy seas and bad weather.\n\nSabah and Labuan MMEA director First Admiral Datuk Mohd Rosli Abdullah said the victim was earlier spotted by the navy's unmanned aerial vehicle before being rescued.\n\n\"The MMEA would like to advise the maritime community to keep abreast with the current weather conditions,\" he said, urging the people to ensure they wore life jackets and brought communication equipment if they had to go out to sea.

It seems to put them in the zone.\n\nPure Perfection fits the bill. He has done it before and he did it again on Wednesday morning when he worked like a winner, running the 600m in 37.7sec.\n\nRichard Lim, his trainer, would have been pleased and he just might be keeping his fingers crossed that his charge brings that form to the races.\n\nPure Perfection is down to contest Race 1 on Saturday and it looks a winnable sort of race for the four-year-old.\n\nLast time out, on Jan 14, Pure Perfection ran his best race to date, finishing third to Great Command in a competitive Maiden event over the 1,200m.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nIf this \"morning glory\" can bring his trackwork form to the races, Lim might have another winner to add to the two that he already has for 2023.\n\nBut Pure Perfection was not the only runner from LIm's yard to go against the clock.\n\nTwo others, Tigarous and Cash Out, were also out for their winding down gallops ahead of Saturday's races and they looked in good order.\n\nCash Out clocked 37.17sec while Tigarous went over the 600m in a leisurely 43sec. Cash Out will see action in Race 6 while Tigarous will contest Race 11.\n\nWith 31 starts under his girth, Tigarous knows all there is to know about racing.\n\nAn Irish-bred, he has four race wins to his name, the last one being that ½-length win over Leatherhead in November.\n\nHis last two runs, on Jan 7 and Jan 14, were not too shabby and he should give a good account of himself on Saturday.\n\nAs for nine-year-old Cash Out, he will be having his 80th race start and he does seem to have his work cut out for him when he takes on much younger opponents.\n\nStill, he can be tossed into the mix when planning those exotic combinations.\n\nAlso out for a spin was the Leslie Khoo-trained Golden Tiger.\n\nHe worked hard, turning on the speed in the back straight before being relaxed to clock 38.3sec for the final 600m.\n\nGolden Tiger has not shown much in his last few starts, with his best run in recent times coming in September when second to First Chief.\n\nHe will have to bring his \"A\" game to the races if he is to beat the likes of Super Talent and My Boss, among others.\n\nLater in the morning, two trials were run. In the first, we saw Tim Fitzsimmons take the trifecta with Typhoon, Nate's Champion and Hurricane.\n\nAllowing his stablemate Hurricane and the Khoo-trained newcomer Grand Avante to show the way for most of the trip, Typhoon and Nate's Champion joined in the fray and they were four in a line passing the furlong mark.\n\nIt was touch and go and nothing separated them.\n\nBut there had to be a winner - even if they crossed the line locked as one.\n\nA print gave Ronnie Stewart the verdict on Typhoon. Nate's Champion, the mount of Amirul Ismadi, was beaten by a nose.\n\nHurricane, the mount of Simon Kok, had to settle for third, a shorthead away.\n\nTyphoon, who did the trip in 1min 01.17sec, has had two race starts but has yet to make the board.\n\nHowever, his trial form does seem to suggest that it could come sooner rather than later. Keep him on your shortlist.\n\nIn the second trial, Super Salute took the honours, beating Ace Sovereign by three lengths, with In All His Glory a distant third.\n\nThe Jason Lim-trained Super Salute also clocked 1:01.17 for the 1,000m.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/248ad288e3e4571e06a99a7dbfdb8ad444cb12f6d9a6ed73a33467eeb113202c/ddd.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Trainer Richard Lim will be hoping for Pure Perfection to salute in Race 1 on Saturday.\n", "caption": "Trainer Richard Lim will be hoping for Pure Perfection to salute in Race 1 on Saturday.

a return to form from the 70 that operated in 2022.\n\nUnlike previous years in which the bazaar's first day typically coincides with the start of the Muslim fasting month, the iteration in 2023 will begin five days earlier to coincide with the Hari Raya light-up at Geylang Serai, and run for 36 days until April 21.\n\nIt will operate daily from 10am to 11.59pm, although this will be extended to 6am on Hari Raya Puasa, which falls on April 22.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a press conference on Thursday, Minister of State for Home Affairs and National Development Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said this would be the longest duration the bazaar has operated.\n\nHe added that affordability will be a key consideration for visitors.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 13, 2025, 02:40am\n\nDriver arrested after fatal crash at Geylang pasar malam\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"As a start, we want to make sure that the food items is something that people can afford,\" he said, citing how every food and beverage (F&B) outlet would offer one item on their menu at a sampler size for $4.\n\nMr Mohamed Mustaffa Shah Jehan, the founder of Enniche Global Trading, which is part of the consortium operating the bazaar, said that retail stalls could expect rentals of up to $15,000 for the entire duration, whereas F&B ones could go up to $19,000 for the same period.\n\nHe added that there will be a space set aside for local entrepreneurs in the vicinity of Wisma Geylang Serai, where it will cost $55 a day to rent a stall.\n\nThis is to give entrepreneurs a chance to market their wares, especially in light of many home-based businesses popping up amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn this area, which will be designated as Souq City, derived from the Arabic word for market, community shelves will be set aside for people to place donated non-perishable halal food and clothing for Hari Raya.\n\nThe area will also host bazaar hallmarks, including F&B and retail stalls.\n\nAssoc Prof Faishal, who is also lead advisor for Wisma Geylang Serai, said the space set aside for donated items is meant to encourage the spirit of giving.\n\n\"We want to provide opportunities for people to contribute while we... celebrate the atmosphere of Ramadan and Hari Raya,\" he said.\n\nDuring the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to dusk, with it being a time for community, reflection, charity and prayer.\n\nMeanwhile, there will also be a separate area designated as the Street Bazaar, stretching from Geylang Serai Market to the area beside Tanjong Katong Complex.\n\nHere, there will be three different themes featured prominently, with interactive art installations placed throughout.\n\nGraffiti artist Slac Satu will also be spray painting his artwork across a different panel during the 30 days of Ramadan.\n\n\"All we want is for visitors to have memorable experiences for them to remember 2023's bazaar for many years to come,\" said Assoc Prof Faishal.\n\nAqil Hamzah\n\nGeylang\n\nRamadan\n\nHARI RAYA PUASA\n\nStreet food\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025, 03:49am\n\nThree hair salons raided in crackdown on illegal massage and vice services in Geylang and Joo Chiat\n\nJun 10, 2025, 08:02am\n\nDigital sentry to keep watch for errant motorists at Geylang Serai market carpark\n\nApr 20, 2025, 12:53am\n\nWhen a $19.90 'buffet' is not exactly a buffet\n\nApr 5, 2025, 11:05pm\n\nDriver and 2 passengers who ditch car and flee from Geylang roadblock at large\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwww.airwallex.com\n\nHow Endowus's CFO uses Airwallex to balance growth and cost control\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/59872dcdb6d5bdeee902ca317902696b48196161c42197244483eae89516eb54/geylangbazaar.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Shoppers at the Ramadan Bazaar in Geylang Serai on May 2, 2022.", "caption": "Shoppers at the Ramadan Bazaar in Geylang Serai on May 2, 2022.

NEA said there will be 580 seats, up from 479 previously.\n\nAbout 55 per cent of the survey respondents had visited the hawker centre in Jurong West Street 61 at least once a month before it closed in August 2020.\n\nThe 14 market stalls in the centre will not be returning, as 95 per cent of respondents prefers to get their groceries from other markets or nearby supermarkets.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 29, 2025, 05:02am\n\nCashback for purchases via DBS PayLah app returns from July 12\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe hawker centre's previous operator - Koufu Group subsidiary Hawker Management -\n\ndid not renew its contract as the business did not fare well,\n\nwith only about half of its stalls open since 2019. The complex opened in 2017.\n\nOn Thursday, NEA said the hawker centre will undergo a makeover. The escalators and staircases that are currently at the front of the centre will be relocated to free up space for stalls on the first storey. This will also improve visibility of the hawker centre, NEA said.\n\nThe carpark's entry and exit points will be repositioned to allow for new cooked food stalls on the first storey, although this will reduce the carpark spaces to 49 from 72 previously.\n\nThe escalators and staircase at the hawker centre will be relocated to free up space, and the carpark entry and exit points will also be repositioned for more stalls on the first storey. PHOTO: NEA\n\nJW 50 Hawker Heritage was appointed as the operator of the new centre on Thursday, said NEA, adding that its proposal was the most robust out of the three tenderers. The contract is worth $4.86 million.\n\n\"For instance, they proposed the second level of the centre to offer international cuisine, as well as festive food, ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat products. Patrons to the centre will be able to enjoy familiar hawker fare on the first level,\" the agency said.\n\nIts proposed average monthly rent for stallholders was also the lowest among all the proposals, NEA added. The Straits Times has asked NEA for the rental rates.\n\nNEA said the operator's parent company, Chang Cheng Mee Wah Food, has expertise and experience in managing food establishments such as coffee shops, which can help to attract tenants to Jurong West Hawker Centre. Last year, the group\n\nbought a coffee shop in Yishun for $40 million.\n\nJW 50 Hawker Heritage has proposed a culinary innovation accelerator programme to help hawkers and people aspiring to be hawkers learn the necessary skills through subsidised training workshops, NEA said.\n\nThe programme also connects them to a network of food companies and mentors, as well as offer them \"competitively priced\" raw and intermediate food supplies.\n\nNEA said there will be 580 seats, up from 479 previously, and the new Jurong West Hawker Centre.

Before its closure, the agency had reached out to 18 stallholders to assist them to take up vacant stalls at other NEA-managed hawker centres and markets.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMeet the young cooks changing the face of S’pore hawker centres\n\nNew Bidadari hawker centre to open in second half of 2023\n\nIsabelle Liew\n\nHAWKER CENTRES\n\nNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY\n\nJurong\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 29, 2025, 07:43am\n\nMan arrested for allegedly assaulting diner after noodle stall collision\n\nMay 22, 2025, 11:47pm\n\nSpell it wrong, cook it right: Meet the smiling owner of Happy Briyani\n\nMay 15, 2025, 02:32am\n\nHotpot horror: Diner blames restaurant's faulty chopsticks for loose tooth, seeks compensation\n\nMay 13, 2025, 03:11am\n\nTo help the needy, hawker sells Malay food for $2.50\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/aa60072603936103c133baeae1bc7de1832e713776547cb127d8ceaa5f6820fb/SEYU1668_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "NEA said it has increased the number of cooked food stalls and seats at the hawker centre, which was closed for more two years.", "caption": "NEA said it has increased the number of cooked food stalls and seats at the hawker centre, which was closed for more two years.

Evidently, you're not alone.\n\nA number of customers have taken to Facebook and Google Reviews to voice their frustration over the non-delivery of their CNY gift hampers from Noel Gifts.\n\nIt seems the hampers did not arrive on the stipulated delivery dates earlier this month (January 2023).\n\nAccording to one Prudy Yeow, she placed an order for a hamper on Dec 26, 2022, for delivery on Jan 15, 2023. However, the hamper did not arrive on the day and remained undelivered as at Jan 18.\n\nThere were no calls or text alerts from Noel Gifts about the non-delivery. Yeow said that when she sent WhatsApp messages to Noel Gifts for updates, she did not receive any specific delivery date. Instead, the company simply apologised and said they were experiencing \"overwhelming\" orders.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 3, 2023, 10:06am\n\nICA foiled attempt to smuggle more than 1,400 vapes on third day of CNY\n\nMore related stories\n\nAnother customer, Louis Liu, said he had placed an order for Jan 9, but was not informed when the delivery failed to arrive on the day. Similarly, Liu has yet to receive any specific answers or dates regarding his delivery.\n\nAnother Facebook user, Ang Siu Wei, shared a response that was purportedly from Noel Gifts, stating that it was \"facing a high volume of inquiries\".\n\nThe company added that it was working to fulfil all CNY orders by Jan 20, with Jan 30 set as the latest date.\n\nThe reply also said: \"We will include an apology letter to your recipient/s to be accountable for the later delivery.\"\n\nIn response to Mothership's queries, Noel Gifts said that it was facing a lack of delivery personnel and manpower to issue \"prompt\" responses.\n\n\"Moreover, the short runway of CNY with the unfavourable weather has further hindered our delivery efficiency,\" Noel Gifts added.\n\nNoel Gifts further said: \"We have taken proactive steps to ease the other issues that have arisen and are getting back to our customers as fast as possible. We seek their kind understanding as we need time to reply to each customer on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"Once again, we are sorry for any inconvenience caused.\"\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nGift Hampers\n\ndelivery\n\ncustomer complaint\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 25, 2023, 01:29pm\n\nNursing home residents whip up special home-cooked CNY dinner\n\nJan 25, 2023, 04:36am\n\nWet weather expected for remainder of CNY festive period\n\nJan 24, 2023, 12:07pm\n\nHow local celebrities celebrated Chinese New Year\n\nJan 23, 2023, 06:28pm\n\nHeavy rain disrupts Chinese New Year celebrations\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nHealth Promotion Board\n\nTrack your meals with ease.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dbf322b4291ed3e519abb3269a81194ede05bfe0e289459e89e4239222e9587a/noel-gift-hampers-copy_censored_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTOS: FACEBOOK"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/24a4c0768b7c555de5971760e0334abd7613d3abff484ba77c57c58bff7e71a5/dw-ica-vape-230203_0.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "ICA foiled attempt to smuggle more than 1,400 vapes on third day of CNY", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d04671baf0c015217d008979ef79d411113cda986b7d4450b65735c8b6979ec9/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-t9cvjgqr7kugtw.jpg?w=503", "alt_text": "660", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1688f3f6bf2cf0cb4d95052bcfcd21912fb51cda4c34d815abde828d26900381/202301195964308913639e08-05b5-41fe-bf83-da1cac07594c_5.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Nursing home residents whip up special home-cooked CNY dinner", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The administrator was not named.\n\nIn the afternoon, a second teacher who suspected the boy had a weapon did not find a gun when she searched his book bag. She then told the same administrator that she believed the boy had put the gun in his pocket before going to recess, the lawyer said.\n\nMs Toscano said another student told a third teacher that the boy showed him a gun during recess and threatened to shoot him if he told anyone. The teacher reported the account to school administrators, she said.\n\nA fourth employee who learned of the threat asked for permission to search the boy, but was denied by the same school safety administrator, the lawyer said.\n\n\"He was told to wait the situation out because the school day was almost over. Tragically, almost an hour later, violence struck Ridge Elementary School,\" Ms Toscano said.\n\nPolice plan to present findings from an investigation to the Commonwealth's Attorney in Newport News, who would make any decision regarding possible charges against the boy's mother. - REUTERS\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n6-year-old accused of shooting teacher in Virginia has ‘acute disability’, family says\n\nSix-year-old boy shoots teacher at US elementary school\n\nunited states\n\nUS NEWS\n\nUS CRIME\n\nSHOOTING - GUN CRIME\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nEDUCATION AND SCHOOLS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 30, 2025, 07:03am\n\nSingaporeans travelling to US advised to check latest entry requirements and comply: MFA\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nS'poreans looking to pursue studies in US can still submit visa applications: US Embassy\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:02am\n\nConfused, nervous, told to 'wait for updates': Singapore students at Harvard react to US ban\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/91b2b5777fc0e744a3e0b16dadabd66ea48f6e1ce435e2a8f36538276da85395/2023-01-07T041447Z1292083690RC2GLY9R7OORRTRMADP3VIRGINIA-SHOOTING.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "The boy shot teacher Abigail Zwerner in front of other students at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, on Jan 6, 2023.", "caption": "The boy shot teacher Abigail Zwerner in front of other students at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, on Jan 6, 2023.

(2) FISH EAGLE has his alumites removed but sports blinkers. Chance if he runs on best form. (11) TIME TOGETHER showed up well on debut and should be involved in the finish. (10) NAZARE can improve.\n\nRace 2 (1,200m)\n\n(3) SILK GARDEN has been threatening and should escape the maiden ranks this time. Biggest danger could be debutante (8) LUSHOZI SHOOP. (1) WOW (finds problems) and (2) WRITTENINTHESAND (better than last run) could get into the trifecta.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\n(2) PHANTOMOFTHEFOREST has been threatening. His blinkers have been removed, which could do the trick. (1) QUIXOTE found problems last time and should challenge. (6) FREE MOVEMENT disappointed in his post-debut. Blinkered. Can come on in heaps. (3) FULL GO is still winless after 24 runs but can run a place.\n\nRace 4 (1,450m) (1) BROADWAY is doing nicely and the form has held up. (12) RADU did well on debut and should relish the extra. Both have prior engagements and it is essential to upgrade the form. (3) BRAVE VIKING was run out of it last time but the track will suit. However, he has a wide draw to overcome. (4) RAPTOR ISLAND was not disgraced in his first run for his new stable - respect.\n\nRace 5 (1,800m) (2) BATTLEGROUND should have his consistency and efforts rewarded and open his account. (3) CIRCUS LIGHTS lost ground last time but did well to get close. He should be the main threat. (1) HAROLD THE DUKE is a plodder but is worth a thought. (4) ELDUCINO is looking for quartet money.\n\nRace 6 (1,800m)\n\n(1) ROSSLYNE finished behind (2) ON THE GUEST LIST when returning from a rest. The latter was not comfortable in the soft conditions. But if the track is firm, she could reverse the form. (3) PONDEROSA PINE has a few lengths to find with ROSSLYNE. (4) HAYLEY'S PROMISE and (8) RED MAPLE could fight out quartet money.\n\nRace 7 (2,600m)\n\nTricky race with interchanging form lines and all runners going this far for the first time. Also the pace will be a deciding factor. (1) POSITIVE ATTIDUDE, (2) TIME TO MEDITATE, (4) MORE FOR ME, (5) ALLTHEWAYFROMUSA and (6) QUEEN BRITANNA should all be included.\n\nRace 8 (1,450m)\n\n(3) MIGHTY GODDESS is overdue for a win.

He is entered in Race 3 on Saturday and will have the services of champion jockey Manoel Nunes.\n\nPHOTO: STC\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 25, 2023, 09:17pm\n\nLogan sees no need for haste\n\n2022 runner-up off to a sluggish start but Aftermath may launch Kiwi trainer's season\n\nShare this article\n\nAfter a breakout season in 2022, Donna Logan has not quite sprung out of the starting blocks this term.\n\nThe Kiwi trainer nearly rewrote Singapore history at her fifth Kranji season, but the crowning of the Republic's first woman champion was not to be for that year.\n\nFollowing a riveting two-horse race in the last quarter, Tim Fitzsimmons eventually outslogged the Ruakaka horsewoman in the last month or so.\n\nBut unlike 2022, when Logan got on the front foot from the get-go with five winners in the month of January, her win-meter for 2023 is still set at zero.\n\nTo Logan, though, the engine has not stalled, but just warming up.\n\n\"My mother always told me: Good things come to those who wait,\" she said.\n\n\"We've had a quiet start for sure because the horses had a big rest.\n\n\"There is no need to rush, we'll just pace ourselves. Besides, we still have a very long year ahead.\n\n\"But I'm still very happy with the way the horses have been running (five placings from 15 runners).\"\n\nWith 2020 champion Michael Clements the current lamplighter on five wins, Logan and four other winless trainers (Jason Ong, Jerome Tan, James Peters and Shane Baertschiger) are certainly not lagging too far behind.\n\nBut Logan is aware she should get on the board sooner rather than later if she does not want to be on the backfoot.\n\nThough the 138-Kranji race winner fields only five horses on Saturday, she is still banking on her first runner, Aftermath in Race 3, the $50,000 Class 4 Division 1 race (1,200m), to get her off to a flier.\n\nThe Spirit Of Boom five-year-old recorded his only victory from 21 Kranji starts over the same course and distance but, to Logan, the recent form was the key factor.\n\n\"I'm very happy with the team I'm sending this week. There are some nice horses and not so nice horses, good jockeys to ride them and they are well and fit,\" she said.\n\n\"Aftermath is probably my best chance of the day. He's in the 1,200m on turf which will suit him, and we've got (Manoel) Nunes on.\n\n\"It was a pretty strong run at his first-up run from a holiday. He was wide without cover and still ran second to Ima, who ran a nice third in a much stronger race last week.\"\n\nLogan will also unveil a newcomer, Knippenberg, an unraced I Am Invincible three-year-old, for the Fortuna NZ Racing Stable. Ronnie Stewart is the pilot.\n\nAfter a barrier trial third, Logan has picked the $75,000 Restricted Maiden race over 1,200m for his Kranji launch.\n\n\"Knippenberg is still learning. He's relatively new and has a nice enough draw (barrier No. 3) for a first run,\" she said.\n\n\"This will be a good educational run and a good gauge where he is at. We can only live and hope he turns into a 3YO candidate.\"\n\nWhile Logan is still on the starting grid, her two apprentices have, ironically, done better than her.\n\nJerlyn Seow has ridden two winners while Jamil Sarwi opened his 2023 account in style with the Jason Lim-trained Sky Eye on Monday, capturing his first $100,000 race in the Kranji Stakes A event over 1,200m, the highlight of the Chinese New Year programme.\n\nLogan revealed that her lads' good results did not come by fluke, but with the help of a legendary pair of hands - former Australian champion jockey Mick Dittman, now Lim's Stable's racing manager.\n\n\"I'm super proud of Jamil and Jerlyn. They've both had a nice start to the season,\" she said.\n\n\"I actually approached Mick and asked him if he could give some tutoring to my apprentices.\n\n\"I was a jockey, too, but I would be a pinhead on the board next to a world-class jockey like Mick.\n\n\"Mick goes through their rides on Monday and points out what they did right or wrong.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6869ccf350bcde8481c963f5b2e194ea3a074c95a5c04deabe3359dbee7cce4a/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Aftermath (Yusoff Fadzli) registering his only win at Kranji in a Class 5 race over 1,200m on Aug 7.

He is one of the few residents at the home who can walk about without help. Accompanied by a nurse from the home, he picked up all the ingredients he needed for the festive meal.\n\nAlthough Mr Tan has tried his hand at cooking dishes such as steamed fish, roti prata and salted vegetables, he opted to cook something for the reunion meal that held special meaning for him - braised pork trotters.\n\nHe said: \"I learnt how to make it from my elder brother. Before he died, he made pork trotters with soya sauce, star anise and garlic. It is easy, and now I can make it myself.\"\n\nMr Lim, 53, who used to be a chef at a Hyatt hotel, offered to make stewed chicken, based on an old family recipe.\n\nHowever, since he now needs to use a wheelchair and is unable to use his left arm and leg after a stroke in 2020, he gave step-by-step instructions to nurses, who did the cooking.\n\nHe said: \"Every Chinese New Year, my mother would make Teochew stewed chicken for my brothers and sisters. Getting the chance to cook for people makes me happy.\"\n\nMs Nixi Tay, manager for programme and community partnership at NTUC Health, was part of a team of 20 nurses and administrative staff who organised the reunion dinner.\n\nShe said: \"Part of NTUC Health's care philosophy is to enable seniors to be as independent as possible and to exercise choice. One of the ways we have done this is by encouraging residents to cook for themselves and fellow residents.\"\n\nResidents of the NTUC Health Nursing Home in Jurong West celebrated Chinese New Year with a steamboat dinner on Jan 19. ST PHOTO: RYAN CHIONG\n\nNTUC Health, which has six nursing homes in Singapore, began a pilot programme in 2022 to encourage residents to cook their favourite meals at mobile cooking stations if they wished to.\n\nThe idea behind buying and preparing the ingredients, and cooking their own reunion meal for Chinese New Year is an expansion of that initiative, said Ms Tay.\n\nShe added that Chinese New Year can be a difficult time for some residents, such as those who do not have any family or those whose family members have died. Others, Ms Tay said, might have strained ties with their family members.\n\nNurse manager Devadasson Vasugi Ezhilarasi, 45, said: \"Some of their families may be unable to visit. This reunion dinner will make them happy and help them know that we are here for them.\n\n\"Mr Tan used to be depressed and isolated himself totally. After engaging him in these activities, we have seen him change a lot. Today, he is so happy, I can see the joy in his face.\"\n\nMr Tan spent Chinese New Year at the nursing home, while Mr Lim visited his sister's family at the weekend.\n\nMr Lim said: \"Nearly everyone here has family problems, that's why some of them are here. Others, like me, have no one at home to take care of them. When we celebrate here, it feels like everybody gets together like a family.\"\n\nBoth Mr Tan and Mr Lim said they plan to cook their special dishes again in the future.\n\nSaid Ms Tay: \"Sharing recipes and cooking dishes encourage social engagement within the nursing home. Sharing their recipes is one way of promoting the preservation of memories and helping to keep traditions alive.\"\n\nThomas Loke\n\nNURSING HOMES\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1688f3f6bf2cf0cb4d95052bcfcd21912fb51cda4c34d815abde828d26900381/202301195964308913639e08-05b5-41fe-bf83-da1cac07594c_5.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Former five-star hotel chef Francis Lim (left) and avid cook Tan Lam Huat display their dishes ahead of their reunion dinner with NTUC Health Nursing Home residents on Jan 19. \n", "caption": "Former five-star hotel chef Francis Lim (left) and avid cook Tan Lam Huat display their dishes ahead of their reunion dinner with NTUC Health Nursing Home residents on Jan 19.

If I have to sum it up, in all the important shots, the important moments I found my best tennis. So that's what makes me the most pleased tonight.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old added of his match with Rublev: \"Some really close games that we had. Andrey is a great opponent, great player. I have tons of respect for him, one of the biggest forehands, quickest players on the tour.\"\n\nDjokovic's quest for a record-extending 10th Australian Open title has been far from smooth, plagued by a left hamstring strain suffered en route to the title at Adelaide earlier in January.\n\nHe struggled physically in the early rounds but was dominant during his fourth-round demolition of Alex de Minaur, and he showed few problems against Rublev.\n\nVictory for the red-hot favourite also propelled him into a 44th Grand Slam semi-final to close the gap on Federer's all-time record of 46.\n\nIn another astonishing record, he clocked a 26th consecutive match-win at the Australian Open to equal Andre Agassi's Open-era record for longest streak at the first Grand Slam of the year.\n\nThe signs were ominous for Rublev before the match even started.\n\nIn contrast to Djokovic's outstanding record in Melbourne, Rublev - who was taken to five sets by Holger Rune in the fourth round - came into the clash with a 0-6 record in Grand Slam quarter-finals.\n\n\"Like always I will try to take experience, lessons. The things that I need to improve I think is very clear,\" said the 25-year-old, who has won 13 ATP titles but is still seeking his maiden major title.\n\n\"There was nothing that impressed me because Djokovic is one of the best. I knew he's going to be really tough, that's it.\n\n\"Mental-wise I feel this Slam was much better than the previous ones, so for sure I feel I'm a better player, I feel better physically also. Hopefully I can keep improving.\"\n\nDjokovic will now turn his focus to Paul, the first American man to reach the semi-finals in Melbourne since Andy Roddick in 2009.\n\nThe Serb will be wary of his less-heralded opponent, who withstood some ferocious serving from Shelton's 24 aces.\n\nPaul is also only the third active American man to reach a Grand Slam semi-final, joining John Isner (2018 Wimbledon) and Frances Tiafoe (2022 US Open) but will have to register a seismic shock if he is to go any further.\n\n\"I'm really excited, man. It's really cool. I think it's even cooler if I do play Novak,\" the 25-year-old Florida-based Paul said after his victory, before he knew who his next opponent was.\n\n\"To play Novak here in Australia would be awesome. Obviously he's pretty comfortable here in Australia. It's going to be a challenging match. But I'm playing some of my best tennis.\" AFP, REUTERS\n\nAUSTRALIAN OPEN (TENNIS)\n\nnovak djokovic\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/862be5c9b49949203e5147681c6a394ee615ef72c6b8674f2b331eb59f1cb8ac/10428382_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Novak Djokovic in action against Andrey Rublev during their quarter-final match at the Australian Open on Jan 25. \n", "caption": "Novak Djokovic in action against Andrey Rublev during their quarter-final match at the Australian Open on Jan 25.

He described this lack of continuous documentation as not ideal.\n\nHe said in the report that the baby's mother, who was delivering her first child, underwent an emergency caesarean section, following an unsuccessful vaginal delivery attempt.\n\nAfter he was born at about 4.30am, the baby was found to have three tight loops of the umbilical cord around his neck. The cord was removed immediately and he was placed on a resuscitator.\n\nAs his vital signs were noted to be less than optimal, he was given assisted ventilation for two minutes which helped his heart rate and oxygen saturation improve.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 29, 2025, 10:41pm\n\nKKH launches Singapore's first sexual health guidelines for women of reproductive age\n\nMore related stories\n\nHowever, at three minutes after birth, his oxygen saturation was noted to be borderline and he was then given continuous positive airway pressure til his vital signs improved.\n\nThe baby was observed to be vigorously moving and had a good cry, and State Coroner Nakhoda noted that nothing amiss was observed.\n\nHowever, when the baby was taken to the viewing room so that his father could see him, the coroner said it was apparent that his condition had begun to deteriorate.\n\nThe father and a nurse noticed that he was giving weak cries and appeared limp.\n\nWhen this became more pronounced and the baby did not show spontaneous limb movements and was not breathing spontaneously, the nurse took him back into the operating theatre.\n\nHis vital signs were not recorded from the seventh minute after birth until he was taken back into the operating theatre at about 5.20am.\n\nThe nurse put him back on the resuscitator, reattached a probe that allowed for measurement of his oxygen saturation and heart rate, resumed the assisted ventilation and then activated a Code Blue emergency, which is used when a patient is in cardiac or respiratory arrest.\n\nThe baby was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and was connected to a ventilator.\n\nBut his condition continued to deteriorate. An ultrasound found indications of swelling of the brain while there was also suggestion of severe brain disease.\n\nBy the fifth day after the baby was born, his condition had worsened further and his parents agreed to withdraw care after discussion with the medical staff and careful consideration. The baby was pronounced dead on April 12, 2021, at about 12.30 pm.\n\nState Coroner Nakhoda ruled out foul play and said the baby had died of natural causes. He also noted that the cause of death was certified to be a brain injury that occurs when the organ experiences a decrease in oxygen or blood flow.\n\nHe added that that it was unlikely that the wrapped umbilical cord had played a part as there was period where the baby was well and breathing independently.\n\nA senior consultant at KKH's department of neonatology stated in a medical report that there was no documentation of continuous monitoring of the baby's vital signs considering his initial stable status.\n\nThe consultant added that on review of this aspect, the hospital was working to ensure documentation of a newborn's vital signs are kept until the newborn is handed over to other teams in the hospital.\n\nState Coroner Nakhoda said he was heartened by the fact that KKH is reviewing its procedures to consider continuous documentation of a newborn's vital signs.\n\n\"Losing a child is always a devastating event, perhaps more so when the child is a newborn,\" he added.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nKKH\n\nbabies\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 10, 2025, 12:50am\n\nTeen with skin disease recalls being ostracised in school\n\nFeb 25, 2025, 04:47am\n\nFree baby car seats for mothers who give birth at KKH\n\nMay 24, 2023, 04:12am\n\nHours, then days: Miracle baby Fattah defying the odds while battling rare disease\n\nJun 8, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nMan had sex with underage girl at hospital staircase\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7965ebd4f95fee347f4ef7a9af7c362fc9e2910f10063dea80c4dc39e68f70d0/hzkkh250122_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The 11-day-old baby died from a brain injury in April 2021. \n", "caption": "The 11-day-old baby died from a brain injury in April 2021.

They were later discontinued in June 2022, with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) citing low ridership, the availability of alternative transport modes and financial prudence as factors.\n\nA&S Transit said it is launching its new night bus services - named NS-1 and NS-2 - to cater to the recovering nightlife scene. The new bus services also provide a low-cost transport alternative to commuters, who would otherwise have to travel via taxi or private-hire car after the MRT and regular bus services stop operating, the company added.\n\nThe new night bus services will both start plying from the bus stop opposite the MAS Building in Shenton Way.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 03:02am\n\nMan who allegedly threw glass bottle at bus window charged\n\nMore related stories\n\nNS-1 will pass through the Central Business District, Clarke Quay, River Valley, Orchard Road and Little India, stopping at public bus stops along the way.\n\nIt will then pass through Ang Mo Kio and Sengkang before ending in Punggol at the bus stop near Samudera LRT station.\n\nNS-2 will similarly pass through the CBD, Clarke Quay and Orchard Road, before hitting bus stops in Newton, Yishun and Sembawang. The service will end in Woodlands, at the bus stop outside Woodlands Train Checkpoint.\n\nBuses for the two new services will operate at 45-minute intervals, with the first bus leaving Shenton Way at 11.30pm and the last bus leaving at 2.30am in the morning.\n\nMore bus trips may be scheduled on the eve of public holidays.\n\nIn comparison, SMRT's six NightRider services previously operated at 20 to 30-minute intervals, while SBST's six Nite Owl services operated at 40-minute intervals.\n\nA&S Transit said it will charge a flat fee of $4.50 for passengers who pay using their ez-link cards. Those who pay by cash will be charged $5, and they will need to provide the exact amount to the bus driver.\n\nThese fares are similar to SMRT's now-defunct NightRider services, which used to cost $4.50 regardless of payment method.\n\nSBST's Nite Owl services were slightly cheaper at $4.40 for bus rides from the city, and $1.70 for trips between public housing estates.\n\nA&S Transit told The Straits Times that its NS-1 and NS-2 services will each be served by three MAN A22 diesel buses that the firm had acquired from SMRT in 2021. Each bus has a seating capacity of 43 passengers, with no standing passengers allowed.\n\nA total of 10 bus drivers will be deployed to operate the two new night bus services. A&S Transit said. \"We do hope to hire more young bus captains to come on board specifically for these two routes,\" the company added.\n\nA&S Transit’s NS-1 and NS-2 services will each be served by three MAN A22 diesel buses that the firm had acquired from SMRT in 2021. PHOTO: A&S TRANSIT\n\nLTA previously said that the decision to discontinue SMRT and SBST's NightRider and Nite Owl bus services came after careful evaluation of various factors, including ridership.\n\nDemand for the public night bus services was low even before the Covid-19 pandemic, LTA had said, and the withdrawal of the services would free up finite resources that could then be reallocated to meet new demand.\n\nWhen asked by ST, LTA did not provide specific ridership figures for the NightRider and Nite Owl services, nor did it say how much the public night bus services had cost to operate.\n\nST also asked A&S Transit about the financial viability of its new night bus routes, given the previously low ridership for similar services.\n\nIn response, the firm said it expects to break even within six months. This is despite fuel and manpower costs rising by 70 per cent due to recent inflation, the company added.\n\nAn A&S Transit spokesman said the firm had done some research before deciding on the two new bus routes, which are targeted at newer estates with potentially higher demand while still serving less accessible areas.\n\n\"We still have much to learn and improve upon, as this is our first foray into night bus services,\" the spokesman added. \"We hope to gather more insights on what the public is looking for in night bus services, and to introduce more routes in future,\" he said.\n\nLTA told ST that it is open to proposals from commercial transport operators which wish to provide after-hours bus services for certain locations and routes.\n\nCompanies that wish to operate a bus service that charges fares and runs on a fixed timetable and route with two or more stops within Singapore are required to apply for a Class 2 Bus Service Licence.\n\nLTA said it has approved A&S Transit's application for two of these licences, as well as its use of selected public bus stops for immediate pickups and drop-offs.\n\nBy\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\nBUSES\n\nPUBLIC TRANSPORT\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 9, 2025, 12:42am\n\nMan arrested over bottle thrown at SMRT bus\n\nJul 7, 2025, 12:32am\n\nPassenger injured after bottle thrown at bus leaves hole in window\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:18am\n\nSMRT to extend selected train, bus services on eve of Hari Raya Haji\n\nMay 19, 2025, 10:36pm\n\nNew bus service 230M linking Kim Keat and Toa Payoh Bus Interchange to start on June 8\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b7cfc6d02c91a7450dea2faedb037b0c05891af9e687383df1fb5c4de47dce3b/a22202_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Private bus charter company A&S Transit is launching its new night bus services to cater to the recovering nightlife scene. \n", "caption": "Private bus charter company A&S Transit is launching its new night bus services to cater to the recovering nightlife scene.

Oil prices are seen to be on an uptrend this year because of higher demand from China, which has all but lifted Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nBut ironically, China is also seen as exporting more refined products, which can depress the wholesale prices of diesel and petrol here. According to market research firm S&P Global, the Chinese government has raised the export quota for its first batch of refined oil products for 2023 by 46 per cent.\n\nAccording to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker set up by the Consumers Association of Singapore, pump operators Caltex, Shell and SPC lowered posted pump rates just before the Chinese New Year weekend, with cuts of between three and five cents a litre.\n\nThe adjustments have brought the prices of these brands more in line with pre-discount rates posted by the two remaining operators - Esso and Sinopec.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 08:49am\n\nCOE prices rise across the board\n\nMore related stories\n\nDiesel is now $2.63 a litre at Sinopec and $2.64 elsewhere. For petrols, the 92-octane grade is now $2.65 a litre at Caltex, Esso and SPC - the only brands offering the grade. The popular 95-octane grade is $2.69 at SPC and $2.70 elsewhere.\n\nThe 98-octane fuel is $3.22 a litre at Shell and $3.17 elsewhere; and the so-called premium 98-octane grade is $3.39 at Caltex, $3.44 at Shell and $3.30 at Sinopec.\n\nPrice differences are greater after discount. For 92-octane petrol, prices range from $2.17 a litre (Caltex, OCBC 365 card and Esso, DBS Esso card) to $2.28 (Esso, Citibank Cash Back card and other OCBC cards). For the 95 grade, prices range from $2.12 at Sinopec (OCBC cards) to $2.32 a litre at Esso and Shell (various cards).\n\nFor 98-octane fuel, discounted rates range from $2.49 at Sinopec (OCBC cards) to $2.77 at Shell (various cards).\n\nPump operators raised prices almost immediately after the GST rate was increased by one percentage point to 8 per cent on Jan 1. With the latest revision, pump prices are now back to their lowest since January 2022.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nPetrol pump prices fall close to lowest level since Jan amid deepening fear of global recession\n\nST Explains: Why have fuel pump prices been on a roller-coaster ride?

If you give blood from a vaccinated donor to an unvaccinated person, the person receiving the transfusion does not become vaccinated.\"\n\n'Profitable falsehoods'\n\nGeorge Della Pietra, a Swiss naturopath founded Safe Blood Donation, a global mediation service that falsely labels mRNA coronavirus vaccines a \"health threat\" and seeks to connect unvaccinated blood donors with recipients.\n\nThe Zurich-based nonprofit offers to obtain \"fresh or canned\" unvaccinated blood for its patrons, according to Safe Blood's website, which says it has a presence across western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, Asia and Africa.\n\nAFP's email to Pietra requesting comment elicited a reply from Safe Blood's media director.\n\n\"There are a large number of scientists and doctors who not only have great concerns about the Covid vaccines, but are convinced that they also enter the body via the blood through the back door, so to speak, and remain there,\" wrote Clinton Ohlers, the media director, quoting from the website.\n\nThat directly contradicts scientific assertions.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nAs Covid-19 continues to spread, so does misinformation about it\n\nNobel laureate urges scientists to leverage on people’s trust in them to tackle misinformation\n\n\"Blood donations from individuals who have received a Covid-19 vaccine are safe for transfusion,\" Jessa Merrill, from the American Red Cross, told AFP.\n\n\"Similar to other vaccines... the Covid-19 vaccine is designed to generate an immune response to help protect an individual from illness, but vaccine components themselves are not found within the bloodstream.\"\n\nSafe Blood's members are required to pay an initial joining fee of €50 (S$72), followed by 20 euros each subsequent year, according to its website.\n\n\"The 'safe blood' movement is absolutely based 100 percent in anti-vaccine misinformation,\" said Wallace.\n\n\"As with all anti-vaccine misinformation, appealing to people's fears is sadly profitable.\"\n\nSperm and breast milk\n\nThe demand to remain \"pure\" reaches beyond blood to social media posts soliciting sperm from unvaccinated men - conspiracy theorists speculate online that the precious commodity will be the \"next Bitcoin\" - as well as breast milk from unvaccinated mothers.\n\nThese requests appear to stem from belief in the debunked claims that Covid vaccines can cause infertility or alter the human DNA.\n\nDemand for \"unvaccinated\" blood is unclear, but experts say it would be a challenge to procure it in countries with high vaccination rates.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration in the United States, where more than 80 percent of the population has received at least one Covid jab, says it does not require blood collectors to test for vaccination status.\n\nHospitals are also not able to inform the status of donated blood to patients.\n\n\"Is the US blood supply tainted?\" screamed a headline from Children's Health Defence, a nonprofit founded by Robert Kennedy Jr, a known purveyor of vaccine misinformation.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nChina seeks to quell Covid-19 falsehoods amid panic-buying of drugs\n\nCovid-19 misinformation bolsters anti-vaccine movement\n\nIt falsely asserted that the country's vaccination campaign may have \"contaminated the country's blood supply.\"\n\nAn AFP reporter who infiltrated one of the closed \"pure bloods\" Facebook groups found posts vilifying doctors administering vaccines as \"an arm of the state.\"\n\nOther posts contained a cartoon image of a nurse holding a syringe and standing in a field full of skulls, and another of \"victims\" tumbling out of a vaccine bottle in crutches and wheelchairs.\n\nAnother post contained a video of a shirtless muscular man headbutting and smashing a car window in what was claimed to be a public outburst against vaccines. - AFP\n\nRelated Stories\n\n‘Kraken’ coronavirus subvariant: Why it is causing concern\n\nAll around the world, Covid-19 surveillance is faltering\n\nWe may be entering Covid-19’s least predictable year yet\n\nWill a China Covid-19 wave set back endemic living in Singapore?\n\nCovid-19 variants in China also detected in Malaysia\n\nHow bad is China’s Covid-19 outbreak?

The film secured four other nominations, including for visual effects and costume design.\n\nBassett was previously nominated for a best actress Academy Award for her portrayal as Tina Turner in the biopic What's Love Got To Do With It.\n\nDisney's Black Panther sequel sold around US$330 million in tickets and set a November record in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the sequel, the character King T'Challa dies at the opening, a script change made after actor Chadwick Boseman passed away from cancer in 2020 just before filming started.\n\nMarvel decided not to recast T'Challa. Instead, writer and director Ryan Coogler crafted a script that put female characters at the forefront.\n\n\"Ramonda is a love letter that reflects and acknowledges what we women do everyday,\" Bassett said.\n\nHer nomination challenges a long-held belief by many big names in Hollywood, including directors Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino, that Marvel films are not real cinema.\n\n\"They seem to me to be closer to theme parks than they are to movies as I've known and loved them throughout my life, and that in the end, I don't think they're cinema,\" Scorsese wrote in the New York Times in 2019, igniting backlash.\n\nDespite that kind of criticism, the first Black Panther won three Academy Awards after garnering seven Oscar nominations in 2019, including the first Best Picture nomination for a super hero movie.\n\nBassett is joined in the category by fellow nominees Hong Chau from The Whale, Kerry Condon from The Banshees of Inisherin, and Jamie Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu from Everything Everywhere All at Once. - REUTERS\n\nMovies\n\nMarvel\n\noscars\n\nacademy awards\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nAirwallex Singapore\n\nWhy businesses need to understand the differences in Chinese Renminbi (CNH vs CNY)\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c721edf8413e1426c712b35a1430315bad623f7c3a7b98534134f32bdf5fc0ba/angelabassett.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Angela Bassett made history as the first Marvel Cinematic Universe star to be nominated for an acting Oscar for her Black Panther: Wakanda Forever role as Queen Ramonda.", "caption": "Angela Bassett made history as the first Marvel Cinematic Universe star to be nominated for an acting Oscar for her Black Panther: Wakanda Forever role as Queen Ramonda.

Recording rights govern reproduction and distribution.\n\nThe flurry of sales came amid a wider conversation over artists' ownership of the work, amplified in large part by Taylor Swift, who has found resounding success as she re-records her first six albums so she can control their master recording rights.\n\nThat moved stemmed from Swift's very public feud with Scooter Braun, the music manager whose company once owned her original masters, and later sold them to the investment firm Shamrock Holdings.\n\nBraun has been Bieber's manager for 15 years, and in a statement said \"when Justin made the decision to make a catalogue deal we quickly found the best partner to preserve and grow this amazing legacy was Merck and Hipgnosis.\"\n\n\"Justin is truly a once in a generation artist and that is reflected and acknowledged by the magnitude of this deal.\" - AFP\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nBruce Springsteen sells music catalogue in $683m deal\n\nSting sells his songwriting catalogue for an estimated $404m\n\nCelebrities\n\nMusic\n\nSTREAMING - MUSIC/VIDEO/CONTENT\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwww.airwallex.com\n\nHow Little Blossom scaled efficiently from Singapore to Asia with Airwallex’s all-in-one solution.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5b9cd72fa9e6872bafeefd1a6877457ecbfbb4a5f752e9ac54ebec73ce05fa78/FILES-US-ENTERTAINMENT-MUSIC-CANADA-BIEBER-RIGHTS-160751.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "According to the deal, Hipgnosis has acquired Justin Bieber’s publishing copyrights to his 290-song back catalog.", "caption": "According to the deal, Hipgnosis has acquired Justin Bieber’s publishing copyrights to his 290-song back catalog.

The most-watched Oscars took place 25 years ago as megahit Titanic swept the honors.\n\n\"When the movies are popular with the public, the public feels invested and tunes in to see who wins,\" Feinberg said. \"This is setting them up for success as much as anything could.\"\n\nSixteen of the 20 people who clinched acting nods were first-time nominees.\n\nThey included Austin Butler for his portrayal of rock legend Elvis Presley, and Colin Farrell, who starred as an Irish farmer obsessed with restoring a friendship in Banshees. Top Gun star Tom Cruise did not make it into the field.\n\nButler recalled the positive reaction to his performance from Elvis's daughter Lisa Marie Presley, who died this month of cardiac arrest at age 54.\n\n\"I just wish she was here to celebrate today with us,\" Butler told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nFor best actress, Cate Blanchett, nominated for her portrayal of a manipulative orchestra conductor in Tar, will compete with Everything Everywhere star Michelle Yeoh and Michelle Williams of The Fabelmans, among others.\n\nWinners will be voted on by the roughly 10,000 actors, producers, directors and film craftspeople who make up the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe academy added more women and people of color to its ranks after the #OscarsSoWhite uproars of 2015 and 2016, and it increased membership from outside the United States.\n\nThis year, seven of the 20 acting nominees were people of color. They included Everything Everywhere stars Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu and Ke Huy Quan, a child star in 1984's Indiana Jones And The Temple of Doom and now a front-runner for best supporting actor.\n\n\"Never in my wildest dreams could I imagine this moment,\" Quan said in a statement.\n\nAngela Bassett was nominated for best supporting actress for playing Queen Ramonda in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and Cuban-Spanish actress Ana de Armas received a nomination for her turn as Marilyn Monroe in Blonde.\n\nSmith, who starred in slavery drama Emancipation, was not nominated. He was been banned from attending the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Rock, but he remains eligible for nominations and awards.\n\nTraditional studios dominated this year's nominations after recent inroads from streaming services. Apple TV+ nabbed best picture last year for heartwarming drama CODA.\n\nThis time, Disney received the most nominations, a total of 22, for movies including Avatar, Banshees and animated Turning Red. Banshees earned four acting nominations among nine overall nods.\n\n\"Massive thanks to the Academy. I think we're going to have a fun night!\" Banshees director Martin McDonagh, also a nominee, said in a statement.\n\nStreaming service Netflix released All Quiet On The Western Front, which tied Banshees with nine nominations.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nGolden Globes 2023: A night of uplift for overlooked, underappreciated nominees\n\nMarilyn Monroe biopic Blonde roasted with eight Razzie nominations\n\noscars\n\nAWARDS AND PRIZES\n\nactors\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nAirwallex Singapore\n\nHow Igloohome scaled efficiently from Singapore to USA, Europe and APAC with Airwallex's help\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8de5a5bb7db8361fba53e300df91758f980d2a6ee76e92d0636ebb5e4c9c0656/eeaao_0001.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Everything Everywhere All At Once starring Michelle Yeoh.", "caption": "Everything Everywhere All At Once starring Michelle Yeoh.
