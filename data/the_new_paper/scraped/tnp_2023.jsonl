MOH did not reveal how many had tested positive for influenza.\n\nMOH said it is in contact with the school to advise on infection control measures.\n\nThis comes after some classes at Nanyang Primary School were put on home-based learning on Tuesday and Wednesday, with several cases of fever, cough and sore throat detected since Jan 26.\n\nThe school's principal Wong Li Peng told The Straits Times on Monday that pupils were strongly encouraged to wear masks in school this week as a precautionary measure, and the school had since stopped physical morning assemblies and reduced group activities.\n\nParents were notified that the school would clean and disinfect classrooms and common areas, and teachers would remind pupils to practise good hygiene, including washing their hands frequently and wiping down surfaces.\n\nThe ministry said it routinely monitors the virus through avenues such as the average daily number of patients seeking treatment in the polyclinics for acute respiratory infections.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the number of cases in the past four weeks, from Dec 25 to Jan 22, has remained stable.\n\nAccording to MOH's weekly infectious bulletin on its website, the average daily number of patients seeking treatment in the polyclinics for acute respiratory infections was 2,336 from Dec 25 to Dec 31, 2,560 from Jan 1 to Jan 7, 2,400 from Jan 8 to Jan 14 and 2,405 from Jan 15 to Jan 21.\n\nInfluenza activity in Singapore typically increases in the middle of the year, from May to July, and at the end of the year, from November to January, MOH said.\n\nThe ministry advised the public to maintain good hygiene by washing their hands regularly with soap and water, especially before touching one's eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nPeople who are unwell should also seek medical treatment promptly, wear a mask when going out and avoid close contact with others.\n\nYong Li Xuan\n\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH)\n\nINFLUENZA\n\nPRIMARY SCHOOLS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/edb4eaac20cac4bb98ac5667b64b45f660e7d3d29e11e5b63f0e7cf11b21e8b1/2023013187220045b2da6148-f216-4248-87a1-c648239856bc.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Based on information from the school, none of the cases have tested positive for Covid-19. \n", "caption": "Based on information from the school, none of the cases have tested positive for Covid-19.

Because you think it's not appropriate right?\"\n\nThe man disagreed, saying the amount was what he was \"comfortable\" with.\n\n'Insufferable'\n\nThe post attracted a flurry of comments, with most calling out the girlfriend's actions.\n\nOne Redditor pointed out that the greater impropriety is the girlfriend's willingness to \"sour the relationship\" and stir trouble between the man and his parents over a hongbao.\n\nOthers simply cut to the chase; one simply warned the man not to \"upgrade\" his girlfriend to become his wife.\n\nhongbao\n\nchinese new year\n\nDATING/RELATIONSHIPS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9c781b28d8321cee86e880f8d3365c96ae97492179a92d35403f3df43e0320b8/red2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "ST PHOTO: JOYCE FANG"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5099ed2b7992d2339bbf56d1cd6105d238f820091a102ab1a69200c79bff839e/reddit-angbao-6-1.jpg?w=295", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2ce89032b28ece1ca2f88ebb010f14fa1ff8249d30efbec318635486fb7a7938/reddit-angbao-2.jpg?w=137", "alt_text": "759", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

But it happens in top football. We wish (it didn't) happen but it did and you have to deal with it,\" he said.\n\n\"As you said, on deadline day is difficult (to sign a replacement), you can't make policy on bad injuries. We have good players in the midfield department, players who can fill the gap.\n\n\"I think you can never fill that gap (completely) because very player has his own characteristics. Another player will always fill in a different way, but it doesn't mean you have to be less successful.\n\n\"It's quite clear Christian Eriksen brings top quality to our squad and he has some specifics that are hard to replace, such as his impacts in the final third with his final ball.\"\n\nThe United boss also said that Fred would be the midfielder who will benefit the most from Eriksen's absence.\n\n\"He's playing together with Casemiro in the Brazil squad... Brazil have so many choices they can make, but they play together and that tells you something about the quality Fred has and what he can contribute to the team.\n\n\"He has a lot of qualities, and they're a good combination, Casemiro and Fred.\"\n\nOn the bright side, ten Hag is now potentially only two games away from winning United's first trophy since they won the Europa League under Jose Mourinho in 2017.\n\nThe 3-0 victory at the City Ground last week meant he is able to rest his first-team players with three Premier League matches - against Crystal Palace and Leeds twice - coming up in the next 10 days.\n\nNo team who have held a three-goal lead from the first leg of a League Cup semi-final have ever lost, so the odds are looking good for United.\n\nForest, meanwhile, are suffering from a flu bug in their squad and a long injury list, which will make it even harder for them to conjure up a miracle on Wednesday.\n\nLast week's defeat was their eighth in a row against United in all competitions, and not since the 1994-95 Premier League season have Forest won at Old Trafford.\n\n\"We were obviously disappointed with the first leg, but that's the situation,\" said Forest boss Steve Cooper.\n\n\"It's obviously an incredibly tough task to qualify.\" - REUTERS\n\nLEAGUE CUP\n\nManchester United\n\nerik ten hag\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/37115bcbef9da9477640a73f82795c3cb21ed8073290716a08c94998de441f9f/2023-01-28T211535Z1115695494UP1EJ1S1N1WX2RTRMADP3SOCCER-ENGLAND-MUN-RDG-REPORT_3.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Manchester United's Christian Eriksen (left) was injured by Reading's Andy Carroll during their FA Cup clash on Jan 28.", "caption": "Manchester United's Christian Eriksen (left) was injured by Reading's Andy Carroll during their FA Cup clash on Jan 28.

His local form before that was useful. (1) VICTOR RAIL raced greenly in a smart debut and would have come on from that effort. He meets a weak field. (6) COTTON RON has been knocking on the door and is as one of the top contenders. (12) TIGER IN RED was much improved on the Poly last run. The colt meets a weak field on the turf and should have a strong chance.\n\nRace 3 (1,400m)\n\n(4) SEA OF TEARS was a beaten favourite last run. With cheekpieces fitted, the filly could make amends. (9) KITTYBOYS GIRL has been knocking on the door and it looks as if it may open although there are others looking to keep it closed. (13) APPROACHABLE LASS has put in two smart efforts on Poly and turf. Still improving, the filly should be competitive. (3) KABON KAPI has had only two outings, both on Poly, and did not finish far behind. The filly is back from a lengthy break but looks promising.\n\nRace 4 (1,500m)\n\n(9) PRINCESS JO shed her maiden tag second-up. She started favourite in her handicap debut and was not far back. This is a weak field. (4) SEA EAGLE backs up quickly after her last start in which she was in need of a run. The mare takes a big drop in class. (3) FAMILY FAVOURITE has been trying further but was a promising second over the trip on the Poly last run against much stronger company. (5) VALERIAS DREAM takes a small drop in the ratings but has been well supported in the market since her maiden win. Watch.\n\nRace 5 (1,750m)\n\n(7) PARIS PIKE is the best rated in this Graduation Plate and is in top form. He rates the one to beat. (5) EL REY VIENE showed up well first run in a handicap after a most impressive maiden victory. He looks to have some class. (1) MEETATTHEWINDSOR made steady improvement leading into his maiden win. He looks progressive and has the best draw. (8) LILLYBELLE is having her third run after a break. The filly finished close-up in both starts. She gets a 1.5kg allowance and can give the boys a run for the money.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nRace 6 (1,000m)\n\n(2) ONE TOO MANY has smart Poly form over the trip and has dropped in class.

With Keagan de Melo staying on board, he should be competitive. (8) PHILISPIEL has consistent form over the trip and goes well on turf.

Do not leave out.\n\nRace 7 (1,200m)\n\n(4) DONQUERARI is down in class. With a 2.5kg claimer aboard, he should be competitive. (6) QUEST FOR THE BEST took a 10-point hit in handicap for his last win. He has always promised to deceive but may have just found his best. (2) PETIT VERDOT was not far back in her first run out of the maidens. This is not a strong field and she could finish in the money. (9) NORTHERN WARRIOR is never far off and his two best recent efforts have been down the Scottsville straight. Chance.\n\nRace 8 (1,200m)\n\n(12) THERE SHE GOES comes with useful Highveld form over the trip. The two-time winner could be the one to beat. (9) SPIRITED FLIGHT was a narrow winner second-up, after starting favourite on debut. Both her starts have been over this course and distance. She could follow up. (2) GRUE OF ICE has her first run for a new stable. She has shown potential and the change of routine could bring out her best. (4) TRIPTOROYALTY has steady form over a shorter distance on Poly. Her turf form is not great but that was in August 2022.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9ca8551ed865e47a825b6334cf14ab48e71d62ca3266eedf8f83d44dd54c12a6/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 14 & 15", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6119828eb9a0fcd6d3eb1e0471fdc0361632ff03246080fb7448db765b775510/JohnSize.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "All hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment", "caption": null}]}

The previous high was 25 in 2005.\n\nA total of 32,325 dengue cases were reported in 2022, according NEA's quarterly dengue surveillance data for October to December 2022, which was released on Tuesday.\n\nThis is the second-highest number of cases in a year - the record high being 35,315 cases in 2020.\n\nMost of the cases in 2022 were of the DenV-3 serotype, or strain, of the dengue virus, which made up 62.3 per cent of the cases reported in December.\n\nNEA had previously identified DenV-3 as one reason for the high number of cases last year as the population here has lower immunity against the strain.\n\nAs at 3pm on Monday, 1,019 cases of dengue have been reported in 2023.\n\nIn January,\n\nthe agency warned of a potential dengue outbreak here this year.\n\nAs at Jan 30, there are 50 active dengue clusters, of which 13 clusters had 10 or more cases. NEA noted that the DenV-3 strain had been detected in 10 of these 13 clusters.\n\nDengue expert Tikki Pang - a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine - had previously told The Straits Times that vaccination could help protect the elderly and the vulnerable, noting that the majority of deaths from the disease here are among those aged 65 and above.\n\nIn a written parliamentary reply in July last year, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical had submitted its dengue vaccine candidate for registration in Singapore, and that the Health Sciences Authority was reviewing the application.\n\nMr Ong described the vaccine, named Qdenga, as the \"most advanced\" among six dengue vaccine candidates in various stages of clinical development.\n\nIn December, Qdenga - which provides protection against all four dengue strains - was authorised for use in the European Union.\n\nZhaki Abdullah\n\nDengue fever\n\nNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY\n\nDISEASES\n\nShare this article", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/25b853d6c48076262106a4cebf53e0abe9e026285068748b4bc622bcdc058698/20230102505741790ec70894-63ad-4424-8963-6ee3d43026ff_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "This is the second-highest number of cases in a year - the record high being 35,315 cases in 2020.", "caption": "This is the second-highest number of cases in a year - the record high being 35,315 cases in 2020.

So far, 44 people have come forward to say they could not get their refund.\n\nStudent Min Khant, 21, who contacted Mr Goyal, said: \"As soon as I realised that the event was cancelled, I tried to get a refund instead of using the redemption code for the other event that has yet to be confirmed.\n\n\"After I didn't get a reply, I assumed that I was being scammed and made a police report.\"\n\nThe police have confirmed that reports have been lodged and they are looking into the matter.\n\nResponding to queries by The Straits Times, Sentosa Development Corporation said that D1 Racing booked the space on Siloso Beach in October.\n\n\"Upon being informed of the event's cancellation, SDC immediately requested the event organiser to inform all ticket holders of the cancellation as they were solely responsible for all marketing, ticket sales and execution of the event,\" SDC said.\n\nRasif said she had pulled out of the event for personal reasons.\n\nShe told ST that she found out that she was one of the featured acts only on D1 Racing's Facebook advertisement, and that she then asked the organiser for payment and assurance that it had the necessary licences for the event.\n\nShe added: \"We reminded the organisers that my attendance was not confirmed until we received a deposit and conducted due diligence, and requested they stop using me in ads until then.\n\n\"We ceased any further negotiations with D1 after realising some inaccuracies in their contract.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old, who is also a social media influencer, said that the organiser did not have permission to use pictures of her in its promotion, and was told four times to remove them, but it was not done.\n\nReplying to ST queries, D1 Racing said that the event had to be cancelled due to drastic changes, adding that it was \"left stranded and had no choice but to cancel the event\".\n\nD1 Racing said it will provide free VIP tickets for its next event regardless of the ticket tier that customers bought for the Siloso beach party.\n\n\"We will be issuing wallets to all guests and topping them up with the amount that each guest paid,\" it said.\n\n\"This will enable them to purchase other products or tickets to other events as well.\"\n\nGabrielle Chan\n\nsentosa\n\nNew Year's Day\n\nCONCERTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 13, 2025, 02:39am\n\nChinese tourist's daughter cuts toe while playing at beach club during holiday\n\nNov 4, 2024, 11:04pm\n\nMoney launderer Su Baolin's former Sentosa Cove plot sold for $22m\n\nOct 22, 2024, 11:12pm\n\nBukom oil spill cleanup nears end, no new slicks spotted\n\nOct 21, 2024, 03:25am\n\nNo sign of oil at Sentosa beaches, waters near desalination plants\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e4e95649b2ded0b46f7c1d1da79e1edb0c32a6396f2ab7fbf8be91ae0a69f21f/IMG20221203100199150111UJ12JJH_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "ZoukOut, a two­-day dusk-­to-­dawn electronic dance music festival, makes a return to Sentosa’s Siloso Beach after a three-year hiatus. ", "caption": "ZoukOut, a two­-day dusk-­to-­dawn electronic dance music festival, makes a return to Sentosa’s Siloso Beach after a three-year hiatus.

He's the optimal fit in our system with his attacking style of play and dynamism, and his mentality and experience fit very well in our team.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 28, 2024, 04:58am\n\nHarry Kane receives European Golden Shoe in Munich\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We have now brought in Yann Sommer, Daley Blind and Joao.

I'm also driven by the hunger for success. I'll give my best for FC Bayern.\"\n\nBayern, who top the Bundesliga but have failed to win since the restart after the World Cup, have also been boosted by the return of forward Sadio Mane, ahead of their upcoming Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain. The 30-year-old trained with the ball in the Tuesday morning session, one week after his return to the training pitch.\n\nMane injured a tendon in his leg during his side's 6-1 win over Werder Bremen in November and required surgery that forced him to miss Senegal's World Cup campaign in Qatar.\n\nBayern travel to the Parc des Princes for the first leg of the Champions League last 16 tie on Feb 14, with the return fixture in Munich on March 8.\n\nCoach Julian Nagelsmann previously said he \"would not count on\" the reigning African Player of the Year to be available for the first leg.\n\nMane, who signed for the Bavarian giants from Liverpool in the summer of 2022, has scored 11 goals in 23 games in all competitions this season. - REUTERS, AFP\n\nbayern munich\n\nmanchester city\n\nepl\n\nPortugal\n\nFootball\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 26, 2024, 08:52am\n\nVincent Kompany praises Bayern's 'outstanding mentality'\n\nMay 15, 2024, 02:14am\n\nAncelotti confident for Champions League final\n\nMay 7, 2024, 07:50am\n\nReal must 'improve' to overcome Bayern in Champions League\n\nApr 28, 2024, 02:38am\n\nKane double steers Bayern 2-1 past Frankfurt ahead of Real clash\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/49824d28d3d6ee6cdc283267a2b3776410ba7e8fffad909cf1c283e244e70766/joao_cancelo.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The versatile 28-year-old Joao Cancelo has predominantly played as a left back but can also operate on the right flank.", "caption": "The versatile 28-year-old Joao Cancelo has predominantly played as a left back but can also operate on the right flank.

He gets another shot in Class 4, which could prove decisive over the concluding stages.\n\n2 Compassion Super notched his second success in nine starts last time. Remaining in Class 4, he can go on with it again.\n\nRace 8 (1,200m)\n\n9 Sugar Sugar rises to Class 3. He has shown previously that he appears capable of competing in this grade. Expect him to do exactly that with the light weight from an inside gate.\n\n5 Humble Star appears to have a nice future and must be considered a serious chance with the booking of de Sousa.\n\n11 Howdeepisyourlove is in superb form. He was competitive last start at his first try in Class 3.\n\n1 Adios knows what it is all about. He should be fighting out the finish.\n\nRace 9 (1,200m)\n\n3 Armour Eagle was strong to the line last start when scoring in this grade. He draws ideally and, if he gets a cheap run throughout, should get every chance to go back-to-back.\n\n7 Gold Gold Baby is looking for a fifth hurrah this term. He draws the right gate, too.\n\n1 Excellent Peers has to overcome a wide gate and hefty weight but he has champion jockey Zac Purton as his pilot.\n\n11 Science Patch has the right form and he should get the right run. Next best.\n\n*Comments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/86ecd51197ab6514ebc089aad85efee98b19bc2ec06dc8a25322bdc80096928a/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "After two runs in Class 2, Tianchi Monster (No. 3) is back in Class 3, the level of all his six wins.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nNewcastle had all the momentum, sweeping forward in a black and white wave that left Southampton powerless to stem the tide.\n\nOnce again it was Longstaff who provided the finishing touch to a breathtaking raid in the 21st minute.\n\nExposing Southampton's fragile wing-back system, Joe Willock sprinted into space behind James Bree and found Miguel Almiron, whose cutback was drilled home by Longstaff.\n\nNewcastle keeper Nick Pope had kept 10 successive clean-sheets, but his unbeaten streak ended in the 29th minute.\n\nCompletely against the run of play, Willock gifted possession to Adams and the striker smashed a superb shot into the far corner from outside the penalty area.\n\nIn a symbolic passing of the torch, Jonjo Shelvey - a veteran of Newcastle's darker days - waved farewell to fans on the pitch at half-time ahead of his move to Nottingham Forest.\n\nShelvey has been left behind by Howe's revolution, an overhaul that has given Newcastle a much stronger spine.\n\nIn the past, Newcastle would have wilted when Southampton pushed hard in a tense second half, but they are made of sterner stuff now.\n\nPope's brilliant save from Adam Armstrong ensured Newcastle's long-awaited return to Wembley wasn't derailed despite Guimaraes' 82nd minute red card for stamping on Samuel Edozie. - AFP\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: Newcastle shocked by third-tier Sheffield Wednesday in FA Cup\n\nFootball: Newcastle's Joelinton charged with drink-driving\n\nLEAGUE CUP\n\nnewcastle united\n\nFOOTBALL MATCHES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 24, 2024, 01:38am\n\nChelsea thrash Middlesbrough 6-1 to reach League Cup final\n\nNov 2, 2023, 02:12am\n\nMan United booed off after Newcastle loss, West Ham knock out Arsenal\n\nOct 10, 2023, 11:44am\n\nFormer Real Madrid and Chelsea winger Hazard retires at 32\n\nSep 28, 2023, 11:20am\n\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp lauds 'top performance' after beating Leicester City\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6bcf39a0c6598b356b583f41b6970c35d1e4774951f7cf45e8ce5f80fd4b069c/2023-01-31T203132Z1447706211UP1EJ1V1L0J4BRTRMADP3SOCCER-ENGLAND-NEW-SOU-REPORT_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Newcastle United's Sean Longstaff celebrates scoring their second goal.", "caption": "Newcastle United's Sean Longstaff celebrates scoring their second goal.

A promoter at the club offered to send the girl home, but Neo insisted that he would send her home, and booked a taxi.\n\nThey arrived at the block of flats where the girl lived alone at about 3.30am.\n\nAfter entering her unit, she told him to lock the gate and to throw the keys through the gate onto the sofa.\n\nShe went into her bedroom, and thinking that Neo had left, she took off most of her clothes, got into bed, and fell asleep.\n\nAt some point, Neo asked her for various sexual acts, but she said no and fell back into sleep.\n\nAt about 3.45am, he texted a female friend to say that he was in the victim's home and that she was naked on the bed. Close to 4am, he texted another female friend, saying, \"I might be a devil soon\".\n\nIn spite of his friends' advice, Neo raped the victim. When she woke up during the rape, he asked her if it was \"nice\" and continued even though she pleaded with him to stop.\n\nWhen he eventually stopped, the victim chased him out of her flat, as he repeatedly asked if she was okay and told her not to tell anyone what had happened.\n\nThat evening, Neo texted the victim and apologised for making her uncomfortable. When she replied that he had raped her, he did not deny her accusation but asked how they could settle the matter.\n\nOn her friend's urging, the victim called the police in the early morning of Nov 22 to report that she had been raped. Neo was arrested on the same day at around 11.40am.\n\nA psychiatric report from the Institute of Mental Health stated that Neo has a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and adjustment disorder, which were in remission at the time of the rape.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nsexual assault\n\nteenager\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c9af9f36ca6572c287063c4f21cee179d87dcfe868647e07400d84e77eb17cac/tnp1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "TNP PHOTO ILLUSTRATION"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

And rightfully so.\n\nTogether, they have won 20 races, with Lim Kosciuszko taking 11 of those. Well, either one can bring home the goodies.\n\nIn preparation for the event, both were out on the training track on Tuesday morning, putting the finishing touches for the opening feature of the Singapore racing calendar.\n\nBoth are in immaculate condition.\n\nLim's Kosciuszko, a winner two starts back when beating the very-talented Golden Monkey in a 1,200m sprint, had bang-in-form jockey Wong Chin Chuen aboard when out for a spot of cantering.\n\nIt will be the dual-Group 1 winner's first race since his last placing in the Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Sprint (1,200m) on Dec 11, 2022.\n\nTrained by Daniel Meagher, the five-year-old, who has so far amassed $800,000, could not be in better racing condition.\n\nCome Saturday, he will have a trainload of fans.\n\nThen there was that other marvel, King Arthur.\n\nHe had a more serious hit-out.\n\nWith Kranji's champion hoop Manoel Nunes in the saddle, he ran out 600m in 39sec.\n\nIt was a fine piece of work, indicative of a good horse ready for the task ahead.\n\nTrained by Donna Logan, who opened her 2023 season with a double (Aftermath and newcomer Knippenberg) last Saturday, King Arthur has all the credentials to lift the trophy.\n\nA son of I Am Invincible, he was a gallant second to Lim's Kosciuszko in the Group 1 Lion City Cup (1,200m) on Aug 14, 2022.\n\nHe notched his ninth victory two starts later in October in a Kranji Stakes A event over 1,200m on turf.\n\nIt was on Jan 23 that he opened his season with a sixth-place finish in a similar race.\n\nOwned by Fortuna NZ Racing Stable, which races Knippenberg, King Arthur will be right at home under the Merlion Trophy conditions.\n\nHe has won over the track and trip and the 57.5kg that he and the rest of his male rivals will have to carry will not be much of a bother.\n\nCelavi, the only mare in the capacity field, will shoulder 56kg.\n\nBack at Kranji after a disappointing adventure in South Korea in September, the Michael Clements-trained six-year-old clocked 42.7 for her 600m gallop.\n\nIt was on Jan 7 that Celavi had her first start for the 2023 season.\n\nThat day, when ridden by apprentice jockey Ibrahim Mamat, she had it tough all the way, having to race wide and without cover.\n\nTo her credit, at the finish of that Poly 1,100m scurry, she still managed to get to within three lengths of the three-figure winner and stablemate, Ocean Crossing.\n\nCelavi is an honest sort of galloper who loves the alternate surface.\n\nHer claim to fame has to be her gutsy win in the 2021 edition, which she won rather easily.\n\nThen ridden by Louis-Philippe Beuzelin, Celavi found the front at the get-go and never looked back, easily holding off Starlight.\n\nFame Star took third.\n\nGold Star, who ran fourth in that contest, will be having another tilt at the Trophy and he was another of the star workers, running the 600m in 39.6.\n\nAnother of trainer Tim Fitzsimmons' gems, he had one win in 2022.\n\nThat was on April 30 and, to his credit, he beat Lim's Kosciuszko over 1,400m.\n\nAlready a seven-year-old, Gold Star still has loads of racing left in him.\n\nIn addition to Tuesday's hit-out, Fitzsimmons has, in the new year, already sent his charge to two trials, the latest being last Thursday.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3630a2e55fe5303e5313f395d09c38e8a27aa1da9c986f8f67834ae08a222e62/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Lim’s Kosciuszko (Wong Chin Chuen) asserting his superiority over King Arthur (Blake Shinn) in the Group 1 Lion City Cup over 1,200m on Aug 14, 2022.

A fourth man, Mr Noor Shah Ryzqa Azman, was with them.\n\nThey ordered a bottle of whisky to share and left the bar at about 10.30pm, as Wong carried the bottle of whisky and drank from it while they walked around.\n\nThe four men, who were intoxicated, ended up near Riverside Point in Merchant Road and wanted to buy cigarettes. They approached a security officer who pointed them to a 7-Eleven store in Keng Cheow Street.\n\nMr Chua, who was drinking at a bar nearby with his friends, was also walking to the 7-Eleven alone when Amirul felt Mr Chua was staring at him.\n\nAmirul and Wong attacked Mr Chua from behind, with Wong\n\nusing the whisky bottle to hit his head a few times,\n\ncausing a patch of his hair to fall off.\n\nThey also punched Mr Chua who had fallen to the ground. Dani Zulastri, who heard the commotion, ran towards them to punch and kick Mr Chua with Amirul.\n\nThe three men and Mr Ryzqa, who was watching the attack from a distance, then fled towards the State Courts near Havelock Road.\n\nMr Chua, whose head was bleeding, walked back to the bar to seek help and one of his friends called for paramedics.\n\nHe was taken to the emergency department at Singapore General Hospital and found to have cuts on his scalp. He was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome with giddiness and memory loss, and was given medical leave for 17 days.\n\nSaid DPP Chu: \"After the assault, the victim suffered giddiness and headaches, especially when bending down, until around May 2022. He would occasionally still suffer from giddiness and headaches, had bad memory, and was fearful of going out at night.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Straits Times a few days after the attack, Mr Chua, a financial adviser, said he had no clue who was behind the attack.\n\nHis girlfriend said he was celebrating a friend's birthday with four others at a restaurant near Clarke Quay, and was going to a convenience store to buy a drink when the assault occurred.\n\nIn her sentencing submissions, DPP Chu, who sought a sentence of between six months and eight months' jail for Dani Zulastri, cited his violence-related antecedents as an aggravating factor.\n\nIn January 2021, he was convicted of being armed with a dangerous weapon without lawful purpose, joining in an unlawful assembly while armed with a deadly weapon on two occasions, and one count of carrying a scheduled weapon.\n\nWong, 20, is expected to plead guilty on Wednesday while the case against Amirul, 23, is still pending. Mr Ryzqa was\n\ngiven a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in August 2022.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nclarke quay\n\nattack\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0970743b8a440e2e2cc922da2df05936c99cc204376e482052a9cc2622404400/svstitches310123.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Dani Zulastri Mohamad Salim was part of a group that attacked a man in Clarke Quay on March 20, 2022, leaving the victim with cuts to his scalp.", "caption": "Dani Zulastri Mohamad Salim was part of a group that attacked a man in Clarke Quay on March 20, 2022, leaving the victim with cuts to his scalp.

Two other forgery charges were taken into consideration during his sentencing.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor David Menon said Liaw became acquainted with the victim in January 2020 after he sent her a message on Instagram.\n\nUsing the name Trevor in his interactions with her, he propositioned the victim to be his sugar baby and solicited sexual services in exchange for a monthly stipend of between $8,000 and $15,000.\n\nThe victim, who had not entered into a similar arrangement before, declined his offer.\n\nOn July 17, 2020, Liaw tried again, increasing his offer to $22,000 a month. He then gave the victim one of his own contact numbers, claiming it belonged to his former sugar baby, in a bid to convince the victim of his credibility.\n\nWhile posing as his former sugar baby, he had also tried to obtain nude pictures from the victim.\n\nThe victim then met Liaw to discuss his proposal, and he promised to increase the stipend to $25,000 if she booked a hotel room for their next meeting, saying he would transfer her the first payment before that.\n\n\"Unemployed and financially constrained, the victim agreed to this proposal,\" said DPP Menon, who added that Liaw never intended to transfer any money to the victim and that he did not have enough money to do so.\n\nOn July 25, 2020, Liaw sent a photo of the forged bank transaction to the victim via Telegram and used a function on the app that caused the image to disappear after a few seconds to conceal his deception.\n\nThe victim repeatedly checked her bank account throughout the day, but the purported transfer was not reflected.\n\nAfter she expressed some hesitance about meeting him, Liaw responded by rebuking her for lacking trust in him. He implied that she would run off with his $25,000, and complained that she had inconvenienced him as he had rearranged appointments to accommodate their meeting.\n\nLiaw promised the victim that he had already transferred $25,000 to her. Believing this, she booked and paid for a hotel room at Aqueen Hotel.\n\nThe same day, the pair met at the hotel where the victim provided Liaw with sexual services, including intercourse.\n\nLiaw did not pay the victim for the services, nor did he reimburse her as promised for the condoms he wore during sex at her insistence.\n\nDPP Menon said the incident traumatised the victim and negatively affected her relationships with men.\n\nLiaw's lawyer S.S. Dhillon said that his client, who has a seven-year-old daughter, was remorseful and suffered from depression.\n\nLiaw could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both for dishonestly obtaining services.\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nforged\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ef9807349f7b40d2f51968d039c93110111ab38d3a91b90044d02941d4fecd7a/gavel.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Kawshigan still could not accept that Ms Nora Tan did not want to be in a relationship with him.\n\nAfter she cut off contact with him, he filed two lawsuits against her - a $3 million High Court claim for allegedly causing \"damage to his stellar reputation\" and \"trauma, depression and impacts\" to his life, and a $22,000 magistrate's court claim for allegedly breaching an agreement to improve their relationship.\n\nThe latter suit was struck out in January by State Courts deputy registrar Lewis Tan, who said Mr Kawshigan's claim was \"manifestly groundless and without foundation\" and amounted to an abuse of the court process.\n\nIn a judgment published on Saturday, Mr Tan said: \"Considered in totality, I find that the present action was intentionally initiated by the claimant with the ulterior motive of vexing or oppressing the defendant by requiring her to defend various claims that fundamentally stem from the same factual matrix in different forums.\"\n\nHe added: \"This court will not be an accessory to his calculated attempt to compel engagement from the defendant who, after years of massaging the claimant's unhappiness, has finally decided to stand up to his threats rather than cower and give in to his demands.\"\n\nMs Tan and Mr Kawshigan met in 2016, and became friends over time.\n\nIn September 2020, problems began to arise when they became misaligned in how they saw their relationship. While Ms Tan regarded Mr Kawshigan only as a friend, he considered her to be his \"closest friend\".\n\nMs Tan asked for their interactions to be reduced, which displeased Mr Kawshigan, as he felt it constituted taking a step back in their relationship. Nevertheless, she emphasised the need for boundaries and urged him to be \"self-reliant\".\n\nOn Oct 22 that year, Mr Kawshigan issued her a letter of demand, threatening legal action for \"monetary damages arising from negligent infliction of emotional distress and possible defamation\".\n\nMs Tan tried to reason with Mr Kawshigan. She told him in a text message that her \"discomfort (was) genuine\". He responded by saying she could either comply with his demands to deepen their relationship or suffer \"irrevocable\" damage to her personal and professional endeavours.\n\nMr Kawshigan's counsellor then asked Ms Tan to participate in their sessions. She agreed, as she thought it would help him come to terms with her decision not to pursue a romantic relationship with him.\n\nAfter 1½ years, Ms Tan stopped the sessions as she felt they had become futile.\n\nIn April 2022, she started harassment proceedings against Mr Kawshigan. In response, he alluded to a potential claim against her in a text message peppered with terms like \"damage that has strong legal basis\" and \"make your liability worst\".\n\nAfter back and forth discussions on the steps to be taken to better align their relationship, Ms Tan decided on May 14, 2022 to cease communications as she felt she could no longer deal with his requests for increased interaction and his inability to respect her personal boundaries.\n\nOn July 7, 2022, he filed a High Court claim against her. He alleged that due to certain remarks and negligence on her part, he suffered a loss in earning capacity and business partnerships, as well as costs incurred in rehabilitation and therapy programs to overcome the trauma he suffered.\n\nMs Tan then obtained an expedited protection order against him and engaged lawyers to file her defence and counterclaim to the suit.\n\nOn Aug 27, 2022, Mr Kawshigan filed the magistrate's court claim for alleged breach of the steps to better align their relationship.\n\nHe claimed that as a result of the breach, his earning capacity as an \"active high-capital trader by night and a busy CEO by day\" has been negatively affected, and that he has had to \"source for deeper psychological assistance\".\n\nMs Tan then applied to strike out this claim.\n\nThe $3 million High Court claim is fixed for a pre-trial hearing on Feb 9.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nlove\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwww.airwallex.com\n\nHow Motherswork handles financial complexity while expanding across borders.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/12e97905788f0a8703d028340f37769b18f18f8dc79e6d3a5a73aa3f8bf8257f/supreme20court20ph_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Another scheme offered a two-year investment with an annual return of 17 per cent.\n\nThe DPPs had said: \"PT Abby claimed that the teak trees were grown in two Indonesian plantations located in Sulawesi and Jogjakarta and that they would maintain the trees until maturity before selling them to timber mills at a minimum sale price.\"\n\nThe investment agreements assured investors of a guaranteed return of the principal sum at the end of the investment periods.\n\nUpon investing, they received a sale and purchase agreement as well as a certificate of ownership over the share of teak trees.\n\nA total of 92 investors signed 131 investment agreements with PT Abby, and paid a total of $2,260,000 to invest in the schemes offered. They were not aware they had been duped to join the schemes.\n\nAmong other things, the agreement falsely represented that PT Abby owned two Indonesian plantations, and that it was the sole owner of the teak trees.\n\nThe prosecutors said: \"(Matthew Goh) admitted knowing that PT Abby did not own any teak plantations and that Prosperity Ventures had made false representations to the investors when they marketed the... investment schemes.\"\n\nBetween December 2014 and November 2015, he dishonestly misappropriated more than $1.1 million of the investors' monies.\n\nHe transferred the cash to his bank account as well those belonging to his family members, including his father. None of the cash was used for to buy teak trees and teak lots\n\nIn July 2016, investors began lodging police reports saying that PT Abby had defaulted on the promised returns.\n\nMatthew Goh left Singapore in June 2017 and returned in June 2018.\n\nHe was later charged with criminal breach of trust in a district court.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nCRIMINAL BREACH OF TRUST\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dc551eda353edf870aebb09b546d7458ddad2c9ca003e95f2e8649e5197a2dce/IMG334520copy_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Matthew Goh Tian Si was the director and shareholder of a firm called Prosperity Ventures Global.", "caption": "Matthew Goh Tian Si was the director and shareholder of a firm called Prosperity Ventures Global.

The Italian has joined London rivals Arsenal on a £12 million fee until 2024 with an option for a further year.\n\nElsewhere in the Premier League, Manchester City defender Joao Cancelo has left for German Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich on loan after a reported bust-up with manager Pep Guardiola.\n\nBayern will also have a £61.5 million buy option for the Portuguese, according to reports.\n\nCancelo fell out of favour after returning from the World Cup, starting in just three of City's 10 matches.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that the fall-out between player and manager occurred at the club's training ground and Cancelo was also said to have been furious not to be named in the starting line-up in last Friday's FA Cup win over Arsenal.\n\nThe relationship became so bad that he threatened to leave, and Guardiola has since allowed him to depart.\n\nLeeds United, meanwhile, have signed United States midfielder Weston McKennie on loan from Juventus until the end of the season.\n\nMcKennie moved for a reported £1 million loan fee. The 24-year-old has made 41 appearances for the USA and started all four of their World Cup matches in Qatar.\n\nMcKennie is the third USA international to team up with Leeds' American boss Jesse Marsch after Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson joined the club in the close-season. - AFP\n\nepl\n\nPLAYER TRANSFERS\n\nchelsea\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwww.airwallex.com\n\nWhy Mighty Jaxx needs tech-first financial operations to power its global growth\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nAd\n\nAirwallex Singapore\n\nSingaporean business, Saturday Club, expanded to 7 markets with Airwallex\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nRECOMMENDATION", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8d1165eb7dcc88859a42c343e23fca2f2ef9aef3aa1554251e4027051d7b666f/FBL-POR-LIGA-PACOSFERREIRA-BENFICA-215403_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chelsea had been in talks to sign Enzo Fernandez (right), but Benfica had refused to budge unless the release clause was met.", "caption": "Chelsea had been in talks to sign Enzo Fernandez (right), but Benfica had refused to budge unless the release clause was met.

There, they allegedly stabbed her to death.\n\nA spokesman for German police, Andreas Aichele, told German tabloid Bild that \"the victim was killed with over 50 thrusts of the knife, the face completely disfigured\".\n\nThe body was found in the backseat of Shekir K and Sharaban K's car by the banks of the Danube River by the victim's parents on Aug 16.\n\nArrest warrants against the pair were issued on Jan 26 and 27 and they face life in prison if convicted.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nGerman teacher gets life for cannibal murder\n\nGerman jailed for life after killing cashier who asked him to wear a mask\n\nMURDER/MANSLAUGHTER\n\nGermany\n\nsocial media\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/080901748667f2243d15ddb6ff0558dd5beb05439c6ec2f90e0c28e409d76565/ackhadidja310123_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The victim was eventually named as Khadidja O, an Algerian beauty blogger who was also 23.", "caption": "The victim was eventually named as Khadidja O, an Algerian beauty blogger who was also 23.

Lisa Marie is also mother to 14-year-old twin daughters Harper and Finley Lockwood.\n\nPriscilla pointed out that her name had been misspelt in the filing and Lisa Marie's signature in the amendment appeared to be \"inconsistent\" with her usual signature. She added that there were also no witnesses or notarisation of the changes.\n\nPriscilla requested the court to invalidate the 2016 amendment, as she said in the filing that the 2010 version is still \"the authoritative and controlling document\".\n\nShe added that as Siegel \"has already or will soon resign\", she and Riley are slated to be the co-trustees, according to prior terms of the trust.\n\nA friend close to Lisa Marie told People magazine that the late star wanted her children to inherit her trust as she \"did not have a relationship\" with her mother by the time she made the amendment in 2016.\n\n\"Lisa's intent was very clear,\" the friend said. \"Lisa really didn't feel that Priscilla was doing anything in her best interest.\"\n\nLisa Marie died on Jan 12 at the age of 54. Her cause of death has not been revealed by the Los Angeles County coroner, who is investigating the case.\n\nShe was laid to rest at Graceland on Jan 22 after a memorial in which Priscilla and Riley, among others, paid tribute to her.\n\nCelebrities\n\nMusic\n\nWILLS, INHERITANCE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ce2d25a793bd552aae67377b86494e594054a7f5df08834214dd40f942582dcf/2023-01-13T001908Z1030046387RC2AWU9EJESSRTRMADP3PEOPLE-LISA-MARIE-PRESLEY_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "FILE PHOTO: Lisa Marie Presley (left) and her mother Priscilla Presley place their handprints in cement at TCL Chinese theatre in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 21, 2022.

She had borrowed money from them and asked the man to make the transfers as repayments.\n\nThe victim transferred another $32,030 to multiple bank accounts between Nov 30, 2018 and Nov 19, 2019.\n\nThe DPP said: \"(One of the accounts) belonged to the accused's boyfriend...She had asked the victim to transfer monies to this bank account, as she had asked her boyfriend to help her to buy daily necessities or food.\"\n\nThe transfers to the other bank accounts were repayments to her friends, he added.\n\nCourt documents did not disclose how Seah's offences came to light, but she was later handed cheating charges in a district court.\n\nTo date, she has made a restitution of $10,000.\n\nSeah's bail was set at $15,000 on Tuesday, and she is expected to surrender herself at the State Courts on Feb 21 to begin serving her sentence.\n\nFor each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncheating\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nAirwallex Singapore\n\nHow EU Holidays expanded to over 180 staff with Airwallex\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9c2c0676a564ef678071dd0689bee13478aff40f66f78a7c31b347ee1cfcdea0/ac1i016120copy_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Seah Bee Leng, 60, pleaded guilty to two cheating charges and was sentenced to a year in jail.

I just told Nunes to ride his own race,\" he said.\n\n\"It's true he's never sat on the horse, but we had nothing to worry about. He knows what to do.\n\n\"He had a good opinion of the horse from his work and trials.\n\n\"We were also confident, and credit to Nunes for another perfect ride.\"\n\nThe Tavistock six-year-old was returning after a six-month layoff.\n\nWith Deception, Strong N Smart and Lim's Stable's much-hyped newcomer Invincible Tycoon in the $50,000 Class 4 Division 2 race over 1,200m, the task of scoring a first-up victory for a fourth overall win looked daunting.\n\nBut, making full use of the carte blanche Ong handed him, Nunes brushed aside all these concerns with a zipping move on the outskirts of the field.\n\nFrom barrier No. 9, War Pride ($27) whipped around to easily find the paint.\n\nFrom that point onwards, Nunes just controlled the pace to a nicety, paving the way to a one-act affair in the straight.\n\nThree lengths away, a cluster of four horses battled for the minors.\n\nStrong N Smart (Amirul Ismadi) won the fight by a short head from Be You (Matthew Kellady).\n\nWar Pride clocked 1min 09.49sec for the 1,200m on the long course.\n\n\"He was first-up after six months. All the credit to Jason and his team,\" said Nunes.\n\n\"We drew a tricky barrier, but he's a straightforward horse. He jumped well and put himself there.\n\n\"I expected Be You to lead, but we decided to go forward when nobody else was keen. We controlled the pace from there.\n\n\"He scored a very impressive win. He's a lovely horse who can get to Class 3, no problem.\n\n\"I was just telling Jason's father how famous those silks are with War Affair and how I wished they can get another good horse.\"\n\nWith a name and silks that brought shades of the Ong family's pride and joy, War Pride has not quite lived up to the early promise shown in his Kranji racing career.\n\nHe even earned a Group 2 berth in the second leg of the Singapore Three-Year-Old Challenge, off the back of two wins in a row.\n\nBut he was soundly beaten by Inferno in the Singapore Three-Year-Old Classic (1,400m) in 2020.\n\nA win in Class 4 company rekindled hope, but overall, he thereafter showed chequered form, interspersed with a lot of downtime.\n\nTo Ong, the issue was not a lack of ability, but more maturity.\n\n\"The horse has no issues, but I was just not happy with his condition. He was too immature,\" said the Australian-trained handler.\n\n\"He's the sort of horse who's not able to take too much work. He loses weight, he's too light.\n\n\"That's why I put him off work for six months to build some mass. He needs time to mature.\n\n\"He put on 14kg for Saturday's race and was in a good condition. I think he'll run well from now on.\"\n\nIf Ong was confident he had found the missing puzzle piece to War Pride, he hopes he will soon find the same inspiration at the New Zealand Bloodstock's 2023 National Yearling Sale.\n\n\"The sale is quite strong and there are some nice horses going around.,\" he said.\n\n\"I have a few horses on my shortlist, but I've been outbidded a few times already.\n\n\"I'm still looking around. But we're only at Day 2. So, we've got three more days to get a horse.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6241ce7034ac6af8d0e61afa30d13fdee38362353a614f7c73e3f271b0c65c0c/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "War Pride (Manoel Nunes) scooting clear to an easy three-length win in the Class 4 Division 2 race over 1,200m on Saturday.

(3) PROMETTERE may have more to offer as a gelding. He showed enough in three starts with his previous stable to warrant consideration. (6) THEWOLFOFWOLSELEY made a pleasing stable debut over a shorter trip and ought to have come on for that comeback run. The gelding should also be competitive with the extra distance. (9) RELEASE ME and (13) INSIDE STORY are open to improvement after being gelded. (11) MARSHALL FIELD and (12) RAINBOW COLOURS have claims, too.\n\nRace 3 (2,000m)\n\n(9) AUTUMN MOON finished ahead of (1) SELUKWE over 1,600m and is 5.5kg better off. He should be competitive in his first attempt over 2,000m. Selukwe was drawn widest that day and could reverse that form with the extra 400m from an inside barrier. (6) MADISON BLUES has improved with experience and could pose the biggest threat over the longer journey. (3) RUN RUDOLPH RUN and (4) DONDER STORM have shown enough to make their presence felt.\n\nRace 4 (1,600m)\n\n(3) BEYONDTHEBOUNDARY made a winning comeback over a shorter trip and would have tightened up. He ought to be competitive over this trip. The progressive (8) FUTURE SWING won over the track and trip last time. The colt has run well in a similar contest and should make his presence felt. (4) SPRING HIGH and (1) SILENT TRIGGER could stake a claim trying the extra distance in their peak. (5) CHOLLIMA is favourably treated by the conditions and is also capable of playing a minor role.\n\nRace 5 (1,600m)\n\nStable companions (4) DOUBLING UP and (5) PREVALENCE have acquitted themselves well in stronger post-maiden races. They are likely to have a say in the finish. Prevalence appears the pick of the Justin Snaith-trained runners on riding arrangements, but concedes weight to all. (9) PONTE PIETRA will appreciate the step-up in distance. The colt is fitter following his pleasing sprint comeback. (7) MONTIEN is likely to make further progress after his maiden success over this track and trip. The promising galloper should also be competitive.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nRace 6 (1,400m)\n\n(4) DESERT ROSE has rediscovered her best form in two starts during the Cape summer. She led all the way for a dominant victory over 1,600m last time. She could repeat the feat over the shorter journey despite the five-point hike. (5) TREASURE HUNT beat Desert Rose over this track and trip two starts back. Better off by 2kg, the mare could bounce back from her last-start unplaced showing in a stronger race. (8) SHANTASTIC arrives with good form over a shorter distance but could be looking for the extra distance. The filly is likely to put up a good show. (2) PERFECT TRUST and (6) JAM JAM are consistent. Drawn well, they are unlikely to be far off the action either.\n\nRace 7 (1,800m)\n\n(8) HOLD MY HAND was outclassed in a Grade 1 race over this track and distance last time. This looks a lot easier. She will be hard to beat at level weights if she runs to her Cape Fillies Guineas fourth performance.

These include shisha tobacco, smokeless tobacco, chewing tobacco such as Gutkha, Khaini, Zarda, e-vaporisers and their components.\n\nAny person convicted of an offence is liable to a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment of up to six months or both for the first offence. A second or subsequent offence could see a fine of up to $20,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both.\n\nIt is also an offence to purchase, use and possess such products. The penalty is a fine of up to $2,000 per offence. All prohibited tobacco items will also be seized and confiscated.\n\nInformation pertaining to prohibited tobacco products in Singapore is available on the HSA website.\n\nMembers of the public who have information on the illegal import, distribution, sale or offer for sale of e-vaporisers can contact HSA's Tobacco Regulation Branch at 6684-2036 or 6684-2037 during office hours.\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nCorrespondent\n\nE-CIGARETTES/VAPING\n\nSmoking\n\nSecondary School\n\nPrimary School\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/44f55e1dcb5360450c9d1c279f095c8f96b9ad94be3b01fc58d0b0225e279742/ace-vape310123_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The HSA said it had acted on a tip off that a retail outlet at a neighbourhood shopping mall had been selling the items to students.", "caption": "The HSA said it had acted on a tip off that a retail outlet at a neighbourhood shopping mall had been selling the items to students.

We make steps but we have to improve, we have to improve further and that's what we will do.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"After we came back from the World Cup break, we wanted to go for it. So far, it didn't happen properly. But it just means we have to keep working.\n\n\"I am not over the moon about this performance but, again, the only thing that happened really is that we lost against a good side, who we lost (to) two weeks ago in a horrendous game.\n\n\"Today was much better... Last game here we couldn't have won, but this today, nobody would be surprised if we had won. We will not fall apart, I can tell you.\"\n\nLiverpool have just one win in their last six games after coming close to winning the quadruple last season, before ending up with the League Cup and FA Cup. They finished one point behind champions Manchester City in the English Premier League and lost the Champions League final to Real Madrid.\n\nHowever, this season has seen a drop-off. They are ninth in the league, have been knocked out of both domestic Cups but are in the last 16 of the Champions League after recovering from a chastening 4-1 defeat by Napoli in their opener.\n\nLiverpool legend Mark Lawrenson conceded their chances of finishing in the Premier League top four are all but over, telling talkSPORT: \"I just don't see it. It's sheer inconsistency...\n\n\"They've not got great legs in midfield and they lack experience. They're going through that change a little bit. They haven't become a bad side and the manager is not a bad manager - he's outstanding.\n\n\"He's said it already, it's one of those where they get to the summer and the revolving door will open: there will be people coming out and people coming in.\"\n\nHowever, former Liverpool and Scotland midfielder Don Hutchison cautioned that his former team's interest in Jude Bellingham in the summer won't solve their issues.\n\nHe told ESPN: \"If anyone thinks that Liverpool are going to sign Jude Bellingham tomorrow and he's going to be the answer... it ain't gonna happen.\n\n\"They need a major rebuild in midfield. Backline's not too bad, front men are sensational going forward when they're all fit. But it's not just a one-man fix.

I think they'll be celebrating a fair bit in New Zealand,\" said fellow New Zealander Logan, who took over Fortuna's and Te Akau Stable's horses from Walker.\n\nLogan credited Galvin for his talent-scouting acumen.\n\nKnippenberg's record of one third from two starts in the countryside in New South Wales, Australia, would have been missed by many.\n\n\"Once again, John is the best at picking these horses at the Inglis Digital sale,\" said Logan.\n\n\"This horse ticked all the boxes for him, and he was quite certain he would make it in Singapore. But it's still early days, so we'll take it one race at a time.\"\n\nThe I Am Invincible three-year-old did not give much away at his one barrier trial on Jan 19 either, when a rather plain third to Watery.\n\nBut Knippenberg ($30) was a lot more dynamic on Saturday, sitting right on the hammer of leader and the better-fancied ($16) fellow debutant Star North (Louis-Philippe Beuzelin).\n\nHe waited for the home straight to turn the tables.\n\nStar North did not shirk the fight, but Knippenberg finally wore him down and skipped away.\n\nThe long stalemate between the duelling pair proved costly for the $12 favourite, Popeyethesailorman.\n\nHopelessly snookered in behind, the Manoel Nunes-ridden, Tim Fitzsimmons-trained galloper needed fresh air more badly than a can of spinach.\n\nHe had to switch across two pairs of heels to bust out. But Knippenberg was already safely home by 1 3/4 lengths. Star North was third, another length away.\n\nThe winning time was 1min 10.32sec for the 1,200m on the long course.\n\n\"He could have led but the long course was a concern. We then decided to put him behind the speed and Ronnie rode him a treat,\" said Logan.\n\n\"I wasn't worried about the wet as he's raced over such tracks in Australia.\"\n\nThen prepared by Australia's leading trainers Ciaron Maher and David Eustace, Knippenberg ran seventh on debut on a soft track at Goulburn.\n\nHe then improved with a third placing over a similar surface at his next start in Bathurst.\n\nLogan was more worried about the quality of opposition her newcomer was testing his mettle against.\n\n\"He had a nice draw (barrier No. 3), but there were some nice horses from Tim Fitzsimmons and Mike Clements (Mewar, 7th) in it,\" she said.\n\n\"I would have been satisfied if he finished in the first five, but he's won, which is great. There's still improvement to come out of him, though.\"\n\nWhile the runner-up to reigning champion Fitzsimmons was at her second 2023 winner, after Aftermath saluted earlier, Stewart was also bringing a slugglish start to an end.\n\n\"He was well prepared and he handled the surface very well,\" said the Australian of his account opener.\n\n\"He looks a nice horse who can go through his grades.

I asked her to lower her voice but she continued to shout,\" said Hou.\n\nFrustrated, Hou said she took the phone away from the helper and asked her to take the call outside the flat.\n\nThe tussle over the phone at the doorway turned violent, and Hou claimed the helper slapped her.\n\nHou claimed that at one point, the helper rushed back into the living room and hit one of her children.

Her allegation made national headlines in Taiwan, to the dismay of Thai tourism operators.\n\nThe 33-year-old actress said police stopped their Grab taxi at a checkpoint close to the Chinese Embassy on Ratchadaphisek Road at about 1am on Jan 5 and detained the group for two hours. She said police eventually released the group in return for a payment of 27,000 baht (RM3,500).\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Bureau (MPB) has denied the claims of extortion, saying that CCTV footage of the incident does not back up the actress's story. Police have contacted Taiwanese authorities in a bid to question An, who has since returned to Taiwan.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 10, 2025, 12:30am\n\nSingaporean fugitive arrested in Thailand for alleged drug trafficking\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn a Facebook post on Monday, Chuwit said a Thai friend who was part of An's group had paid the 27,000-baht bribe to police.\n\n\"The Thai friend had joined a drinking party with Taiwanese actress,\" he said, adding that she also had a video clip as evidence.\n\nChuwit also claimed that MPB chief Thiti Saengsawang had ordered Metropolitan Police Division 1 commander Pol Maj-General Attaporn Wongsiripreeda and Huai Khwang police station chief Yingyos Suwanno to take four steps to cover up the incident.\n\nChuwit alleges they were ordered to:\n\n- Delete footage from the Chinese Embassy's CCTV cameras and police body cameras.\n\n- Persuade the Grab taxi driver to say that he stayed at the checkpoint for 40 minutes, had no video of the incident, and that the Taiwanese actress was drunk.\n\n- Release video clips to discredit An.\n\n- Counter the extortion claim by declaring that she had made up the story.\n\nChuwit said police scandals over collusion with Chinese triads and extortion of the Taiwanese actress had damaged Thailand's reputation.\n\n\"Most importantly, the police made up a story, destroyed evidence and retaliated against the Taiwanese actress.\"\n\nHe added that he expects the police to confess to extortion of the actress soon. - THE NATION/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nthailand\n\nextortion\n\nactress\n\ntaiwan\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:20am\n\n2 Singaporeans among 3 arrested in Thailand in joint anti-vice sweep\n\nJun 4, 2025, 11:28pm\n\nS'pore businessman nabbed before flight at Bangkok airport over suspected tax evasion\n\nMay 21, 2025, 12:24am\n\nActor Mark Lee urges hairstylist Addy Lee not to be too harsh on host Quan Yifeng\n\nMay 6, 2025, 02:06am\n\nSingaporean man in Thailand nabbed for being part of illegal vape network\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6ba8aba6a5e0bb104855918512988e621bbbdf388720e6fbcf2a7a5a51947722/1919248.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTOS: THE STAR"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c8dfff1f1a51e769427c5a561e85c62f12824017e1ded49d59202b34d24fd8e3/rrcnb1007.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Singaporean fugitive arrested in Thailand for alleged drug trafficking", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/695e9e7b89e7dd294f5d48d52ab28801ebf428f5f572e2708fe275265d789999/photo2025-06-1913-30-51.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "2 Singaporeans among 3 arrested in Thailand in joint anti-vice sweep", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He was sentenced to 32 months' jail and three strokes of the cane.\n\nThey both cannot be named as there are gag orders to protect their victims' identities.\n\nAfter arriving in Singapore in 2019, the Vietnamese man had his work permit cancelled on March 7, 2020, said deputy public prosecutors Victoria Ting and Matthew Choo.\n\nAs he could not return to Vietnam due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he was given a special pass that allowed him to stay here until Sept 6, 2021.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the victim's mother, who ran a restaurant in Geylang, offered fellow Vietnamese workers stranded in Singapore free food and the accused started going to the restaurant.\n\nThe man and his victim became acquainted as the girl would help out at the restaurant after school.\n\nIn March 2021, after the man was asked to leave the shelter he was staying in, the victim's mother allowed him to stay in the restaurant.\n\nBut some time in July 2021, the man was told he could not stay in the restaurant as he was unvaccinated.\n\nOut of goodwill, the victim's mother allowed him to stay with her and the girl in a two-room condo unit she was renting in Bedok.\n\nThe unit's other occupants were the mother's stepbrother and a restaurant worker. The Vietnamese slept on a sofa.\n\nOn or about Aug 8, 2021, the Vietnamese told the girl he had romantic feelings for her despite knowing that she was 11 years old.\n\nThen some time in August, the man raped the girl in the condo unit.\n\nThe victim's mother found out when the restaurant worker living in the unit told her that he suspected that the girl and the offender were romantically involved.\n\nWhen he was confronted, the Vietnamese admitted to having touched the victim inappropriately. The girl then confirmed that he had raped her.\n\nThe mother made a police report and the man was arrested on Aug 26, 2021.\n\nIn the other case, the Malaysian man started a relationship with his victim's mother in 2010, and soon moved in to live with the victim's family, said DPP Wong Shiau Yin.\n\nSome time in 2011, while the victim was watching television in the living room, the offender asked her to go with him into the toilet.\n\nThere, he pulled down his trousers and rubbed his private parts against hers for about 10 minutes. Her mother was asleep at the time.\n\nSaid DPP Wong: \"The victim did not understand what was happening and therefore did not shout for help. Instead, she kept silent throughout the ordeal.\"\n\nBut her mother suddenly appeared outside the toilet and told the victim to leave the room.\n\nDPP Wong said the victim did not know what transpired between the offender and her mother, but remembered seeing him kneeling on the floor begging for forgiveness.\n\nBut some time later, the man had also attempted to perform oral sex on the victim.\n\nThe offences were brought to light when the victim, who is now 17 years old and suffers from major depressive disorder, confided in an intern at a clinical and health psychology centre, who then referred the matter to the Ministry of Social and Family Development.

She was paid about $1,000 for her efforts.\"\n\nShe was one of several people charged in 2022 over their alleged links to the phishing scams, which led to victims losing some $12.8 million.\n\nSome of the offenders, including Mark Teo Sin Yan, 32, and Leong Jun Xian, then 21, were dealt with in court earlier.\n\nThe cases involving several others, including Kong Jia Quan and Muhammad Khairuddin Eskandariah, both 20, are pending.\n\nDPPs Chua and Ronnie Ang said in court documents that the girl and other accused persons had sourced for and provided control of bank accounts to members of crime syndicates believed to be based overseas.\n\nThey opened bank accounts and gave the syndicates the account credentials.\n\n\"Some of these bank accounts were subsequently used to receive and dissipate funds from the (scams involving OCBC customers), while other bank accounts were used to receive and dissipate funds from victims of other scams,\" the prosecutors added.\n\nThe syndicates also told the group to withdraw cash from ATMs, by giving them instructions on messaging platform Telegram.\n\nThe girl, who opened a DBS bank account with her Singpass details, was a member of three Telegram chat groups used by the offenders.\n\nIn all, the group provided at least 16 bank accounts to the syndicates in the Telegram group chats between December 2021 and February 2022, receiving nearly $600,000 from different scams, including\n\nthose involving OCBC customers.\n\nBetween Dec 8, 2021, and Jan 19, 2022, the police received 768 reports from OCBC bank account holders who had fallen prey to phishing scams.\n\nOCBC said in January 2022 that it had\n\nmade full goodwill payouts to all victims.\n\nThe girl, who pleaded guilty to giving a false statement, had lied to the police on Dec 30, 2021, when she claimed that she had withdrawn cash on behalf of a fictitious person named \"firewin888\", whom she said reached out to her on Telegram.\n\nClaiming that she had been threatened by firewin888, she said the cash was kept in a red paper bag which was placed outside her home for collection by the Telegram user.\n\nAs a result of the false statement, officers from both the Criminal Investigation Department and Yishun North Neighbourhood Police Centre were diverted to review footage from devices such as police cameras around her estate to try to spot a person carrying a red paper bag.\n\nAs the statement was false, the police were unable to find anyone carrying a red paper bag, and they had to interview the girl again.\n\nShe is expected to be sentenced on Feb 13.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nSCAMS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9cc84ab313bc64406950e13181ca4a2b5bd5c87c6a20974446e3627797fb1b06/tnp16.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "TNP PHOTO ILLISTRATION"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

This will especially help to reach out to the uninformed and the elderly.\"\n\nCompanies that use third-party services - or aggregators - to send their SMSes may find that their texts are flagged as \"likely scam\" if the service provider is not in the registry.\n\nIMDA urges firms to choose aggregators that are part of the registry to avoid this problem.\n\nAt least 2,600 SMS sender IDs have been registered with the IMDA, which has reached out to organisations through associations, such as the Singapore Business Federation, Singapore International Chamber of Commerce and Association of Banks in Singapore, to encourage them to sign up.\n\nAfter the registry was set up in March 2022, the Republic saw a 64 per cent reduction in scams through SMS from the last quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2022, said IMDA.\n\nIt added that scam cases perpetrated via SMS made up around 8 per cent of scam reports in the second quarter of 2022, down from 10 per cent in the same period of 2021.\n\nHow the SMS Sender ID Registry works\n\nAll organisations that send SMSes using alphanumeric sender IDs are required to register with the Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry, or will have their messages labelled as “likely scam” from Jan 31, 2023. PHOTO: IMDA\n\nCurrently, organisations register their protected sender IDs but scammers are still able to use lookalike IDs that are not registered.\n\nFrom Tuesday, all unregistered sender IDs will be marked as \"likely scam\" for a transition period of six months. After this period, messages with these unregistered IDs will be blocked and not delivered to users.\n\nThis will cover all sender IDs that come from local and overseas sources, but does not apply to person-to-person texts.\n\nThere will be a one-time set-up fee of $500 per firm and an annual charge of $200 per registered sender ID.\n\nOrganisations keen to register can contact the Singapore Network Information Centre at\n\nsmsregistry@sgnic.sg\n\nBy\n\nOsmond Chia\n\nRead articles by Osmond Chia\n\nInfocomm Media Development Authority\n\nCYBER SECURITY\n\nINTERNET CRIMES AND SCAMS\n\nSCAMS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 17, 2022, 09:06am\n\n#LookAtMe film by Ken Kwek barred from being screened in S'pore over potential to cause social division\n\nDec 16, 2021, 08:24am\n\nHigh Court dismisses TOC's bid to challenge IMDA's orders to shut its Chinese site, social media channels\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3ebdb63a5dee2b31a2dd1f61780e5a6269398a814641bfc34047c9dd52ffa279/yaohui-pixgeneric-7973_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Companies that are not part of the registry will have their text messages labelled as “likely scam”.", "caption": "Companies that are not part of the registry will have their text messages labelled as “likely scam”.

Phang reciprocated, to continue to lead her on.\n\nOn Nov 8, 2020, at the request of 'Leon', the victim agreed to be his girlfriend for the first time. Though Phang had initially promised the victim to spend time with her in-person, she never fulfilled any of those promises and would give various excuses not to meet her.\n\nWhen they were in a relationship, DPP Shen said Phang, as 'Leon', groomed the victim to be subservient to her by telling her that she should be loyal and obedient.\n\nPhang then deceived the victim into buying items like food and game credits for her. She also made the victim resign from her job without notice, which resulted in her having to pay her company $1,566.\n\nPhang caused the victim to incur a total monetary loss of at least $4,705.64. The victim initially paid for the purchases with her own money, but later had to get money from her sister and father.\n\nSome time before Nov 19, 2020, Phang conceived the idea of procuring nude photographs and videos from the victim, for the purpose of extorting money from her.\n\nShe asked the victim to prove her love by sending her nude material over Whatsapp. The victim expressed her discomfort as she had never met 'Leon' in person.\n\nOn Feb 12, 2021, after repeated requests, the victim sent two photographs of her bra and panties respectively to her and sent two nude videos over Instagram the next day after more pressure.\n\nAfter receiving more material, Phang attempted to extort $1,000 from the victim, by threatening to post her nude material online and distribute them to her friends, family, and ex-employer if she failed to pay her the money.\n\nWorried her nude videos who be distributed, the victim eventually blocked 'Leon' on social media.\n\nOn May 18, 2021, the victim lodged a police report stating that a person known to her only as Leon had threatened to distribute her nude photographs and claimed to have already done so to a friend.\n\nThe police managed to establish Phang's identity, and an operation to track and detain her.\n\nShe was arrested at her home on May 18, 2021 at about 5.30pm.\n\nFor cheating, Phang could have been jailed for three years with a fine.\n\nShe could have been jailed for up to two years with a fine for criminal intimidation.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nextortion\n\nnude pictures\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/00b9e05dd5af79c972284c97914681d4c6f26b55fda7091bfad3bed89cc77a63/extort.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Janelle Phang Minxuan caused the victim to lose over $4,000.", "caption": "Janelle Phang Minxuan caused the victim to lose over $4,000.

The unsuspecting Mr Sivanesan authorised payments totalling nearly $4,200 to her between December 2019 and November 2020.\n\nTeo also owned a firm called TKW that performed maintenance, repair and painting work. He did not tell the other RN members he was the firm's owner when the group engaged its services.\n\nDPP Gan told the court: \"He also sought to further conceal his ownership of TKW to members of the RN by using a variety of signatures, including one which read 'Shirley', on invoices issued by TKW.\n\n\"Had the accused disclosed... his ownership of TKW to members of the RN... TKW would not have been engaged to render services to the RN.\"\n\nBetween December 2019 and December 2020, Teo dishonestly induced Mr Kian and Mr Sivanesan to authorise payments totalling $2,840 to TKW.\n\nHe also made bogus payment claims over purported reimbursements for purchases and services, including air-conditioning servicing.\n\nTeo made such claims on multiple occasions between July 2020 and August 2021. As a result, Mr Kian and Mr Sivanesan were duped into approving payments totalling some $3,800.\n\nThe pair had trusted the veracity of Teo's payment claims, and did not inquire further into the claims beyond ensuring the amount in the supporting documents he provided tallied with the amount to be disbursed to him, said DPP Gan.\n\nTeo's offences came to light after an officer from the director's office of Sembawang GRC conducted a review of the RN's finances.\n\nThe police were alerted on Nov 30, 2021, after several financial irregularities were discovered.\n\nTeo's bail has been set at $15,000, and he is expected to surrender himself at the State Courts on Feb 20 to begin serving his sentence.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncheating\n\nShare this article", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/29378fbdb3e1a499a1d4126135950fbf4076e27cf7a6310d51b5be25747120a1/ac1i980020copy_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Teo Kum Weng made bogus claims for purported reimbursements for goods and services because he was facing financial difficulties at the time.", "caption": "Teo Kum Weng made bogus claims for purported reimbursements for goods and services because he was facing financial difficulties at the time.

The couple have since divorced.\n\nThe man, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim's identity, married her mother in 2014.\n\nTwo years later, he and the victim were in the living room of their flat when they started teasing each other.\n\nShe ran into her bedroom and tried to close the door in an attempt to hide from her stepfather. He pushed open the door and wrestled with her on her bed.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Colin Ng said: \"The accused rested his body on top of the victim's body. The accused then bit the victim on her (chest) over her clothes.\"\n\nWhen she screamed for help, he immediately left the bedroom. The mother, who was in the kitchen, went to the bedroom after hearing the scream.\n\nHowever, the girl did not reveal what had happened.\n\nOn or around March 19, 2018, the man was in the kitchen with the girl when he tried to kiss her lips.\n\nThe DPP said: \"However, the victim resisted and struggled. During the struggle, the accused pinned the victim down on the floor (and touched her genitals).\"\n\nShe screamed for help and told him to stop, then left the flat soon after.\n\nThree months later, she told her boyfriend about the incident, but stopped him from making a police report.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n4 men charged over molestation of kids at various locations\n\nNearly 5 years’ jail for man who repeatedly molested daughter, victim-shamed her during trial\n\nThe offender struck yet again at around 8.30am on Feb 20, 2019, when he grabbed her right breast while her mother was in the master bedroom. The mother rushed out when she heard screaming.\n\nAt first, the victim - who was then 20 - refused to tell her mother about what had transpired, but did so later that evening. The police were alerted.\n\nThe man was represented by defence lawyer S.S.

If convicted, he would be the latest example of how South Korea has tried to crack down on sex crimes as the country continues to grapple with the reverberations of the #MeToo movement.\n\nProsecutors charged Oh Young-soo, 78, in November 2022, after a woman filed a complaint accusing him of inappropriately touching her in 2017.\n\nIf a district judge in Suwon, about 32km south of Seoul, convicts Oh, he would face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to about US$12,000 (S$15,800).\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:48am\n\nKia launches its first Singapore-assembled EV\n\nMore related stories\n\nFew additional facts are known about the case and the incident. Court documents are unavailable by law, and authorities have declined to offer more details about the accuser, citing their policy not to disclose any information about victims of sex crimes.\n\nOh has denied any wrongdoing, but he has already faced fallout since being charged.\n\nHe has been excluded from the cast of a South Korean play called Love Letter, in which he had been scheduled to perform on Jan 14. The country's Culture Ministry has also stopped airing a government commercial that had featured him.\n\n\"I rushed to request replacements as soon as I heard the news,\" said Mr Lim Dong-sik, head of advertising at the broadcasting network sponsoring the play in which Oh had been cast. Mr Lim added that the allegations had tarnished Oh's reputation.\n\nIn 2022, Oh became the first South Korean to win a Golden Globe, for best supporting actor. He was also nominated for an Emmy for his performance in Squid Game, a dystopian drama that chronicles South Koreans down on their luck who join a secretive, deadly contest in hopes of winning a life-changing fortune.\n\nThe show struck a pop-culture nerve worldwide - becoming Netflix's most-watched new series ever - and featured Oh portraying an older competitor known as \"Player 001\" in the game. Netflix did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nProsecutors in Suwon pressed charges on Nov 25 after initially dropping the case.\n\nA police station in Seongnam, a nearby city, had originally received the complaint from the woman in December 2021 and had immediately begun investigating the case, said Ms Jang Shin-mo, a division leader at the station. That station sent the case to the prosecutors in February 2022, but authorities decided two months later not to press charges, she said.\n\nThe woman appealed and asked police to reopen the case in May 2022, Ms Jang said. After gathering more evidence, prosecutors pressed charges in November 2022.\n\nPeople convicted of indecent assault in South Korea become registered sex offenders who are monitored by police even after completing their prison terms. First-time offenders can receive reduced sentences, such as five years, or simply a fine.\n\nIn the wake of the charges, Oh had become a particularly poor fit to appear in the play Love Letter, said Mr Lim.\n\nThe play is a romance featuring a pair of actors who take turns reading love letters to each other. Each character is married to someone else, but they exchange intimate letters throughout the span of their lives.\n\nMr Lim said his company had decided to drop Oh from the play the day the charges were announced. Oh and the other actor who had been scheduled to appear as a pair were replaced by two other performers.\n\nAfter the Culture Ministry cancelled the government advertisements featuring Oh, it said in a statement that it had done so to avoid \"unnecessary controversy\". The e-mailed statement did not explicitly mention the accusations against Oh.\n\nThe ads, which had promoted regulatory reform, disappeared from government websites, official social media channels and subway stations only 11 days after they went up.\n\nThroughout his career, Oh has played supporting roles in film and television, including a part as an ageing Buddhist monk in the 2003 romance film Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring. That portrayal earned him the moniker \"monk actor\", a role he would reprise in other films, television shows and commercials. - NYTIMES\n\nSouth Korea\n\nactors\n\nTV series\n\nSTREAMING - MUSIC/VIDEO/CONTENT\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 28, 2025, 01:14am\n\nWoman left in vegetative state by botched procedure returns to S'pore\n\nJan 13, 2025, 09:32am\n\nFans wait 7 hours in the rain for (G)I-dle's Minnie at Chagee opening\n\nDec 31, 2024, 02:48am\n\nWhy is there a concrete wall near the end of Muan Airport runway?\n\nDec 29, 2024, 11:41pm\n\nGrief fills Muan Airport as families wait for victims to be identified\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7bb5eb673711703fed27b7373f7b0a6762e46cf08be6aeef58ee418bd012c0fe/svsquidgame271122_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Squid Game actor Oh Young-soo has been removed from ads by the South Korean government following his indictment for indecent assault.", "caption": "Squid Game actor Oh Young-soo has been removed from ads by the South Korean government following his indictment for indecent assault.

The occasion is traditionally marked by the Hokkiens, a Chinese dialect group in Singapore.\n\nCompared with previous years, this year's celebration was the first without restrictions since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nDevotees were allowed into the temple till about 2am, unlike the past two years when it was closed earlier due to pandemic restrictions, said the temple's event coordinator Jeffrey Tan, 66, who has worked for the temple for 26 years.\n\nAt the altar, temple staff placed a spread of longevity buns, longevity noodles, roast meats, cooked crabs, fresh fruits, red eggs and traditional sweets and confectionery.\n\nDevotees had arrived as early as 8pm on Sunday to write their name, home address, prayers and well wishes on joss paper.\n\nMr Ko Woei Hin, 45, who owns a construction business, makes offerings yearly for the Jade Emperor's birthday.\n\nThis year, Mr Ko, accompanied by his wife, offered 30 sets of joss paper as well as headwear, clothing, pineapples, buckets of ingots and a ship with sails - all made of paper - to the deity.\n\nThis year's visitors also included a 101-year-old matriarch accompanied by her family.\n\nThe devotees' stacks of joss paper will be burnt at about 3pm on Monday, which will mark the end of the celebration.\n\nMichelle Chin\n\nFESTIVALS/CELEBRATIONS\n\nreligion\n\nculture\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b4eda0a0af81e7a7e9bbd18acc28f9ffb1efc5c7663351d96ea74f222fd3e18c/tpk.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Devotees turning out in force at the celebration of the Jade Emperor’s birthday at Loyang Tua Pek Kong temple on Jan 29, 2023.", "caption": "Devotees turning out in force at the celebration of the Jade Emperor’s birthday at Loyang Tua Pek Kong temple on Jan 29, 2023.

Class 2A and 2B licences allow the supply of beer only, and permitted hours under them are from 6am to 11.59pm or as indicated on the licence.\n\nFailure to display the required notices could result in a fine of up to $10,000 for liquor licensees.\n\nThere are no changes to rules for liquor consumption, which allow licensed outlets to sell alcohol only within their premises and during permitted hours.\n\nPatrons found to be drinking in a licensed outlet after its permitted hours may face a fine of up to $1,000. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $2,000, jailed for up to three months, or both.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nRegular alcohol use most common in older men, binge drinking in young adults: Survey\n\nDrinking too much?

The remaining three floors are set to open in the next few months.\n\nNevertheless, there is more than enough to explore at the soft launch, such as a tinkering space on the second floor that the National Library Board has set up in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution of the United States.\n\nAimed at getting children to tackle hands-on problems independently, it encourages them to invent solutions to engineering challenges - such as how to construct an item to hover in a wind tunnel, or how to build structures around a teetering table without them falling.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:01am\n\nLocal author traces evolution of Singaporean Chinese names\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn addition, a Stories Come Alive room on the first floor features interactive screens that animate Singaporean poems across the four official languages.\n\nFor instance, in a rendition of Singaporean lawyer and writer Ronald Wong's poem Punggol, children are able to tap on accompanying pop-ups to explore the locations featured in the work, such as the all-but-forgotten Babujan Zoo that was a neighbourhood fixture in the 1930s.\n\nOther features aimed at children include NLB's first permanent toy library, which offers puppets, costumes and props to experiment with, and a Storyteller Cove that provides prompts for children to come up with their own tales.\n\nSaid Ms Catherine Lau, deputy chief executive of NLB: \"When we plan the space, we want it to spark imagination and curiosity.\n\nThe Stories Come Alive Room uses moving images, text, and light and sound effects to make storytelling an immersive and interactive experience for children aged four to 10 years. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nWe want them to learn through using our book collection, through playing at the toy library and the other interactive activities.\"\n\nIn line with NLB's Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025 (LAB25), which aims in part to make libraries more inclusive to all, the new facility incorporates numerous accessible features to serve the needs of people with disabilities.\n\nThe Storyteller Cove, a space with animations, illustrations, and activity stations including for prop-making, aims to inspire to children to create their own stories. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nFor instance, one feature to make the library more friendly for wheelchair-bound patrons is the \"Borrow-n-Go\" passageway, which utilises Ultra-High Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to enable users to borrow their desired titles without having to place them on a table-top, as is the case at traditional borrowing kiosks.\n\nThe library also offers Calm Pods, quiet and safe spaces with wall and floor padding, as well as sensory aids, for users with disabilities to go to should they need privacy to calm down.\n\nA staff demonstrating the usage of Borrow-n-Go during the media preview on Jan 27. It allows wheelchair users to borrow books easily by going through this passageway. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nMulti-coloured keyboards with large keys have also been installed at the new library, so that people with visual impairments can access the library's catalogue with greater ease.\n\nThese accessible features were created with inputs from the Singaporean disability community, including the NLB's Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee which includes experts on child development and the CEOs of local social service organisations.\n\nAssistive technology devices such as coloured keyboards with larger keys are available to aid visually impaired patrons. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nSpeaking to The Straits Times, Ms Verena Lee, assistant director of the Punggol Regional Library said: \"We want to welcome persons with disabilities in and make sure they feel accepted... We want to continue to shape how we deliver our services, to think of new ways to engage our community.\n\n\"So come, use the library, and give us feedback.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nWant to read books and make friends?

A fourth fish, Lala, died in September.\n\nIn this instance, the fishy incident took place earlier this month where Mutekimaru was live-streaming a game of Pokemon.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMutekimaru had stepped away for a break after the game crashed due to a system error and the console returned to the home screen.\n\nThe fish however carried on swimming - as what fishes do - and seemingly continued to control the console remotely from its tank.\n\nDuring the next seven hours, CNN reported that the fish managed to change the name of its owner's Switch account, downloaded a new avatar, set up a PayPal account and sent an email about the process as well as read a set of terms and conditions on the Nintendo eShop.\n\n\"Fish eagerly read the terms and conditions. Many of us humans don't read the terms of service, but fish are smarter than we are,\" a caption in the recap video of the incident said.\n\nIn a budding shopping spree that would make any shopaholic proud, the fish also added 500 yen (S$5) to Mutekimaru's Switch account and in the process, exposed the owner's credit card details.\n\nBy then, the livestream has attracted thousands of comments from amused followers. The incident went viral on Twitter as well.\n\n\"I can only imagine having to explain to customer service that your pet fish made purchases on your account,\" wrote a commentator, while another said: \"Never leave your pet fish unattended.\"\n\nCNN reported Mutekimaru as saying later that he had contacted Nintendo to explain what happened and asked for a refund of his 500 yen.\n\nNintendo declined to comment to CNN, citing customer confidentiality.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nNintendo breaks sales record with new Pokemon games on Switch\n\nDad saddled with $20,000 bill after daughter's in-game spending spree\n\nJapan\n\nfish\n\nVIRAL VIDEOS\n\nGAMING/VIDEO GAMES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22, 2025, 07:40am\n\nFormer S'pore basketball coach's wife, missing for 2 years, confirmed dead in Japan\n\nMay 20, 2025, 12:18am\n\nS'pore man arrested in Japan for allegedly committing indecent acts involving boy in onsen\n\nApr 6, 2025, 04:16am\n\nSingaporeans believed to be among 47 injured in bus collision on Tokyo expressway\n\nApr 3, 2025, 12:30am\n\nMFA officer who took nude photos of male customers in Tokyo bathhouse dismissed\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bcc3f0f09dc63c0a2a753773b69d23329deab4120347a672b6b75edb06c41070/affish300123_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The fishy incident took place earlier this month where Mutekimaru was live-streaming a game of Pokemon.", "caption": "The fishy incident took place earlier this month where Mutekimaru was live-streaming a game of Pokemon.

I will be continuing to support Sailors as always.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:01pm\n\nLion City Sailors retain Singapore Cup to cement domestic dominance\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe 1.96m striker, who scored 16 goals in 56 appearances for his country and featured at the 2014 and 2018 World Cups, is close to agreeing a move to Hong Kong Premier League side Kitchee SC, according to media reports.\n\nKim is the latest highly paid Sailor to leave the club after a disappointing 2022 season, in which the big spenders lost the SPL title to Albirex Niigata and crashed out of the Singapore Cup at the group stage.\n\nThe exodus began in November 2022, when the club announced the departure of six players, including Hassan Sunny (now with Albirex), Gabriel Quak, Shahdan Sulaiman (both Hougang United) and Faris Ramli (Tampines Rovers), who were believed to be among the highest local earners at the club.\n\nA host of backroom staff also departed and chief executive Chew Chun-Liang also left the club in December.\n\nEarlier in January, Singapore midfielder Song Ui-young also announced that he was moving out of his \"comfort zone\" to pursue new challenges with Thai League 1 side Nongbua Pitchaya.\n\nSailors owners Sea Limited, Singapore's largest consumer Internet company, has since late-2022 been buffeted by a perfect storm of an economic slowdown, inflation, increasing competition and a broader tech sell-off. The parent of e-commerce giant Shopee and gaming firm Garena has suffered a US$150 billion plunge in its value since late 2021 and there has been at least three rounds of layoffs at Shopee's local and international offices.\n\nWhile Kim's record of 24 goals in 35 appearances for the Sailors in all competitions makes for good reading on paper, he failed to impress fans here due to his lack of mobility up front.\n\nThe former K. League and Asian Champions League (ACL) winner was brought in for his experience at the top tier of Asian football, but started only two of the Sailors' six matches during their ACL debut in 2022 and failed to score.\n\nThe Sailors' December signing of reigning SPL Player of the Year Kodai Tanaka, who racked up 33 goals and 11 assists for Albirex in 2022, was the first sign that Kim's time was up.\n\nThe 23-year-old Japanese striker's arrival meant that there were five foreigners on the Sailors' books, more than the SPL quota of four. Their other imports are centre-back Pedro Henrique, playmaker Diego Lopes and winger Maxime Lestienne.\n\nSailors captain Hariss Harun said of Kim: \"He was a consummate professional, a good presence in the dressing room, and a fighter out on the pitch. We wish him the best in the next chapter of his career, and we'll be following him closely too.\"\n\nThe Sailors will kick off their new SPL campaign on Feb 24 against Tanjong Pagar United. As last season's top local side, they will also compete in the play-offs for a place in this season's ACL. If they fail to progress, they will then take their place in the second-tier AFC Cup.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: Sailors sign SPL Player of The Year Kodai Tanaka\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nSingapore Premier League\n\nSingapore Football\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nWounded Sharjah up for revenge to 'get the trophy they deserve' in ACL2\n\nMay 7, 2025, 12:10am\n\nScalpers take to online platforms to resell ACL Two final tickets\n\nApr 28, 2025, 10:50pm\n\nCan Forrest Li replicate Sailors' success on national level?\n\nApr 23, 2025, 02:05am\n\nLion City Sailors get provisional approval to host Asian Champions League 2 final at Bishan Stadium\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bc079b64fd299d43a2b23dd9a87fd1632e11aa46a7472ed17c018283136dea7c/20220219100010976d478697a-f927-437d-a949-57d9bb07c5aa_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Lion City Sailors’ Kim Shin Wook (in white) scoring a goal against Albirex Niigata during the Singapore Premier League Community Shield match at Jalan Besar Stadium on Feb 19, 2022.", "caption": "Lion City Sailors’ Kim Shin Wook (in white) scoring a goal against Albirex Niigata during the Singapore Premier League Community Shield match at Jalan Besar Stadium on Feb 19, 2022.

However, he applied for post-doctorate jobs in the medical industry because of his passion to help people. Unsurprisingly, no one would hire him because his field was unrelated to medicine.\n\nBut he remained committed to his calling, and was advised by an older scientist to try Dr Judah Folkman, a Harvard University professor and surgeon-in-chief at Boston Children's Hospital who was known for hiring people with unusual backgrounds.\n\nProf Langer landed a job as Dr Folkman's assistant and began working at the hospital in 1974.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 3, 2025, 05:38am\n\nS'pore partially shielded from Trump's tariffs, but global trade slowdown looms\n\nMore related stories\n\nDr Folkman was studying metastasis, the process of how cancerous tumours grow and spread throughout the body. He theorised that tumours stimulated angiogenesis, or the growth of blood vessels, to provide them with nutrients and allow them to spread.\n\nHe tasked Prof Langer to find a method to deliver angiogenesis-inhibiting drugs to the tumour.\n\n\"I spent years in the laboratory experimenting with different materials and different designs to deliver the drugs. I found 200 different ways not to get this done.\" said Prof Langer at the summit.\n\n\"But eventually, I was able to make tiny little nanoparticles which could deliver molecules of any size, including nucleic acids and mRNA.\"\n\nHe innovated a way to encase drug molecules within an ultra-small particle, which could attach to the tumour and release the drug over time via diffusion. He published his findings in 1976 in Nature, a prestigious scientific journal.\n\nRidiculed\n\n\"When I first presented this work, it was ridiculed. I was 27 years old, the youngest person in that room.\n\n\"When I finished the talk, I thought all these older people would encourage me as a young researcher. But as I stepped off the podium, a bunch of them came up to me and said, 'We don't believe anything you just said'.\"\n\nScientists dismissed his work, believing that large molecules were too big to exit the nanoparticles.\n\nUndeterred, Prof Langer sought a faculty position in a university to obtain more funding to continue his research, but no one would take him.\n\n\"No chemical engineering department in the world would hire me. They said, 'All this biology stuff you're doing doesn't make any sense for a chemical engineer. You should be doing oil and energy'.\"\n\nProf Langer eventually managed to land a job in the MIT nutrition department. However, he was later advised to leave by his colleagues when they found out about his unusual field of research.\n\n\"One evening, I went to a faculty dinner at a Chinese restaurant with some senior MIT professors. A senior scientist sat quizzing us while smoking a cigar. When he heard my concept for drug delivery, he blew a cloud of smoke in my face and said, 'You better start looking for another job',\" said Prof Langer.\n\nBut he persisted in his research, and his work slowly gained traction in the scientific community. He then tried to file a patent for his drug delivery idea.\n\n\"Five years in a row, the patent examiner rejected it,\" he said. \"But you can tell by now (that) I don't like to give up, so I started to think about how could we convince the examiner to approve it.\"\n\nProf Langer compiled citations from eminent scientists who commended his work over the years, and finally secured a patent in 1983. This would mark the start of an illustrious series of successes.\n\nHe went on to file over 1,200 patents, licensed to more than 300 pharmaceutical, biotechnology, chemical and medical device companies. He also became the most cited engineer in history, with more than 380,000 citations from the myriad research papers he authored or co-authored.\n\nHe founded or co-founded 41 companies. He co-founded Moderna in 2010.\n\n\"Once I was able to deliver large molecules over long times, I thought this might be a great way to deliver vaccines,\" he told The Straits Times in an e-mail interview on Jan 20.\n\n\"I published my first paper on this in the Journal Of Immunological Methods in 1979. But it was not until I helped start Moderna that I contributed to the industrial development of novel vaccines.\"\n\nModerna made mRNA-based medicines using Prof Langer's drug delivery method, which eventually became the foundation for the development of Moderna's Covid-19 mRNA vaccines.\n\n\"I'm highly prejudiced but I think Moderna's future will be incredible,\" he said.\n\n\"The scientists and leadership (at Moderna) are superb... The company has some 50 programmes being developed for new vaccines and new therapies.\n\n\"Moderna has changed the world and the medical field, and I believe it will continue to do so.\"\n\nAsked at the summit what kept him going and believing in his idea despite the repeated rejections and setbacks, Prof Langer replied: \"I was very lucky that Judah Folkman went through a lot of the same things as I did, where people didn't believe in what he was doing, and yet he kept trying and believing. He was a great role model.\n\n\"In my upbringing, my dad ran a tiny liquor store in Albany (New York), and he worked all the time - another great role model. Maybe some part of it is genetics. I am a really stubborn person.\"\n\nThe summit, organised by the National Research Foundation, was held from Jan 17 to Jan 20. It featured lectures and panel discussions with 21 eminent scientists, including Nobel laureates and winners of the Millennium Technology Prize, awarded by independent foundation Technology Academy Finland.\n\nLucas Tan\n\nPHARMACEUTICALS SECTOR\n\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 29, 2024, 11:15pm\n\nZyrtec-D no longer available due to health risk concerns\n\nDec 8, 2023, 02:37am\n\nSome shops run out of ART kits as number of Covid-19 cases rises\n\nNov 14, 2022, 09:44am\n\nWatch out for these supplements with potent substances: HSA\n\nOct 31, 2022, 12:01pm\n\nIndonesia revokes firms' fever syrup licences amid probe into 150 deaths\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/31427bcdc9ff6bc0e0623fe4e6f948e01926f482cc1ba6f0a71b59a4f395e9b7/robert20langer2028129_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Professor Robert Langer founded or co-founded 41 companies, notably being the co-founder of Moderna in 2010. \n", "caption": "Professor Robert Langer founded or co-founded 41 companies, notably being the co-founder of Moderna in 2010.

Monday's figure also was around 20 percent lower than the number logged a week earlier.\n\nThe country added 30 Covid-19 deaths, bringing the death toll to 33,420. The number of critically ill patients came to 402, down from 420 the previous day, the KDCA said.\n\nIn May, South Korea\n\nlifted the outdoor mask mandate\n\nin a major step toward supporting people's return to normalcy.\n\nAs mask requirements were eased, confusion lingered among students, teachers and workers demanding accurate and detailed guidelines for schools and workplaces.\n\nA second grade elementary school student named Lee Sang-hyun who lives in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, has never experienced mask-free school life as he entered elementary school during the pandemic. He said: \"I will keep wearing masks because I think it will be dangerous. I've been used to it for two years, so it's not that uncomfortable.\"\n\nSome teachers said there won't be a dramatic change at schools as some students, especially those in teenage groups, have not been following the rules from months before.\n\n\"This easing of mask obligations doesn't feel like such a dramatic change,\" said Ms Jang Hwa-kyung, a high-school teacher in Incheon, adding that she thinks it is about time to ease the regulations.\n\n\"In the early days of Covid-19, children followed the rules, but as time went by, their awareness decreased. As I recall, the mask mandate has not been strictly followed since last summer,\" she said, adding that there are many obstacles to fully monitoring her students.\n\n\"Teachers can make students wear masks during class time, but honestly, it is impossible to keep it that way during break times.

An association of private institutes in Gangnam recommended the students to wear masks by February.\n\nA teacher at DaechiPL Academy in Gangnam-gu said that opinions are divided among teachers. \"Some teachers say they will encourage everyone to wear masks, while others say they will only ask children with cold symptoms to wear it. But as it is not an obligation anymore, it will be hard to enforce if children resist.\"\n\nHe also hinted that to adolescents, masks are sometimes considered a way to cover one's face rather than as a protective measure against the virus. \"Some children said they would keep wearing masks to cover their faces because they are worried about their appearance, aside from Covid-19,\" he said. - THE KOREA HERALD/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nSouth Korea to require Covid-19 tests for HK, Macau travellers; new Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 detected\n\nSouth Korea’s education success is faltering in evolving economy: Report\n\nSouth Korea\n\ncovid-19\n\nPrimary School\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 28, 2025, 01:14am\n\nWoman left in vegetative state by botched procedure returns to S'pore\n\nJan 13, 2025, 09:32am\n\nFans wait 7 hours in the rain for (G)I-dle's Minnie at Chagee opening\n\nDec 31, 2024, 02:48am\n\nWhy is there a concrete wall near the end of Muan Airport runway?\n\nDec 29, 2024, 11:41pm\n\nGrief fills Muan Airport as families wait for victims to be identified\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e0807fa63ffa485cf398f6c8a13af3dc84d7a65a11da51faa3775feddb649c7e/2023-01-30T042609Z1534755381RC2R0Z9XPH5NRTRMADP3HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-SOUTHKOREA.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Starting Monday, people can visit most places, including schools, kindergartens and gyms, without masks.", "caption": "Starting Monday, people can visit most places, including schools, kindergartens and gyms, without masks.

It was the three-year-old's first start on turf, having finished second in three Polytrack outings.\n\nST PHOTO: SHAHRIYA YAHAYA\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 29, 2023, 03:26pm\n\nItalian Revolution runs riot\n\nBridesmaid's tag is shed as Baertschiger's three-year-old finally goes one better\n\nShare this article\n\nAfter knocking on the door for a while, Italian Revolution finally broke through for his first hurrah on Saturday.\n\nA first test on grass proved to be the winning formula, even if the Caravaggio three-year-old was no slouch on Polytrack, as evidenced by his three seconds from as many starts.\n\nBut, convinced that turf is still his strongest suit, trainer Shane Baertschiger must have felt vindicated when the on-pace galloper led from barrier to box in the $75,000 Restricted Maiden race over 1,200m.\n\n\"I was looking for a first run on turf for him at the last meeting in 2022, but he couldn't get a run. He's better on turf,\" said the Australian.\n\n\"But he's actually beaten by some pretty good horses at his three starts, especially that handy horse (Mykyta) at his last start.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nBesides a surface switch, a change of pilot was the other new element thrown into the equation.\n\nBut again, Baertschiger qualified that the booking of top jockey Vlad Duric in lieu of stable rider Matthew Kellady was purely tactical.\n\n\"Matty did nothing wrong on this horse, but he's had three chances on him. So I thought I'd give Vlad a try and see how we go,\" he said.\n\nThe four-time Singapore champion jockey modestly played down his contribution, though, bouncing off all the credit to the conveyance he was legged up on.\n\n\"Shane has been wanting to take a seat with this horse for a while. But not today, as it was a small field,\" said the Australian hoop.\n\n\"He stood there for a long time, but he sprung the gates very well. He controlled the race and had no pressure.\n\n\"He was good today, he pricked his ears, so I had plenty of horse. But, if there is some pressure in front, he can be vulnerable.\n\n\"Going forward, he can also sit off a high-pressure race as he has a good turn of foot.\n\n\"But I think he's just a sprinting type. He's a neat horse who will win plenty of races.\"\n\nDuric has seldom been seen since racing resumed on Jan 7, with Italian Revolution being only his sixth ride.\n\nBut, as the heavyweight rider cannot cut his arm off, he has learned how to make the best out of a weighty situation.\n\n\"After six weeks off (during the December break), I struggle with my weight at my age, but I chipped away,\" he said philosophically.\n\n\"Those good horses come up now and again, though, and I'm happy to get my fair share of winners.\"\n\nPicking and choosing quality rides that fit his weight range is one thing, but he still has to steer them home.\n\nHe duly turned up with a copybook front-running ride on Italian Revolution.\n\nThough the $8 favourite was not out like a scalded cat at barrier rise, Duric just had to bustle him up for that perfectly dosed early burst to find the front.\n\nOnce the rail was secured, the pair enjoyed a soft lead, even with debutants Nimbus Cloud (Krisna Thangamani) and Star Express (Louis-Philippe Beuzelin) three abreast for most of the way.\n\nWith the other fancies like Diaz (Manoel Nunes) and Tantheman (Wong Chin Chuen) not making their presence felt in the straight, it was left to the leading trio to fill the trifecta.\n\nItalian Revolution strolled in virtually uncontested with 2¼ lengths to spare from Nimbus Cloud. Star Express stuck on for third, another ½-length away.\n\nThe winning time was 1min 11.03sec for the 1,200m on the long course.\n\nDuric was right on the money again on the Stephen Gray-trained Prioritize ($16) in the $30,000 Class 5 race over the Poly 1,700m, for a riding double from only four rides.\n\nBaertschiger was incidentally opening his account for 2023, aptly with a new charge shedding his maiden status for a loyal customer of his.\n\n\"MA Racing is my biggest supporter. It's good to get a winner for them early,\" said Baertschiger, who has trained Group winners Bestothelign, Faaltless and Nepean for the local outfit.\n\n\"I got this horse as a yearling for only A$70,000 ($65,300) in Melbourne. I think he's won over $80,000 now, so he's paid for himself, and whatever he does from now on is a bonus.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d51a2e31db68b470b863c146338b336e16614743590fed84145eddb8d2a18bed/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Italian Revolution (Vlad Duric) leading from pillar to post to give trainer Shane Baertschiger his first winner for 2023.

But the point now is that we need to set aside a time of reflection.\"\n\nShe goes on, speaking to the viewer: \"Guys who just collected your O-level results, you are more than your results, all right?\"\n\nShe even plugs her social media account: \"Stay tuned for what happens after O levels.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 24, 2025, 12:59am\n\nThose who were hit as kids are more willing to physically punish their own children: S'pore study\n\nMore related stories\n\nThough she tried to focus on a positive message at the end, many netizens felt she had crossed the line. Some slammed her for being disingenuous in consoling her daughter when at her most vulnerable, while others suggested she was exploiting the moment for social media likes.\n\nView post on TikTok\n\n@sarahxmiracle\n\n#miraclefamilie\n\n#holdup\n\n#players\n\n#coileray\n\n#momlife\n\n#momof4\n\n#momsoftiktok\n\n#bigfamily\n\n♬ Players - DJ Smallz 732 - Jersey Club Remix - Coi Leray\n\nThe new social media mum\n\nTo be fair, while the Singaporean singer-songwriter's social media presence is centred around her family content, it rarely involves embarrassing moments of her children.\n\nHer daughter was also quick to post a video rebutting the idea that she had been used as \"crying bait\" by her mother, which went some way to assuage concerns that the teenager had been filmed without her consent entirely.\n\nBut the episode begged the question of whether children, even in innocent and non-embarrassing situations, should be used for social media content. After all, all over the Internet, many mumfluencers (a hybrid term that refers to mums who are social media influencers), and sometimes dad influencers, have grown their following by posting pictures of their children.\n\n\"The rise of mum/mom/mommy bloggers has been a worldwide trend, with some mum bloggers now earning a significant income from their personal 'brand' and role as social media influencers,\" wrote Dr Catherine Archer, a senior lecturer specialising in social media and strategic communication at Edith Cowan University, in 2019 in the Media International Australia journal.\n\nOne well-known example is Californian photographer Laura Izumikawa (@lauraiz), who found Internet fame by posting cute shots of her sleeping daughter Joey dressed as pop culture icons and celebrities.\n\nOf course, influencers are not the only people to post photos of their children. Social media is awash with pictures and videos of babies and toddlers, many obviously too young to give consent or know what consent means.\n\nPerhaps it's easy to get caught up in the sharing frenzy. Many of us can forget about boundaries.\n\nFor one thing, where is the line? A photo of your baby in a diaper looks cute, but what about a photo of a toddler who is potty training, or a child taking a bubble bath? Such photos are ripe for exploitation and could be used in ways beyond your control.\n\nIn 2020, Ms Amanda Morgan found photos of her then six-month-old daughter taken from her Facebook and Instagram pages and shared on websites featuring paedophile content. Lurking on the Internet are all kinds of danger - voyeurs, predators and other unsavoury characters.\n\nAnd since what goes on the Internet stays on the Internet, even deleting the photo after experiencing \"posting remorse\" does not preclude the possibility that someone has already saved the picture on his desktop and is storing it away for some nefarious use some time in the future.\n\nHow social media replaced conversations\n\nWith social media, we live a large part of our lives in a public space. We can easily sleepwalk into oversharing, without realising the content we share can compromise the privacy of others, beyond our immediate family circle.\n\nThere are people who feel compelled to post when they quarrel with their partners or while waiting for their parents to be treated at the accident and emergency department.\n\nAnd when there is a stranger misbehaving or a child having a meltdown on the MRT, many automatically click record and share the video of the incident with others, with no regard for the person whose behaviour might be caused by deeper problems, a mental illness or developmental disorders.\n\nWhy then do we still continue with such thoughtless actions?\n\nDr Brandon Koh, an industrial-organisational psychologist and lecturer at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, has an inkling. He said in a blog post on the university's website that social media provides people with \"a shroud of anonymity, lowering the barrier to initiate or participate in public shaming\", and \"magnifies the reach of such public-shaming acts to a wider audience\".\n\nSo is Cheng-De Winne comforting her daughter after her O levels a private moment requiring a more human response, not to be shared with faceless followers? Perhaps.\n\nWhen dealing with stress, pain and heartbreak, time is needed for wounds to heal. Turning the experience into social media fodder can interrupt this crucial healing process.\n\nIs it that we have forgotten how to connect with others without using our phones? If so, how will our children learn to cope with the complicated feelings they might go through in times of conflict, loss and distress - apart from picking up the instinct to pick up a phone and broadcast them to others? Would posting a Stitch to their video on TikTok help them deal with their emotional needs?\n\nNot living for the likes\n\nSocial media has rewired the way we communicate and process our emotions, so it's understandable that digital natives want to document moments of the day.\n\nIndeed, from food to love to travel, we seem to be unable to live life to the fullest without our smartphones and data plans. Our camera \"eats\" before us as we snap photos of our lunch before digging into it, and our holidays are spent chasing Instagrammable moments.\n\nBut by living for the \"Likes\" and \"Share\" instead of for the moment, are we becoming more detached from the actual experience?\n\nChildren are being initiated into this world much sooner. A global study by international think-tank DQ Institute in 2018 showed that 85 per cent of Singapore children aged eight to 12 are active on social media. I have friends whose children as young as three or four are allowed to scroll through TikTok videos. While children cannot be totally protected from online dangers, parents can take the lead and set a good example by demonstrating healthy social media habits.\n\nFirst, show how we can live outside our smartphones and social media. Take the time to help your child communicate better and learn how to have a heartfelt conversation and establish meaningful connections.\n\nSecond, when posting on social media, consider what content is worth posting, and set boundaries on what you share publicly, especially photos that feature any form of nudity or show your children or other people in vulnerable situations, and make that distinction clear to your children.\n\nWhen they are old enough, get your children involved in the decision to post content. As they get older, they might develop an informed attitude towards social media, with a perspective on how to regulate their exposure, resist the pressures of comparison that come with its use, and establish a healthy relationship with it.\n\nDear parents, think before you post that picture or video. Instead of capturing the moment for the world, why not relish the moment and savour that rare experience of being with your daughter as she goes through a rite of passage, such as the pivotal moment when collecting O-level results? Surely, this special bonding moment is worth more than likes and shares.\n\n*Annie Tan is a mother of two and a freelance writer who writes on women's issues.\n\nAnnie Tan\n\nparenting\n\nsocial media\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 16, 2025, 08:55am\n\nDad's emotional support after her mum's death helps taekwondo champ fly high\n\nMar 27, 2025, 10:40am\n\nParents to get 6 weeks shared leave for babies born on or after April 1\n\nMar 23, 2025, 12:00am\n\n'I needed to protect her against dark thoughts': Father of 5, whose wife had postnatal depression\n\nMar 22, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nMore fathers in Singapore seeking help for postnatal depression\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6aab16928a46bd6f2af0bd3172e946390f532c46269e1487fce08fe13b4a0bc4/acbabiesvid220123.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Social media is awash with pictures and videos of babies and toddlers, many obviously too young to give consent. \n", "caption": "Social media is awash with pictures and videos of babies and toddlers, many obviously too young to give consent.

Only my team and family know what we have been through in the last four or five weeks and this is why I'd probably say this is the biggest victory in my life, considering the circumstances,\" added Djokovic, who was more emotional than usual.\n\nThere had been an air of inevitability about Djokovic triumphing again. After his three-year ban from Australia was lifted, he won the lead-up Adelaide International before reinforcing his status as an all-time great in Melbourne.\n\nHis dominant win drew him level with Nadal on a record 22 Slams, two clear of the now-retired Roger Federer. The Spaniard made a second-round exit with a hip injury, one of a series of shocks which upended the men's and women's draws during the first Major of the year.\n\n\"I guess we always find the A-game on the Slams,\" Djokovic said, of equalling his old rival Nadal. \"This is what I feel both Nadal and myself probably still fight for.\n\n\"It is still what motivates us the most, winning the biggest titles in our sport and trying to keep up with the young guns.\"\n\n\"Tennis is in good hands,\" he added. \"But we're still not going anywhere.\"\n\nNadal and Djokovic have won 16 of the last 19 Slams. The 36-year-old Spaniard though is set to slide down the rankings when they are released on Monday, in contrast to Djokovic. The Serb will dethrone Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz and return to world No. 1 for the first time since June 2022. Tsitsipas will climb one place to third.\n\nBoth men were back on a court that helped them rise to stardom.\n\nCheck out this tweet!\n\nlink\n\nJanuary 29, 2023\n\nDjokovic won his first Grand Slam in 2008 on Rod Laver Arena while Tsitsipas burst on the scene in 2019 when he stunned defending champion Federer in the last 16.\n\nMoving freely with only minimal strapping on his troublesome left hamstring, Djokovic opened with a comfortable hold after being greeted by huge cheers.\n\nHe worked two break points on Tsitsipas's opening serve, to no avail, but kept probing and the Greek handed him a break for 3-1 with a careless double fault. Tsitsipas, 24, in only his second Grand Slam final to Djokovic's 33rd, appeared nervous, losing the first set.\n\nBut he battled back into contention in a much closer second set as his confidence grew, earning his first break point - and set point - when Djokovic blasted a backhand wide.\n\nBut the Serb clung on to keep the set on serve and it went to a tiebreak, where his greater experience roared to the fore.\n\nAgainst the odds, Tsitsipas broke for the first time on Djokovic's opening serve in set three, only to relinquish the advantage immediately after a gripping rally.\n\nIt again went to a tiebreak, where Djokovic once again raised a level.\n\nNovak Djokovic (right) shaking hands with Stefanos Tsitsipas after winning the final match at the Australian Open on Jan 29, 2023.

I don't think there's any reason for me to be affected by today's loss.\"\n\n\"It is a step forward. I'm looking forward to scoring more points during this season, making bigger results, fighting for bigger trophies.\"\n\nHe added: \"Getting our asses kicked is for sure a very good lesson every single time... I don't see any reason to be lowering my expectations or my goals.\n\n\"I am born a champion.

Here is a look at some of them:\n\nPenny stock crash masterminds John Soh Chee Wen and Quah Su-Ling\n\nJohn Soh Chee Wen and Quah Su-Ling were found guilty of market manipulation that led to the October 2013 penny stock crash that wiped $8 billion in market capitalisation from the Singapore Exchange.\n\nThe duo had manipulated the share prices of three investment companies: Blumont Group, Asiasons Capital and LionGold Corp.\n\nSoh and Quah had engaged in \"wash trading\" - a form of market manipulation in which a trader buys and sells a stock simultaneously. This creates an illusion of demand and artificially inflates the price of the stock.\n\nThe case was described as the \"most serious case of stock manipulation in Singapore\" by the prosecution.\n\nOn Dec 28, 2022, Soh was sentenced to 36 years' imprisonment, while Quah was sentenced to 20 years' jail.\n\nFormer Agritrade CFO Lim Beng Kim\n\nLim Beng Kim, former chief financial officer of commodities trader Agritrade International, defrauded over a dozen banks, causing almost US$500 million in losses.\n\nAccording to the charge sheets, Lim deceived 16 financial institutions into believing that financial statements for Agritrade and its units were audited.\n\nShe also instructed her subordinate to insert a copy of the auditor's signature into a document that was falsely claimed to be the audited statements.\n\nOn Jan 17, 2023, she was sentenced to 20 years' jail for her crime.\n\nOver a dozen individuals linked to the Shell oil heist\n\nMore than a dozen individuals were arrested after a series of raids uncovered the theft of about US$150 million worth of oil from Shell's biggest global refinery over several years.\n\nThe Shell oil heist involved around 340,000 tonnes of gas oil that was siphoned from the oil major's Pulau Bukom site in Singapore, in incidents dating back to 2014.\n\nProsecutors described it as the largest and most sophisticated marine gas oil heist in Singapore's history.\n\nThe Shell oil heist involved at least three former Shell employees, and 12 former surveyors who took bribes to conceal the crime.\n\nFormer Shell employee Juandi Pungot was jailed for 29 years in March 2022 for siphoning nearly $128 million worth of gas oil, while another key player, Tiah Kok Hwee, was sentenced to over 16 years' jail.\n\nSouth-east Asia is a hot spot for illicit fuel trading, with its island-dotted waters providing cover for small-scale smuggling of oil products across borders. But the regularity and audacity of the thefts at Shell's refining facility - some of which took place during working hours - made it stand out.\n\nFormer Asia Pacific Breweries (APB) finance manager Chia Teck Leng\n\nThe authorities estimated that Chia Teck Leng lost $62 million feeding his gambling habit. PHOTO: SINGAPORE POLICE FORCE\n\nFormer APB executive Chia Teck Leng used his position as finance manager to swindle four foreign banks out of $117 million from 1999 to 2003. Only $34.8 million was recovered.\n\nAt the time, the case was Singapore's biggest involving commercial fraud.\n\nChia had been a compulsive gambler, and secretly led a double life as a high-rolling hustler with a lavish lifestyle. The authorities estimated that he lost $62 million feeding his gambling habit.\n\nChia submitted forged documents to open accounts in APB's name, with himself as the sole signatory. He transferred money drawn from three of the accounts into a fourth, and then transferred the funds to his two personal accounts.\n\nIn 2004, he was sentenced to 42 years in jail - the longest for a case of commercial fraud.\n\nSunshine Empire's James Phang Wah\n\nJames Phang Wah swindled some 20,000 Singaporeans of nearly $190 million through a Ponzi scheme. PHOTO: SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS\n\nSunshine Empire owner James Phang Wah swindled some 20,000 Singaporeans of nearly $190 million through a Ponzi scheme from 2006 to 2007.\n\nThe scheme, which promised high yields through the company's investment plan, tricked victims into purchasing nearly 26,000 \"lifestyle packages\" costing anywhere from $240 to $12,000.\n\nSunshine Empire paid earlier investors using the money paid up by new investors in what became Singapore's biggest Ponzi scheme.\n\nOf the huge sums paid to the company, only $21 million was recovered.\n\nPhang was sentenced to nine years' jail and a $60,000 fine.\n\nBarings Bank's Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson\n\nNick Leeson was caught in Germany and eventually extradited to Singapore, where he was sentenced to 6½ years in prison. PHOTO: ST FILE\n\nSingapore-based derivatives trader Nick Leeson brought down Britain's oldest merchant bank, Barings Bank, in 1995 after betting on Japanese stock and bond derivatives - and covering up the huge losses when the bets failed.\n\nIt was estimated at the time that Leeson, who wrote the book Rogue Trader about his experience, incurred losses amounting to US$1.3 billion.\n\nThe scale of those losses came as a shock to Barings and regulators. Their failure to salvage the crisis led to Barings' eventual collapse.\n\nBefore the full scale of his crimes was exposed, Leeson fled Singapore. This sparked a global pursuit of around a week, before he was caught in Germany.\n\nHe was later extradited to Singapore, where he was sentenced to 6½ years in prison. - THE BUSINESS TIMES\n\nBernadette Toh\n\nSINGAPORE COMPANIES\n\nFINANCIAL CRIMES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2f83ff3b029048e71f0c6bb9acec4fd6daa9d0aa1c762c691bc4620b32bd06cd/imgjohnsohqsl218m1choj_7.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "John Soh Chee Wen and Quah Su-Ling were found guilty of market manipulation that led to the October 2013 penny stock crash. \n", "caption": "John Soh Chee Wen and Quah Su-Ling were found guilty of market manipulation that led to the October 2013 penny stock crash.

Back on the Poly, a repeat will see her go close again. (5) PIXIE IN LOVE ran well last start with blinkers off. The filly has a chance if she stays. (7) GIMME A DREAM is better than his last run suggests. The gelding has shown some improvement first-up on the Poly. (4) SALIENT POINT was a close third at long odds last time. He has fair Poly form.\n\nRace 2 (2,000m)\n\n(5) HEY BILL is consistent and was a beaten favourite against stronger rivals last time. The drop in class should see him home first. (2) RICCARDO finished a neck behind Hey Bill. Slightly better off on weights, he will go close again. (4) QUESTION MASTER is way better than his last effort indicates. He goes well for jockey Jason Gates. (1) LORD MINVER is never far back and has a light weight. He loves the Poly.\n\nRace 3 (1,600m)\n\n(4) CORSICAN looks the obvious choice. He has been consistent on the Poly and is distance suited. He will not get a beater chance to shed his maiden status. Stablemate (1) MISTER LINCOLN started at long odds in his sprint debut and was a well-beaten third. Stepping up to a more suitable trip and with improvement, he is the biggest threat. (2) DUKE OF AFRICA is lightly raced and is back after a short break. His best form has been on the Poly and he would not be a surprise winner. (6) LAW COURT is also lightly raced but has shown some ability. The Poly could suit.\n\nRace 4 (1,000m)\n\n(5) ADDIENA won very well over the course and distance last start. She got a six-point rise in handicap but that should not stop her from scoring again. There will be a good pace on from the jump with stable companions (6) MAGICALLEE and (1) PUFF OF SMOKE in the race. Puff Of Smoke has come good and has stable rider Kabelo Matsunyane aboard with a handy weight. (2) RUSSIAN DOLL has yet to finish out of the money in four starts. Her best form is on the Poly. Although giving weight to all, she is the class horse and should put in another good effort.\n\nRace 5 (1,400m)\n\n(3) CRESTED EAGLE has not finished far behind in his recent outings. With a big drop in class, the gelding appears the one to beat with apprentice jockey Rachel Venniker's 1.5kg claim. (1) ALLAROUNDTHEWORLD is consistent but finally shed his maiden tag only at his last outing. He looks capable of scoring again now that he has struck winning form. (4) JUSTFORTHEEPENNY has been dropping in the handicap and is overdue for another win. This is his best trip. (7) GIAMBATTISTA comes from a very much in-form stable. Having won over this course and distance, he cannot be left out of any calculations.\n\nRace 6 (1,400m)\n\n(3) MOVIE MAGIC found traffic last run but his form before that was solid. The gelding is best over this course and trip. (5) MAC HARDY was disappointing last run but now gets blinkers to spark him up. Lightly raced, he could still have more to come. (7) QUIZ MASTER has been knocking on the door and is better off on weights with (4) CAPETOWN AFFAIR for a length's beating. There should be very little between the two.\n\nRace 7 (1,700m)\n\n(4) ZAKHO was an impressive maiden winner when tried on the Poly and is returning from a short break. He stays the trip and looks progressive. (3) ICE KINGDOM took time to get off the mark but both his recent wins were on the Poly, with two turf runs separating. He takes another step up in trip and a drop in class. (1) BARBATTI shed his maiden tag last run. He is up in trip but has shown before that he could stay the extra distance. (9) LOU LOU THE LEGEND is lightly raced and is having his second after a break.

Both have since changed ownership, with Hamama even transferred to Mahadi Taib.\n\nPairing off from a long way out, the eye-balling duo gave each other no quarter well into the Polytrack home straight.\n\nBoth could be vulnerable to a swooper but neither buckled under pressure, even if they were running on fumes.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nAs Simon Kok upped the ante on Qaidoom, Hamama matched her grey challenger stride for stride under Saifudin Ismail's urgings.\n\nIt was only inside the last 100m that the war of attrition finally unveiled a winner.\n\nQaidoom slowly gained the ascendancy as a gallant Hamama eventually surrendered to the even-money favourite to run sixth, creditably less than two lengths astern.\n\nLim's Craft (A'Isisuhairi Kasim) and Hyde Park (Jerlyn Seow) pounced late but they could not lower the boom on Qaidoom.\n\nA neck split the Pacific Stable's new acquisition and Lim's Craft, with Hyde Park third, another ½-length away. The winner clocked 59.49sec for the 1,000m on the all-weather track.\n\nWith Clements away at the Karaka yearling sale in New Zealand, assistant trainer Michael \"Chopsy\" White was on hand to lead in the yard's sixth winner that cemented their current first place on the log.\n\n\"She is a bread-and-butter speedy mare and she's got down to the right weight in the handicap,\" said the Australian.\n\n\"The owners have started to invest heavily in horses. They want to become big players.\n\n\"This mare has come up for sale and she fitted the bill, even if she's no star.\"\n\nWith Qaidoom's two previous wins recorded on debut in Open Maiden company and in a Class 5 event, White was keeping things in perspective.\n\n\"I think she's just a genuine Class 4 1,000m type,\" he said.\n\n\"It'll be harder for her now as she may end going up and down in the ratings.\"\n\nKok said the win might not have looked pretty but he had to think on his feet when Plan A did not come off.\n\n\"I discussed with Clements before he left, and Chopsy in the parade ring. They both told me she was a mare who likes to go forward,\" said the Malaysian jockey.\n\n\"We studied the form and thought Hamama would be up there, and to track her up in second.\n\n\"But my horse began so well. I tried to make her come back but she was always working onto the bridle.\n\n\"Hamama set a very fast pace. I was happy to sit on the outside but I didn't want to use my horse too much.\n\n\"But at the 450m, I was a bit worried when she hit a flat spot. I had to ride her hands and heels to hold my position.\n\n\"She then kicked clear but, in the last 50m, Lim's Craft was coming in fast. Luckily, she stayed on well to the line and we hung on.\n\n\"I'm lucky enough to have got a winner at my first ride for the owners. They have a lot of quality horses coming up.\n\n\"CC (Wong Chin Chuen) rides most of their horses but I pick up whatever I can.\n\n\"I've now ridden three winners all up. So I can't complain with the way my season has gone so far.\"\n\nThe day's riding honours were shared between Kranji's current leading hoops, Wong and last year's title holder and four-time Singapore champion Manoel Nunes, both well clear of the rest.\n\nWong scored aboard Big Day, Star Empire and Nineoneone while Nunes hit back with Aftermath, War Pride and Takhi.\n\nThey are tied on 11 winners, with Nunes keeping the yellow jersey on a countback for seconds.\n\nSaturday's Singapore Results:\n\nsares29.pd\n\nf\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a72851a407dffadadc9a69f706fe147da448f0657906f1b57a2b23827f067cd7/unnamed_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Qaidoom (Simon Kok) holding her rivals at bay in the Class 4 event over the Polytrack 1,000m in Race 11 on Saturday.

The Smart Missile three-year-old trialled thrice before that for another third and a second.\n\nPHOTO: STC\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 27, 2023, 09:38pm\n\nTantheman, not the name Tan meant, but it will do\n\nThunder Man or otherwise, Kranji trainer is unfazed; he just hopes horse goes boom\n\nShare this article\n\nLocal trainer Jerome Tan is well known around Kranji for his great sense of humour.\n\nWhen a new horse he owns and trains was recently unveiled as Tantheman, it is not hard to imagine how he would have been the target of some light banter.\n\nBut as much as the Singaporean has a jocular side, even the slightly chest-thumping namesake seemed out of character to his media-shy nature.\n\nIt turned out Tantheman was never the name he had intended to register the Smart Missile three-year-old as.\n\nFans might be disappointed, but Tan does not harbour illusions of grandeur or dreams of himself in spandex.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nAs is sometimes the case, a simple admin error was the culprit, and phonetics the root cause.\n\n\"I wanted to call him Thunder Man, but somehow, the officer heard wrongly and wrote his name down as Tantheman,\" said Tan.\n\n\"By the time I found out, it was too late to change. So I decided to leave it as Tantheman.\"\n\nWhether Thunder Man has a nicer ring than Tantheman is a case for conjecture, but this is how the A$20,000 (S$18,600) purchase as a yearling will now be known as.\n\nAfter all, horses cannot spell, and if they are to take the racing scene by storm, it does not really matter if they are named Thunder, Trigger or Tumbleweed.\n\nBesides, the racing world has hatched many happy endings to such typo-induced misnamed horses.\n\nAmerican Pharoah, the 2015 US Triple Crown winner, is a famous case in point. The misspelling of \"Pharoah\" (instead of Pharaoh) also arose through an inadvertent mistake.\n\nTan has graciously moved on from the \"Thunder Blunder\" - so long it was not a mistake made at the sale ring of the Inglis HTBA Yearling Sale in Sydney in 2021.\n\n\"I really liked the horse. He had a nice conformation,\" he said.\n\n\"I got him as a yearling for A$20,000. In the end I kept him for myself.\"\n\nTan had to wrap his new ward up in cotton wool for a while, though.\n\n\"He had some issues when he came, he had a stress fracture. That's why he took a little longer to get ready,\" he said.\n\n\"But he's very well now. I was very happy with his trials.\n\n\"I think he will run a good race. He's got a chance.\"\n\nThe top of the market of the $75,000 Restricted Maiden race over 1,200m on Saturday is likely to be hogged by Italian Revolution and debutant Diaz, while, interestingly enough, the other horse who may \"steal the thunder\" is another newbie who goes by the name of Thunder Hero.\n\nIn-form jockey Wong Chin Chuen, who was aboard at all of Tantheman's four barrier trials, keeps the reins.\n\nRunner-up to Manoel Nunes in 2022, Wong shares the same number of winners (eight) as the Brazilian, but the Malaysian hoop sits in second place on a countback for seconds.\n\nOn the other hand, Tan, who finished mid-table in 2022 with a decent haul of 24 winners, has yet to get on the scoresheet after three meetings.\n\nThe 55-year-old, who relocated to his home turf in 2019 after cutting his teeth as a trainer in Penang for 10 years, will be banking on either Tantheman or his other two runners Big Day ($30,000 Class 5 race over 1,400m) and Savvy Command ($50,000 Class 4 race over 1,000m) to break the deadlock as soon as possible.\n\nIn 2022, he had to wait for two months before he led in his first winner Sacred Gift on March 5. When it rains it pours, though. Tan racked up 10 more winners in the next eight weeks.\n\nTan does not dwell on the past, but would rather look ahead instead.\n\nHe is currently taking care of the future at the New Zealand Bloodstock's 2023 National Yearling Sale, which takes place in Karaka from Sunday to Tuesday.\n\n\"I haven't seen anything yet. Hopefully, I can find a nice horse,\" he said.\n\nIf he does, he may well get another chance of getting his Thunder Man for real this time.\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ec1f48fe2747733629bf0bd02f593de60859b5516d8b7b48d9a365c6118e9f01/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Tantheman (Wong Chin Chuen, No. 4) finishing third to Sirbring Colt in a barrier trial on Jan 17.

They chatted normally initially, but the girl soon became annoyed with Teo for teasing her, and she blocked him from contacting her on the platform.\n\nSome months later, Teo messaged her on Instagram and asked her to meet him. She initially refused, but Teo persisted and she relented.\n\nNothing out of the ordinary happened during their first meeting, but when they went to watch a movie a few days later, Teo asked her to perform a sex act on him. She was 11 or 12 years old then.\n\nDespite her refusal, Teo unzipped his trousers and exposed himself.\n\nAs she walked out of the cinema in anger, Teo followed her and apologised, offering to take her home. On their way to her home in a taxi, Teo tried to get the girl to touch him again.\n\nSome time in October 2020, Teo contacted the girl, who was 13 by then, and offered her $100 to send him naked photos of herself, but she refused.\n\nHe then offered her $150 to expose herself on video, and she agreed to it. During the video call, Teo, who was also exposing himself, recorded the video without the girl's knowledge.\n\nOn Jan 17, 2021, at about 3.30pm, Teo called the older sister, then 15, and asked if she wanted to be friends with him. He kept quiet when she asked who he was before he started moaning and making other sexual noises.\n\nWhen the girl ended the call, Teo asked her in a message if she wanted to see his penis. She ignored the message. He then told her about his exchange with her sister and sent her a recording of the conversation.\n\nThe older sister then spoke to her sister and told their mother about Teo. The mother made a police report.\n\nTeo was arrested in his home on Jan 24, 2021, and officers found a thumb drive containing 502 pornographic videos, 354 of which were related to child abuse.\n\nWhile he was out on bail, Teo joined a WhatsApp group that was created to let students from a girls' school talk about their school life.\n\nHe found the group through a link on a social media profile page and sent lewd messages to several girls whose numbers he had obtained via the chat.\n\nTeo will return to court on March 10 for sentencing.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/32af7b2e3239da53c0b05d38ab2fcdd14a8d5ace2bb13754f76a4d21345c11bb/ac1i792520copy_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Teo Jun How pleaded guilty to nine charges on Friday.

The Thai vendors come from different provinces and 30 of them will operate food stalls.\n\nFor instance, visitors can tuck into Thai kway chap from Lopburi province in central Thailand, cha chak (Thai teh tarik) from Satun province in southern Thailand and Thai otah from Phrachuap Khiri Khan, a town in western Thailand. The otah come in flavours of crab, prawn, fish and squid.\n\nThere will also be 50 food stalls run by local vendors selling Thai fare such as moo ping (Thai grilled pork skewers), boat noodles, grilled giant river prawns and coconut shake.\n\nChatuchak Night Market Singapore is not officially linked to Bangkok's Chatuchak Weekend Market, but 20 of the Thai vendors are from there, including King Octopus, which sells grilled baby octopus.\n\nSome of the Thai vendors were last in Singapore in 2020 for the inaugural edition, which launched on Feb 4 with 200 stalls and was originally slated to run until May 3 that year. But the market had to be prematurely closed in March because of Covid-19 restrictions.\n\n(Clockwise from left) Cha chak (Thai teh tarik), Thai otah from Prachuap Khiri Khan and Thai kway chap from Lopburi province. PHOTOS: CHATUCHAK SG\n\nMr Keith Tay, 40, the company director of event organiser Chatuchak Sg, says he incurred financial losses then, but declined to disclose the amount. But in the last three years, he had always hoped to bring the event back.\n\nWhen pandemic measures were eased in Singapore, he started planning six months ago. He made four trips to Thailand to source for vendors and iron out the logistics and accommodation for them.\n\nHe says: \"Even though travel restrictions have been lifted and many Singaporeans have visited Thailand in the last few months, the Thai food we have here is still limited. The night market will feature popular Thai food that is not commonly available here.\"\n\nDishes include leng saap moo (spicy pork spine ribs) and luk chup, a Thai marzipan dessert shaped like miniature fruit.\n\nChatuchak Night Market Singapore\n\nWhere\n\n: The Grandstand, 200 Turf Club Road\n\nWhen:\n\nFeb 7 to April 2\n\nOpen\n\n: 4 to 10pm, Tuesdays to Sundays\n\nHedy Khoo\n\nSTFood Online Editor\n\nTHAI FOOD\n\nBangkok\n\nStreet food\n\nflea market\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d6caf707c61301e347a7218f0b4874051ff20452be38cc8555f5a9e01f71e611/2.20chatuchak20night20market_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The open-air night market will feature 180 vendors, of which 60 are from Thailand. \n", "caption": "The open-air night market will feature 180 vendors, of which 60 are from Thailand.

Expect him to roll forward and, if he remains unchallenged, it would not surprise to see him prove very difficult to reel in. 4 All Joyful is worth an each-way ticket. He can improve sharply.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\n8 Eason can turn it around here. The step back in trip is more than suitable and chances are he uses the inside draw to roll forward and press for the lead under a light weight. One to beat. 7 Beauty Tycoon is chasing a fourth win from his last five starts. He is still improving and it would not surprise to see him take another step forward here. 1 Ima Single Man is holding his condition and gets 4½ kg taken off with Angus Chung's booking. 5 Power Koepp is doing everything right. Keep safe.\n\nRace 4 (1,200m)\n\n13 Double Show is consistent albeit without registering a win yet. Still he gets another chance and can improve, following his latest effort which saw him travel wide and without cover. 5 Goal Oriented was hardly given a chance on debut in a race that saw the field strung out. He is worth an each-way ticket. 6 Happy For All caught the eye in a recent trial and he must be kept safe with James McDonald hopping up. 4 Further Forward clearly has the necessary ability with Purton booked to ride.\n\nRace 5 (1,650m)\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\n9 Royal Bomb can mix his form at times. He has had several difficult runs this term but the good gate and booking of Jamie Kah will ensure he gets every chance. He can win. 1 Handsome Twelve has a significant class edge over his rivals. He has turned into a dominant force on the dirt and he may well bounce back following his latest effort. 2 True Legend is expected to roll forward and lead. Expect him to take running down from out in front. 13 Beauty Champ is after back-to-back wins. Next best.\n\nRace 6 (1,000m)\n\n10 I Give is steadily coming to hand and chances are he was allowed to press forward by his connections. He has a bit of class and the addition of pacifiers should suit. 4 Innoconstruction surprised on debut with his slashing second. Purton hops on and a repeat of that effort will see him go close. 3 Cheval Valiant gets his shot. 5 Juneau Flash catches the eye. He has the right experience to improve and his pairing with Ryan Moore is a big plus.\n\nRace 7 (1,600m)\n\nTHE STEWARDS' CUP\n\n2 Romantic Warrior was devastating last start over 2,000m in the Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Cup. Not expecting the step back in trip to pose much of a threat, although, perhaps the race map and tempo could challenge him. One to beat. 4 Waikuku always comes good at this time of the season. He is worth taking an each-way ticket on at a big price. 1 Golden Sixty is still brilliant and could easily pinch this one. 3 California Spangle is the likely leader and will remain there a while. Tough race overall.\n\nRace 8 (1,400m)\n\n7 Courier Marvel steps out for his second start. This is not an overly strong race and his debut effort will have done his experience a world of good. Prepared to take a chance on him, especially as he pairs with Alexis Badel. 10 Indigenous Realm can mix his form at times, but has the class when required. 4 Beauty Mission pairs favourably with McDonald. He is so close to a first win. 3 Good News can bounce back. He is much better than what his last-start effort suggests.\n\nRace 9 (1,600m)\n\nTHE HONG KONG CLASSIC MILE\n\nChallenging Hong Kong Classic Mile to kick off the Four-Year-Old Classic Series. Siding with 10 Tuchel who was impressive last start in Class 2 when travelling wide without cover before winning. Expect him to be over the odds. 2 Keefy just keeps on turning up. He will do the same and give this race a big shake. 9 Viva Chaleur has the ability and should be finishing fast once more. 3 Packing Treadmill will put himself on the speed. Purton hops up and this horse has ability to win and must not be underestimated.\n\nRace 10 (1,400m)\n\n7 Stunning Impact is holding his form and he looks well placed. He was caught too far back last time out but to his credit, he managed to close off with merit. One to beat. 1 Amazing Victory has both consistency and the ability to win on his side. Bears close watching on Purton's booking. 6 Copartner Ambition is racing well and has claims. The 4½kg dip in weight with the apprentice aboard holds him in good stead once more. 10 Parterre mixes his form but does have a bit of ability. Keep safe.\n\n(Comments courtesy of  The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7f0f3e8bd83b8d0a755dff1dee9d28e9c45f6ad984c95e37fdb2c53c807595c8/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "James McDonald driving Romantic Warrior to a stellar win in the Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Cup (2,000m) at Sha Tin on Dec 11.

The rats can be seen climbing on top of one another while scrabbling for the air spaces.\n\nTagging Mandai Wildlife Group - which manages the zoo - in its 'public service announcement (PSA)' on Thursday (Jan 26), HSS appealed for more air holes for the rats.\n\nIn its Instagram post, HSS said it was notified of \"a family of more than 20 rats\" under the care of the Singapore Zoo that were \"acting abnormally, putting their noses to breathe through the fine holes and gaps in the edges\" despite living in a large enclosure.\n\n\"At times they can be seen climbing on top of each other to do so,\" HSS added.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:24am\n\n'We cannot halt time': Vet advice on caring for a senior pet\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"The staff explained that the rats were 'looking for fresh air', and as the rats are confined, the staff will open the acrylic box for 30 minutes a day. We think this is not enough! Air is not an option. Air is NECESSITY to live. We hope this gets heard by the appropriate people, who will be able to make immediate changes to rectify this situation.\"\n\nThe post sparked outrage among netizens, with some slamming the zoo for \"cruelty\".\n\nHowever, the behaviour of the rats is \"not uncommon\" as the videos were taken close to feeding time, Mandai Wildlife Group told Stomp in response to queries. All 13 fancy rats, which were born in the Singapore Zoo, are also in good health, it added.\n\nDr Heng Yirui, a veterinarian at Mandai Wildlife Group, said: \"Since being made aware of the social media video circulating about our fancy rats at Singapore Zoo's Rainforest Kidzworld, we conducted an internal review to get to the bottom of what happened.\n\n\"The behaviour of the rats in the video is actually not uncommon because it was taken close to the rats' feeding time.\n\n\"By nature, rats are also highly curious animals and rely on sniffing to investigate and inspect their surroundings. The inquisitive sniffing that is seen in the video is part of how they explore new scents in the environment, including when guests go close to their home.\n\n\"All 13 fancy rats at Rainforest KidzWorld are in good health condition, with no signs of respiratory distress or laboured breathing. None of the rats in the current housing have ever been diagnosed with respiratory issues or any other medical issues relating to poor ventilation for over two years.\n\n\"Animal welfare and care of the animals are not compromised. Nevertheless, we appreciate the care and concern of all netizens who have been following this today.\"\n\nMandai Wildlife Group responding to the Hamster Society's Instagram post.\n\nDr Heng added: \"The exhibit in the video is home to 13 fancy rats and consists of two large connecting chambers, with ample space for the rats to move about. Each of these chambers is also fitted with fans to circulate air and ensure ventilation at all times. The exhibit is also cleaned daily.\"\n\nDr Heng did not directly address a question posed by Stomp about whether it is true that the enclosure is opened for 30 minutes daily.\n\nResponding to queries by Stomp, HSS said its initial concerns were based on the videos it received and comments that zoo staff had supposedly made, particularly about the \"30-minute opening of the enclosure's lid for air\" and that \"the rats were looking for fresh air\".\n\nHSS added: \"As we primarily handle hamsters, their behaviour can differ from rats. While it is not uncommon for animals to push their noses out of holes to sniff exciting smells, they also do that when there is a lack of air, which was why we were concerned.\"\n\nHSS noted that while Mandai Wildlife Group has clarified how the rats have sufficient ventilation, \"the staff's comment about the rats still needing daily lid-off ventilation for 30 minutes was not touched on\".\n\nHSS told Stomp: \"I do believe it was the part that shocked most people.\"\n\nANIMAL WELFARE\n\nSingapore Zoo\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:52am\n\nWill you give Frodo the Singapore Special a fur-ever home?\n\nJun 30, 2025, 09:34am\n\n'It was never smooth sailing': Dog welfare group ex-president reflects on 13 years at the helm\n\nJun 27, 2025, 07:49am\n\nKitten allegedly rolled in container at Tuas adopted, NParks investigating\n\nJun 26, 2025, 06:52am\n\nNParks probing case of kitten allegedly stuffed in container, rolled around\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ac270b278a10ead3292d12d97b5426971e21b656cabe1e448c7252d6416aadd3/ratsmain.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "Mandai Wildlife Group responding to the Hamster Society's Instagram post."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/22b25b4eb2260868a007fc78b4739884d4257c8f6a28018b2dd29ab60861d59c/Azmi-pixgeneric-4.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "'We cannot halt time': Vet advice on caring for a senior pet", "caption": "Mandai Wildlife Group responding to the Hamster Society's Instagram post."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/57df6de94795e5a83e431ff4ec9e9bbaffc16e1169334834b866f3016146cb13/whatsapp_image_2023-01-27_at_12.22.54_am.jpeg?w=742", "alt_text": "787", "caption": "Mandai Wildlife Group responding to the Hamster Society's Instagram post."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b7edfbb1045e2e097281c57cb5ece7818eafb56b0424ac1a1548435b95a7e143/imgonline-com-ua-FrameBlurred-SOqvliMSc5DX.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Will you give Frodo the Singapore Special a fur-ever home?", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

There she found her father, who had been drinking beer at night, asleep on the sofa. She also noticed a few cans of beer in the living room.\n\nAt that time, Kshivadarrshini's mother had left for work and her sister was asleep in her own room.\n\nSaid DPP Koh: \"The accused had previously told the victim not to drink alcohol at home, as he might urinate on himself after he was intoxicated and the accused or her mother would have to clean him up after.\n\n\"The accused then felt very angry with the victim for drinking at home even though she had told him not to. She thought that she did not want her mother and her younger sister to go through the same matter over and over again.\"\n\nShe then went to the kitchen and took a 34cm-long hammer from a drawer.\n\nWhile her father was still sleeping, she swung the hammer - which had a wooden handle and a metal head, and weighed about 700g - and struck his head three to four times.\n\nKshivadarrshini's father awoke in pain from the blows, with his head bleeding.\n\nWhen Kshivadarrshini noticed the extent of the bleeding, she called the police and said she had smashed her father's head with a hammer and that he was bleeding but conscious.\n\nAfter Kshivadarrshini was arrested, her father was taken to the emergency department at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where a doctor documented his injuries, including a 4cm cut.\n\nA scan showed that he had a fracture in his skull, and he was admitted for observation.\n\nHe was discharged on Jan 9, 2020, and was prescribed antibiotics and painkillers.\n\nOn Friday, both DPP Koh and Kshivadarrshini's lawyer, Ms Tay Xi Ying, said the case was an exceptional one.\n\nCommenting on the psychiatric report obtained by the defence, Ms Tay said that it highlighted a link between Kshivadarrshini's state of mind and her actions.\n\nKshivadarrshini will return to court on April 5 for sentencing.\n\nThe offence of voluntarily causing hurt carries a jail term of up to three years, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e8d43e80f1699e1368a8645e71d1a9317ebc713bb81c4360157ccaa7a990c999/img7006_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Kshivadarrshini Karunanethi pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt.

No details have been given about whether he was then driving for an operator.\n\nA kindergarten later engaged him to transport children with special needs. In 2011, an autistic boy, whom he found to be \"cute\", became one of his passengers.\n\nThough Tan's contract ended in 2012, he continued to be engaged privately by the children's parents to ferry the youngsters to and from school.\n\nThe boy was between four and six years old when Tan first targeted him.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, the boy was released early from kindergarten. While he was in the front passenger seat, Tan made the child perform a sexual act on him. Tan committed other similar offences against the boy during that period.\n\nOn May 4, 2016, Tan rang up a maid whom he had befriended and offered her some food. She met him with her employer's daughter, whose age was not mentioned in court documents. The maid went behind Tan's vehicle to eat after he volunteered to take care of the girl.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMan tried to rape daughter when she was four, victim ‘blames herself for everything’\n\n'Dangerous paedophile' who sexually abused 11 schoolboys gets 42 years' jail, 24 strokes\n\nHe took the girl to the front cabin of the vehicle and took an upskirt shot of her, as well as pictures of her sitting on his lap. The maid later retrieved the girl, oblivious to what Tan had done.\n\nHe also asked two other maids he had befriended to send him sexually explicit pictures of little girls. One declined, but the other agreed after he told her such pictures would arouse him.\n\nOn at least 22 occasions between May 5 and Nov 1, 2016, Tan instigated the maid to send him explicit pictures of her employer's prepubescent daughter.\n\nOn at least another eight occasions, she also sent Tan 51 photos of another prepubescent girl and three photos of her employer's prepubescent son naked.\n\nThe ages of the three children were not disclosed in court documents.\n\nAfter becoming a school bus driver in 2017, Tan used a nine-seater van to ferry children who had been victims of alleged acts of abuse.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n20 years' detention for paedophile who sexually abused 2 grand-nieces\n\nTimely to review age limit for caning rapists, say some lawyers\n\nDPP Chong said Tan knew they were under care arrangements, and he had signed an undertaking to safeguard information linked to them.\n\nOne of them was an eight-year-old girl who had allegedly been physically abused and, as part of her care arrangements, had to live with her aunt and maternal grandparents.\n\nAfter dropping off the other children on Jan 12, 2017, he molested the girl and took a video of himself committing the offence. He molested her again on Jan 16, 2017, and shot a video of the acts.\n\nThree days later, he showed the girl pictures of himself clad in underwear.\n\nLater that month, the girl felt uncomfortable about what Tan had done. She told her aunt and grandparents, who alerted her mother.\n\nThe mother alerted the police on Jan 26, 2017. Officers arrested Tan later that day and seized his phone, which contained upskirt videos of many victims.\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nCRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN/MINORS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/41957d9b6f2d15f7b5fa38fb19aad738440ce72d14917d3c7bfda944afbebd11/rrgaryalexandertan2701_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Gary Alexander Tan pleaded guilty in December 2022 to six charges, including multiple counts of molestation.", "caption": "Gary Alexander Tan pleaded guilty in December 2022 to six charges, including multiple counts of molestation.

But in the midst of towing, the actor's snow plough began to \"slide sideways\" and then \"roll down the hill\", forcing him to leap out of the vehicle.\n\nWhen he realised it was heading directly toward his nephew, he tried to divert the vehicle but was \"immediately pulled under the left side track\" and \"completely crushed\" under the snow plough.\n\nThe nephew administered aid to him until help arrived, but Renner was left with \"30 plus broken bones\", according to his most recent Instagram post on Jan 21.\n\nHowever, he remained upbeat, saying the broken bones would \"mend, grow stronger, just like (how) the love and bond with family and friends deepens\".\n\nRenner is an Oscar-nominated actor best-known for playing superhero archer Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2011.

It will also acquire 374 accessory parcels at the mall, including al fresco and multi-purpose areas spanning a total of 1.28 million sq ft, and all 2,181 carpark spaces.\n\nMustafa's managing director Mustaq Ahmad said: \"Having established ourselves in Singapore as a mega one-stop retail store for everything from fast-moving consumer goods to fashion, cosmetics and electronics, we believe the time is ripe for us to get into Malaysia.\"\n\nHe added that Capital City Mall meets many of the requirements for its first flagship store in Malaysia, including its close proximity to Singapore and ample floor area.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 26, 2024, 10:53pm\n\nMustafa Jewellery customer becomes a millionaire\n\nMore related stories\n\nBoth the Mustafa department store and Capital City Mall are expected to open for business in the second half of 2023.\n\nCapital City Mall was completed in April 2018 and opened in October that year.

These are expected to include a 315-room hotel, an 18-storey tower with 630 serviced suites, and 690 serviced apartments.\n\nThe company said it will also pursue other real estate opportunities, including helping Mustafa's identify potential sites in Malaysia and Indonesia to develop its mega stores.\n\nTrading in Capital World shares has been suspended on the Singapore Exchange since Feb 14, 2020. It has until April 30 to submit a trading resumption proposal to the exchange.\n\nCapital World chief executive Hoo Khee Leng said the deal with Mustafa's \"will fast-track Capital World's turnaround and restore value to shareholders as we work towards getting the company's share trading suspension lifted\".\n\nKang Wan Chern\n\nAssistant Business Editor\n\nMustafa Centre\n\nmalaysia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 15, 2024, 09:23am\n\nMustafa Centre to go back to staying open 24 hours\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/91b643d0e644e9e09ccce32f3aad92871e9380933e53023fe91de5b86f00951f/desweevelittleindia12108051_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The department store in Johor Bahru is expected to open for business in the second half of 2023. \n", "caption": "The department store in Johor Bahru is expected to open for business in the second half of 2023.

The victim said she was kicked because the offender was angry at her for putting on the socks wrongly. Tan also pinched the other maid.\n\nThe accused, who used to be a director and secretary at Novena Medical Centre,\n\nhad claimed trial to eight assault charges involving\n\nMs Joan Lozares Lizardo and Ms Jenefer Vegafria Arangote, both Filipinas.\n\nDistrict Judge Salina Ishak on Friday also ordered Tan to give $2,500 to Ms Lizardo and $5,100 to Ms Arangote as compensation.\n\nBefore sentencing her, the judge, who convicted Tan on seven assault charges in December 2022, said: \"All maids should be treated with dignity and respect... The victims ought to be compensated for their pain and suffering.\"\n\nThe judge gave a discharge amounting to an acquittal on one of Tan's charges involving Ms Lizardo. This means Tan cannot be charged again with the same offence.\n\nThe prosecution will be appealing against this discharge.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutors Kumaresan Gohulabalan and Ng Jun Chong stated in their submissions that Tan's husband, Mr Sim Guan Huat, had employed both domestic helpers.\n\nTan assaulted Ms Arangote on five occasions in September 2018 by pinching the woman's abdomen, chest and limbs.\n\nDuring the trial, Ms Lizardo testified that Tan had hit her many times between October 2015 and October 2018. Ms Lizardo was unable to recall the details of most of these incidents.\n\nHowever, she remembered that in October 2018, Tan was wearing a ring on her finger when she hit the maid hard on the head.\n\nMs Lizardo's accounts of abuse were corroborated by two other maids - Ms Gaborne Clayrimae Balasa and Ms Zin Mar Phyo - who had also worked for Tan.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nWoman accused of maid abuse acquitted on all charges\n\nWoman convicted of maid abuse after attempting to cover victim’s bruises with make-up\n\nThe DPPs told Judge Salina: \"She felt pain when the accused hit her.

She explained that the accused was very angry and had been screaming for her socks.\"\n\nOn another occasion, Ms Lizardo testified that she was on the front porch of the Paradise Island house on Oct 12, 2018, when Tan kicked her chest because the maid was putting on the offender's socks wrongly.\n\nThe prosecutors said: \"The kick was painful and she could still feel the pain after five days.\"\n\nMs Arangote corroborated Ms Lizardo's account.\n\nA doctor who examined Ms Lizardo five days later found that the maid had tenderness over her sternum, consistent with injury inflicted by a kick to the chest.\n\nAccording to the doctor, Ms Lizardo said that her employer had kicked her.\n\nCourt documents did not state who alerted the police, but officers later came to Tan's home and statements were taken.\n\nThe prosecution said that Ms Arangote and Ms Lizardo were credible and candid witnesses whose evidence should be given full weight.\n\nThe DPPs added: \"We highlight that neither Jenefer nor Joan actually reported the abuse to the police, that Joan informed (a policewoman) that she did not know why the police officers were at the house, and that Jenefer had no idea the police were coming.\"\n\nTan denied all the charges, claiming to be shocked when she was prosecuted for the offences.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nWoman who joined daughter in torturing Myanmar maid to death gets 14 years’ jail\n\n24 years’ jail for man who repeatedly raped maid while his wife, kids were not at home\n\nShe also claimed that she had never caused any hurt to any of her maids and did not abuse any of them.\n\nAccording to court documents, she even provided officers at Clementi Police Division with the contact details of some of her other maids in a bid to prove her innocence.\n\nThe DPPs said: \"However, it is jarring that the clear and consistent evidence from her previous domestic helpers (Ms Balasa and Ms Zin Mar Phyo) was that she had been abusive towards Joan on many occasions.\"\n\nOn Friday, defence lawyer Derek Kang told the court that Tan intends to appeal against her conviction and sentence.\n\nHer bail has been set at $15,000.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nMAID/DOMESTIC WORKER\n\nassault\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/522cea3ddca57a83dbe5edf33e01af9743dd3f4e6f94f87a7ae7e39fde3faf00/btmaid20230127_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Tan Lee Hoon was convicted on seven assault charges involving her domestic helpers in December 2022.", "caption": "Tan Lee Hoon was convicted on seven assault charges involving her domestic helpers in December 2022.

I didn't ride trackwork so much last year,\" he said.\n\n\"Last time, I would ride three to four every morning. I would say that number has doubled now.\n\n\"I've changed to a positive mindset when facing the highs and lows of racing. I used to just sit back and expect things to improve by themselves.\n\n\"Now I put myself out there so trainers know I'm available. I just want to contribute more to the rides, so I go knocking on more doors.\n\n\"These days, I get a lot of support from KY (Keah Yong) Young, Leslie Khoo, Tim Fitzsimmons, David Kok, CT (Cheng Tee) Kuah.\n\n\"It's a two-way traffic. I help them with their horses and they help me back with more support.\"\n\nThe upshot was a larger book of rides right off the bat in the new campaign.\n\nOn Day 1 at the season opener on Jan 7, Amirul was set down for seven rides - a significant uptick to his usual handful.\n\nGranted, quality was not quite there, as none placed, but that is where an ounce of luck also plays a part.\n\n\"I was actually already happy with seven rides, and didn't mind taking one more when Simon Kok was injured and stood down - and I got a winner,\" as he recalled about his pinch-hitting turn for that fortuitous 2023 opener.\n\n\"I thought Ocean Crossing was just a backmarker and the distance was a bit short for him.\n\n\"But, in the race, I could feel the horse had a nice turn of foot. I rode a patient race on him and he won.\n\n\"Hard work pays off, but a bit of luck can also go a long way. That win was like a turning point for me.\"\n\nRacing is littered with shortlived wins, but Ocean Crossing was no flash in the pan for Amirul. One week later, he doubled up with Bionics.\n\nTo observers, the last-gasp win showcased his undeniable skills yet again. But, to Amirul, it meant much more.\n\n\"You have no idea how happy I was to beat (Manoel) Nunes (on January) that day,\" he said.\n\nBesides getting lucky - and a kick out of beating a four-time champion, Amirul conceded that he had also been making hay while the sun shone.\n\n\"I also took advantage of a lack of jockeys. Many jockeys were suspended like Saifudin (Ismail) and Krisna (Thangamani) or injured like Simon, (Mohd) Zaki and Yusoff (Fadzli),\" he said.\n\n\"I put myself there and I got rides I wouldn't normally get. More importantly, I'm really enjoying my riding.\"\n\nAmirul's resurgence can continue this Saturday. Though he has no standout, he can make a case for a couple from his even spread of eight rides.\n\n\"This week, I got eight rides. I think Strong N Smart is my best chance. I've ridden him three times, and he went around well at his last start,\" he said.\n\n\"I think Wild Bee is my second-best chance. He won his last start and has drawn well like Strong N Smart.\"\n\nMicheal Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7f2f42e7a4b913d456cd02f459f1caeb181b9131e67012e9c84f1b4ef2979748/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Amirul Ismadi is all smiles as he returns to the winner's enclosure astride pick-up ride Ocean Crossing on Jan 7. \n\n", "caption": "Amirul Ismadi is all smiles as he returns to the winner's enclosure astride pick-up ride Ocean Crossing on Jan 7."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 14 & 15", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6119828eb9a0fcd6d3eb1e0471fdc0361632ff03246080fb7448db765b775510/JohnSize.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "All hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Today it was a bit tougher for me because it was different conditions,\" said Rybakina, 23.\n\n\"I couldn't play really aggressive tennis. The ball was not going so much, but I'm happy that in the end I managed to win.\n\n\"I'll try my best in the final of course.\"\n\nAzarenka's fellow Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka took on Magda Linett of Poland in the second semi-final. She won 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 and will face Rybakina in the title-decider on Saturday.\n\nSabalenka is the highest-ranked player left in the women's draw at fifth in the world and is favourite to win her first Grand Slam.

awards for deeds ranging from busting crooks to helping businesses\n\nShare this article\n\nHe began his career as a Singapore Customs officer in 2010 overseeing raids on suspects who had stashed contraband cigarettes in tissue boxes in cars at the checkpoints and in lockers at worksites.\n\nSince 2020, Deputy Chief Superintendent of Customs Muhammad Suffyan Tumadi, assistant head of Schemes and Engagement, has been a trade facilitator who assists companies in their application of the various Customs schemes.\n\nIn conjunction with International Customs Day on Thursday, Mr Suffyan was among more than 300 customs officers who received Singapore Customs Good Service Medals and Long Service Medals.\n\nMr Suffyan, 38, a former prosecution officer, was awarded the Customs Service Medal (10 years).\n\nHe noted that his current role is not much different from his previous job, which was people-oriented as he had to deal with lawyers, judges and investigators.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 08:19am\n\nMan arrested over 1,550 cartons of contraband cigarettes\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Similarly, in my current job as a trade facilitator, I have to understand the needs of companies - different companies have different needs and different challenges,\" he told The Straits Times.\n\nTwo investigators from the Trade Investigation Branch and Special Investigation Branch respectively, who wanted to be known only as Mr Ang, 38, and Mr Lee, 33, because they often go undercover as part of their work, received a Staff Award, Outstanding Project (Enforcement).\n\nThe pair led an investigation against a parallel importer who had allegedly evaded more than $3 million in duties and goods and services tax (GST) on more than 1,800 imported cars.\n\nMr Lee said that picking up the evidence trail of suspects who try to dodge taxes or make fraudulent declarations is not always easy.\n\nWhen the investigators make surprise visits, suspects can become uncooperative and refuse them entry into the premises despite the officers identifying themselves and producing search warrants.\n\n\"Usually, we work the ground to look for evidence to build our case,\" said Mr Lee, noting there are also operational considerations such as the security of the place they are in and the safety of their personnel.\n\nDifferent modus operandi\n\nHe added that offenders have different ways of keeping track of their own finances, with some relying on the old-school pen and paper while others have progressed to high-tech spreadsheet software.\n\nCustoms officers are known to bust peddlers of contraband cigarettes by disguising themselves, such as wearing a sarong to blend in with foreign workers, and using surveillance techniques to keep track of large shipments of duty-unpaid cigarettes until their final destination.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Singapore Customs uncovered a trend of syndicates attempting to smuggle duty-unpaid cigarettes by concealing them in a container among shipments belonging to multiple consignees.\n\nIn 2021, Singapore Customs collected $10.14 billion in revenue from customs and excise duties on tobacco, liquors, petroleum, motor vehicle, and GST from imports.\n\nFor new companies wanting to expand their business, they would need to understand the procedures and product codes of goods being shipped to Singapore.\n\nThis is where Higher Superintendent of Customs Muhammad Firdaus Roslan, 38, and Chief Superintendent of Customs Yeo Ban Meng, 48, come in.\n\nThey each received a Staff Award, Outstanding Project (Trade), for their work on the review and implementation of the Asean Harmonised Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN) in 2022.\n\nIn simple terms, every product is assigned a code and, depending on the code, traders would know which products are subject to excise duties or need to follow various regulations.\n\nThe AHTN was jointly developed by Asean member states (AMS), such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, to promote uniform classification of goods and facilitate trade within Asean.\n\nThe review took into consideration amendments to the Harmonised System (HS) by the World Customs Organisation, technology changes, international trade patterns and proposals submitted by AMS.\n\nNineteen project teams and four individuals were also recognised with various staff awards such as Service Excellence, Trade, ProEnterprise, Enforcement and Innovation.\n\nMr Tan Hung Hooi, director-general of Singapore Customs, said during the ceremony at the NTUC Auditorium that in the next year, Singapore Customs will continue with its efforts to \"build a future-ready workforce, and push ahead with capability-building, especially in data and digitalisation\".\n\n\"As we transform our work and upskill our officers, it is also important that our officers find purpose in their work, and we continue to deliver on our mission,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nZaihan Mohamed

His last race was on Sept 3, 2022.\n\nThe chestnut New Zealand-bred gelding with the prominent broad blaze has resumed fresh.\n\nHe won his trial impressively with blinkers on Jan 19.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nRidden by stable jockey Matthew Kellady, he crossed in nicely from his wide berth to eyeball the Tim Fitzsimmons-trained and Manoel Nunes-ridden Diaz on settling down.\n\nThe pair drew away to lead by six lengths at the bend and by eight at the top of the straight.\n\nAlthough kept well in check, Watery beat Diaz by half a length in 1min 00.32sec.\n\n\"Yeah, he trialled well. It will be his first time running in Class 5 and first time with blinkers. Should be hard to beat,\" said Baertschiger.\n\nThe affable horseman added that he gave Watery a break because the gelding was a \"tired horse\" from his eight-start campaign in 5½ months in 2022.\n\nThe rest has certainly done wonders to his charge.\n\nBaertschiger started the new season slowly.\n\nHe had only seven runners in two of the three meetings for a second and a third, and has wisely engaged rising apprentice jockey Ibrahim Mamat for the ride.\n\nTrainer Michael Clements' protege's 4kg allowance will bring Watery's handicap down - from 59kg to 55kg.\n\nThis will give the horse every chance, not forgetting that he will also be aided by an inside barrier (Gate 3) and the first-time blinkers which have sparked many horses to victory.\n\nWatery's best effort from eight starts was his good second behind Deception in a $75,000 Restricted Maiden event over 1,200m on turf on May 14, 2022.\n\nOn Saturday, the Tornado Stable-owned galloper is contesting the $30,000 Class 5 Division 1 event over the Polytrack 1,200m.\n\nHe just has to bring his trial form to the race to account for his seven rivals.\n\nWhile Watery gets a claiming rider to reduce his handicapped weight, Italian Revolution has the services of the forceful four-time Singapore champion jockey Vlad Duric.\n\nKellady had ridden the three-year-old well three times but luck denied him of victory on each occasion. His mount just found one to beat at the winning post.\n\nPerhaps the riding switch could bring a change of luck for the MA Racing Stable-owned Australian-bred gelding.\n\nDuric will partner Italian Revolution, one of the star performers on the training track on Tuesday, and complete their task with distinction in the $75,000 Restricted Maiden Division 1 event over 1,200m on turf.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9d36e6fb1a2564094d9ce72422ed2614500c590a80cd5884da50c7e4ba9e0337/unnamed.png?w=965", "alt_text": "The Shane Baertschiger- trained Watery (Shafrizal Saleh) finishing second to the Donna Logan-trained Deception (Hakim Kamaruddin) over 1,200m on May 14, 2022.

I was underwater, gulping a lot of the water. I couldn't feel the floor... the current was very strong,\" he told The Straits Times in a phone call on Thursday.\n\nHis wife, carrying their four-year-old son, stood above them in shock.\n\nMr Hussain used his free arm to hold onto a stable plank on the bridge and his right leg felt concrete - the submerged pillars of the bridge.\n\n\"To fight the current and climb back to land, I pressed my leg against the concrete and pushed up, while holding my daughter. A group of passers-by who were a few metres behind us on the bridge grabbed Ashley.\"\n\nMr Hussain then hauled himself up back onto the bridge, suffering a large bruise on his ribs, scratches on his arms and cuts on his thigh. Ashley was unhurt.\n\nThe whole ordeal lasted at most two minutes, but it felt like a lifetime, he said.\n\nHis family and the passers-by stayed at the bridge to warn visitors about the hole. They also tried to cover it up with stray planks, but the wooden pieces kept floating away on the flooded walkway.\n\nHe said: \"I'm a strong swimmer, trained as a lifeguard, but I would not have survived in that water. I think the hole was bigger than a manhole.\"\n\nThey then walked to the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve Wetland Centre, but found it empty on the public holiday. The family learnt later that the only employee on duty that day was on the other side of the wetland reserve, attending to other visitors.\n\nSeveral calls to an available hotline number went unanswered.\n\n\"I then rang 995. It was the only number we could think of. But the SCDF (Singapore Civil Defence Force) operator said if they did not need an emergency ambulance, we should address this to the right agency.\"\n\nMr Hussain later posted an update on social media that SCDF apologised to him for how the operator had handled the call.\n\nFinally, their call to the hotline went through. The staff member came rushing back to speak with the family and check on the walkway.\n\nMr Hussein's wife also emailed NParks about the incident. He said on Wednesday night, he received a call from an NParks director to inform him that the site had been cordoned off and engineers engaged to repair the bridge. The director also said the wetland reserve would implement longer term preventive measures to avoid structural problems caused by inclement weather, and that they would work on displaying a helpline number more prominently in the park.\n\nThe walkway crosses a sluice gate that controls discharge from the Buloh Besar River into the sea.  PHOTO: SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS\n\nMr Lim said the overflowing waters during the peak of the spring tide, coupled with heavy rain, had dislodged the floor panels, creating the hole.\n\nHe said: \"We have reached out to the family to thank them for helping to inform other park visitors about the gap and notifying our staff of the situation to rectify it.\"\n\nOn Thursday morning, a section of the bridge was cordoned off with cones and tape, with most of the missing wood planks back in place as repairs had been underway since Wednesday at around 5pm, said one of the workers. Two workers were sawing planks to fit the gap.\n\nWhile Mr Hussain's wounds and cuts are healing, he remains shaken by the ordeal.\n\n\"I've been through many dangerous close calls growing up that have not affected me as much. But this involved my daughter and family.\n\n\"I keep replaying in my head how things could have gone wrong.\"\n\nShabana Begum\n\nand\n\nThomas Loke\n\nsungei buloh\n\nACCIDENTS\n\nPARKS/NATURE RESERVES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2024, 02:55am\n\n5 taken to hospital after hornet attack at Sungei Buloh\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a68e705eaf4b6ccdb414b4cf3e1b804610fc070e73074bff3d1415439e886f46/202301267755737859bef6fa-db8d-4c91-88a0-8eb61afed45e_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Workers patching up the hole in the bridge on Thursday. \n", "caption": "Workers patching up the hole in the bridge on Thursday.

And though his ex-wife, who lives in Thailand, gives him about $1,000 monthly, it is not enough to feed the both of them.\n\nConsidered relocating\n\nAt one point, he considered moving his stall to another location with higher footfall, but found the higher rental an obstacle.\n\n\"There was a stall for rent at a coffee shop in Toa Payoh, but the rent is $3,000 a month. I don't even dare to think about it.\"\n\nIn an effort to supplement his reduced income from his stall, Andrew said he worked part-time as a hotel security guard the last two months.\n\nHe would work at the hotel from 8pm to 8am the next day, then return home for a two- to three-hour nap before getting up to sell rojak.\n\n\"(That routine) was making me very tired.

I can accept that.\"\n\nHow long can Yen, who is married to former beauty queen Cissy Wang, 41, continue in action films?\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\n0\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I have told my wife many times that I would retire at the age of 55,\" he said. \"I already had this idea when I was filming Big Brother (2018).\" He was hoping to act less and bring in more newcomers.\n\nYen can currently be seen in the martial arts film Sakra\n\n, in which he plays Qiao Feng, head of the Beggar's Gang martial arts group and one of the main characters of late writer Louis Cha's wuxia novel Demi-Gods And Semi-Devils.\n\nThe star added: \"I can still fight a bit now, but when the audiences are no longer interested in seeing me do so, I will not stop the world from turning.\"\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nIn feudal China, Donnie Yen’s hero fights to save himself from getting cancelled\n\nDonnie Yen's wife sends her love to him via social media on his 59th birthday\n\nLim Ruey Yan\n\nCelebrities\n\nMovies\n\nhong kong\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\n4\n\n0\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\n1\n\n0\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\n4\n\n0\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\n1\n\n0\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a87100579611390a1acd4b29125b93a39eaebc7486c8008bfd0d7e4cadcab61a/SAKRASTILL202212237_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Donnie Yen is currently starring in the film Sakra.

The friends alerted the authorities about the incident.\n\nA search party involving multiple agencies including the police, Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA), Fire and Rescue Department and Civil Defence Force, was subsequently launched following the 6am incident.\n\nHowever, efforts were made difficult due to the choppy seas and bad weather.\n\nSabah and Labuan MMEA director First Admiral Datuk Mohd Rosli Abdullah said the victim was earlier spotted by the navy's unmanned aerial vehicle before being rescued.\n\n\"The MMEA would like to advise the maritime community to keep abreast with the current weather conditions,\" he said, urging the people to ensure they wore life jackets and brought communication equipment if they had to go out to sea.

It seems to put them in the zone.\n\nPure Perfection fits the bill. He has done it before and he did it again on Wednesday morning when he worked like a winner, running the 600m in 37.7sec.\n\nRichard Lim, his trainer, would have been pleased and he just might be keeping his fingers crossed that his charge brings that form to the races.\n\nPure Perfection is down to contest Race 1 on Saturday and it looks a winnable sort of race for the four-year-old.\n\nLast time out, on Jan 14, Pure Perfection ran his best race to date, finishing third to Great Command in a competitive Maiden event over the 1,200m.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:45pm\n\nRace cards for July 14 & 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nIf this \"morning glory\" can bring his trackwork form to the races, Lim might have another winner to add to the two that he already has for 2023.\n\nBut Pure Perfection was not the only runner from LIm's yard to go against the clock.\n\nTwo others, Tigarous and Cash Out, were also out for their winding down gallops ahead of Saturday's races and they looked in good order.\n\nCash Out clocked 37.17sec while Tigarous went over the 600m in a leisurely 43sec. Cash Out will see action in Race 6 while Tigarous will contest Race 11.\n\nWith 31 starts under his girth, Tigarous knows all there is to know about racing.\n\nAn Irish-bred, he has four race wins to his name, the last one being that ½-length win over Leatherhead in November.\n\nHis last two runs, on Jan 7 and Jan 14, were not too shabby and he should give a good account of himself on Saturday.\n\nAs for nine-year-old Cash Out, he will be having his 80th race start and he does seem to have his work cut out for him when he takes on much younger opponents.\n\nStill, he can be tossed into the mix when planning those exotic combinations.\n\nAlso out for a spin was the Leslie Khoo-trained Golden Tiger.\n\nHe worked hard, turning on the speed in the back straight before being relaxed to clock 38.3sec for the final 600m.\n\nGolden Tiger has not shown much in his last few starts, with his best run in recent times coming in September when second to First Chief.\n\nHe will have to bring his \"A\" game to the races if he is to beat the likes of Super Talent and My Boss, among others.\n\nLater in the morning, two trials were run. In the first, we saw Tim Fitzsimmons take the trifecta with Typhoon, Nate's Champion and Hurricane.\n\nAllowing his stablemate Hurricane and the Khoo-trained newcomer Grand Avante to show the way for most of the trip, Typhoon and Nate's Champion joined in the fray and they were four in a line passing the furlong mark.\n\nIt was touch and go and nothing separated them.\n\nBut there had to be a winner - even if they crossed the line locked as one.\n\nA print gave Ronnie Stewart the verdict on Typhoon. Nate's Champion, the mount of Amirul Ismadi, was beaten by a nose.\n\nHurricane, the mount of Simon Kok, had to settle for third, a shorthead away.\n\nTyphoon, who did the trip in 1min 01.17sec, has had two race starts but has yet to make the board.\n\nHowever, his trial form does seem to suggest that it could come sooner rather than later. Keep him on your shortlist.\n\nIn the second trial, Super Salute took the honours, beating Ace Sovereign by three lengths, with In All His Glory a distant third.\n\nThe Jason Lim-trained Super Salute also clocked 1:01.17 for the 1,000m.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nAll hail King Size at his 13th HK crowning moment\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:15pm\n\nPlenty of choices await Aeliana\n\nJul 14, 2025, 01:14pm\n\nJuly 15 South Africa (Kenilworth) form analysis\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:51am\n\nOng, See break Group 1 duck\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/248ad288e3e4571e06a99a7dbfdb8ad444cb12f6d9a6ed73a33467eeb113202c/ddd.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Trainer Richard Lim will be hoping for Pure Perfection to salute in Race 1 on Saturday.\n", "caption": "Trainer Richard Lim will be hoping for Pure Perfection to salute in Race 1 on Saturday.

a return to form from the 70 that operated in 2022.\n\nUnlike previous years in which the bazaar's first day typically coincides with the start of the Muslim fasting month, the iteration in 2023 will begin five days earlier to coincide with the Hari Raya light-up at Geylang Serai, and run for 36 days until April 21.\n\nIt will operate daily from 10am to 11.59pm, although this will be extended to 6am on Hari Raya Puasa, which falls on April 22.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a press conference on Thursday, Minister of State for Home Affairs and National Development Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said this would be the longest duration the bazaar has operated.\n\nHe added that affordability will be a key consideration for visitors.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 13, 2025, 02:40am\n\nDriver arrested after fatal crash at Geylang pasar malam\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"As a start, we want to make sure that the food items is something that people can afford,\" he said, citing how every food and beverage (F&B) outlet would offer one item on their menu at a sampler size for $4.\n\nMr Mohamed Mustaffa Shah Jehan, the founder of Enniche Global Trading, which is part of the consortium operating the bazaar, said that retail stalls could expect rentals of up to $15,000 for the entire duration, whereas F&B ones could go up to $19,000 for the same period.\n\nHe added that there will be a space set aside for local entrepreneurs in the vicinity of Wisma Geylang Serai, where it will cost $55 a day to rent a stall.\n\nThis is to give entrepreneurs a chance to market their wares, especially in light of many home-based businesses popping up amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn this area, which will be designated as Souq City, derived from the Arabic word for market, community shelves will be set aside for people to place donated non-perishable halal food and clothing for Hari Raya.\n\nThe area will also host bazaar hallmarks, including F&B and retail stalls.\n\nAssoc Prof Faishal, who is also lead advisor for Wisma Geylang Serai, said the space set aside for donated items is meant to encourage the spirit of giving.\n\n\"We want to provide opportunities for people to contribute while we... celebrate the atmosphere of Ramadan and Hari Raya,\" he said.\n\nDuring the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to dusk, with it being a time for community, reflection, charity and prayer.\n\nMeanwhile, there will also be a separate area designated as the Street Bazaar, stretching from Geylang Serai Market to the area beside Tanjong Katong Complex.\n\nHere, there will be three different themes featured prominently, with interactive art installations placed throughout.\n\nGraffiti artist Slac Satu will also be spray painting his artwork across a different panel during the 30 days of Ramadan.\n\n\"All we want is for visitors to have memorable experiences for them to remember 2023's bazaar for many years to come,\" said Assoc Prof Faishal.\n\nAqil Hamzah\n\nGeylang\n\nRamadan\n\nHARI RAYA PUASA\n\nStreet food\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025, 03:49am\n\nThree hair salons raided in crackdown on illegal massage and vice services in Geylang and Joo Chiat\n\nJun 10, 2025, 08:02am\n\nDigital sentry to keep watch for errant motorists at Geylang Serai market carpark\n\nApr 20, 2025, 12:53am\n\nWhen a $19.90 'buffet' is not exactly a buffet\n\nApr 5, 2025, 11:05pm\n\nDriver and 2 passengers who ditch car and flee from Geylang roadblock at large\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwww.airwallex.com\n\nHow Endowus's CFO uses Airwallex to balance growth and cost control\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/59872dcdb6d5bdeee902ca317902696b48196161c42197244483eae89516eb54/geylangbazaar.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Shoppers at the Ramadan Bazaar in Geylang Serai on May 2, 2022.", "caption": "Shoppers at the Ramadan Bazaar in Geylang Serai on May 2, 2022.

NEA said there will be 580 seats, up from 479 previously.\n\nAbout 55 per cent of the survey respondents had visited the hawker centre in Jurong West Street 61 at least once a month before it closed in August 2020.\n\nThe 14 market stalls in the centre will not be returning, as 95 per cent of respondents prefers to get their groceries from other markets or nearby supermarkets.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 29, 2025, 05:02am\n\nCashback for purchases via DBS PayLah app returns from July 12\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe hawker centre's previous operator - Koufu Group subsidiary Hawker Management -\n\ndid not renew its contract as the business did not fare well,\n\nwith only about half of its stalls open since 2019. The complex opened in 2017.\n\nOn Thursday, NEA said the hawker centre will undergo a makeover. The escalators and staircases that are currently at the front of the centre will be relocated to free up space for stalls on the first storey. This will also improve visibility of the hawker centre, NEA said.\n\nThe carpark's entry and exit points will be repositioned to allow for new cooked food stalls on the first storey, although this will reduce the carpark spaces to 49 from 72 previously.\n\nThe escalators and staircase at the hawker centre will be relocated to free up space, and the carpark entry and exit points will also be repositioned for more stalls on the first storey. PHOTO: NEA\n\nJW 50 Hawker Heritage was appointed as the operator of the new centre on Thursday, said NEA, adding that its proposal was the most robust out of the three tenderers. The contract is worth $4.86 million.\n\n\"For instance, they proposed the second level of the centre to offer international cuisine, as well as festive food, ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat products. Patrons to the centre will be able to enjoy familiar hawker fare on the first level,\" the agency said.\n\nIts proposed average monthly rent for stallholders was also the lowest among all the proposals, NEA added. The Straits Times has asked NEA for the rental rates.\n\nNEA said the operator's parent company, Chang Cheng Mee Wah Food, has expertise and experience in managing food establishments such as coffee shops, which can help to attract tenants to Jurong West Hawker Centre. Last year, the group\n\nbought a coffee shop in Yishun for $40 million.\n\nJW 50 Hawker Heritage has proposed a culinary innovation accelerator programme to help hawkers and people aspiring to be hawkers learn the necessary skills through subsidised training workshops, NEA said.\n\nThe programme also connects them to a network of food companies and mentors, as well as offer them \"competitively priced\" raw and intermediate food supplies.\n\nNEA said there will be 580 seats, up from 479 previously, and the new Jurong West Hawker Centre.

Before its closure, the agency had reached out to 18 stallholders to assist them to take up vacant stalls at other NEA-managed hawker centres and markets.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMeet the young cooks changing the face of S’pore hawker centres\n\nNew Bidadari hawker centre to open in second half of 2023\n\nIsabelle Liew\n\nHAWKER CENTRES\n\nNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY\n\nJurong\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 29, 2025, 07:43am\n\nMan arrested for allegedly assaulting diner after noodle stall collision\n\nMay 22, 2025, 11:47pm\n\nSpell it wrong, cook it right: Meet the smiling owner of Happy Briyani\n\nMay 15, 2025, 02:32am\n\nHotpot horror: Diner blames restaurant's faulty chopsticks for loose tooth, seeks compensation\n\nMay 13, 2025, 03:11am\n\nTo help the needy, hawker sells Malay food for $2.50\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/aa60072603936103c133baeae1bc7de1832e713776547cb127d8ceaa5f6820fb/SEYU1668_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "NEA said it has increased the number of cooked food stalls and seats at the hawker centre, which was closed for more two years.", "caption": "NEA said it has increased the number of cooked food stalls and seats at the hawker centre, which was closed for more two years.

Evidently, you're not alone.\n\nA number of customers have taken to Facebook and Google Reviews to voice their frustration over the non-delivery of their CNY gift hampers from Noel Gifts.\n\nIt seems the hampers did not arrive on the stipulated delivery dates earlier this month (January 2023).\n\nAccording to one Prudy Yeow, she placed an order for a hamper on Dec 26, 2022, for delivery on Jan 15, 2023. However, the hamper did not arrive on the day and remained undelivered as at Jan 18.\n\nThere were no calls or text alerts from Noel Gifts about the non-delivery. Yeow said that when she sent WhatsApp messages to Noel Gifts for updates, she did not receive any specific delivery date. Instead, the company simply apologised and said they were experiencing \"overwhelming\" orders.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 3, 2023, 10:06am\n\nICA foiled attempt to smuggle more than 1,400 vapes on third day of CNY\n\nMore related stories\n\nAnother customer, Louis Liu, said he had placed an order for Jan 9, but was not informed when the delivery failed to arrive on the day. Similarly, Liu has yet to receive any specific answers or dates regarding his delivery.\n\nAnother Facebook user, Ang Siu Wei, shared a response that was purportedly from Noel Gifts, stating that it was \"facing a high volume of inquiries\".\n\nThe company added that it was working to fulfil all CNY orders by Jan 20, with Jan 30 set as the latest date.\n\nThe reply also said: \"We will include an apology letter to your recipient/s to be accountable for the later delivery.\"\n\nIn response to Mothership's queries, Noel Gifts said that it was facing a lack of delivery personnel and manpower to issue \"prompt\" responses.\n\n\"Moreover, the short runway of CNY with the unfavourable weather has further hindered our delivery efficiency,\" Noel Gifts added.\n\nNoel Gifts further said: \"We have taken proactive steps to ease the other issues that have arisen and are getting back to our customers as fast as possible. We seek their kind understanding as we need time to reply to each customer on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"Once again, we are sorry for any inconvenience caused.\"\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nGift Hampers\n\ndelivery\n\ncustomer complaint\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 25, 2023, 01:29pm\n\nNursing home residents whip up special home-cooked CNY dinner\n\nJan 25, 2023, 04:36am\n\nWet weather expected for remainder of CNY festive period\n\nJan 24, 2023, 12:07pm\n\nHow local celebrities celebrated Chinese New Year\n\nJan 23, 2023, 06:28pm\n\nHeavy rain disrupts Chinese New Year celebrations\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nHealth Promotion Board\n\nTrack your meals with ease.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dbf322b4291ed3e519abb3269a81194ede05bfe0e289459e89e4239222e9587a/noel-gift-hampers-copy_censored_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTOS: FACEBOOK"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/24a4c0768b7c555de5971760e0334abd7613d3abff484ba77c57c58bff7e71a5/dw-ica-vape-230203_0.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "ICA foiled attempt to smuggle more than 1,400 vapes on third day of CNY", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d04671baf0c015217d008979ef79d411113cda986b7d4450b65735c8b6979ec9/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-t9cvjgqr7kugtw.jpg?w=503", "alt_text": "660", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1688f3f6bf2cf0cb4d95052bcfcd21912fb51cda4c34d815abde828d26900381/202301195964308913639e08-05b5-41fe-bf83-da1cac07594c_5.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Nursing home residents whip up special home-cooked CNY dinner", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The administrator was not named.\n\nIn the afternoon, a second teacher who suspected the boy had a weapon did not find a gun when she searched his book bag. She then told the same administrator that she believed the boy had put the gun in his pocket before going to recess, the lawyer said.\n\nMs Toscano said another student told a third teacher that the boy showed him a gun during recess and threatened to shoot him if he told anyone. The teacher reported the account to school administrators, she said.\n\nA fourth employee who learned of the threat asked for permission to search the boy, but was denied by the same school safety administrator, the lawyer said.\n\n\"He was told to wait the situation out because the school day was almost over. Tragically, almost an hour later, violence struck Ridge Elementary School,\" Ms Toscano said.\n\nPolice plan to present findings from an investigation to the Commonwealth's Attorney in Newport News, who would make any decision regarding possible charges against the boy's mother. - REUTERS\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n6-year-old accused of shooting teacher in Virginia has ‘acute disability’, family says\n\nSix-year-old boy shoots teacher at US elementary school\n\nunited states\n\nUS NEWS\n\nUS CRIME\n\nSHOOTING - GUN CRIME\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nEDUCATION AND SCHOOLS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 30, 2025, 07:03am\n\nSingaporeans travelling to US advised to check latest entry requirements and comply: MFA\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nS'poreans looking to pursue studies in US can still submit visa applications: US Embassy\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:02am\n\nConfused, nervous, told to 'wait for updates': Singapore students at Harvard react to US ban\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/91b2b5777fc0e744a3e0b16dadabd66ea48f6e1ce435e2a8f36538276da85395/2023-01-07T041447Z1292083690RC2GLY9R7OORRTRMADP3VIRGINIA-SHOOTING.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "The boy shot teacher Abigail Zwerner in front of other students at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, on Jan 6, 2023.", "caption": "The boy shot teacher Abigail Zwerner in front of other students at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, on Jan 6, 2023.

(2) FISH EAGLE has his alumites removed but sports blinkers. Chance if he runs on best form. (11) TIME TOGETHER showed up well on debut and should be involved in the finish. (10) NAZARE can improve.\n\nRace 2 (1,200m)\n\n(3) SILK GARDEN has been threatening and should escape the maiden ranks this time. Biggest danger could be debutante (8) LUSHOZI SHOOP. (1) WOW (finds problems) and (2) WRITTENINTHESAND (better than last run) could get into the trifecta.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\n(2) PHANTOMOFTHEFOREST has been threatening. His blinkers have been removed, which could do the trick. (1) QUIXOTE found problems last time and should challenge. (6) FREE MOVEMENT disappointed in his post-debut. Blinkered. Can come on in heaps. (3) FULL GO is still winless after 24 runs but can run a place.\n\nRace 4 (1,450m) (1) BROADWAY is doing nicely and the form has held up. (12) RADU did well on debut and should relish the extra. Both have prior engagements and it is essential to upgrade the form. (3) BRAVE VIKING was run out of it last time but the track will suit. However, he has a wide draw to overcome. (4) RAPTOR ISLAND was not disgraced in his first run for his new stable - respect.\n\nRace 5 (1,800m) (2) BATTLEGROUND should have his consistency and efforts rewarded and open his account. (3) CIRCUS LIGHTS lost ground last time but did well to get close. He should be the main threat. (1) HAROLD THE DUKE is a plodder but is worth a thought. (4) ELDUCINO is looking for quartet money.\n\nRace 6 (1,800m)\n\n(1) ROSSLYNE finished behind (2) ON THE GUEST LIST when returning from a rest. The latter was not comfortable in the soft conditions. But if the track is firm, she could reverse the form. (3) PONDEROSA PINE has a few lengths to find with ROSSLYNE. (4) HAYLEY'S PROMISE and (8) RED MAPLE could fight out quartet money.\n\nRace 7 (2,600m)\n\nTricky race with interchanging form lines and all runners going this far for the first time. Also the pace will be a deciding factor. (1) POSITIVE ATTIDUDE, (2) TIME TO MEDITATE, (4) MORE FOR ME, (5) ALLTHEWAYFROMUSA and (6) QUEEN BRITANNA should all be included.\n\nRace 8 (1,450m)\n\n(3) MIGHTY GODDESS is overdue for a win.

He is entered in Race 3 on Saturday and will have the services of champion jockey Manoel Nunes.\n\nPHOTO: STC\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 25, 2023, 09:17pm\n\nLogan sees no need for haste\n\n2022 runner-up off to a sluggish start but Aftermath may launch Kiwi trainer's season\n\nShare this article\n\nAfter a breakout season in 2022, Donna Logan has not quite sprung out of the starting blocks this term.\n\nThe Kiwi trainer nearly rewrote Singapore history at her fifth Kranji season, but the crowning of the Republic's first woman champion was not to be for that year.\n\nFollowing a riveting two-horse race in the last quarter, Tim Fitzsimmons eventually outslogged the Ruakaka horsewoman in the last month or so.\n\nBut unlike 2022, when Logan got on the front foot from the get-go with five winners in the month of January, her win-meter for 2023 is still set at zero.\n\nTo Logan, though, the engine has not stalled, but just warming up.\n\n\"My mother always told me: Good things come to those who wait,\" she said.\n\n\"We've had a quiet start for sure because the horses had a big rest.\n\n\"There is no need to rush, we'll just pace ourselves. Besides, we still have a very long year ahead.\n\n\"But I'm still very happy with the way the horses have been running (five placings from 15 runners).\"\n\nWith 2020 champion Michael Clements the current lamplighter on five wins, Logan and four other winless trainers (Jason Ong, Jerome Tan, James Peters and Shane Baertschiger) are certainly not lagging too far behind.\n\nBut Logan is aware she should get on the board sooner rather than later if she does not want to be on the backfoot.\n\nThough the 138-Kranji race winner fields only five horses on Saturday, she is still banking on her first runner, Aftermath in Race 3, the $50,000 Class 4 Division 1 race (1,200m), to get her off to a flier.\n\nThe Spirit Of Boom five-year-old recorded his only victory from 21 Kranji starts over the same course and distance but, to Logan, the recent form was the key factor.\n\n\"I'm very happy with the team I'm sending this week. There are some nice horses and not so nice horses, good jockeys to ride them and they are well and fit,\" she said.\n\n\"Aftermath is probably my best chance of the day. He's in the 1,200m on turf which will suit him, and we've got (Manoel) Nunes on.\n\n\"It was a pretty strong run at his first-up run from a holiday. He was wide without cover and still ran second to Ima, who ran a nice third in a much stronger race last week.\"\n\nLogan will also unveil a newcomer, Knippenberg, an unraced I Am Invincible three-year-old, for the Fortuna NZ Racing Stable. Ronnie Stewart is the pilot.\n\nAfter a barrier trial third, Logan has picked the $75,000 Restricted Maiden race over 1,200m for his Kranji launch.\n\n\"Knippenberg is still learning. He's relatively new and has a nice enough draw (barrier No. 3) for a first run,\" she said.\n\n\"This will be a good educational run and a good gauge where he is at. We can only live and hope he turns into a 3YO candidate.\"\n\nWhile Logan is still on the starting grid, her two apprentices have, ironically, done better than her.\n\nJerlyn Seow has ridden two winners while Jamil Sarwi opened his 2023 account in style with the Jason Lim-trained Sky Eye on Monday, capturing his first $100,000 race in the Kranji Stakes A event over 1,200m, the highlight of the Chinese New Year programme.\n\nLogan revealed that her lads' good results did not come by fluke, but with the help of a legendary pair of hands - former Australian champion jockey Mick Dittman, now Lim's Stable's racing manager.\n\n\"I'm super proud of Jamil and Jerlyn. They've both had a nice start to the season,\" she said.\n\n\"I actually approached Mick and asked him if he could give some tutoring to my apprentices.\n\n\"I was a jockey, too, but I would be a pinhead on the board next to a world-class jockey like Mick.\n\n\"Mick goes through their rides on Monday and points out what they did right or wrong.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6869ccf350bcde8481c963f5b2e194ea3a074c95a5c04deabe3359dbee7cce4a/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Aftermath (Yusoff Fadzli) registering his only win at Kranji in a Class 5 race over 1,200m on Aug 7.

He is one of the few residents at the home who can walk about without help. Accompanied by a nurse from the home, he picked up all the ingredients he needed for the festive meal.\n\nAlthough Mr Tan has tried his hand at cooking dishes such as steamed fish, roti prata and salted vegetables, he opted to cook something for the reunion meal that held special meaning for him - braised pork trotters.\n\nHe said: \"I learnt how to make it from my elder brother. Before he died, he made pork trotters with soya sauce, star anise and garlic. It is easy, and now I can make it myself.\"\n\nMr Lim, 53, who used to be a chef at a Hyatt hotel, offered to make stewed chicken, based on an old family recipe.\n\nHowever, since he now needs to use a wheelchair and is unable to use his left arm and leg after a stroke in 2020, he gave step-by-step instructions to nurses, who did the cooking.\n\nHe said: \"Every Chinese New Year, my mother would make Teochew stewed chicken for my brothers and sisters. Getting the chance to cook for people makes me happy.\"\n\nMs Nixi Tay, manager for programme and community partnership at NTUC Health, was part of a team of 20 nurses and administrative staff who organised the reunion dinner.\n\nShe said: \"Part of NTUC Health's care philosophy is to enable seniors to be as independent as possible and to exercise choice. One of the ways we have done this is by encouraging residents to cook for themselves and fellow residents.\"\n\nResidents of the NTUC Health Nursing Home in Jurong West celebrated Chinese New Year with a steamboat dinner on Jan 19. ST PHOTO: RYAN CHIONG\n\nNTUC Health, which has six nursing homes in Singapore, began a pilot programme in 2022 to encourage residents to cook their favourite meals at mobile cooking stations if they wished to.\n\nThe idea behind buying and preparing the ingredients, and cooking their own reunion meal for Chinese New Year is an expansion of that initiative, said Ms Tay.\n\nShe added that Chinese New Year can be a difficult time for some residents, such as those who do not have any family or those whose family members have died. Others, Ms Tay said, might have strained ties with their family members.\n\nNurse manager Devadasson Vasugi Ezhilarasi, 45, said: \"Some of their families may be unable to visit. This reunion dinner will make them happy and help them know that we are here for them.\n\n\"Mr Tan used to be depressed and isolated himself totally. After engaging him in these activities, we have seen him change a lot. Today, he is so happy, I can see the joy in his face.\"\n\nMr Tan spent Chinese New Year at the nursing home, while Mr Lim visited his sister's family at the weekend.\n\nMr Lim said: \"Nearly everyone here has family problems, that's why some of them are here. Others, like me, have no one at home to take care of them. When we celebrate here, it feels like everybody gets together like a family.\"\n\nBoth Mr Tan and Mr Lim said they plan to cook their special dishes again in the future.\n\nSaid Ms Tay: \"Sharing recipes and cooking dishes encourage social engagement within the nursing home. Sharing their recipes is one way of promoting the preservation of memories and helping to keep traditions alive.\"\n\nThomas Loke\n\nNURSING HOMES\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nFood & Drink\n\nShare this article", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1688f3f6bf2cf0cb4d95052bcfcd21912fb51cda4c34d815abde828d26900381/202301195964308913639e08-05b5-41fe-bf83-da1cac07594c_5.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Former five-star hotel chef Francis Lim (left) and avid cook Tan Lam Huat display their dishes ahead of their reunion dinner with NTUC Health Nursing Home residents on Jan 19. \n", "caption": "Former five-star hotel chef Francis Lim (left) and avid cook Tan Lam Huat display their dishes ahead of their reunion dinner with NTUC Health Nursing Home residents on Jan 19.

If I have to sum it up, in all the important shots, the important moments I found my best tennis. So that's what makes me the most pleased tonight.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old added of his match with Rublev: \"Some really close games that we had. Andrey is a great opponent, great player. I have tons of respect for him, one of the biggest forehands, quickest players on the tour.\"\n\nDjokovic's quest for a record-extending 10th Australian Open title has been far from smooth, plagued by a left hamstring strain suffered en route to the title at Adelaide earlier in January.\n\nHe struggled physically in the early rounds but was dominant during his fourth-round demolition of Alex de Minaur, and he showed few problems against Rublev.\n\nVictory for the red-hot favourite also propelled him into a 44th Grand Slam semi-final to close the gap on Federer's all-time record of 46.\n\nIn another astonishing record, he clocked a 26th consecutive match-win at the Australian Open to equal Andre Agassi's Open-era record for longest streak at the first Grand Slam of the year.\n\nThe signs were ominous for Rublev before the match even started.\n\nIn contrast to Djokovic's outstanding record in Melbourne, Rublev - who was taken to five sets by Holger Rune in the fourth round - came into the clash with a 0-6 record in Grand Slam quarter-finals.\n\n\"Like always I will try to take experience, lessons. The things that I need to improve I think is very clear,\" said the 25-year-old, who has won 13 ATP titles but is still seeking his maiden major title.\n\n\"There was nothing that impressed me because Djokovic is one of the best. I knew he's going to be really tough, that's it.\n\n\"Mental-wise I feel this Slam was much better than the previous ones, so for sure I feel I'm a better player, I feel better physically also. Hopefully I can keep improving.\"\n\nDjokovic will now turn his focus to Paul, the first American man to reach the semi-finals in Melbourne since Andy Roddick in 2009.\n\nThe Serb will be wary of his less-heralded opponent, who withstood some ferocious serving from Shelton's 24 aces.\n\nPaul is also only the third active American man to reach a Grand Slam semi-final, joining John Isner (2018 Wimbledon) and Frances Tiafoe (2022 US Open) but will have to register a seismic shock if he is to go any further.\n\n\"I'm really excited, man. It's really cool. I think it's even cooler if I do play Novak,\" the 25-year-old Florida-based Paul said after his victory, before he knew who his next opponent was.\n\n\"To play Novak here in Australia would be awesome. Obviously he's pretty comfortable here in Australia. It's going to be a challenging match. But I'm playing some of my best tennis.\" AFP, REUTERS\n\nAUSTRALIAN OPEN (TENNIS)\n\nnovak djokovic\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/862be5c9b49949203e5147681c6a394ee615ef72c6b8674f2b331eb59f1cb8ac/10428382_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Novak Djokovic in action against Andrey Rublev during their quarter-final match at the Australian Open on Jan 25. \n", "caption": "Novak Djokovic in action against Andrey Rublev during their quarter-final match at the Australian Open on Jan 25.

He described this lack of continuous documentation as not ideal.\n\nHe said in the report that the baby's mother, who was delivering her first child, underwent an emergency caesarean section, following an unsuccessful vaginal delivery attempt.\n\nAfter he was born at about 4.30am, the baby was found to have three tight loops of the umbilical cord around his neck. The cord was removed immediately and he was placed on a resuscitator.\n\nAs his vital signs were noted to be less than optimal, he was given assisted ventilation for two minutes which helped his heart rate and oxygen saturation improve.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 29, 2025, 10:41pm\n\nKKH launches Singapore's first sexual health guidelines for women of reproductive age\n\nMore related stories\n\nHowever, at three minutes after birth, his oxygen saturation was noted to be borderline and he was then given continuous positive airway pressure til his vital signs improved.\n\nThe baby was observed to be vigorously moving and had a good cry, and State Coroner Nakhoda noted that nothing amiss was observed.\n\nHowever, when the baby was taken to the viewing room so that his father could see him, the coroner said it was apparent that his condition had begun to deteriorate.\n\nThe father and a nurse noticed that he was giving weak cries and appeared limp.\n\nWhen this became more pronounced and the baby did not show spontaneous limb movements and was not breathing spontaneously, the nurse took him back into the operating theatre.\n\nHis vital signs were not recorded from the seventh minute after birth until he was taken back into the operating theatre at about 5.20am.\n\nThe nurse put him back on the resuscitator, reattached a probe that allowed for measurement of his oxygen saturation and heart rate, resumed the assisted ventilation and then activated a Code Blue emergency, which is used when a patient is in cardiac or respiratory arrest.\n\nThe baby was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and was connected to a ventilator.\n\nBut his condition continued to deteriorate. An ultrasound found indications of swelling of the brain while there was also suggestion of severe brain disease.\n\nBy the fifth day after the baby was born, his condition had worsened further and his parents agreed to withdraw care after discussion with the medical staff and careful consideration. The baby was pronounced dead on April 12, 2021, at about 12.30 pm.\n\nState Coroner Nakhoda ruled out foul play and said the baby had died of natural causes. He also noted that the cause of death was certified to be a brain injury that occurs when the organ experiences a decrease in oxygen or blood flow.\n\nHe added that that it was unlikely that the wrapped umbilical cord had played a part as there was period where the baby was well and breathing independently.\n\nA senior consultant at KKH's department of neonatology stated in a medical report that there was no documentation of continuous monitoring of the baby's vital signs considering his initial stable status.\n\nThe consultant added that on review of this aspect, the hospital was working to ensure documentation of a newborn's vital signs are kept until the newborn is handed over to other teams in the hospital.\n\nState Coroner Nakhoda said he was heartened by the fact that KKH is reviewing its procedures to consider continuous documentation of a newborn's vital signs.\n\n\"Losing a child is always a devastating event, perhaps more so when the child is a newborn,\" he added.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nKKH\n\nbabies\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 10, 2025, 12:50am\n\nTeen with skin disease recalls being ostracised in school\n\nFeb 25, 2025, 04:47am\n\nFree baby car seats for mothers who give birth at KKH\n\nMay 24, 2023, 04:12am\n\nHours, then days: Miracle baby Fattah defying the odds while battling rare disease\n\nJun 8, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nMan had sex with underage girl at hospital staircase\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7965ebd4f95fee347f4ef7a9af7c362fc9e2910f10063dea80c4dc39e68f70d0/hzkkh250122_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The 11-day-old baby died from a brain injury in April 2021. \n", "caption": "The 11-day-old baby died from a brain injury in April 2021.

They were later discontinued in June 2022, with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) citing low ridership, the availability of alternative transport modes and financial prudence as factors.\n\nA&S Transit said it is launching its new night bus services - named NS-1 and NS-2 - to cater to the recovering nightlife scene. The new bus services also provide a low-cost transport alternative to commuters, who would otherwise have to travel via taxi or private-hire car after the MRT and regular bus services stop operating, the company added.\n\nThe new night bus services will both start plying from the bus stop opposite the MAS Building in Shenton Way.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 03:02am\n\nMan who allegedly threw glass bottle at bus window charged\n\nMore related stories\n\nNS-1 will pass through the Central Business District, Clarke Quay, River Valley, Orchard Road and Little India, stopping at public bus stops along the way.\n\nIt will then pass through Ang Mo Kio and Sengkang before ending in Punggol at the bus stop near Samudera LRT station.\n\nNS-2 will similarly pass through the CBD, Clarke Quay and Orchard Road, before hitting bus stops in Newton, Yishun and Sembawang. The service will end in Woodlands, at the bus stop outside Woodlands Train Checkpoint.\n\nBuses for the two new services will operate at 45-minute intervals, with the first bus leaving Shenton Way at 11.30pm and the last bus leaving at 2.30am in the morning.\n\nMore bus trips may be scheduled on the eve of public holidays.\n\nIn comparison, SMRT's six NightRider services previously operated at 20 to 30-minute intervals, while SBST's six Nite Owl services operated at 40-minute intervals.\n\nA&S Transit said it will charge a flat fee of $4.50 for passengers who pay using their ez-link cards. Those who pay by cash will be charged $5, and they will need to provide the exact amount to the bus driver.\n\nThese fares are similar to SMRT's now-defunct NightRider services, which used to cost $4.50 regardless of payment method.\n\nSBST's Nite Owl services were slightly cheaper at $4.40 for bus rides from the city, and $1.70 for trips between public housing estates.\n\nA&S Transit told The Straits Times that its NS-1 and NS-2 services will each be served by three MAN A22 diesel buses that the firm had acquired from SMRT in 2021. Each bus has a seating capacity of 43 passengers, with no standing passengers allowed.\n\nA total of 10 bus drivers will be deployed to operate the two new night bus services. A&S Transit said. \"We do hope to hire more young bus captains to come on board specifically for these two routes,\" the company added.\n\nA&S Transit’s NS-1 and NS-2 services will each be served by three MAN A22 diesel buses that the firm had acquired from SMRT in 2021. PHOTO: A&S TRANSIT\n\nLTA previously said that the decision to discontinue SMRT and SBST's NightRider and Nite Owl bus services came after careful evaluation of various factors, including ridership.\n\nDemand for the public night bus services was low even before the Covid-19 pandemic, LTA had said, and the withdrawal of the services would free up finite resources that could then be reallocated to meet new demand.\n\nWhen asked by ST, LTA did not provide specific ridership figures for the NightRider and Nite Owl services, nor did it say how much the public night bus services had cost to operate.\n\nST also asked A&S Transit about the financial viability of its new night bus routes, given the previously low ridership for similar services.\n\nIn response, the firm said it expects to break even within six months. This is despite fuel and manpower costs rising by 70 per cent due to recent inflation, the company added.\n\nAn A&S Transit spokesman said the firm had done some research before deciding on the two new bus routes, which are targeted at newer estates with potentially higher demand while still serving less accessible areas.\n\n\"We still have much to learn and improve upon, as this is our first foray into night bus services,\" the spokesman added. \"We hope to gather more insights on what the public is looking for in night bus services, and to introduce more routes in future,\" he said.\n\nLTA told ST that it is open to proposals from commercial transport operators which wish to provide after-hours bus services for certain locations and routes.\n\nCompanies that wish to operate a bus service that charges fares and runs on a fixed timetable and route with two or more stops within Singapore are required to apply for a Class 2 Bus Service Licence.\n\nLTA said it has approved A&S Transit's application for two of these licences, as well as its use of selected public bus stops for immediate pickups and drop-offs.\n\nBy\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\nBUSES\n\nPUBLIC TRANSPORT\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 9, 2025, 12:42am\n\nMan arrested over bottle thrown at SMRT bus\n\nJul 7, 2025, 12:32am\n\nPassenger injured after bottle thrown at bus leaves hole in window\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:18am\n\nSMRT to extend selected train, bus services on eve of Hari Raya Haji\n\nMay 19, 2025, 10:36pm\n\nNew bus service 230M linking Kim Keat and Toa Payoh Bus Interchange to start on June 8\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b7cfc6d02c91a7450dea2faedb037b0c05891af9e687383df1fb5c4de47dce3b/a22202_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Private bus charter company A&S Transit is launching its new night bus services to cater to the recovering nightlife scene. \n", "caption": "Private bus charter company A&S Transit is launching its new night bus services to cater to the recovering nightlife scene.

Oil prices are seen to be on an uptrend this year because of higher demand from China, which has all but lifted Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nBut ironically, China is also seen as exporting more refined products, which can depress the wholesale prices of diesel and petrol here. According to market research firm S&P Global, the Chinese government has raised the export quota for its first batch of refined oil products for 2023 by 46 per cent.\n\nAccording to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker set up by the Consumers Association of Singapore, pump operators Caltex, Shell and SPC lowered posted pump rates just before the Chinese New Year weekend, with cuts of between three and five cents a litre.\n\nThe adjustments have brought the prices of these brands more in line with pre-discount rates posted by the two remaining operators - Esso and Sinopec.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 08:49am\n\nCOE prices rise across the board\n\nMore related stories\n\nDiesel is now $2.63 a litre at Sinopec and $2.64 elsewhere. For petrols, the 92-octane grade is now $2.65 a litre at Caltex, Esso and SPC - the only brands offering the grade. The popular 95-octane grade is $2.69 at SPC and $2.70 elsewhere.\n\nThe 98-octane fuel is $3.22 a litre at Shell and $3.17 elsewhere; and the so-called premium 98-octane grade is $3.39 at Caltex, $3.44 at Shell and $3.30 at Sinopec.\n\nPrice differences are greater after discount. For 92-octane petrol, prices range from $2.17 a litre (Caltex, OCBC 365 card and Esso, DBS Esso card) to $2.28 (Esso, Citibank Cash Back card and other OCBC cards). For the 95 grade, prices range from $2.12 at Sinopec (OCBC cards) to $2.32 a litre at Esso and Shell (various cards).\n\nFor 98-octane fuel, discounted rates range from $2.49 at Sinopec (OCBC cards) to $2.77 at Shell (various cards).\n\nPump operators raised prices almost immediately after the GST rate was increased by one percentage point to 8 per cent on Jan 1. With the latest revision, pump prices are now back to their lowest since January 2022.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nPetrol pump prices fall close to lowest level since Jan amid deepening fear of global recession\n\nST Explains: Why have fuel pump prices been on a roller-coaster ride?

If you give blood from a vaccinated donor to an unvaccinated person, the person receiving the transfusion does not become vaccinated.\"\n\n'Profitable falsehoods'\n\nGeorge Della Pietra, a Swiss naturopath founded Safe Blood Donation, a global mediation service that falsely labels mRNA coronavirus vaccines a \"health threat\" and seeks to connect unvaccinated blood donors with recipients.\n\nThe Zurich-based nonprofit offers to obtain \"fresh or canned\" unvaccinated blood for its patrons, according to Safe Blood's website, which says it has a presence across western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, Asia and Africa.\n\nAFP's email to Pietra requesting comment elicited a reply from Safe Blood's media director.\n\n\"There are a large number of scientists and doctors who not only have great concerns about the Covid vaccines, but are convinced that they also enter the body via the blood through the back door, so to speak, and remain there,\" wrote Clinton Ohlers, the media director, quoting from the website.\n\nThat directly contradicts scientific assertions.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nAs Covid-19 continues to spread, so does misinformation about it\n\nNobel laureate urges scientists to leverage on people’s trust in them to tackle misinformation\n\n\"Blood donations from individuals who have received a Covid-19 vaccine are safe for transfusion,\" Jessa Merrill, from the American Red Cross, told AFP.\n\n\"Similar to other vaccines... the Covid-19 vaccine is designed to generate an immune response to help protect an individual from illness, but vaccine components themselves are not found within the bloodstream.\"\n\nSafe Blood's members are required to pay an initial joining fee of €50 (S$72), followed by 20 euros each subsequent year, according to its website.\n\n\"The 'safe blood' movement is absolutely based 100 percent in anti-vaccine misinformation,\" said Wallace.\n\n\"As with all anti-vaccine misinformation, appealing to people's fears is sadly profitable.\"\n\nSperm and breast milk\n\nThe demand to remain \"pure\" reaches beyond blood to social media posts soliciting sperm from unvaccinated men - conspiracy theorists speculate online that the precious commodity will be the \"next Bitcoin\" - as well as breast milk from unvaccinated mothers.\n\nThese requests appear to stem from belief in the debunked claims that Covid vaccines can cause infertility or alter the human DNA.\n\nDemand for \"unvaccinated\" blood is unclear, but experts say it would be a challenge to procure it in countries with high vaccination rates.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration in the United States, where more than 80 percent of the population has received at least one Covid jab, says it does not require blood collectors to test for vaccination status.\n\nHospitals are also not able to inform the status of donated blood to patients.\n\n\"Is the US blood supply tainted?\" screamed a headline from Children's Health Defence, a nonprofit founded by Robert Kennedy Jr, a known purveyor of vaccine misinformation.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nChina seeks to quell Covid-19 falsehoods amid panic-buying of drugs\n\nCovid-19 misinformation bolsters anti-vaccine movement\n\nIt falsely asserted that the country's vaccination campaign may have \"contaminated the country's blood supply.\"\n\nAn AFP reporter who infiltrated one of the closed \"pure bloods\" Facebook groups found posts vilifying doctors administering vaccines as \"an arm of the state.\"\n\nOther posts contained a cartoon image of a nurse holding a syringe and standing in a field full of skulls, and another of \"victims\" tumbling out of a vaccine bottle in crutches and wheelchairs.\n\nAnother post contained a video of a shirtless muscular man headbutting and smashing a car window in what was claimed to be a public outburst against vaccines. - AFP\n\nRelated Stories\n\n‘Kraken’ coronavirus subvariant: Why it is causing concern\n\nAll around the world, Covid-19 surveillance is faltering\n\nWe may be entering Covid-19’s least predictable year yet\n\nWill a China Covid-19 wave set back endemic living in Singapore?\n\nCovid-19 variants in China also detected in Malaysia\n\nHow bad is China’s Covid-19 outbreak?

The film secured four other nominations, including for visual effects and costume design.\n\nBassett was previously nominated for a best actress Academy Award for her portrayal as Tina Turner in the biopic What's Love Got To Do With It.\n\nDisney's Black Panther sequel sold around US$330 million in tickets and set a November record in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the sequel, the character King T'Challa dies at the opening, a script change made after actor Chadwick Boseman passed away from cancer in 2020 just before filming started.\n\nMarvel decided not to recast T'Challa. Instead, writer and director Ryan Coogler crafted a script that put female characters at the forefront.\n\n\"Ramonda is a love letter that reflects and acknowledges what we women do everyday,\" Bassett said.\n\nHer nomination challenges a long-held belief by many big names in Hollywood, including directors Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino, that Marvel films are not real cinema.\n\n\"They seem to me to be closer to theme parks than they are to movies as I've known and loved them throughout my life, and that in the end, I don't think they're cinema,\" Scorsese wrote in the New York Times in 2019, igniting backlash.\n\nDespite that kind of criticism, the first Black Panther won three Academy Awards after garnering seven Oscar nominations in 2019, including the first Best Picture nomination for a super hero movie.\n\nBassett is joined in the category by fellow nominees Hong Chau from The Whale, Kerry Condon from The Banshees of Inisherin, and Jamie Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu from Everything Everywhere All at Once. - REUTERS\n\nMovies\n\nMarvel\n\noscars\n\nacademy awards\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nAirwallex Singapore\n\nWhy businesses need to understand the differences in Chinese Renminbi (CNH vs CNY)\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c721edf8413e1426c712b35a1430315bad623f7c3a7b98534134f32bdf5fc0ba/angelabassett.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Angela Bassett made history as the first Marvel Cinematic Universe star to be nominated for an acting Oscar for her Black Panther: Wakanda Forever role as Queen Ramonda.", "caption": "Angela Bassett made history as the first Marvel Cinematic Universe star to be nominated for an acting Oscar for her Black Panther: Wakanda Forever role as Queen Ramonda.

Recording rights govern reproduction and distribution.\n\nThe flurry of sales came amid a wider conversation over artists' ownership of the work, amplified in large part by Taylor Swift, who has found resounding success as she re-records her first six albums so she can control their master recording rights.\n\nThat moved stemmed from Swift's very public feud with Scooter Braun, the music manager whose company once owned her original masters, and later sold them to the investment firm Shamrock Holdings.\n\nBraun has been Bieber's manager for 15 years, and in a statement said \"when Justin made the decision to make a catalogue deal we quickly found the best partner to preserve and grow this amazing legacy was Merck and Hipgnosis.\"\n\n\"Justin is truly a once in a generation artist and that is reflected and acknowledged by the magnitude of this deal.\" - AFP\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nBruce Springsteen sells music catalogue in $683m deal\n\nSting sells his songwriting catalogue for an estimated $404m\n\nCelebrities\n\nMusic\n\nSTREAMING - MUSIC/VIDEO/CONTENT\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwww.airwallex.com\n\nHow Little Blossom scaled efficiently from Singapore to Asia with Airwallex’s all-in-one solution.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5b9cd72fa9e6872bafeefd1a6877457ecbfbb4a5f752e9ac54ebec73ce05fa78/FILES-US-ENTERTAINMENT-MUSIC-CANADA-BIEBER-RIGHTS-160751.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "According to the deal, Hipgnosis has acquired Justin Bieber’s publishing copyrights to his 290-song back catalog.", "caption": "According to the deal, Hipgnosis has acquired Justin Bieber’s publishing copyrights to his 290-song back catalog.

The most-watched Oscars took place 25 years ago as megahit Titanic swept the honors.\n\n\"When the movies are popular with the public, the public feels invested and tunes in to see who wins,\" Feinberg said. \"This is setting them up for success as much as anything could.\"\n\nSixteen of the 20 people who clinched acting nods were first-time nominees.\n\nThey included Austin Butler for his portrayal of rock legend Elvis Presley, and Colin Farrell, who starred as an Irish farmer obsessed with restoring a friendship in Banshees. Top Gun star Tom Cruise did not make it into the field.\n\nButler recalled the positive reaction to his performance from Elvis's daughter Lisa Marie Presley, who died this month of cardiac arrest at age 54.\n\n\"I just wish she was here to celebrate today with us,\" Butler told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nFor best actress, Cate Blanchett, nominated for her portrayal of a manipulative orchestra conductor in Tar, will compete with Everything Everywhere star Michelle Yeoh and Michelle Williams of The Fabelmans, among others.\n\nWinners will be voted on by the roughly 10,000 actors, producers, directors and film craftspeople who make up the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe academy added more women and people of color to its ranks after the #OscarsSoWhite uproars of 2015 and 2016, and it increased membership from outside the United States.\n\nThis year, seven of the 20 acting nominees were people of color. They included Everything Everywhere stars Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu and Ke Huy Quan, a child star in 1984's Indiana Jones And The Temple of Doom and now a front-runner for best supporting actor.\n\n\"Never in my wildest dreams could I imagine this moment,\" Quan said in a statement.\n\nAngela Bassett was nominated for best supporting actress for playing Queen Ramonda in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and Cuban-Spanish actress Ana de Armas received a nomination for her turn as Marilyn Monroe in Blonde.\n\nSmith, who starred in slavery drama Emancipation, was not nominated. He was been banned from attending the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Rock, but he remains eligible for nominations and awards.\n\nTraditional studios dominated this year's nominations after recent inroads from streaming services. Apple TV+ nabbed best picture last year for heartwarming drama CODA.\n\nThis time, Disney received the most nominations, a total of 22, for movies including Avatar, Banshees and animated Turning Red. Banshees earned four acting nominations among nine overall nods.\n\n\"Massive thanks to the Academy. I think we're going to have a fun night!\" Banshees director Martin McDonagh, also a nominee, said in a statement.\n\nStreaming service Netflix released All Quiet On The Western Front, which tied Banshees with nine nominations.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nGolden Globes 2023: A night of uplift for overlooked, underappreciated nominees\n\nMarilyn Monroe biopic Blonde roasted with eight Razzie nominations\n\noscars\n\nAWARDS AND PRIZES\n\nactors\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nAirwallex Singapore\n\nHow Igloohome scaled efficiently from Singapore to USA, Europe and APAC with Airwallex's help\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8de5a5bb7db8361fba53e300df91758f980d2a6ee76e92d0636ebb5e4c9c0656/eeaao_0001.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Everything Everywhere All At Once starring Michelle Yeoh.", "caption": "Everything Everywhere All At Once starring Michelle Yeoh.

This was introduced in 2016 to give rental households that had previously bought a subsidised flat the option to buy their second HDB flat on a shorter lease.\n\n\"I was having quite a hard time after my divorce, as I was also diagnosed with breast cancer. I didn't have enough CPF savings to buy my own home, so for almost 10 years I worked 12 hours a day, sometimes even on weekends and public holidays,\" said Madam Zaidah.\n\nThe 57-year-old is now a freelance massage therapist and lives with her son, 20, who is a student. She has two older children aged 32 and 33.\n\n\"When I was told about Fresh Start in 2018, I jumped at the opportunity,\" said Madam Zaidah, who opted for a 60-year lease. The flat cost about $141,000, including the resale levy, and she received $44,000 in grants.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:25am\n\nMedics treat 7 after Chai Chee block lift lobby blaze\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. After eight years of living in a rental flat, I can now just think of my monthly expenses and save for retirement,\" added Madam Zaidah, who managed to pay the purchase price in full.\n\nMinister of State for National Development Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said the HDB's home ownership support team was set up in 2019 to provide more dedicated support for households like Madam Zaidah's.\n\nThe team guides rental households through the process of home ownership - from planning their purchase till they collect their keys - while considering factors such as family and financial stability.\n\n\"When I meet those who have purchased a flat, there is a sense of achievement and happiness... Our aim is to help families living in public rental flats achieve home ownership and inter-generational mobility, so their children can move up the social ladder,\" said Dr Faishal.\n\nAs at December 2022, the team had reached out to about 1,400 rental households.\n\nDr Faishal said some tenants may face difficulty in buying a home as they do not have sufficient funds in their CPF Ordinary Account - this may be because they have freelance jobs, for instance. \"This is where the Community Link programme comes in, where we can share options for alternative employment with CPF contributions to introduce more stability and opportunities for home ownership.\"\n\nMadam Zaidah said having her own home was always the plan, as her rental flat was cramped and not conducive for her children.\n\n\"Now, I can have more built-ins, like a TV console and kitchen cabinets. And my children will have a place to live if anything happens to me,\" she added.\n\nBy\n\nIsabelle Liew\n\nRead articles by Isabelle Liew\n\nhdb\n\nrental\n\nHOUSING POLICY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 10, 2025, 02:49am\n\nPunggol resident harassed by debt collectors over former owner's loans\n\n13\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:15am\n\nFrom noise complaints to posting photos: The five-year dispute between Woodlands neighbours\n\n45\n\nJun 30, 2025, 05:35am\n\nSome 950,000 Singaporean households to get U-Save, S&CC rebates in July\n\n4\n\nJun 26, 2025, 06:36am\n\nToilet ceiling in Queenstown flat collapses as woman showers\n\n18\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/83c59faa20ad7d493d0c042c7e314bc2f5c28f105417351ceb6765cd02bbd275/rrhdba2401_5.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Madam Zaidah Ismail was able to buy a two-room flexi flat in Punggol at a more affordable price under the Fresh Start housing scheme in 2019. \n", "caption": "Madam Zaidah Ismail was able to buy a two-room flexi flat in Punggol at a more affordable price under the Fresh Start housing scheme in 2019.

She was so small, smaller than my hand... Nick and I were both standing there as they intubated her. I don't know how they even found what they needed (in her tiny body) to intubate her,\" Chopra added.\n\nThe couple spent the next three months at the neonatal intensive care unit at two hospitals in California, said Chopra. \"We spent every single day with her on my chest, on my husband's chest.

I just go out there and play the game.\"\n\nTsitsipas, who will become world No. 1 for the first time should he win the title, has thrived on the energy from the crowd in Melbourne.\n\nThe city has a large Greek population, including some of his extended family, and he considers this his \"home\" tournament.\n\nTsitsipas' best Slam result so far is reaching the French Open final in 2021, when falling to Novak Djokovic in five sets after holding a 2-0 lead.\n\nLehecka, ranked 71st, warned before the match he wanted revenge after losing to Tsitsipas in the semi-finals at Rotterdam in 2022.\n\nBut the 21-year-old, who beat 11th seed Cameron Norrie and sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime en route to the last eight, was immediately under the gun.\n\nTsitsipas worked five break points on his opening service game and got over the line when the Czech smacked a backhand volley wide.\n\nHe consolidated for a 3-0 lead and, with his strong first serve offering Lehecka few opportunities to strike back, coasted to the first set in 36 minutes, sealing it with an ace.\n\nTsitsipas saved five break points to hold in a crucial third game of the second set as Lehecka came alive and began applying pressure.\n\nBoth players dug in and it went with serve to a tiebreak, where the Greek kept his cool to take an early advantage that he never gave up.\n\nIn a close third set, Tsitsipas' second double fault of the night handed Lehecka three break points in game seven.\n\nBut he saved them all to hold, pumping the air in celebration.\n\nWith the bit between his teeth, the Greek star dialled up the pressure as Lehecka served to stay in the contest and a cross-court backhand earned him a match point which he converted.\n\n\"It felt different this time from any other match and the most important thing in the end is that I found a solution,\" said Tsitsipas.\n\nTo make his first final in Melbourne, Tsitsipas will have to get past Khachanov.\n\nThe Russian is into his second straight Grand Slam semi-final after a run to the same stage at last September's US Open.\n\n\"I think the first semi-finals which I did in US Open, that gave me an extra boost and extra confidence to show where I really am, what I can do when I'm at my best,\" said Khachanov.\n\n\"Physically also, after pre-season, I'm feeling really good so far.\" AFP\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas\n\nAUSTRALIAN OPEN (TENNIS)\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 23, 2022, 10:50pm\n\nTearful farewell as Federer's last match ends in defeat, fiery protest at Laver Cup\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nJan 28, 2022, 11:50am\n\nMedvedev takes down Tsitsipas to set up Nadal date in Aus Open final\n\nJan 26, 2022, 11:15am\n\nTerrific Tsitsipas demolishes Sinner to reach Aussie Open semi-finals\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f11c94ee9cad25597fe016548098fd7bf748596b2070ca599a06f04a262c4c3f/10426553.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Stefanos Tsitsipas (above) will meet Karen Khachanov in the Australian Open semi-finals.

The sport will be called Muay Thai at that event.\n\nThe two kingdoms have repeatedly clashed over their cultural heritage, with 2011 seeing several months of bloody military conflict over a disputed temple on the border.\n\nCambodia ultimately won that dispute when the UN's top court ruled in its favour.\n\nMuay Thai secured Olympic recognition as a sport in 2021 - but its pathway to the Olympic Games is uncertain because of safety concerns.

That year, he saddled nine winners.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe snared a few feature successes as the years went by, the biggest being the Group 1 Emirates Singapore Derby with Chase Me in 2012.\n\nKoh was ecstatic he could reach his 600th Kranji victory on Monday's auspicious Chinese New Year meeting with his pocket dynamo Flying Nemo.\n\nHis two-from-two hero weighed only 429kg but has a big heart.\n\nOn Oct 8, the Nemo Stable-owned three-year-old New Zealand-bred also finished with a pulverising run to take the $75,000 Restricted Maiden event over the Poly 1,000m.\n\n\"They said I was close, but I didn't know it was this one,\" said Koh, after Flying Nemo produced a dazzling turn of foot to nab Opunake (Mohd Zaki) within the shadows of the winning post and score by three-quarter lengths in 1min 5.57sec.\n\n\"He's a small horse, very young and new, so we don't want to use him too much.\n\n\"I gave him a break after his last win and sent him out when he's fresh.\n\n\"I thought he's a good chance. Let's hope he comes back well, and we'll take it race by race with him.\"\n\nKoh, 50, heaped thanks to the Singapore Turf Club for the opportunity to train at Kranji.\n\nHe was also grateful to all his owners and friends who contributed towards his milestone.\n\n\"Of course, my colleagues who have toiled with me over the years. It's been a long and winding road,\" he added.\n\n\"I try to make it a point to score something during Chinese New Year. People say like 'ang bao horses'.\n\n\"As for this year, I hope that our racing can start to recover from the setbacks we suffered during the worst Covid years.\"\n\nBoth Exceed Natural ($23) and Flying Nemo ($12) were ridden by jockey Simon Kok.\n\nHe had resumed riding after recovering from\" space=\"1\"a hairline fracture to his right scapula during his three-week stint in Maisons-Laffitte and Chantilly in Paris in December.\n\nHe fell while doing trackwork in France but felt none the worse then.\n\n\"It went unnoticed and I continued to work, until the first meeting here, and I felt the pain on that day,\" said the two-time Singapore champion apprentice jockey.\n\nHe had to give up his rides, including four which won, on the first day of the 2023 Singapore season on Jan 7.\n\n\"I went to the hospital to do an X-ray, which showed that there was a hairline fracture on the right scapula, so I rested for a while and missed two meetings. But I'm 100 per cent (fit) now.\"\n\nMonday's Chinese New Year meeting also saw jockey-turned-trainer Kuah Cheng Tee achieving his 100th win milestone with $22 chance Last Samurai (Louis-Philippe Beuzelin).\n\n\"So happy to get my first winner and also my 100th winner on Chinese New Year,\" said the 48-year-old Singaporean, who bagged his first career victory with Smart Fortune on April 8, 2016.\n\n\"I expected him to run a very good race. I wasn't worried about the rain at all because American-breds tend to handle the wet ground easily.\n\n\"You need to ride him in the right place and get the right pace. He is a challenging horse, but also very honest.\n\n\"We'll see how he pulls up before we plan his next race.\n\n\"The future is filled with uncertainties, so honestly, I have not set any goals for myself, given the current circumstances.\n\n\"We try our very best to train every horse and wish for more winners as we go. It's also very important to have the support of owners.\"\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/da150b27c9d87e681904ef0bbf15ecbca4508703074f839f596c613dfbdc6d2e/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Trainer Desmond Koh's 600th winner Flying Nemo (Simon Kok) returning to scale after scoring his second straight success at Kranji on Monday.\n\n", "caption": "Trainer Desmond Koh's 600th winner Flying Nemo (Simon Kok) returning to scale after scoring his second straight success at Kranji on Monday.

No leisurely breakfast.\n\nThere was work to do and, like soldiers in a cavalry, men and horses were up at dawn doing their everyday chores.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nAs were the diehards in the otherwise ghostly empty stands.\n\nEven with the handicaps for Saturday's races would be released only on Tuesday evening, they turned up at dawn to watch our equine beauties being put through their paces.\n\nPlenty of them, despite it being a public holiday.\n\nThey saw the pair of James Peters' runners, Healthy Star and Endless, match strides over the 600m in 37.1sec.\n\nPartnered by Krisna Thangamani and Benny Woodworth respectively, they caught the eye.\n\nEndless was a winner two starts back when claiming a 1,700m race with Krisna in the saddle.\n\nHe is engaged in Saturday's Class 5 event over the Polytrack 1,200m.\n\nAs for Healthy Star, his last few runs have not inspired confidence but it was around this time in 2022 - Feb 2 - that he put together a winning show.\n\nHe runs in the Class 5 Polytrack 1,100m event and you may want to have a small wager on him. He is long overdue for a win.\n\nThen there was Sun Palace, who is running in the same race as Endless.\n\nTrained by Desmond Koh, who saddled his 600th milestone success on Monday, the handsome bay worked like he meant business, clocking 38.6sec for the trip.\n\nUp in the saddle was Kranji's champion jockey Manoel Nunes.\n\nAfter sitting quiet for the first two meetings of the year, Koh flexed his muscles on Monday, saddling a double from a team of just five runners.\n\nAnd they were good winners, too, with Exceed Natural and Flying Nemo.\n\nNow that he has hit the ground running, more can be expected from his yard and Sun Palace is one of them who looks ripe and ready.\n\nNot to be shortchanged, the faithful in the stands were treated to a duel in the drizzle.\n\nIt was between Italian Revolution and newcomer Ten Ha. And it was one of the star workouts of the morning.\n\nFrom the Shane Baertschiger yard, Italian Revolution had the services of Matthew Kellady, while Ten Ha was piloted by comeback kid Mohd Zaki.\n\nThe pair eventually covered the distance in 37.5sec.\n\nCredit to the newcomer Ten Ha, who gave Italian Revolution a couple of lengths' headstart, but drew level at the finish.\n\nA New Zealand-bred by Niagara, he deserves to come under notice in the Restricted Maiden Division 2 event over 1,200m on turf.\n\nBut it was all about Italian Revolution's work.\n\nStill a three-year-old, he has already shown signs of big things to come.\n\nTake that debut in October.\n\nUp against some precocious youngsters, he ran second to Flying Nemo.\n\nThat day, he attempted to lead all the way but was caught by the big-hearted pocket dynamo, who cleared away to an impressive two-length win.\n\nStill, and all things considered, that had to be something.\n\nAfter all, we now know just how good Flying Nemo has turned out to be.\n\nA month later, Italian Revolution - then under notice by astute racegoers - again found one to beat in Sabah Ace.\n\nThat day, punters sent him out as the $23 second pick.\n\nThen there was that last run on Jan 7.\n\nCarrying the hopes of the grandstand, he again had to play bridesmaid, beaten by a length by Mykyta, after leading for most of the short and sharp Poly 1,100m trip.\n\nBaertschiger has still to get his first winner for 2023.\n\nBut it is early days yet and, with a horse like Italian Revolution in his barn, he is not going to be sitting quiet for too long.\n\nHis charge is running in the Restricted Maiden Division 1 event over 1,200m on turf.\n\nThe Shane Baertschiger-trained Italian Revolution (Matthew Kellady) finishing second to the David Kok-trained Sabah Ace (Ronnie Stewart) over the Polytrack 1,100m on Nov 5, 2022.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nExperience ultra smooth 10Gbps Broadband + WiFi 7 connectivity\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/99ab514a21e8f482e74e4a0e7a7722c1f2990b2c2b43eea5b3ad3a623e0ab673/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "On Tuesday's sparkling gallop, the three-year-old looks ready to score at his fourth start at Kranji.", "caption": "On Tuesday's sparkling gallop, the three-year-old looks ready to score at his fourth start at Kranji.

He was touched off on this course last time out and should be able to go one better. (9) LAZY GUY has come good as a five-year-old but always seems to find one better of late. He should have a big chance of breaking his duck in a small field. (8) AXEL COLLINS has run his two best recent races on this course and should finish in the money. (3) RARE FLAG is struggling but was not too far back on this course last start. The gelding can finish in the money.\n\nRace 2 (1,200m)\n\n(3) MASERATI ROAR has shown some promise, with a second and a third from three starts. More is expected as he races with blinkers for the first time. (5) LUCKY DOLLAR is lightly raced and has improved with each outing. Keagan de Melo has jumped off Royal Oasis to ride the gelding. (2) ROYAL OASIS has had plenty of chances. He finished close in his last two starts. Switching to the turf, he must have a strong chance. (9) MAJESTIC REIGN has been close-up in all three starts. He tried further last run and the drop in trip should suit.\n\nRace 3 (1,400m)\n\n(3) AFRICAN DUSK was a beaten short-priced favourite over this trip last time and was rested. The gelding goes well over this trip and gets a useful 2.5kg claimer aboard. (1) UNCLE LUCKY has been constantly improving and showed up well back on turf last start. He meets little of note. (5) UNSOLVED RIDDLE started at long odds on debut. He raced greenly and was not far back over a sprint. He is sure to make good improvement. (4) HUNTERS ARROW is consistent and is seldom far back. Distance-suited, the gelding should be in the mix.\n\nRace 4 (1,500m)\n\n(7) SOUTHERN CAPE comes from an in-form stable. She is resuming from a short break but her form is solid. She ran a cracking race behind easy Michael Roberts Stakes winner Cape Eagle last time. (4) LUCKY MISS has been knocking on the door. She is course-and-distance suited and should run another honest race. (8) SEA EAGLE has been rested but has ability. With only 52.5kg to shoulder, she will be a threat. (3) MARIA COROLINA has never been far back of late. The light weight and ideal distance should see her put in a big effort.\n\nRace 5 (1,200m)\n\nThe Group 1-winning (5) PEARL OF ASIA has dropped further in the handicap. Although still carrying top weight, he has his third run after a break and showed signs of a form return with a tongue-tie. (12) ISHNANA got no favours last time when fourth at Greyville. Before that, he stormed home to win. He has put in his best with blinkers and he goes well for this rookie. Stablemate (7) AFRICAN SKYLINE has been out of the money only once in 12 starts.

Each additional month of Covid-19 lockdown had been joining a feeding frenzy of sorts on the substrata of sweetness and empathy that undergirds any relationship, leaving only rancour and exasperation between me and my ex.\n\nMy relationship - to paraphrase what Ernest Hemingway said of bankruptcy - fell apart gradually at first, and then suddenly.\n\nThe upshot was that my comfy swivel chair and oversized desk stuffed with all manner of business cards, note books, slide decks and books I had promised to review but had not yet were marooned in my home office in my painstakingly remodelled apartment.\n\nNow I was covering South-east Asia's economic deepfreeze - from Vietnam's treatment of factory workers to Thailand's evaporating tourism trade - from my Mac propped up in a hotel bed or AirBnB kitchen table.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 23, 2025, 01:20am\n\nS'porean man mistaken for ex-DBS CEO Piyush Gupta says he told woman it wasn't him\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut as planet Earth completed its rotation around the sun to where it roughly was when my own world imploded, it was time to escape the gravitational pull of Bali's Canggu-Seminyak nexus where I had shuttled between my home office du jour, gym and beach walks with my newly adopted dog, Typo.\n\nAdding to the urgency: easing Covid-19 restrictions meant I was no longer mostly alone in my tropical bubble.\n\nMonthly overseas visitor growth was averaging more than 40 per cent and will have approached the two-million mark for the full year by the time the data is available in February.\n\nBut the vast majority of the new arrivals were opting for the main touristy places like Canggu and Ubud. The congestion will only intensify as Chinese holidaymakers return this year.\n\nTourism officials say that only about 5 per cent of arrivals were venturing to places like Buleleng Regency, a 1,400 sq km swathe of Northern Bali with only 650,000 people.\n\nThat is where I wanted to go.\n\nPerks of the job\n\nBefore I do that, a word about one of the little-known perquisites of being a reporter for a big newspaper: I get invited to stuff. Nice stuff. All-expenses-paid stuff. But as a writer normally focusing on supply-chain issues and foreign direct investment, I turn these down.\n\nBut with my new-found ambition to turn the page on the tragicomedy that was the past three years of my life, I accepted a marketing guru friend's invitation to review his client's designer mountain getaway.\n\nAlam Mountain was, I was assured, pitched at discerning travellers, offering a breath of fresh air. I am discerning. I needed a breath of fresh air. I accepted.\n\nAlam Mountain, in effect, turns the conventional villa design inside out.\n\nAlam Mountain resort is styled as a bridge to nature and set 800m above sea level, offering commanding views. PHOTO: ALAM MOUNTAIN\n\nI arrived expecting bedrooms and the living room if not under one roof then within a compound. Instead, two bungalows and the entertainment space comprise three distinct components atop an open platform.\n\nThe detached Gladak-style bungalows with their pitched roofs are fitted with antique panels repurposed from traditional longhouses from Java. Each is fitted with walk-in closets, en-suites and private reading areas.\n\nStyled a \"bridge to nature\" and perched some 800m above sea level, Alam offered your faithful scribe commanding views.\n\nTo the west was Mount Agung. To the east: the Unesco heritage-listed rice terraces of Jatiluwih. In between: a verdant expanse stretching south to Ubud and beyond to the increasingly congested centres from whence he escaped.\n\nThe result is luxurious exposure to the vicissitudes of the tropics at elevation. A crystal clear sunrise set to the soundtrack of the benign din of thousands of distant roosters could quickly give way to wafts of mist pouring through the living room.\n\n\"It's an exquisite sensation,\" Mr Mattias Klueber, who manages marketing and media relations for Alam Mountain's Swiss owners, told The Straits Times, referring to the experience of lounging among the clouds.\n\nAlam Mountain turns the conventional villa design inside out. PHOTO: ALAM MOUNTAIN\n\nWork on the villa dates back to 2010 when the Zurich-based investors bought the land.\n\nThey envisioned a retreat into the lush greenery of northern Bali - ideal for a writer (that is me) or a couple (not so much at that point) seeking seclusion, while providing meaningful and stable work for some residents of the nearby village of Lumbang.\n\n\"You are alone, but not lonely,\" said Mr Klueber.\n\nA friendly staff served exquisite meals and friendly banter before fading away back into the mist.\n\nI was ensorcelled. I wanted more. And so bitten by the travel-writing bug, I struck out two months later on my second invitation to hilltop luxury - away from the thundering hordes. This time to Elevate Bali by Hanging Gardens which, as it happens, was about 30km from Alam Mountain.\n\nElevate Bali, which fully opens in January, is a five-star property ringed with 26 private villas, each with a heated pool. It is aiming for well-heeled travellers with limited holiday time. If you come here, it is because you want to make the most of your week or so off.\n\nPrivate villas ring the five-star Elevate Bali by Hanging Gardens. PHOTO: ELEVATE BALI BY HANGING GARDENS\n\nSensible people would opt for its airport transfer for the two-hour-plus drive up to Munduk in Buleleng. Not me. My version of living my best life meant hopping on my trusty 125cc Honda scooter, to wind up the spine of mountains in Bali's north, skirting Lake Lake Buyan, eventually pulling on my rarely used long-sleeved pullover, as I gazed out to Lake Tamblingan.\n\n\"You can experience something unique here,\" Mr Agus Suananda, Elevate's owner, and former head of Buleleng Regency, told me on arrival as we looked out over the Lovina and Bali's northern coast line 1,100m below.\n\n\"I wanted guests to feel like they are part of nature.\"\n\nAll the public spaces and villas enjoy magnificent views. Once it is completed, the spa and with four detached treatment bungalows will offer guests the experience of untethering from reality by way of massage from a vantage point more than a kilometre above the valley below.\n\nAll the public spaces and villas at Elevate Bali enjoy magnificent views. PHOTO: ELEVATE BALI BY HANGING GARDENS\n\nUp here, you are in an ongoing dialogue with the elements. Sun yields to mist, which turns to rain, which turns to mist and eventually to a distant war of lightning harmlessly playing out over the Bali Sea.\n\nThe light show was there for me to lazily ponder with my new-found flame: my own lightning in a bottle.\n\nThat is right. I was on the market again.\n\nAnd as we sat there, I thought back on the past three years of Covid-19, the lockdowns, the isolation and the heartache, and tried to make sense of this unfamiliar feeling that was as exquisite as the mist meandering around my feet back at Alam Mountain.\n\nIt was hope. Hemingway would say I had been broken by the world these past three years. Maybe we all have been. But now I was stronger in the broken places.\n\nAlam Mountain’s investors had envisioned a retreat into the lush greenery of northern Bali. PHOTO: ALAM MOUNTAIN\n\nGetting there\n\nGaruda and Singapore Airlines codeshare five flights daily between Singapore and Bali for roughly $420 for a round trip. Scoot operates three daily flights with fares as low as $220. Other services include KLM and Indonesia Air Asia.\n\nAlam Mountain and Elevate Bali by Hanging Gardens both offer airport transfers that can take 90 minutes and two hours respectively.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nElevate Bali is offering one-night stays in January starting from four million rupiah (S$350) for two people including breakfast Go to www.elevatebali.com/accommodations\n\nRates for Alam Mountain start at US$350 (S$460) a night for four guests including breakfast.

But the Thai capital boasts some excellent Western restaurants too.\n\nI have uncovered many gems since I first travelled there in the 1980s, including the constantly evolving La Normandie at Mandarin Oriental Bangkok and the award-winning Eat Me in Silom.\n\nMore recently, I visited the two-Michelin-starred Suhring, which has become one of the hottest names in food circles since it opened in 2016 and is currently ranked No. 40 in The World's 50 Best Restaurants list.\n\nI also found time to check out three stunning new eateries that opened in the past two Covid-stricken years, which foreign visitors have not descended on yet. These range from fine-dining restaurants in luxury hotels to a cafe in the basement of a mall, proving there is good grub for every budget.\n\nHere are some new places to hit next time you find yourself in Bangkok.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 11:28pm\n\nS'pore businessman nabbed before flight at Bangkok airport over suspected tax evasion\n\nMore related stories\n\nCote by Mauro Colagreco\n\nAddress:\n\nCapella Bangkok, 300/2 Charoen Krung Road, Yan Nawa, Sathon, Bangkok 10120\n\nTel:\n\n+66-2098-3888\n\nOpen\n\n: Noon to 2pm, 6 to 10pm (Wednesdays to Sundays). Closed on Mondays and Tuesdays\n\nInfo\n\n: www.cotebkk.com\n\nChef Mauro Colagreco became a familiar name to foodies here after his restaurant Mirazur in the French Riviera was crowned No. 1 at The World's 50 Best Restaurants ceremony held in Singapore in 2019. It boasts three Michelin stars.\n\nThe chef is also behind Fiamma at Capella Singapore, which opened in June. But that is a casual restaurant with an entirely different vibe from the fine-dining Mirazur.\n\nFor something closer to the original concept but not too far from home, go to Cote by Mauro Colagreco at the Capella Bangkok, which overlooks the Chao Phraya river. It opened in October 2020 and has already been awarded one Michelin star.\n\nCote by Mauro Colagreco at the Capella Bangkok serves Mediterranean cuisine in an elegant and homely setting. PHOTO: CAPELLA BANGKOK\n\nLike the hotel, the restaurant's interiors are luxurious and understated. Large windows afford not just the view of the water, but also let in a flood of light during the day. The mood at dinner turns dark and romantic, illuminated by twinkling lights on the opposite bank of the river.\n\nThe kitchen team is led by chef Davide Garavaglia, who joined Mirazur in 2015. He offers four set menus for lunch on weekdays, priced from 1,800 baht (S$67) for four courses to 5,800 baht for seven courses. For dinner and weekend lunch, the menus range from 4,100 baht for five courses to 6,500 for nine courses. There is no a la carte option.\n\nThe Mediterranean cooking is inspired by Mirazur and the menus include some of its signature dishes. For instance, plump for the roast pigeon as the main course, one of the most famous dishes at the mothership restaurant.\n\nThe pigeon dish at Cote by Mauro Colagreco is based on one of the signature dishes from the chef’s Mirazur restaurant and is not to be missed. ST PHOTO: WONG AH YOKE\n\nWhen it arrives at the table, the pigeon breast looks so pink that I approach it with apprehension. I don't like pigeon that is cooked rare as it tends to have a gamey flavour, but this actually tastes perfect, with the meat cooked just right.\n\nI like, too, that the chef uses almost every part of the bird. The leg is confit while the liver is turned into a mousse and stuffed into an olive. You even see the little roasted heart on the plate next to a bok choy.\n\nThat is not an onion but rolled-up slices of squid, served at Cote by Mauro Colagreco. ST PHOTO: WONG AH YOKE\n\nAnother interesting dish is squid that is cut into very thin strips and rolled in a circular pattern to look like a sliced onion. It comes with artichokes and a \"bagna cauda\" sauce made with garlic and anchovies.\n\nAnd if you are surprised to see a macaron served as a starter and not at the end of the meal, that is because its bright red colour comes from beetroot and its shell is filled with savoury cream and caviar.\n\nMaison Dunand\n\nAddress:\n\n55 Soi Sueksa Witthaya, Silom, Bang Rak, Bangkok 10500\n\nTel\n\n: +66-65639-0515\n\nOpen\n\n: Noon to 2pm (Saturdays and Sundays), 5.30 to 9pm (Thursdays to Mondays). Closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays\n\nInfo\n\n: maisondunand.com\n\nMaison Dunand may have opened only in September, but its chef-owner Arnaud Dunand Sauthier is no stranger to Bangkok. He was the chef of the French restaurant Le Normandie at the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok from 2012 to 2021, and is widely credited for earning the establishment its two Michelin stars since the guide was launched in Thailand in 2017.\n\nWith his new restaurant, the name of which means \"Dunand's Home\" in French, the chef returns to his roots in the Savoie region in the French Alps, but also takes inspiration from his travels around the world.\n\nHe uses seasonal ingredients from places such as northern Thailand, Japan and Europe in contemporary French cooking. This includes a mountain pig from the Alps that is served as a main course for the 4,800 baht seven-course dinner menu. It comes with a plump Utah oyster sitting on top. At the table, the server drizzles a seaweed sauce over everything. Think of it as a novel surf-and-turf.\n\nA starter of mirabelle plum with beef and sardine at Maison Dunand. ST PHOTO: WONG AH YOKE\n\nOther courses include a starter comprising slices of mirabelle plum folded into the shape of a blossom, with pieces of Miyazaki beef and sardines woven in. Or a decadent combination of Kristal caviar on top of uni and potato mousse.\n\nThe 2,600 baht lunch is a five-course menu with different dishes, such as a milk-fed lamb neck with pumpkin and goat cheese.\n\nDespite its Alpine leanings, the cooking is light and bright and you do not end the meal with a heavy stomach. That sense of cheer is reflected in the ambience too, especially at lunch when light streams in through the glass windows and bounces off the restaurant's pastel palette interiors, adorned with artworks of cows.\n\nTables are set outdoors at Maison Dunand, which also has an adjoining casual eatery and bakery called Alpea. ST PHOTO: WONG AH YOKE\n\nBesides the fine-dining restaurant, there is a casual eatery and bakery in an adjoining building called Alpea. It wasn't open when I was there in late September, but I sneaked a peek at its fake fireplace and rustic brick walls.\n\nOutside is an elevated wooden platform where tables are set among the foliage for those who enjoy dining under the stars.\n\nCDGRE\n\nAddress\n\n: G15, G Floor, Siam Paragon, 991 Rama I Road, Pathum Wan, Bangkok 10330\n\nTel\n\n: +66-61269-6711\n\nOpen\n\n: 10am to 10pm daily\n\nInfo:\n\nwww.cdgrebkk.com\n\nTucked among an entire floor of eateries in the basement of Siam Paragon shopping mall, CDGRE would have escaped my attention had I not been instructed by a friend to check it out.\n\nIt has just a few small tables and looks like a typical cafe with standee banners outside displaying photos of simple Western dishes. Look more closely, however, and you see that some items carry names of famous chefs like Suhring's Pork Meatloaf Burger (360 baht) and Gaggan's Chicken Tikka Masala Burger (360 baht).\n\nCDGRE looks like a typical shopping mall cafe with standee banners outside.  ST PHOTO: WONG AH YOKE\n\nThat is because CDGRE (pronounced see-deegree), which opened in October 2021, is a collaboration by the Suhring brothers, Thomas and Mathias, who own the award-wining Suhring restaurant, celebrity chef Gaggan Anand and Carnival, a streetware fashion brand in Bangkok. Besides serving food and drinks, the cafe also has a small section selling Carnival merchandise emblazoned with the CDGRE logo.\n\nI am told the Crispy Pork Knuckle With Cabbage, Mustard, Spicy Relish (990 baht) is excellent, but it feeds two and I'm on my own. So I get the Duck Leg Risotto With Mushrooms & Parmesan Cheese (680 baht), which turns out to be one of the best risottos I've eaten in a long time.\n\nThe duck leg risotto at CDGRE is excellent and very good value for money. ST PHOTO: WONG AH YOKE\n\nThe rice is cooked perfectly with just the right amount of bite, and comes studded with generous chunks of mushroom. On top is a whole roasted duck leg that is deboned and boasts tender meat lined with a layer of crispy skin. A small mixed salad with the duck makes the dish a complete meal on its own.\n\nTry the coffee too, I was told, so I order a cappuccino (120 baht). It is amazing.\n\nWhat impresses me is that the chefs have put in so much effort to deliver quality food at decent prices instead of just relying on their fame to draw in crowds.\n\nThis is not to be missed, plus you can work off your lunch with some hardcore shopping. Siam Centre and Siam Discovery are right next to Siam Paragon, and MBK Center is just a short walk away.\n\nWong Ah Yoke\n\nSenior Food Correspondent\n\nBangkok\n\nthailand\n\nFOOD AND DRINK\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 1, 2025, 07:41am\n\nEarthquake tremors don't deter S'porean influencer from completing facelift in bangkok\n\nFeb 15, 2025, 10:55pm\n\n2 Singaporeans arrested in Bangkok gambling den\n\nNov 28, 2024, 08:25am\n\n'I really wanted to live': SQ321 passenger on turbulent trauma\n\nNov 23, 2024, 11:02pm\n\nS'pore man nabbed for allegedly faking bomb threat at Bangkok airport\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nUS-China Tariff Truce: What It Means for Markets and Your Investment Strategy\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f68c0b1212cc954e2f63109f9be6173ee59f4d8018946d2b6a544d9973412f65/afrestaurants301022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(Clockwise from left) Cote by Mauro Colagreco, Maison Dunand and CDGRE. \n", "caption": "(Clockwise from left) Cote by Mauro Colagreco, Maison Dunand and CDGRE.

Some even argue that a lighter, narrow rear tyre combined with a long swingarm may boost acceleration.\n\nBut motorcycle road safety and racing experts have told The Straits Times that such changes are illegal, risky and untested for road use.\n\nMr Joseph Lee from SBR Trackdays said on Monday: \"These are dangerous modifications (for road use). They have become popular only in the past few years, when Malaysia started doing Thai-style drag racing.\"\n\nMr Lee, who organises motorcycle track days for superbikes at the Sepang International Circuit in Selangor, said he witnessed in 2022 two long swingarms break on road-going motorcycles.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 28, 2025, 11:43pm\n\nMan installs warning lights on car, claims they are for emergencies\n\n\"The problem is the (long motorcycle) swingarms are made of soft aluminium,\" said Mr Lee. \"If a heavy pillion rider sits on the motorcycle, the swingarm may break.\"\n\nMr Aman Aljunied, an assistant manager at the Singapore Safety Driving Centre, said that using non-standard thin tyres may be dangerous as a result of reduced traction on wet surfaces.\n\n\"An extended swingarm is a modification of a (motorcycle) frame's structure which may cause unstable handling in cornering and straight-line riding,\" said Mr Aman. \"Motorcycle manufacturers have researched and tested their motorcycles' handling before production, therefore it is best to ride a motorcycle 'standard' as sold in the showroom for transportation use.\"\n\nThe narrow tyres seen on illegally modified motorcycles are slightly wider than mountain bike tyres. Like the long swingarms, narrow tyres can be bought on e-commerce platforms and through Facebook groups.\n\nMr Norman Lee, owner of motorcycle workshop Race Werks Motor Sports, said such modifications will alter a motorcycle's handling.\n\n\"Workshops should discourage motorcycle owners from doing such modifications because other than a cosmetic upgrade, there is no long-term benefit for the rider,\" said Mr Lee.\n\n\"These are accidents waiting to happen, when the motorcycle performs poorly over bumps or crashes when going into turns.\"\n\nThe extended swingarms can be easily bought and installed at late-night motorcycle workshops in Johor Bahru. ST understands that some workshops in Singapore also provide the service.\n\nA motorcycle mechanic at Jalan Tebrau in Johor said he is seeing more young Singaporean customers wanting longer swingarms.\n\n\"For under RM600 (S$185), your newly modified motorcycle with a longer swingarm can be ready in a few hours,\" said the mechanic, who did not want to be named.\n\nA motorcycle with a pillion rider seen recently near Singapore Turf Club. The motorcycle has a long swingarm, narrow tyres and aftermarket wheels. ST PHOTO: ZAIHAN MOHAMED YUSOF\n\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) said last Friday that it takes a serious view of illegal vehicle modifications, as they could pose safety risks to drivers, riders and other road users.\n\nAn LTA spokesman said: \"Modifying the rear swingarm of a motorcycle is not allowed as it can affect the manoeuvrability and safety of the vehicle. When replacing the rims of a motorcycle, the size (width and diameter) of the installed rims must conform to the manufacturer's recommendations.\"\n\nThe most common types of illegal modifications for motorcycles involve exhaust and lighting systems, said LTA. In 2021, LTA issued 2,740 summonses for these types of modifications, with 1,927 summonses issued in 2022.\n\nLTA also issued 757 summonses to motorcyclists for having improper or unsuitable tyres in 2021, including 19 for rear swingarm modifications. In 2022, 755 summonses were issued, with 39 of them for rear swingarm modifications.\n\nA small capacity motorcycle parked near Clarke Quay is seen with an extended swingarm probably made of soft aluminium. This picture was taken three days ago. ST PHOTO: ZAIHAN MOHAMED YUSOF\n\nSome motorcycles with swingarm and tyre modifications can be spotted at Housing Board multi-storey carparks, near late-night eateries and at motorcycle workshops in Jalan Besar.\n\nA food delivery motorcyclist, whose motorcycle has an illegal swingarm modification, said he is currently the only one in his group with the unique swingarm.\n\n\"I look at where I'm going and I know how to take bends safely… I do it slowly,\" said the rider, who gave his name only as Jasni.\n\nBut Jasni would also have to look out for the law as anyone who illegally modifies vehicles can be fined up to $5,000, imprisoned for up to three months, or both.\n\nPenalties for repeat offenders are doubled. Repeat offenders convicted in court may also have their vehicles detained for up to three months, said LTA.\n\nBy\n\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Zaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nmodification\n\nmotorcycle\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/872dc2a26bf41d86e2ac675a65bf362cd8a44a1ed8fb59e374605b06b3185260/sotong203_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A motorcycle with a long swingarm and narrow tyres spotted recently near Star Vista. \n", "caption": "A motorcycle with a long swingarm and narrow tyres spotted recently near Star Vista.

This was a 10 per cent increase from 3.9 per cent in September 2021, and a 43 per cent increase from 3 per cent in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nVaporisers or e-cigarettes consist of an atomiser, a battery source and a small container for e-liquid or juice. The liquid, which may contain nicotine and chemicals like glycerine and propylene glycol, is heated to form an aerosol that is eventually inhaled. The e-juice comes in flavours such as watermelon, mango, green tea and even buttermilk pudding.\n\nIn October 2021, the Ministry of Education said the number of students - from primary school, secondary school and pre-university institutions - caught for smoking and vaping offences has \"remained low\" at an average of about seven for every 1,000 students over the past three years.\n\nOne teacher on a primary school's disciplinary committee in the north-west of Singapore said that when a pupil is caught vaping, he is counselled about its dangers and his parents are alerted. A repeat offender may face caning.\n\nThe teacher, who did not want to be named, told The Straits Times last Wednesday: \"They (primary school pupils) told me they took the vaporisers belonging to their parents or brothers who smoke and vape. I have students who said they bought their vapes from secondary school students. I have also counselled a female pupil who was a vape dealer.\"\n\nPupils caught vaping are often using them in the school toilets. \"We have helpful janitors, as well as other students, who tell us of students who boast about bringing vaporisers to school,\" said the teacher, who added her school has instituted random checks on students' bags.\n\nThe ban on vaporisers took effect on Feb 1, 2018. Yet, its popularity in Singapore steadily rose during Covid-19 movement restrictions in 2020 despite a worldwide drop in cigarette consumption.\n\nIn 2019, the revenue collected from duty-paid cigarettes was $1.176 billion while in 2021, the figure was $1.347 billion. A total of 2.9 million packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes were seized by Singapore Customs in 2019, compared with 1.95 million packets seized in 2021.\n\nVaporisers are bought and sold over the Internet, on social media and via private messaging apps. A disposable vaporiser costs about $30 and can last roughly 5,000 puffs. Non-disposable vaporisers may cost about $60 and a set of three pods, each with about 500 puffs, $17.\n\nSmuggle\n\nIn comparison, a packet of 20 premium cigarettes now costs about $14.30.\n\nThere are at least 20 groups specialising in vaporisers on messaging app Telegram, with each having about 50,000 vaporiser advertisements and an average of 13,000 members.\n\nWebsites with Malaysian contact numbers sell vape packages in Singapore dollars, starting at $30 for a disposable vaporiser. A few sites also peddle cannabis-infused gummy bears, cannabis joint wrappers and cannabis oil.\n\nWhen the Malaysian border opened in April 2022, some vapers like \"Mike\", not his real name, said it was a habit to smuggle small quantities of e-vaporisers and e-juice in his car.\n\n\"You get to choose many different styles of vapes and e-juice in Malaysia, and it is only a third of the price compared with vapes sold online in Singapore,\" said Mike, 25.\n\nA spokesman for HSA told ST on Saturday that the authority carries out surveillance of retail sites, social media platforms and messaging apps for any suspected peddling of vaporisers and their refill liquids and cartridges. It also collaborates with online platforms like Instagram, Facebook and Carousell to remove illegal postings on tobacco-related products.\n\nIn 2022, more than 2,601 postings were removed. From 2018 to 2022, 860 people were caught selling and smuggling vaporisers, and 145 were prosecuted in the same period.\n\nUnder the law, any person convicted of selling, offering for sale, possessing for sale, importing or distributing vaporisers is liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for up to six months or both.\n\nThe Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) told ST on Saturday that it also carries out active online surveillance and engages e-commerce companies, courier companies and related industries closely to ensure that their platforms and listings are not misused for drug offences.\n\nA CNB spokesman said some vaporisers may be marketed as \"health products\" but contain derivatives of hemp or cannabis, which are controlled substances.\n\nBy\n\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nColumnist\n\nRead articles by Zaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\nE-CIGARETTES/VAPING\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/49a994791a70c56c852c613713692d678c9b32f40709fe7683bd840c6624e573/20220930286382264d8a2630-f41a-4122-88e7-ee3309e8d735_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The latest figures indicate a rise in the vaping trend with almost four times the number of people caught in 2022 than in 2020.

I played really well today.\"\n\nOstapenko was clearly second best but might take solace at her best Grand Slam showing since she reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2018, a year after she won the Roland Garros title.\n\nRybakina, seeded 22nd only because ranking points were not awarded at last year's Wimbledon, will next play the winner of Tuesday evening's quarter-final between third seed Jessica Pegula and twice Melbourne Park champion Victoria Azarenka.\n\n\"For sure, I'm going to watch it,\" she said. \"But at the same time, I need to forget about tennis just for a few hours, to rest the mind, then prepare for another tough match.\" REUTERS\n\nAUSTRALIAN OPEN (TENNIS)\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThe Underrated Strategy That Keeps Your Investments on Track\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b338179b2e08fcf00fc8eff638a7c268fa98733b939203cc4097b15cdbe396d2/10425798_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan in action against Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia during their quarter-final match at the Australian Open. \n", "caption": "Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan in action against Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia during their quarter-final match at the Australian Open.

There's people that live at the location as well... it was in the afternoon when kids were out of school and for children to witnesses it is unspeakable,\" she said.\n\nNBC Bay Area cited a Half Moon Bay city councilman saying the victims are Chinese farmworkers.\n\nBoth farms are on the outskirts of Half Moon Bay, and aerial video taken by news crews shows them with rows of greenhouses.\n\nThe new bloodshed came less than 48 hours after a gunman killed 11 people at a dance studio near Los Angeles.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been in Monterey Park where that massacre took place, took to Twitter moments after news broke of the new killings.\n\n\"At the hospital meeting with victims of a mass shooting when I get pulled away to be briefed about another shooting.

Grab said there were fewer delivery riders owing to the rain.\n\nThe 26-year-old student had to quickly salvage the situation by driving to the various outlets to collect the food himself.\n\nWaiting times on food delivery app Grab were said to be as long as 90 minutes.

That day, he beat Italian Revolution by two lengths.\n\nIt was two for Koh, who sent out Exceed Natural to beat Fort Mustang by a neck in Race 4.\n\nAnd it was two for Kok, who was the man in the saddle on Exceed Natural for that other late-burst victory in the day's only 1,600m race.\n\nLike it was with Flying Nemo, Exceed Natural also exhibited blistering speed. And to think he will be 10 years old in August.\n\nFor Kok, the wins must have been a well-received shot in the arm..\n\nIndisposed for the first two days of the season, Exceed Natural was only his second ride for the year.\n\nTo have conjured up a double will surely boost his confidence.\n\nThe Chinese New Year meeting also proved to be a landmark occasion for local trainer Kuah Cheng Tee.\n\nThe 48-year-old saddled his 100th winner at Kranji when Last Samurai led from go to whoa to take the sixth event.\n\nWell supported, the American-bred beat Rocket Ryane by 1 3/4 lengths, with Rocky taking the other minor placing.\n\nA former jockey, Kuah hung up his boots in 2003.\n\nHe then worked through the ranks from senior track rider to stable supervisor in 2005, before earning his assistant trainer's licence in 2009.\n\nHe became a fully fledged trainer in 2016.\n\nIn the opening event, which served to usher in the Year Of The Rabbit, Super Generous was off like a mechanical hare in a greyhound race.\n\nAnd the rest never came close to catching her over the 1,200m.\n\nA three-time winner, Super Generous was ridden by A'Isisuhairi Kasim, who has hit a brilliant patch of form at these early days of the season.\n\nSuper Generous was his fourth winner, coming on the heels of that fine treble on Day One.\n\nIt was also a super training feat by Leslie Khoo who, like \"Harry\" Kasim, has had a dream start to the season.\n\nAnd the horse he has to thank just happens to be his latest winner, Super Generous.\n\nThe mare gave Khoo his first winner for the season when she beat Per Incrown by a neck on Jan 7.\n\nHe added another to the tally when Wild Bee won on Jan 14.\n\nKhoo, who had entered a lean and mean team of three for the meeting, picked up a double when Melody Fair swamped them to take Race 8.\n\nWong Chin Chuen, who rode Melody Fair, would end the day with a treble, his other winners being Sun Elizabeth in the seventh and newcomer Pacific Bao Bei in the last.\n\nFollowing Super Generous' victory in the first, another mare put the boys to shame in Race 2.\n\nAhorsewithnoname, owned by Giovanni Stable, began that journey to making a name for herself when she led from pillar to post to win with plenty of cheek.\n\nJumped cleanly by Manoel Nunes, she went to the front. From then on, the Brazilian nursed her home to take the 1,400m race by two lengths.\n\nIn his post-race interview, the champion hoop agreed that the mare was a temperamental girl.\n\nHe said: \"Like most fillies, you do not fight with her.\n\n\"She found the front easily and, when she put herself there, she went on to race really well. I just did the rest.\"\n\nHer trainer, Tim Fitzsimmons, agreed.\n\n\"She tends to get her head up and sometimes changes gears,\" he said.\n\n\"I did not give Manoel any instructions. We just wanted her to be comfortable and that was where he put her. It was a good win.\"\n\nMonday's Singapore Results\n\n:\n\nsinres24.pd\n\nf\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Money Market Funds in Singapore for Smarter Cash Management\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/110e5014d5dddf4c75666bc7c81c809babea13d42874220fc4477c411748d0fb/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Desmond Koh-trained Flying Nemo (Simon Kok) producing a blistering finish to beat Opunake (Mohd Zaki) in Race 10 on Monday.", "caption": "The Desmond Koh-trained Flying Nemo (Simon Kok) producing a blistering finish to beat Opunake (Mohd Zaki) in Race 10 on Monday.

If they have no adverse effect on her, she should be hard to stop. (3) RIO SUPREMO races in new surroundings and could challenge. (2) TIME FOR CHARITY showed good improvement with blinkers and should be in the trifecta. Watch the tote on the newcomers.\n\nRace 2 (1,000m)\n\n(1) IRON SKY was just ahead of (8) BROSNAN, with (3) DUNGEONS not far behind. Brosnan was on debut and drifted in the betting. He can only improve and should have no problem beating them. Stable companion (9) ELUSIVE JUSTICE is reported to be decent for his debut outing. Also making his debut is (10) SAGAN, who is bred to fly. Watch the betting.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\n(1) SWING UPON A STAR needed his first run as a gelding and could resume winning ways. (2) TSAR BOMBA found problems last time and would not go down without a fight. (6) STROKE OF MERCY gets only 3kg from them but has that come-on look. (5) LIL MISS MONEYBAGS could feature if she can settle early.\n\nRace 4 (2,400m)\n\n(4) RARATONGA ROSE is in top form and has a hat-trick chance. She meets (6) NAMAQUA BLOSSOM on 2kg worse terms for a head beating. On paper, she still looks to have the slight edge. (2) LITTLE PRINCE stayed on over the extra journey last time and could handle the marathon distance. (3) BANHA BRIDGE is a trier but could be better over a little shorter.\n\nRace 5 (1,600m)\n\n(11) TIMEFORTHAT has been threatening for her fourth success. It could happen from a decent draw. (3) SEQUOIA is going over a preferred distance and must come into the equation. (4) TINDER DRY is unbeaten over this course and distance. (1) ADMIRALTY ARCH is drawn wide but will be running on late.\n\nRace 6 (1,450m)\n\n(8) LETHA found problems last time. If the mare has no breathing problem, she could score. Stablemate (3) BEE IN MY BONNET improved after a break to open her account and could go on. (1) LADY OF POWER and (14) BIG CITY GIRL are drawn wide but will be running on late. (2) ARDEN PARK, (4) QUANTUM, (6) MAMAQUERA, (9) SPLASH OF GREEN and (10) SCOTTADITO are capable of pulling it off.\n\nRace 7 (1,450m)\n\n(12) SOUTHERN BLAZE is threatening for a third victory and could have his consistency rewarded. (10) IN CAHOOTS carries 0.5kg overweight but, on his last-start facile victory, the gelding could double-up over this trip. (9) INDUS KNIGHT should be cherry ripe. The value choice. (7) KOTINOS, (2) FATEFUL DAY and (11) TANGANGA need to overcome wide draws but cannot be ignored. (4) MAGICAL FLIGHT could finish off strongly if covered early.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9ca8551ed865e47a825b6334cf14ab48e71d62ca3266eedf8f83d44dd54c12a6/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He is suited to the course and distance and warrants support in Race 8 at Sha Tin on Tuesday.\n\nPHOTO: HKJC\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 23, 2023, 02:42pm\n\nBlaze Warrior fired up for seventh strike\n\nShare this article\n\nRace 1 (1,200M)\n\n1 Mr Valiant makes a crucial dip to Class 4. He did well to finish sixth last time at Happy Valley and looks like he will appreciate racing in this grade. The booking of Karis Teetan is a plus. 3 Baby Crystal is racing well and looks very close to a first win. He has placed second three times from four starts. 4 Brilliant Life was aided by the good draw last time and closed in nicely for second. He has shown he is capable of winning soon. 5 Call Me Dandy makes his debut. Watch the betting.\n\nRace 2 (1,400M)\n\n4 Maximize Heart steps out for his first run in Class 5. He has won on this day before and should be well suited in this grade, especially with Derek Leung hopping up now. 3 Fortune President caught the eye last start and he can also improve racing in this grade. The inside draw should see him save ground throughout.  7 Team Goodluck has the ability and his pairing with Zac Purton is a plus. This grade is suitable, so is the inside gate. 6 Medic Elite is fit and holding his condition. He can be competitive.\n\nRace 3 (1,400M)\n\n8 Lady's Choice can figure strongly second-up at a price after a sound debut when closing in for sixth. The booking of Vincent Ho is a plus and he appears ready to take a big step forward. 10 Thunderboltaurus did well on debut for fourth and Hugh Bowman sticks aboard. He was well supported that day and this contest is suitable. 3 Turin Warrior is doing everything right, except win. Keep safe. 2 Spicy Grill rarely runs a bad race (a second and three thirds this term) but is not drawn well.\n\nRace 4 (1,200M)\n\n6 A Americ Te Specso finished nicely for third at his last start. He can take another step forward. His chances look very good, especially with Purton sticking aboard. 10 Smart Leader has been competitive in this grade since his win four starts ago. Holding his condition, he should be around the mark. 11 Fighting Star made all the running impressively last time. Expect him to do the same again but they may not let him skip too far in front. 5 Nicetobemet can improve following a sound debut.\n\nRace 5 (1,800M)\n\n14 Smart Cousin is in a rich vein of form and is close to a first win this term. With the light weight, he gets every chance. 4 Owners' Star is competitive and has the class. With a bit of luck, he should be in the finish. 3 Go Go Sixteen is drawn ideally and should get a sweet run. The step-up in distance is suitable, as is the booking of Teetan. 1 Superb Daddy will be in the finish.\n\nRace 6 (1,800M)\n\n13 Reach Goal slots in light and should improve following his latest effort. He travelled three-wide without cover that day but still managed to stick on for fifth. He is the one to beat with a light weight from an ideal gate. 1 Nicholson Returns is chasing back-to-back successes. He remains in Class 4, which is suitable. 9 Winning Steps can improve with a return to Sha Tin. The step-back in trip looks a plus. 14 Red Elysees knows what it is all about and should be in the finish. The light weight is an advantage.\n\nRace 7 (1,400M)\n\n6 Blissful Star is still without a win but he looks to have found a suitable contest. 11 Nordic Combined is tracking towards a first win. The booking of Silvestre de Sousa signals intent. With the light weight, he should get his opportunity. 2 Wind N Grass can improve after finishing midfield last time. He is a three-time winner. 5 Yellowfin is consistent (with a second and fourth thirds in last five starts) and should be thereabouts.\n\nRace 8 (1,400M)\n\n2 Blaze Warrior can bounce back after finishing fifth behind the promising Lucky Sweynesse in the Group 3 Chinese Club Challenge Cup over 1,400m. The six-time winner is suited over this course and distance. 10 Mr Ascendency slots in light and looks to have several rating points still to climb. This is quite a huge test but he is in the right vein of form to make a very big improvement. 1 Healthy Happy knows what it is all about. He should find the front and try to pinch this. 3 Fantastic Treasure is better than his latest performance suggests. He can reverse his form in this company.\n\nRace 9 (1,200M)\n\n9 Decisive Twelve has done everything right this season except win. His consistency can be rewarded from an ideal draw under Teetan. 1 Brilliant Way was narrowly denied last time. He should make another challenge with Purton sticking aboard. 4 Goko Win gets Alexis Badel in the saddle and a pair of blinkers. He will likely try to pinch this from the front. 2 Beauty Charge, who found one to beat in his last two starts, is next best.\n\nRace 10 (1,400M)\n\n4 Marado is chasing a fourth consecutive victory. He remains in Class 3 and Gate 1 should give him every conceivable chance. 1 Atullibigeal won well last start and should be in the finish again. He will be finishing fast under Hugh Bowman. 10 Global Harmony has the ability. It is just a matter of putting it all together. Keep safe.\n\nRace 11 (1,600M)\n\n2 Maximus is better than his form suggests. He has yet to score in Hong Kong but has shown that the Sha Tin turf mile is his best trip. 3 Sight Spirit will improve sharply back to this course and distance. 6 Super Sunny Sing is chasing a hat-trick. He will be competitive. 1 Sinba is classy and worth considering. Keep safe.\n\n*Comments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/29a1ca0be943f2fa1e77ece4749f60312eb31f8db9e84209e844bedffce642d7/unnamed_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Six-time winner Blaze Warrior ran a fair fifth in the Group 3 Chinese Club Challenge Cup over 1,400m.

I also couldn't squat or kneel without feeling pain in my knees,\" says Madam Thio, who is married and has a son, 44, and daughter, 35.\n\nAfter retiring in 2018, she went for holidays, volunteered at church and spent time watching South Korean dramas.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 02:31am\n\n'Smart diapers' for adult patients tested at KTPH to prevent rashes, reduce checks for nurses\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut when she started limping out of the blue in 2020, her daughter suggested that she begin exercising and recommended a personal trainer at Strength Avenue gym in Boat Quay. Since then, she has been working out with a coach for an hour every week to improve her mobility and gain strength.\n\nIn the beginning, however, Madam Thio was afraid of getting injured.\n\n\"I had been fearful of climbing steps and falling due to my weak knees. So when I started personal training, I wondered if I could trust the coach to not hurt my joints. But after the second session, I found that this was working out because the coach took into account my slow pace,\" she says.\n\nDr Shannon Chia, team lead at Sport Singapore's Active Health division, says that between the ages of 30 and 60, there is a steady decline in muscle strength.\n\n\"Because the initial rate of decrease is ever so gradual, a person will not feel its significance until the age of 60 and above. Once past 60 years old, there is an accelerated loss of muscle strength. By the age of 80, this loss gets more significant,\" she notes.\n\nWhile muscle loss is a natural ageing process that cannot be undone, it can be slowed down through regular strength training, say experts.\n\nMr Abdul Muhaimin, who coaches Madam Thio at Strength Avenue, considered her age and medical history when working out a fitness plan for her.\n\n\"It took her six months just to gain confidence to lift any form of weight. She started off carrying an 8kg kettlebell before she moved on to the deadlift, and I progressively added weight over time,\" says Mr Muhaimin. In a deadlift, one lifts a weight from ground to thigh-level.\n\n\"Sometimes, she may feel aches from the previous session, so I have to be careful to manage that as well,\" he adds.\n\nMadam Samantha Thio, 67, doing exercises in a gym. ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO\n\nDr Chia says a rule of thumb for anyone wanting to be more active is to start slowly and gradually build up intensity and duration, especially if it has been a long time since he or she last exercised.\n\n\"There are many ways to strengthen one's muscles, whether at home or the gym, with each offering pros and cons. Seniors can consider using their body weight, resistance bands, free weights such as a dumbbell, or household items such as filled water bottles or used detergent bottles,\" adds Dr Chia.\n\nApart from deadlifts, Madam Thio also does other strength-training exercises, such as squats with a medicine ball or dumbbells, and pushing a sled weighing 82.5kg in the gym. At home, she does simpler workouts such as hip hinges, squats and the glute bridge.\n\nShe bought a medicine ball, kettlebells and resistance bands to use in her home workouts.\n\nFor Madam Thio, strength training is \"liberating\".\n\n\"When I first met my coach, he told me I hadn't used my muscles in many years, so this process of trying to reawaken them would take time. Though it took me over a year to squat without pain, I was happy with my improvement,\" she says.\n\nMr Ng Siah Heng, 59, works out an hour every week with his personal trainer. He is doing a type of weightlifting called the snatch. ST PHOTO: DESMOND WEE\n\nLike Madam Thio, Mr Ng Siah Heng was sporty in his younger days, but started having difficulty squatting when he was approaching his mid-50s.\n\nThe 59-year-old adjunct lecturer at a tertiary institution took up a gym membership in 2020, when he realised he was not as strong and agile as before.\n\n\"I used to play badminton and tennis when I was young. But as I aged, my muscles felt stiff and my reflexes were slow. I had issues with balance, with a tendency to fall. I wanted to strengthen my body,\" says Mr Ng, who is married.\n\nHe started by attending group fitness classes at Level Gym in Robinson Road. They were targeted at improving one's cardiovascular endurance, agility and flexibility.\n\nIn 2021, he decided to engage a personal trainer at the gym for a more tailored fitness regimen. For an hour a week, Mr Ng mainly does a type of weightlifting called the snatch with his trainer.\n\nThe exercise, which can be done with a barbell, dumbbell or kettlebell, involves carrying a weight from the ground all the way overhead in one fluid motion. He started off with 20kg and can now lift up to 65kg. He aims to lift 80kg in 2023.\n\nSays Mr Ng: \"Since I started exercising and weightlifting, my balance has become a lot better and my reflexes are faster. When I walk on uneven ground, I feel more stable as my knees and thighs are stronger.\"\n\nWeight training gives him a \"sense of euphoria\", he adds. \"The blend of concentration, coordination and strength is something I truly enjoy while exercising.\"\n\nHowever, he is careful not to push himself too hard. \"While it is good to improve the quality of life as we age, it is more important to have a good coach for guidance and know the limitations of your own body,\" he says.\n\nIn selected ActiveSG gyms, Dr Chia says there are exercise machines suitable for seniors which are pneumatic and run purely on air pressure.\n\n\"These are machines that allow for smaller weight increments of 100g as opposed to traditional weight plates, providing a safer workout that is gentler on seniors' muscles and joints,\" she says.\n\nMr Victor Chan, a lifeguard and swimming instructor at the Singapore Armed Forces' Basic Military Training Centre, started strength training at the age of 21.\n\nBut \"carrying weights for successful ageing has been a different experience\", says the 70-year-old.\n\n\"As a youngster, I trained for a nice physique. But now, all I want is to feel strong and improve my mobility,\" says Mr Chan, who is married and has a son and daughter.\n\nHe works out at home every day for about two hours, with dumbbells weighing 11kg to 13kg and a barbell of 20kg.\n\nAt his age, Mr Chan is careful not to overload himself with too much weight.\n\n\"When I was young, I had more strength. As I age, strength decreases, so it's important that I listen to my body and ensure I don't carry weights that are too heavy and instead train more for mobility. So I do more repetitions with lighter weights instead,\" he adds.\n\nAt his age, Mr Victor Chan, 70, is careful not to overload himself with too much weight.  ST PHOTO: ARIFFIN JAMAR\n\nUsing equipment at home, Mr Chan does exercises such as the shoulder press, bicep curl and squat with dumbbells.\n\nBesides strength training, he has also participated in many army half-marathons and triathlons, but stopped about four years ago after he underwent surgery to fix a nerve issue in his foot. He now takes it slow and runs 6km to 10km four to five times a week.\n\n\"I feel good when I exercise. I have more strength and energy, and don't feel lethargic. It also improves my mood because I feel more lively,\" he says.\n\nAmrita Kaur\n\nsenior citizens\n\nEXERCISE/FITNESS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 7, 2025, 11:31pm\n\nSingaporean athletes at World Masters Games prove age is no barrier to fitness\n\nJun 4, 2025, 07:49am\n\nWhen an $8 hair salon visit cost $1k: Chain admits to unfair trade practices targeting the elderly\n\nMay 23, 2025, 11:53am\n\nMore elderly in Singapore turning to helplines for loneliness and mental health support\n\nApr 24, 2025, 01:05am\n\nPhilanthropist Toh Soon Huat exposes scam that uses his name to dupe elderly man of $10,000\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThe Underrated Strategy That Keeps Your Investments on Track\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ddf9ea781b7da46124fc53a668b5d4f0c1629085f0432c771c438d0b8ea0ce63/afseniors170123_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Victor Chan (left), 70, and Madam Samantha Thio, 67. \n", "caption": "Mr Victor Chan (left), 70, and Madam Samantha Thio, 67.

Brown Invitational in Maryland on Saturday.\n\nPHOTO: KAMPTON KAM\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 23, 2023, 02:26pm\n\n'Small steps' mantra helps jumper Kampton Kam to second national mark in a week\n\nShare this article\n\nInspired by Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis, Singaporean high jumper Kampton Kam developed his own mantra: To head in the right direction, one centimetre at a time.\n\nOlympic, world and European champion Duplantis has been setting new standards since he was seven and has made breaking world records his trademark, literally and figuratively raising the bar in his sport. At the 2022 World Athletics Championships last July, Duplantis added a centimetre to his own world pole vault record to claim his first outdoor world title, soaring over 6.21 metres.\n\nKam's motto of showing an improvement each time he competes has got him off to a perfect start in 2023, rewriting the national indoor record twice in the United States, where he is based, in the span of a week.\n\n\"I look to Duplantis as a source of inspiration,\" said the 21-year-old, who competes for the University of Pennsylvania as a freshman.\n\n\"Every time he competes, he always goes one better than the last time. That is my goal - I want to get better each week and head in the right direction one or two centimetres at a time. The idea is to keep taking all these small steps and at the end, all the efforts will pay off.\"\n\nKam's latest mark of 2.08m was achieved as he won gold at the at the Wesley A. Brown Invitational, held at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland on Saturday.\n\nExactly one week earlier, he had kicked off his collegiate athletics career with a bang when he leapt 2.06m at the Penn 10-Team Select in Staten Island, New York. The jump helped him claim gold and better his previous national mark that had stood since December 2021, by one centimetre.\n\nUp next for Kam will likely be the Rutgers Open meet in New York next Friday.\n\nKam, who also holds the national outdoor Under-18 (2.10m), Under-20 (2.15m) and Under-23 (2.20m) marks, said that being aware of what he needs to improve on has also helped.\n\nCurrently, he has been working hard on perfecting his strides in the lead up to his leap.\n\n\"I have to keep looking at what I can get better in because the long-term goal is to get to the 2024 Olympics and to get there, I will need to hit 2.33m. For a high jump, the way you need to sprint is different from the usual sprint you would have in a race. My coach has been working with me on the way I run and each week I am coping better with that, \" he said.\n\nWhile the Olympics is the ultimate dream, Kam's immediate goal is to qualify for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Indoor Track and Field Championships that will be held in New Mexico, in March.\n\nTo do so, he will need to be ranked as one of the NCAA's top 16 indoor high jumpers. Currently, Kam's 2.08m mark places him 57th.\n\nAnd even as he is motivated and determined to keep improving, Kam is eager to enjoy the meets and competitions as they come.\n\nHe said: \"I have waited a long time to come to the US and compete here. I am treating it seriously but at the same time, I want to learn to have fun with it. I am getting to go to a lot of new places while on this journey and my coach has repeatedly told me to not worry and keep giving my best. And I aim to do just that in the years ahead.\"\n\nBy\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nRead articles by Deepanraj Ganesan\n\nHigh Jump\n\nSINGAPORE ATHLETES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2b593a2ed247febfe1aa5768ccfb11b5628f4bfd43a38d43ec6709a42099326e/image64834412028229_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Kampton Kam cleared 2.08m to claim first place in the men’s high jump event at the Wesley A.

I don't know if it was a present. Especially from 5-2 (down in the fifth), somehow I was able to win. I started to think it was over.\"\n\n\"Now I can go to the casino, for sure I'm going to win,\" he added, laughing.\n\nVictory put the 25-year-old into the Melbourne quarter-finals for a second time and the last eight for a seventh occasion at Grand Slams.\n\nDespite being world No. 6 Rublev, who has won 13 ATP titles, has never been able to go further.\n\nHe described beating Rune as \"not like a roller coaster, it's like they put a gun to your head. A roller coaster is easier\".\n\n\"I was never able to win matches like this,\" he said.\n\nWith both players less than clinical on serve, Rublev broke the Dane with a forehand winner to take a 4-2 grip in the first set.\n\nBut Rune's returns helped create chances and he broke straight back when Rublev played into the net from the baseline.\n\nA Rune double fault immediately handed the advantage back to his opponent, and this time Rublev made no mistake in serving out the set in 37 minutes.\n\nUndaunted, Rune clung on in a see-sawing 12-minute opening game in set two and turned the tables to break Rublev for a 3-1 lead, which he never relinquished.\n\nWith the sun blazing down, Rublev pounced in the sixth game of the next set, opening up three break point opportunities and making the most of them.\n\nDown two sets to one, Rune called a trainer for what appeared to be a blood pressure test. Unperturbed, he got back to work and broke for 4-2 and took it to a fifth.\n\nIn a battle of attrition, Rune ground down Rublev to move to 5-2 in the decider, but he failed to serve out for the match.\n\nRublev then saved two match points to take it to the 10-point tiebreak, where he bounced back from 7-3 down for a gutsy win.\n\n\"This one hurts a lot,\" said a disappointed Rune. \"It was super close. I had my chances. He played well.\"\n\nWith young gun Ben Shelton winning a five-set battle against compatriot J. J. Wolf, and Sebastian Korda advancing on Sunday, Tommy Paul ensured three American men will contest the quarter-finals for the first time since 2000.\n\nThe unseeded Paul beat 24th seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 in the evening at Margaret Court Arena to book a matchup with 20-year-old Shelton, whose dream run continued with a 6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 win over Wolf.\n\n\"Any time you play Bautista it's going to be a war,\" said a beaming Paul after reaching his first Grand Slam quarter-final.\n\n\"I'm really happy playing an American in the quarters, there's going to be an American in the semis.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas says it will be \"a disgrace\" if Djokovic continues to be barred from the United States because of his stance on Covid vaccines.\n\nThe Serb is set to miss prestigious Indian Wells and Miami events in the spring after US authorities extended until April their requirement for international visitors to be vaccinated.\n\nThe 21-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic missed last year's US Open for the same reason.

It's really putting the clients or event organisers and the patron at the centre of it and what kind of problems we can solve for them.\"\n\nBut getting tickets online is not always a smooth process.\n\nWhenever tickets to popular events go on sale, or when demand outstrips supply, there will inevitably be complaints by disgruntled customers who either had to wait a long time in an online queue system to secure tickets or failed to get them at all due to technical issues.\n\nIn the United States, fans of American pop star Taylor Swift sued ticketing company Ticketmaster after they faced difficulties trying to purchase tickets to her massively popular 2023 tour when they went on sale online in November 2022.\n\nSistic works with event organisers to ensure that their online buying processes are designed to ensure fairness, Mr Ow says in response.\n\nThese include mechanisms such as virtual waiting rooms so that when numerous patrons try to buy tickets at the exact same time, they get assigned a random queue number. Another feature available is automated seat selection, so that patrons spend less time mulling over decisions on where to seat.\n\nSistic also sends out advisories to help patrons be well-prepared before tickets go on sale. For example, they can register their interest for events and receive e-mails and SMSes to remind them to set up their accounts, download the Sistic app and study the seating maps before sales begin.\n\nFans complained after they experienced technical issues while watching the JJ Lin Sanctuary Finale Virtual Concert held on July 10, 2021. PHOTO: JFJ PRODUCTIONS\n\nThen there is the perennial issue of scalpers re-selling tickets.\n\nWhen events sell out, there will often be posts on platforms such as online marketplace Carousell hawking tickets at overblown prices. Worse still are the scams, where ticket buyers end up losing money to unscrupulous sellers.\n\nMr Ow notes that in Singapore, secondary sales are not illegal. Still, under the terms and conditions, a ticket buyer is not allowed to transfer or sell his or her tickets.\n\n\"That doesn't stop consumers from trying to either get rid of tickets to events that they cannot attend or (engage in) profiteering. What we are trying to do right now is work with folks like Carousell or the Ministry of Home Affairs to try to reduce the occurrence of scams. Our primary concern is to protect the interest of patrons.\"\n\nFor instance, Sistic implements technology such as dynamic barcodes, a feature in which the barcodes on e-tickets change every 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nMr Ow says the company had to pivot quickly when the pandemic upended the live events industry in 2020. It accelerated the launch of its live-streaming platform, Sistic Live, which it started working on in 2019, before the pandemic hit.\n\nBecause of Sistic Live, which hosted a variety of online events ranging from concerts and talks to book readings and fund-raisers, the annual number of events that Sistic handled became even more than before the pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, it took on 1,800 to 2,000 events, including both physical and virtual, compared with 1,600 pre-pandemic, like the Singapore Writers Festival and the Esplanade's Huayi - Chinese Festival of Arts.\n\nThe number of events in 2022 continued to be the same, but because of further easing of restrictions, audience numbers grew and ticket sales were 2.6 times more than in 2021.\n\nThe return of physical events without restrictions also meant that Sistic Live events dropped significantly - there were 150 in 2022, compared with 300 in 2021.\n\nFrom pop concerts and theatre productions to major sports events and conferences, the live events industry looks set to grow even bigger in 2023.\n\nBoth supply and demand will remain strong, Mr Ow says, but the ability to sell tickets will also be tough due to stiff competition for the consumer dollar. Rising inflation and a possible recession will also make it harder.\n\n\"Despite that, people will still need to find respite from life through the arts and entertainment, so I think the demand will continue to be there,\" he says. \"Inbound travel, hopefully, will improve with China opening up, so there are some bright spots there that we can potentially look out for.\"\n\nWhile Sistic used to hold the lion's share of the ticketing market here, the past few years have seen more players enter the industry, from smaller companies such as Peatix to multinational giants like Ticketmaster.\n\nThe latter, in particular, is selling tickets for major events such as the National Stadium gigs by English pop star Harry Styles in March and K-pop girl group Blackpink in May.\n\nMeanwhile, Sistic's 2023 roster includes Malaysian singer Eric Moo's concert, HSBC Women's World Championship and Disney's Frozen The Hit Broadway Musical.\n\n\"I think the race is not so much about what the competitors are doing, but about ourselves,\" Mr Ow says.\n\n\"If we put the patrons in the centre, (we ask) 'What do they need? What kind of problems do they have that we as a service and solution provider, can help to address? I think that should be our North Star as to where we want to go next.\"\n\nEddino Abdul Hadi\n\nMusic Correspondent\n\nJJ Lin\n\nCONCERTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 5, 2023, 08:16am\n\nJJ Lin not amused by videos mocking his dance moves\n\nMay 10, 2023, 09:49am\n\nLooking dapper in that tux, JJ: Singer wows fans after suiting up to meet President\n\nMar 23, 2023, 01:53pm\n\nMirror singer Stanley Yau apologises for misunderstanding caused by his post\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:13am\n\nWoman assaulted at JJ Lin concert after asking fans not to block view\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nUS-China Tariff Truce: What It Means for Markets and Your Investment Strategy\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/63d3a44d64a217eb0df7b16517d5f4f3821d29780376e112285419275ed9690c/2023011760816267dsc1658-01_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Joe Ow says the company had to pivot quickly when the pandemic upended the live events industry in 2020.

She was born in Croatia and has a Serbian father.\n\n\"And yes a lot of them are women too. So much for 'women supporting women',\" she added.\n\nDokic, who last year revealed she nearly committed suicide, said the abuse was \"evil and disgusting\".\n\n\"The most common comment being 'what happened to her, she is so big'?\" she wrote.\n\n\"I will tell you what happened, I am finding a way and surviving and fighting. And it really doesn't matter what I am doing and what happened because size shouldn't matter.\n\n\"What matters is your online abuse, bullying and fat shaming. That's what matters because those of you that do it are just evil, bad, mean and ignorant people.\"\n\nDokic sprang to prominence at Wimbledon in 1999 when she stunned world number one Martina Hingis in the first round.\n\nShe won six WTA singles titles during her career and reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon in 2000, but struggled for years to escape the influence of her volatile father Damir.\n\nThey endured a well-documented split and she tumbled down the rankings.\n\nThe family rift followed a series of bizarre episodes including Damir being banned from the All England Club at Wimbledon and at one point claiming his daughter had been kidnapped.

And he said, 'Nothing. I'm going to pace this thing at a minute a page,'\" recalls the 59-year-old American actor, who won an Oscar for another drama about Tinseltown history, Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood (2019).\n\n\"And it pretty much turned out that way, to Damien's credit. I was surprised at how much stayed in the movie.\"\n\nPitt says he had been itching to work with Chazelle since his breakout work Whiplash. And the film-maker's reputation got a further boost in 2017, when he became the youngest person to win the Best Director Oscar for La La Land at age 32.\n\nThen Pitt read the script for Babylon. \"And - you saw it - it's mayhem,\" he says with a smile.\n\nBut the story is also \"really well grounded\" in the history of Hollywood's silent era, he adds.\n\n\"I had kind of dismissed that era,\" Pitt says. \"I hadn't really paid attention to it because it's not an acting style I relate to and it's not what we gravitate to now. It wasn't until I saw some of the films, at Damien's urging, that you find a real charm and warmth in them.\"\n\nMargot Robbie and Diego Calva in Babylon. PHOTO: UIP\n\nRobbie had a similar reaction to the screenplay, which casts her as an aspiring actress named Nellie LaRoy - a character based on silent-film sex symbol Clara Bow.\n\nSays the 32-year-old, who starred in the comedy The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013) and was Oscar-nominated for the biopic I, Tonya (2017): \"I remember reading the script and being particularly terrified and excited by the whole thing.\"\n\nShe wondered how she would pull off two especially wild scenes, one involving a rattlesnake and another, throwing up.\n\n\"You know when you read a script and even the night before (filming), you're, like, 'I don't know what to do in this scene, it's so insane.'\"\n\nChazelle was also unlike any director she has worked with.\n\n\"I give it a lot on my first take, like, I go big,\" Robbie says. \"But Damien comes up to me after that first take and he's, like, 'Um, that was great, we just need way more.'\n\n\"And I was, like, 'I don't know if I have more.'\"\n\nBut she rose to the occasion and, while it ended up being the \"hardest I've ever worked on a film\", Robbie loves the fact that Chazelle demands so much.\n\n\"My favourite thing about him is that he expects so much from you as an actor,\" she adds.\n\nBabylon opens in cinemas on Thursday.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nAlison de Souza\n\nBrad Pitt\n\nactors\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 4, 2022, 10:55pm\n\nBrad Pitt 'choked' one child, hit another in Angelina Jolie plane fight: Court papers\n\nNov 29, 2016, 07:39am\n\nTheories about this year's most shocking celeb break-up\n\nFeb 16, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nSeeing stars at the Oscars: Janet Hsieh to cover red carpet\n\nJan 19, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nWin THE BIG SHORT movie premiums\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThese 5 S-REITs Are Outperforming in 2025 - Here’s Why\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/638d4e7287c17bd345c9ee9036e245ba69e1d93b9ce3e6b39a5e31e013473739/dw-babylon-pitt-2300117_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Brad Pitt plays a silent-film star in Babylon. \n", "caption": "Brad Pitt plays a silent-film star in Babylon.

He fled that scene.\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna identified the suspect as Huu Can Tran, a septuagenarian he said used a high-capacity magazine pistol to shoot up a ballroom dance venue popular with older patrons in Monterey Park, about 11 km east of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nInvestigators did not yet know a motive, although gun violence is frequent in the United States. Mr Luna did not identify any of the victims but said the five men and five women appeared to be in their 50s, 60s and beyond.\n\nThe sheriff said the pistol Tran used appeared to be illegal in California, where state laws ban any magazine holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 22, 2024, 02:15am\n\nSakkari romps into Miami Open third round, Wozniacki loses\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We want to know, we want to know how something this awful can happen,\" Mr Luna told reporters.\n\nAfter police say Tran carried out the shooting in Monterey Park at about 10pm on Saturday (2pm on Sunday, Singapore time), he was confronted by bystanders at a second dance club in the neighbouring city of Alhambra about 20 minutes later, Mr Luna said.\n\n\"I can tell you that the suspect walked in there, probably with the intent to kill more people, and two brave community members decided they were going to jump into action and disarm him,\" Mr Luna said.\n\nThe sheriff said that Tran turned a handgun on himself on Sunday as police approached a white van he was driving in Torrance, about 34km from the site of the shooting at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park.\n\nOfficers heard a single gunshot from the van as they approached, then fell back and called for a SWAT team.\n\n\"The suspect sustained a self-inflicted gunshot wound and was pronounced dead at the scene,\" Mr Luna said.\n\nOf the 10 people injured, seven remained hospitalised Sunday night, with at least one person in critical condition.\n\nThe shooting took place around the location of a two-day Chinese New Year celebration where many downtown streets are closed for festivities that draw thousands of people from across Southern California.\n\nCheck out this tweet!\n\nlink\n\nJanuary 22, 2023\n\nResidents stood gazing at the many blocks sealed off with police tape on Sunday in Monterey Park. Mr Chester Chong, chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles, described the city of about 60,000 people as a quiet, peaceful, beautiful place where everybody knows each other and helps each other.\n\nThe city has for decades been a destination for immigrants from China.

They also have a two-year-old son, Keith.\n\nThe triplets were born one minute apart at 34 weeks through caesarean delivery at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), weighing between 2.1kg and 2.3kg.\n\nDr Low, a physiotherapist, told The Straits Times: \"We have always wanted a big family and we are very glad the triplets are here with us safely.\"\n\nWhile triplets are already very rare, what is more astonishing is that only one embryo had been implanted in Dr Low's womb through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 29, 2025, 05:38am\n\nKKH opens Singapore's first centre for flat-head syndrome as cases rise 36%\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe chances of an embryo splitting into triplets are \"extremely rare\", said her doctor, Dr Sim Wen Shan, a consultant at KKH's Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine. A landmark Japanese study found that only 0.04 per cent of pregnancies from a single embryo transfer produced triplets.\n\nDr Sim said that in IVF procedures, implanting one embryo is now recommended to reduce the chances of having twins or triplets, which can increase the risks in pregnancy.\n\nMr Chua, an officer in the Singapore Armed Forces, recalled that when they were told they were expecting triplets, \"it was a big shock for the both of us\".\n\nThe couple, who married in 2014, began to try various fertility procedures, such as intrauterine insemination and IVF, after a few years of marriage failed to produce a child.\n\nThen they conceived Keith naturally. In May 2022, they decided to use one of their frozen embryos to try for a second child.\n\nIn her sixth week of pregnancy, Dr Low learnt she was carrying twins.\n\nDr Low, who is 168cm tall and weighs 52kg, said: \"I was really very scared as I am small-sized. I was not sure if I could carry twins.\"\n\nBut Mr Chua was over the moon, as he had always wanted a big family.\n\nDr Claire Low and Mr Edwin Chua with their two-year-old son, Keith, and their triplets (from left) Kenneth, Gareth and Seth. ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHENG\n\nAt a follow-up scan two weeks later, their doctor at the time, who practises at another hospital, went silent in the middle of it.\n\nThe couple looked at his serious expression and feared the worst - that Dr Low had suffered a miscarriage.\n\nDr Low said: \"My doctor turned the monitor to Edwin and asked him: 'You can count, right?'\"\n\nThe couple saw three beating hearts.\n\n\"I asked: 'Is it triplets?' The doctor said yes,\" Mr Chua said. \"With triplets, it is a whole magnitude of difference in terms of challenges.\"\n\nDr Low said her doctor could not explain how the twins were now triplets, but he said his only other patient with triplets had had three embryos implanted.\n\nDr Low added: \"I asked my doctor that if I go back the next week, there wouldn't be four babies, right? He said, 'Claire, don't worry. You are not an amoeba.'\"\n\nAfter the news had sunk in, her main concern was to keep herself and her triplets safe and healthy, given that it was now a very high-risk pregnancy.\n\nTwo of the triplets were monochorionic twins, identical twins who share a placenta, an organ that delivers nutrients and oxygen to the foetus. Dr Sim said one of the complications of this is that one of the twins or both could experience suboptimal growth.\n\nAnother complication was twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, in which one twin may get too much blood, overworking the heart, while the other may receive too little for brain development and proper growth in the womb. In serious cases, both babies may not survive.\n\nAfter learning she was expecting triplets, Dr Low switched from private care at another hospital to subsidised care at KKH because of cost considerations, as well as the hospital's expertise in managing complex pregnancies.\n\nDr Sim said mothers expecting a multiple pregnancy are also at higher risk of complications, such as diabetes or high blood pressure during pregnancy.\n\nFortunately for the couple, things went well.\n\nHer only complaints were of bad morning sickness in her first trimester and a very big belly.\n\nShe said: \"I used to joke that I looked like a sotong ball on a satay stick.\"\n\nMr Chua said in jest about his four sons: \"Now I can form my own basketball team.\"\n\nTriplets are extremely rare in Singapore. There were five sets of triplets born in 2021, according to the Report on Registration of Births and Deaths published by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.\n\nSince the triplets were born, the couple have hired two confinement nannies and one domestic helper, and their parents are ready to help babysit.\n\nAside from taking things one day at a time, the couple are also still trying to figure out how to tell the triplets apart. Dr Low dresses each in a different colour to differentiate them.\n\nWhile there will be no new-year visiting for the new mother and her three infants, the family hope to welcome visitors to their home after the one-month confinement period.\n\nAnd this year's Chinese New Year is extra special for them as there is no cap on the number of visitors, unlike in the past two years.\n\nDr Low said: \"We want to give couples who have difficulties getting pregnant hope. And to tell them not to give up, as sometimes miracles can happen.\"\n\nRare occurrence\n\nIn a landmark study published in the journal Human Reproduction in 2018, Japanese researchers investigated the causes and prevalence of multiple pregnancies after a single embryo was implanted in a woman's womb.\n\nThey investigated close to a million cycles of a single embryo transfer and found that 29.5 per cent of the procedures resulted in pregnancy. Of these, 1.56 per cent produced twins and 0.04 per cent led to triplets.\n\nThe study found that multiple pregnancies occur through a process called zygotic splitting.\n\nA zygote is the fertilised egg cell that results from a sperm fertilising an egg, and contains all the genetic information from both parents to form a baby. The zygote soon starts to divide and subdivide into many more cells called blastomeres, which eventually form the embryo.\n\nWhen a zygote splits into two and each zygote goes on to develop into an embryo, this leads to identical twins. If it divides into three, triplets are formed, Science Daily reported.\n\nTheresa Tan\n\nSenior Social Affairs Correspondent\n\nbabies\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 10, 2025, 02:27am\n\nNewborn with 'bubble boy disease' now thriving, thanks to Singapore's early detection programme\n\nMay 31, 2025, 01:40am\n\nMay babies: Actress Grace Wong's daughter born in same month as her and husband\n\nMay 9, 2025, 12:25am\n\nTalking to your kids about the colour of their skin\n\nApr 13, 2025, 02:22am\n\nChallenges in having sex more common in women than one might think\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nCOURTS\n\nHome deals worth celebrating this SG60 with $6 OFF every $60 spent: code SG60.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bb7727e33e97a9ffba45b70dba2b0457703e84bafb02d75b4601b8694bad3e69/2023011444516345f9d2c9a2-9880-448a-9642-d5d616a8ac63_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Dr Claire Low holding Gareth (left) and Kenneth, and Mr Edwin Chua with Seth and their two-year-old son, Keith. \n", "caption": "Dr Claire Low holding Gareth (left) and Kenneth, and Mr Edwin Chua with Seth and their two-year-old son, Keith.

PHOTO: AFP\n\n.It was a jolt for Arsenal who had not conceded so early all season but they responded impressively.\n\nUnited needlessly conceded a corner after trying to play out from the back and Arsenal worked the ball to Granit Xhaka who delivered an appetising cross for Nketiah to time his leap perfectly and thump a header into the back of the net.\n\nArsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale was forced to make a save from Scott McTominay as the frantic pace continued until halftime.\n\nThe hosts moved up a gear in the second half and Saka gave them the lead in the 53rd minute with a goal to rival Rashford's. Cutting in from the right he fired a stunning left-foot shot that gave De Gea no chance.\n\nBack came United though and six minutes later they were level when Ramsdale could not deal properly with a high ball and the ball bounced out to Martinez who improvised a lobbed header that nestled in the back of the net.\n\nArsenal began to turn the screws and with 20 minutes remaining Saka almost restored Arsenal's lead with a carbon copy of his goal but this time the ball clipped the outside of the post and when De Gea saved from Nketiah it looked as though the hosts would have to settle for a point.\n\nBut Nketiah, who has established himself as a fan favourite, was on hand to flick home from in front of goal in the 90th minute after a low cross was deflected into his path.

The Straits Times tests some of them out with round-trip flights in May to some popular destinations.\n\nWhy May? For starters, there is a public holiday on May 1 (Labour Day), and one more on April 22 (Hari Raya Puasa) if you are looking at a long trip.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:31am\n\nS'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat\n\nMore related stories\n\nMay is shoulder season in many parts of the world - sans the heat, crowds and higher prices of summer (June to August). And since it is still four months away, it is not yet subject to last-minute fare hikes.\n\nHere are some tips to help you save on airfare and maximise your shopping or food budget.\n\n1. Book on weekends, fly on weekdays\n\nThis will give you the most bang for your buck, according to data from travel booking platforms.\n\nExpedia's 2023 Air Travel Hacks Report reveals that for Singapore-based travellers, tickets booked on Sundays are 30 per cent cheaper than those on Friday, the most expensive day to book.\n\nThe same report encourages travellers to depart on a Thursday, which is about 25 per cent cheaper than leaving on a Sunday, the most expensive day to fly.\n\nMeanwhile, booking platform Traveloka reports that Friday is the most expensive, and Tuesday the cheapest - with a price difference of about 14 per cent.\n\nIt may all sound rather confusing, but do not be bogged down by flying on an exact day. As a rule of thumb, midweek is when flights are likely to be cheaper and less crowded, which increases your chance of having an empty seat next to you and breezing through immigration queues.\n\nOn a Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight to London, for instance, flights on Tuesdays to Thursdays cost at least $100 to $200 less than those on other days of the week.\n\n2. Look for deals on new routes\n\nKeep an eye out for new routes, which airlines will usually promote with attractive deals.\n\nAirAsia, for instance, will launch direct flights from Singapore to Chiang Mai four times a week in February. Flights to the northern Thai city now include a layover in Bangkok. The airline offered one-way fares starting at 3,390 baht (S$136) during the launch promotion in November 2022.\n\nWhile the promotion has ended, you can still bag round-trip fares for about $255 in May 2023.\n\nWith many airlines launching new routes and reinstating old ones now that borders have reopened, the time is ripe to shop for fare deals.\n\n3. Keep destinations flexible\n\nNo concrete plans? Just want to go somewhere? Key in your dates into travel search engine Kayak's explore function and it will show you where flights are cheapest.\n\nEnter your dates into travel search engine Kayak’s explore function and it will show you where flights are cheapest. PHOTO: KAYAK/SCREENSHOT\n\nYou might get ideas for an unexplored city or you could compare prices between favourite destinations. For instance, flights to South Korea in May start at around $432, while a ticket to Osaka costs about $100 more.\n\nKayak reveals that Spain and Greece are the cheapest entry points into Europe, with flights to Madrid starting at around $950 and those to Athens starting at $816.\n\n4. Book about four to six months ahead\n\nTravel booking platform Expedia's report says it is best to book flights about four to six months in advance, and that fares peak about two to three weeks in advance.\n\nA flight from Singapore to Bali on Scoot costs about $238 in May and $355 in February.\n\nIf you are not ready to commit so far ahead, most travel booking platforms have a price alert function which will notify you when prices match your budget, so you know you are getting the best deal.\n\n5. Search in a different language or currency\n\nTravel booking platform Skyscanner is known for its low fares, but you can save even more by using the search links on its international sites, which are found at the bottom of the home page.\n\nTickets to Bali on Scoot for the same flight timings cost about $5 to $10 less on the Singapore site (\n\nwww.skyscanner.com.sg\n\n) compared with the Indonesian site (\n\nskyscanner.co.id\n\n).\n\nBooking directly on an airline's website? Toggle through different currencies to score some savings. Local currency is not always cheaper.\n\nOn AirAsia, the same round-trip flights from Singapore to Chiang Mai in May cost about $8 more when paid in Thai baht or Malaysian ringgit compared with the Singapore dollar.\n\nIn both cases, it may take a bit of trial and error to find a lower price. And if you do, minimise foreign exchange fees on your payment by using a multi-currency travel wallet such as the YouTrip pre-paid Mastercard.\n\n6. Get cashback on flight bookings\n\nMake bookings via home-grown online company Shopback, which provides cashback deals for shoppers. Travel booking platforms such as Trip.com, Expedia and Traveloka are listed there.\n\nGo to\n\nshopback.sg\n\nand click on the travel booking platform you want. You will be directed there, where you can make your booking. Shopback earns a commission from each purchase it redirects to these merchants and shares a part of that with the customer.\n\nCashback rates generally range from 2 to 6 per cent, but can go as high as 12 per cent during promotional periods such as 11/11 or Black Friday. Brands also run \"upsized cashback\" deals from time to time.\n\nAs with all deals, read the fine print. For instance, Trip.com's cashback rate is advertised as 5.5 per cent, but this applies to only hotel bookings. International flights, on the other hand, will get you 1 per cent cashback.\n\nAmong the flight booking platforms on Shopback, Traveloka now offers the best rate of 2.5 per cent cashback for flights to Britain or the United States, and 2 per cent for other outbound flights from Singapore.\n\nThis works out to $37.50 cashback for a flight to London in May that costs $1,500. It may not seem like a princely sum, but the point of cashback is that it adds up, especially between flights, hotels and other travel expenses.\n\n7. Secure your fare\n\nWhile shopping around for the best price, some airlines allow you to secure your fare for one to three days. This is handy if you have found a good deal, but need time to finalise travel plans.\n\nFare-hold fees vary depending on the cabin class and flight, and airlines usually reveal prices towards the tail end of the booking process. Checks by ST show that the fees usually range from $5 to $45 and most are non-refundable.\n\nSIA's Secure My Fare service, for instance, starts at $5 and the carrier will hold your itinerary for up to 72 hours.\n\n* Prices are correct as at Jan 16.\n\nClara Lock\n\nTravel Correspondent\n\nTRAVEL AND LEISURE\n\nTOURISM & TRAVEL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:05am\n\nSTB revokes licences of 5 travel agents\n\nJun 18, 2025, 05:17am\n\nSIA, Scoot flights from Changi Airport to Bali among dozens cancelled after Indonesia volcano eruption\n\nJun 11, 2025, 05:29am\n\nNTUC exploring options to match retrenched Jetstar Asia staff to roles at SIA Group\n\nJun 9, 2025, 07:26am\n\nGo on, recline your seat: Experts offer eight tips for a more restful flight\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0a1918e12f78a40f683c67db388bbba1ad01335f7a3b176c7ba7d0f216beb942/travel.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: ST FILE"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/530cfa58cb3c1b65b5273c98bd0f83d870d837268e08217d0363eb39f1573b81/2025-07-02T160924Z1771162797RC2FEFAE35L7RTRMADP3EUROPE-WEATHER-FRANCE.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "S'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat", "caption": "Enter your dates into travel search engine Kayak’s explore function and it will show you where flights are cheapest.

Dressed in a simple white tank top and looking surprisingly refreshed, she takes our video call in the back seat of the car as her mother, Singapore actor Xiang Yun, drives her home.\n\nThere are no complaints about how hard the day had been, even though Yixin plays a physically scarred character whose makeup has been causing outbreaks on her sensitive skin. She breaks into a smile as we chat, and there's a note of positivity in her voice. When I thank her for making time despite her packed schedule, she starts off brightly: \"It's been a long day, but we ended off on a good note.\"\n\nIn a crowd of rising second generation stars such as Chantalle Ng, Tay Ying and Eleanor Lee, the 22-year-old, with her girl-next-door vibes, may not yet be a familiar face among local audiences, but she is determined to push herself to be the best she can be. Yixin is the first among them to score an international leading role as Ling in the recently released 13-episode Netflix series Mr Midnight: Beware the Monsters, which is adapted from the local horror-mystery children's book series of the same name.\n\nThe show, which chronicles the adventures of four youths who investigate paranormal activities in the small fictional town of Tanah Merah, also features Malaysian actor Idan Aedan as Tyar, a teenager who has developed a connection with the spirit world, and local thespian Lim Yu Beng, as Ling's father, Uncle Tan. Yixin discovered her love for performing when she joined Chinese dance as a co-curricular activity in secondary school, and she later enrolled in Singapore Polytechnic's applied drama and psychology course.\n\nDuring that time, she struggled to reconcile her passion with a gnawing sense of insecurity, but she is slowly learning how to embrace confidence with humility - without the guilt.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 23, 2024, 07:55am\n\nMarcus Chin in good spirits after second heart surgery\n\nMore related stories\n\nShe shares: \"Acting has always been very present in my life. Mingling and interacting with people who are so passionate about the arts really inspired me, and I fell in love with it over the years. Performing has always been something that makes me happy.\"\n\nBut she almost never entered the industry because of the intense scrutiny she has always been under, thanks to her famous parents, both of whom have starred in beloved local productions such as The Awakening (1984), and Zero to Hero (2005). Xiang Yun, 61, has even been dubbed one of Singapore's first A-list TV stars.\n\nYixin modelling for Fendi (Nylon windbreaker, silk skirt, and Fendi Baguette nylon bag)\n\nThe scrutiny was especially harsh during her growing up years. As a teenager, Yixin battled skin problems and was \"on the heavier side\". She recalled: \"People would comment online or come up to me saying, 'Why do you have very bad skin? Why [do] you never take care of your skin?' - as if I wanted to have acne problems. I was only 14 [and] people would tell me not to eat so much.\n\n\"There would be discussions on the Internet on 'why the parents look like this and she looks like that'. These unhealthy beauty standards triggered me a lot. I wasn't angry, but more hurt, I guess.\"\n\nAs we converse, it becomes apparent that it wasn't so much what other people thought of Yixin that contributed to her confidence struggles, but because she is fiercely protective of her family, especially her parents, whom she considers her inspiration.\n\n\"If I mess up, if I'm not good at acting on set, if I do a lot of NG (no good) takes, it's not Yixin that messed up, it's that 'Edmund Chen and Xiang Yun's daughter cannot act'. That's the kind of narrative that has been played, and it has affected me more than it should.\"\n\nYixin's previous acting experiences include being a shy nine-year-old in a cameo role with her elder brother Chen Xi in Echoing Love, an indie film directed by their father Edmund Chen, and as Sissy in last year's television reboot of the 1998 local movie The Teenage Textbook.\n\nThe Teenage Textbook and Mr Midnight marked turning points for her not just professionally, but also personally.\n\nShe says: \"I usually cringe when I watch my own shows, but the environment in The Teenage Textbook was so safe and encouraging that I dared to play out of my character. Sissy Song is way more outspoken and extroverted than I am. Having to act sassy, bitchy and walk around in heels took me out of my element, but I had a blast.\n\n\"The director and producer would tell me where I got it right or was doing too much. I realised that no one had ever stopped me from making mistakes; it was all expectations that I had put on myself.\"\n\nOne day, while the cast was going through the weekly rushes (unedited raw footage) on the set of Mr Midnight, Yixin squirmed at her scenes, even though the director said she did well. It was not lost on the director, who chided her and asked why she would brush compliments aside.\n\n\"They told me that I was not being nice to myself, and that I should embrace it and accept that I'm good when I'm told so,\" she shared.\n\n\"Since then, I have taken notice of how I react and the way I behave when I get compliments. I think it stems from my mother telling me that no matter how far I go in the industry, I must be grateful and not big-headed. But I've learnt that it's good to practise confidence, even though I may not be feeling my best at that point in time. It's ok to tell yourself that you are doing well and good.\"\n\nAgain, the fear of her parents' reputation being tarnished rears its head. \"One of the stereotypes of being associated with our parents is that we're all very arrogant and ungrateful, but we are all human; we make mistakes, we go through hard times, yet we are pressured to be constantly at our best,\" she says.\n\nChasing her dreams\n\nYixin's career is her priority now - dream roles include being a villain and starring in an action movie - and she plans to attend acting courses overseas to gain experience. Mr Midnight is a significant feather in her cap - she went through four global auditions, without knowing it would be on Netflix, before clinching the role of Ling. In one of the auditions, different sets of actors for the lead roles were put through spontaneous scripts to assess the combination with the best rapport. Each round's results were only revealed three months later.\n\n\"When my manager told me that I got the role, I screamed! It was at the beginning of Covid in 2020, so it was the craziest news ever,\" she said, beaming. Her other passions are travel and photography, and both are well expressed through her Instagram pages (@chxnyixin, 91K followers and @xineries, 2,500 followers), which showcase scenery and behind-the-scenes shots captured with her Fujifilm X100V camera.\n\nHer romance with fellow actor Gavin Teo, who shares similar interests, is also going swimmingly, and the duo have been travelling together and with Yixin's family. Family bonds remain strong, and Yixin and her brother Chen Xi are often each other's sounding boards on acting, food and his sketches. The family also makes time to have dinner together at home at least once a week.\n\nYixin is especially thankful that she can talk about \"anything under the sun\" with her parents, and wants to create the same safe space in her industry.\n\nShe says: \"They're very understanding of my emotions, which is not very common in Asian families. I've been brought up in an environment where I can safely speak my thoughts and how I feel, and I am very grateful for that. I feel that words matter and being authentic is important, and that's the kind of environment I would always want to provide for my fellow cast and colleagues.\"\n\nThis article was first published in Her World.\n\nGrace Ma\n\nlocal actor\n\nFASHION MODELS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 20, 2024, 07:07am\n\nJeanette Aw holds on to tent during Mid-Autumn Festival\n\nSep 18, 2024, 01:40am\n\nActor Ryan Lian arrested for allegedly tampering with lock\n\nAug 15, 2024, 01:21am\n\nCyclist falls after riding into actor Chen Hanwei's car\n\nJul 31, 2024, 12:31am\n\nSuhaimi Yusof makes lifestyle adjustments post-stroke\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nCOURTS\n\nCelebrate home the smart way: use code SG60 to get $6 OFF every $60.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6d270e727aaeff93018eed71c8ce99ac7dcfa5e2dd6e875aec1ba805cf45c596/44.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTOS: HER WORLD"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b978c517741bec5f7a32ca8e68cb739c3f1f063d23d62660c95c439261b5d09f/mc.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Marcus Chin in good spirits after second heart surgery", "caption": "Yixin modelling for Fendi (Nylon windbreaker, silk skirt, and Fendi Baguette nylon bag)"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/760b9f607eb23f75dbfef60ba9177d7cd40d1548775623577537152acfab9596/22.jpg?w=975", "alt_text": "738", "caption": "Yixin modelling for Fendi (Nylon windbreaker, silk skirt, and Fendi Baguette nylon bag)"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6b6859a40e2a5a2892a454ed741a0d1e7d18f7f9f23521c1feb7abe2f28519dc/screenshot_2024-09-20_at_2.57.54_pm.png?w=318", "alt_text": "Jeanette Aw holds on to tent during Mid-Autumn Festival", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He will have to be very good to get over the second-run syndrome.\n\nHole In One, on the other hand, has fresh legs.\n\nThis will be his first outing after his comprehensive victory on Nov 26, the final day of the 2022 season.\n\nThe rest seems to have done him a world of good. He impressed in his trial on Jan 12.\n\nHe missed the start, raced wide all the way and ran on beautifully to finish a half-length second behind Winning Stride.\n\nHe probably would have won had jockey A'Isisuhairi Kasim ask for something.\n\nA'Isisuhairi, who top scored with three winners on the first race day of 2023, has a full book of 12 rides for eight different trainers and Hole In One looks his best bet.\n\n\"He trialled very well. The horse is fit and sound,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a horse with some ability, for sure. He has a good draw on Monday and is meeting a small field. Hopefully, I can get the job done.\"\n\nHole In One has drawn pole position and should get a nice cover.\n\nHe also has a handy 54.5kg weight, 2.5kg lighter than when he took the Restricted Maiden event over 1,200m in a smart 1min 10.03sec.\n\nHe was then ridden by Vlad Duric, who cannot make Monday's allocated weight.\n\nHole In One won two trials and was backed as a sure thing ($7) on debut on Nov 5, but he was hemmed in on the rails and finished fifth.\n\nHe recouped the losses with a fluent victory despite racing a tad greenly and being bumped twice.\n\nThird-up on Monday, it should be smooth sailing.\n\nThe Tim Fitzsimmons-trained Kick, who has two seconds and a fourth from four starts, could be his main threat.\n\nHe is a nice type, no doubt. But, on appearance, he looked short of a run when he cantered on the training track.\n\nHe also has to give Hole In One 3.5kg and will start from Gate 6.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nRecession-Proof Investments to Know in 2025\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/31b0e8daa24f68dfed348a9493a0ef459ee580c06d46fe658a98d3ee7b9fb475/hole_in_one.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The promising Hole In One winning second-up with Vlad Duric astride on Nov 26, 2022.

Both were 250km multi-day treks with point-to-point courses broken up into six stages.\n\nBut the Antarctica race was his most gruelling yet.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 17, 2024, 03:38am\n\nPounding the pavement for charity\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"On my second day, I was still learning how to run on the snow, and it was really challenging on the ankles and the knees. I fell down quite a few times,\" said Mr Koh, adding that he also cut himself with the microspikes he wore over his shoes for better grip on the frozen terrain.\n\nMr Koh had come a long way from April 2022, when the physical education (PE) teacher was rudely awakened some nights from the excruciating pain in his left hip.\n\nIt was the result of his active lifestyle, comprising two PE classes daily and 10km runs three times a week.\n\nHe sought help at Alexandra Hospital, and was diagnosed with osteoarthritis, a condition where the cartilage that cushions the ends of bones degenerates due to wear and tear.\n\nBy then, Mr Koh had already set his mind on completing the once-in-a-lifetime ultramarathon in December. He would need hip replacement surgery if he wanted to run pain-free.\n\n\"It's not every year that I'm 50… and I thought it would be quite significant to have an event to round up that age,\" said Mr Koh.\n\nBut hip replacement surgery has risks.\n\nDr Chua Wei Liang, Mr Koh's surgeon and Alexandra Hospital's deputy head of orthopaedic surgery, said that hip replacements involving a standard implant with a ball-in-socket mechanism have up to a 10 per cent chance of dislocation.\n\nMr Koh underwent the surgery on May 23, and spent six weeks rehabilitating.  PHOTO: COURTESY OF KOH SUAN LAM\n\nBut a newer, dual-mobility implant - which has a smaller metal or ceramic head snap-fitted inside a large plastic head - allows for greater range of motion and more stability. The risk of dislocation is half of the traditional implant's.\n\n\"Given that Mr Koh was one of my younger patients, the dual-mobility hip replacement was a better option than the standard. (He also) lived a life of competitive sports, including hardship marathons…\n\n\"This technique was the best option to allow him to return to such an elite athletic level,\" said Dr Chua, who added that one out of five of his patients is suitable for the dual-mobility hip implant.\n\nMr Koh underwent the surgery on May 23, and spent six weeks rehabilitating.\n\nOf his first run after the operation in July, Mr Koh said: \"It was quite simple because I ran one minute, and stopped for one minute, as advised by my physiotherapist. But (running) gave me such a feeling of happiness.\"\n\nHe added that it took him about a month before he could go non-stop during a run.\n\nMr Koh had come a long way from April 2022, when he was rudely awakened some nights from the excruciating pain in his left hip. ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG\n\nAs he recovered, Mr Koh began training for the ultramarathon, clocking 300km a month in September, slowly increasing his mileage to 700km a month prior to the race in November.\n\nAn ultramarathon is a running race longer than the traditional marathon distance of 42.195km.\n\nForty-three participants, including Mr Koh, boarded an expedition ship in Ushuaia, Argentina, on Nov 22.\n\nThe group sailed for two days, crossing the Drake Passage, infamous for being one of the most treacherous maritime routes, before the ship docked at the tip of Antarctica.\n\nOver the next six days of the ultramarathon, participants were taken via Zodiac boats (inflatable, pontoon-style boats) to mapped-out routes on land.\n\n\"I really can't explain in words how it feels like to run beside penguins, with seals lying by the side,\" said Mr Koh.\n\n\"My hip also felt stronger after the ultramarathon, and in fact, I ran faster after I came home from the trip!\"\n\nLee Li Ying\n\nMarathon\n\nAntarctica\n\nsurgery\n\nteacher\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 21, 2023, 06:04am\n\nKipchoge returning for Tokyo Marathon, Hassan to debut\n\nApr 2, 2023, 02:28pm\n\nRunners queue for up to 3½ hours for race pack at Suntec, organiser apologises\n\nFeb 13, 2023, 10:51am\n\nNo sweat for Fat Gor: Chow Yun Fat completes 10km marathon; jokes he is \"still too young\"\n\nDec 9, 2022, 01:54pm\n\nSmoking marathoner may face ban in China\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e76d558945df5d7128cf7e6d188ce6f184ab475911bc8cd27488b74f449281ae/aihip2001_4.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Teacher Koh Suan Lam marked 50th birthday by taking part in the Antarctica leg of the Racing the Planet 4 Deserts Ultramarathon Series in Nov, 2022.

He is by The Factor, a Group 1 winner on dirt. He has always trialled well on the surface and can go one better. 3 Super Win Dragon will probably start at very short odds. He has been imperious this term with three wins from three outings - all on dirt. He could be hard to catch. 1 Ka Ying Master rarely runs a bad race. He is also capable of going one better. 4 Astrologer has always trialled well on the dirt. Next best.\n\nRace 2 (1,200m)\n\n2 Colourful Prince is expected to fire to the front. He has got the gate speed to do so and give him every chance to nail a first win. The dirt suits, so does his pairing with Lyle Hewitson, who snared a double at Happy Valley on Wednesday. 11 Fortune Marbo is better than his form suggests. His trials on the dirt have been very good. He is worth an each-way ticket. 3 Touch Faith is a winner on the dirt but may find this difficult from Gate 12. He does get Zac Purton to offset this hindrance. 7 Gold Comet is returning to form. He can mount a challenge.\n\nRace 3 (1,600m)\n\n4 The Rock had a minor setback recently but his latest trackwork was impressive. He is no stranger to drastic form reversals but Gate 1 will give him every chance to knock his rivals out. 3 All For St Paul's should find the front and lead this group. He is tough, tenacious and capable of winning. 2 Running Glory has the class but suspect he is better over further. However, this is not an overly strong field. 1 Excellent Proposal has mixed his form but this is a significant dip to what he is used to.\n\nRace 4 (1,200m)\n\n13 Alloy Star is on the quick back-up. He caught the eye six days ago, flashing home to finish fifth. With the huge advantage of a light weight, he looks the one to beat. 14 Raging Blaze also has no weight on his back. He has been improving this season and has shown that he is very close to a first win. 3 M M Johnny is in sound form and looking to snap consecutive runner-up efforts. 5 Encore flashed home fifth two runs back. Expect him to reproduce that effort.\n\nRace 5 (1,200m)\n\n1 Sergeant Pepper has a significant class edge on this group. He returns to the dirt after a long time but he has always trialled well on it. He looks well placed with the return to Class 4. 4 Flying Bonus can lead. From there, he should take a fair bit of running down. 3 Shining Fortune loves the dirt and is racing well. 11 Son Pak Fu can improve sharply. Big watch with no weight.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nRace 6 (1,600m)\n\n10 General Ace was squeezed out of his most recent outing. Forgive that run. He is capable of improving, especially with Vincent Ho sticking aboard. Gate 1 should see him save ground throughout. 6 Flying Mojito turned his form around to finish a close second last start. He is improving and Purton's booking bears close watching. 3 Turquoise Alpha has not done too badly since his last success four starts back. It would not surprise to see him return to form. 1 Oscar Glory should find the front. He can take running down at times.\n\nRace 7 (1,000m)\n\n6 Noble One did well last start but had no luck when it mattered. He can bounce back, especially as the outside draw should afford him the run of the race. 2 Excellent Fighter won on debut in the same race. He looks to have plenty up his sleeve and his pairing with Silvestre de Sousa bodes well for this contest. 9 Prince Of Porty steps out following a number of tidy trials. Purton hops up for his debut and this contest shapes as a suitable starting point. 1 Forte finished second at his penultimate start. Do not rule him out.\n\nRace 8 (1,400m)\n\n13 Gallant Hero has a powerful finish. He has shown several times this season that he is very close to a first win. The light weight should afford him his opportunity. 2 Forerunner was impressive when winning on debut. He takes a step up in a grade but he appears above average. 10 Run Run Buddy can improve following a sound effort on debut for second. 3 The Hulk has the class to score. The question is whether he is in the right vein of form.\n\nRace 9 (2,000m)\n\n4 Five G Patch is the one to beat, after a cracking run at Happy Valley last start. He should be fit and ready to lead his rivals on a merry chase. 12 Natural Storm is chasing back-to-back wins. The distance is of no concern and the light weight is more than ideal. 10 Hit The Shot does nothing wrong. Expect him to fight out yet another finish. 6 Intrepid Winner mixes his form but is more than capable over 2,000m. He has a powerful finish.\n\nRace 10 (1,200m)\n\n7 Magniac makes his debut in Hong Kong after impressing in his trials. He appears well educated and his trio of wins in Australia were sound. He looks ready to make an immediate impact. 4 Beauty Eternal is very talented with a win and a third in two starts, but he can be his own worst enemy. He is a major player should he receive the chance to show his best. 8 Hyper Dragon Ball is the each-way play of the race. Expect sharp improvement from him at a price. 1 Jumbo Fortune is dropping in class and can spring a surprise.\n\n*Comments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3fe53afe4872b838ce76fd0d73927d7b05ec42191529bb2630cbc0b3339fef5d/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Sergeant Pepper has a significant class edge over his rivals in Race 5 at Sha Tin on Saturday.\n", "caption": "Sergeant Pepper has a significant class edge over his rivals in Race 5 at Sha Tin on Saturday.

Just last week, Kunlavut, 21, had beaten the Singaporean at the same stage of the Malaysia Open.\n\nAndrew described Loh's performance as \"fluctuating\", adding that there were periods where he was dominant and times where he could not gain the initiative.\n\n\"In the latter cases, he is then under a lot of pressure to play very tight with a low margin for error which is hard against a player like Vitidsarn,\" said Andrew.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 7, 2025, 11:31pm\n\nSingaporean athletes at World Masters Games prove age is no barrier to fitness\n\n1\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"That said, there were still some very good areas where we're seeing some progress in areas Kean Yew is working in.\"\n\nIt was a close start to their match at the KD Jadhav Indoor Hall in New Delhi but, with the score tied at 6-6, Loh made it 7-6 with a cross-court smash and went into the interval 11-7 up.\n\nA strong defensive showing then helped world No. 8 Kunlavut claim the next 12 points before taking the first game 21-12.\n\nThe second game saw the pair exchange leads several times but, with the score at 17-17, Kunlavut pulled ahead to win the match in 39 minutes.\n\nIn Saturday's semi-finals, Kunlavut will face Indonesia's Anthony Ginting, who beat China's Li Shifeng 21-11, 17-21, 21-18.\n\nAfter the match, Loh, 25, said: \"Nothing much to say, ups and downs are normal in sports. I just need to rest the mind a little, reflect and try again.\"\n\nNext up for Loh is the Indonesia Masters in Jakarta from Tuesday to Sunday.\n\nAndrew noted that Loh has \"a few small gains to make which can make a noticeable difference\".\n\nHe said: \"He's good in the front court but can control more there. There are times in rallies and matches where he needs to be more patient then at times he needs to go in full attack.\n\n\"The advantage to be gained here is identifying the right strategy at the right moments.

The spokesman also noted that the SPH Media Holdings Board has tasked its audit and risk committee to further investigate the issues more fully.\n\n\"MCI has requested for SPH Media Holdings Board to share these findings when ready and expects full cooperation on this,\" the spokesman said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 12:27pm\n\nST has Government's full backing to stay relevant in digital age: PM Wong\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"MCI is undergoing its own review of whether the inconsistencies would have affected the decision to fund SMT, and the amount the Government committed to fund. We have not disbursed any of these funds to SMT to date. We will share our findings in due course,\" the spokesman added.\n\nThe overstated circulation numbers were discovered in an internal review covering the period between September 2020 and March 2022, to assess data that SPH Media had taken over from its predecessor Singapore Press Holdings Limited.\n\nMCI had previously stated that SMT will receive public funding of up to S$180 million a year over five years, with the company required to provide half-yearly progress updates.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, SPH Media, which has come under public criticism after announcing the discovery on Jan 9, said its Board's Audit and Risk Committee will focus investigations on the preliminary findings that circulation figures had been overstated by up to 90,000 average daily copies in some months.\n\nThe committee will also commission legal advisers to assist in the probe, and report its findings directly to the SPH Media board.\n\nSeveral MPs have filed questions on the matter for Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo for the next Parliament sitting on Feb 6.\n\nPeople's Action Party MP Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio GRC) has asked whether the Government could provide some insight from the internal report received from SPH Media regarding the alleged inconsistencies in its circulation data, and how these could possibly impact the Government's commitment to fund the company. Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang GRC) has asked if the Government will adjust the grant given to SPH Media.\n\nWorkers' Party MP Dennis Tan (Hougang) has asked how the inconsistencies in circulation data will impact the Government's commitment to fund SMT while fellow WP MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) asked whether individuals involved in initiating and perpetuating the inflated circulation figures in SMT have been referred to the police for further investigation.  WP MP Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) has asked about the total number of copies that were printed, counted and destroyed and the environmental impact of these actions.\n\nThe Progress Singapore Party has called for an independent inquiry to be conducted and said its Non-Constituency MPs will pursue the matter in Parliament.\n\nAsked about the issue in an interview with Singapore media in Davos, Switzerland, Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo said similar questions have been raised, and will be addressed in Parliament when it sits.\n\n\"We are taking the matter seriously,\" said Mrs Teo. \"The appropriate place to answer these questions is Parliament, so that will come up at the next sitting.\"\n\nBy\n\nJean Iau\n\nRead articles by Jean Iau\n\nSPH MEDIA TRUST\n\nMCI\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22, 2025, 09:56am\n\nNew website, new features, New Paper: TNP unveils fresh look and interactive upgrades\n\nMar 8, 2025, 12:49am\n\nS'poreans still rely on public service media for credible news: Minister\n\nNov 4, 2024, 03:09am\n\nSPH Media lays off 34 employees amid tech division restructuring\n\nNov 26, 2023, 06:07pm\n\nWhat keeps one newspaper vendor going despite increasingly tough times\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f6efc780c6cf78fdf758ae0ef1226e423ee1f050b97fe4001092c9433b3d214d/dji0284_4.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "MCI had previously stated that SPH Media Trust will receive public funding of up to S$180 million a year over five years. \n", "caption": "MCI had previously stated that SPH Media Trust will receive public funding of up to S$180 million a year over five years.

At the time of the report, (Singh) had already retired from service, and was no longer with SPF since June 13, 2016. Victim care support was offered to the victims.\"\n\nSingh's case has been adjourned to Feb 17.\n\nSeparately, Abdul Gaffor allegedly committed molestation on four separate occasions at around 2am on Nov 4, 2020.\n\nHe is accused of performing acts such as touching a woman's breast.\n\nThe location where he allegedly committed the offences has been redacted from court documents.\n\nIn their statement, the police spokesman said: \"The alleged offences against Abdul Gaffor were surfaced in a police report made by the victim on May 11, 2021.\n\n\"Following the report, SPF swiftly initiated investigations and removed Abdul Gaffor from front-line duties.

He was fined $5,000 for his offences.\n\nBetween September and October 2020, Lin was engaged by the owners of a house in Whitley Residences, a development in Whitley Road which comprises 61 semi-detached units, to sell their property.\n\nThe owners also engaged another property agent, known only as Gideon, to market their property for sale.\n\nIn October 2020, Lin placed an advertisement on PropertyGuru for the property at an asking price of $4.8 million. This was subsequently lowered to $4.6 million in November 2020 due to a lack of response.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 18, 2024, 02:00am\n\nHousebreaking syndicates have stolen $3.85m since June\n\nMore related stories\n\nLater that month, Lin placed a fake advertisement on PropertyGuru, purportedly for another unit in Whitley Residences. The unit was listed at a lower, more attractive asking price of $4.38 million.\n\nLin did so because he wanted to test the response of house hunters to the unit.\n\nHe said: \"This listing was created by me to direct (potential buyers) to (the) developer's units after I (had) seen zero response for the $4.6 million listing. It worked and I (had) seen a couple of enquiries and managed to bring (them) over to both developer's units and my resale unit.\"\n\nIn November 2020, Lin saw that another property agent, known only as Denise, had copied his fake listing to market the property.\n\nWhen he confronted her on Nov 15, 2020, she said that the contents of her listing were provided by Gideon.\n\nLin then lodged a complaint against Denise with the CEA, alleging that she had copied his listing without his consent.\n\nHowever, while recording a statement as part of investigations, Lin provided false information to the council.\n\nMr Gavin Ng and Ms Magdelene Sim, prosecuting officers for CEA, said that Lin claimed that he had two resale units at Whitley Residences.\n\nLin said the \"owners\" of the unit had verbally given him consent to market the property. He added that the \"owners\" were not willing to reveal too much information because they did not want the neighbours to know they were selling the unit at the lowest price in the whole development.\n\nOn Jan 21, 2021, three days after he recorded the statement, Lin wrote an e-mail to CEA confessing he was not authorised to sell the unit in the fake listing.\n\nHe said in his e-mail: \"After much consideration, I've decided to come clean with the details. I (acknowledge) that I've given inaccurate information (in) the statement and am aware of the consequences… and truly (regret) it.\"\n\nHe added: \"This story was made up by me to get away from the recording officer in probing further on this matter.\"\n\nIn mitigation, Lin's lawyer, Mr Justin Ng from Kalco Law, said: \"As the Covid-19 pandemic came into full force in early 2020 and lasted for more than two years, the property market was significantly affected.\n\n\"The accused struggled to make ends meet as a budding estate agent in what was already a highly competitive industry. It was under these circumstances that the accused resorted to creating a fake listing on the PropertyGuru website.\"\n\nIn response to queries from The Straits Times, CEA said it will commence the process to revoke Lin's property agent registration.\n\nAn ERA spokesman said: \"We expect our agents to uphold themselves to the highest standards of ethics and professionalism when carrying out their jobs as real estate agents. We do not condone behaviours that go against the code of ethics.\"\n\nBy\n\nJessie Lim\n\nRead articles by Jessie Lim\n\nLANDED PROPERTY\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 13, 2024, 07:52am\n\nSCDF puts out fire at terrace house near Katong Shopping Centre\n\nDec 6, 2023, 12:08pm\n\nWoman who bought $18.68m GCB loses lawsuit against property agency over seller's brochure\n\nJan 10, 2023, 01:34am\n\nFire at East Coast Road house, 20 people evacuated, one in hospital\n\nApr 19, 2022, 08:00am\n\nHong Fok's Cheong family puts up Oxley Rise mansion for sale\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nYour dream home, now more affordable with IKEA home design ​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/eb8b3fa341401d24fea00343003b91ac75ab47a817ae21bc90417f4284b434e5/hzagent200122a_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Property agent Terrence Lin is the first person to be prosecuted for providing false information under the Estate Agents Act. \n", "caption": "Property agent Terrence Lin is the first person to be prosecuted for providing false information under the Estate Agents Act.

He is represented by Mr James Gomez from Edmond Pereira Law Corp.\n\nQuah allegedly helped his patients make false representations to MOH that they were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine when they were not.\n\nThese offences allegedly happened between October 2021 and January 2022.\n\nAs a result of Quah's actions, his patients were considered as vaccinated and eligible for all vaccination-differentiated safe management measures.\n\nIn grounds of decision published in April 2022, the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) said that instead of administering the Covid-19 vaccine,\n\nQuah had given the patients saline solution.\n\nAt least three patients\n\npaid him $1,000 to $1,500 for each dose.\n\nKoh and Quah's clinical assistant, Thomas Chua, 40, are also mentioned in some of the charges. Koh allegedly referred patients to Quah.\n\n(From left) Iris Koh, Jipson Quah and Thomas Chua were handed additional charges on July 27, 2022.

They are Wan Medical Clinic in Bedok; Mayfair Medical Clinic in Woodlands; Mayfair Medical Clinic in Chong Pang, Yishun; and Ong Clinic & Surgery, also in Yishun.\n\nMOH had earlier said it would be issuing notices of suspension to the four clinics that Quah owned or was clinic manager of, and would revoke their approvals to conduct rapid tests for Covid-19.\n\nIf convicted of dishonestly making a false representation to MOH, Quah can be jailed for up to 20 years and fined.\n\nBesides Quah's criminal charges, SMC also said in its grounds of decision that Quah allegedly organised remote pre-event testing for unvaccinated people, even though this was not allowed at the time. Such people could pay him a monthly subscription fee of $125 for daily testing, or pay $12 per test on an ad hoc basis.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nAussie allegedly conspired with GP to unlawfully obtain Covid-19 vaccination certificates\n\nGP Jipson Quah, accused of submitting fake vaccination data, placed on leave by company\n\nOne clinic staff member - identified as \"C\" - also allowed people to send pre-recorded videos of themselves taking a Covid-19 test, in which they would state their names and the date and time. Their test results would then be uploaded to an MOH database.\n\nLastly, a patient allegedly approached Quah to get a letter exempting her from being vaccinated against Covid-19. She showed him her positive serology results, indicating that she had recovered from the virus in the past.\n\nSeparately, a complaint filed against police officers by Koh was dismissed by a magistrate's court on Jan 9.\n\nKoh, who was arrested in January 2022\n\nfor allegedly conspiring to cheat and submit falsified vaccination records to MOH, had filed a magistrate's complaint against four police officers she claimed had mishandled personal items seized from her after her arrest.\n\nThe magistrate dismissed her complaint\n\nand said Koh did not provide any credible evidence that the police officers had committed an offence under the Penal Code.\n\nQuah will return to court for a pre-trial conference on Feb 6.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCourt dismisses complaint against police officers by Healing the Divide’s Iris Koh\n\nGP Jipson Quah, initially accused of cheating MOH, has charge amended to more serious offence\n\nJessie Lim\n\nDOCTORS/SURGEONS\n\nMinistry of Health\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Money Market Funds in Singapore for Smarter Cash Management\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/34b8c211819150871e732563fb49dda85eace08d7b319aaba20ec5da538e33af/IMG639320copy_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jipson Quah allegedly helped patients make false representations to the Health Ministry that they were vaccinated.", "caption": "Jipson Quah allegedly helped patients make false representations to the Health Ministry that they were vaccinated.

Ms Varsha and Mr Ahjay were each accused of one count of forgery.\n\nMs Ketaki was accused of slapping Ms Susi once in 2015 and another time in 2016.\n\nOn or around Sept 5, 2016, Ms Ketaki was said to have submitted to the Ministry of Manpower a forged three-page document comprising monthly salary receipt acknowledgements for June 2015 to May 2016 purportedly signed off by Ms Susi.\n\nShe was also accused of working together with Ms Varsha and Mr Ahjay to commit forgery some time between Jan 1 and Sept 12, 2017, by allegedly making a false one-page apology letter, purportedly signed by the maid.\n\nAccording to court documents, Ms Ketaki is married to Mr Ahjay's brother, while Ms Varsha is Mr Ahjay's wife.\n\nIn his submissions, defence lawyer Amarjit Singh Sidhu said that Ms Ketaki employed Ms Susi on Jan 19, 2011, mainly to take care of her two sons and perform household chores.\n\nThe lawyer from Amarjit Sidhu Law Corp added: \"While Susi had made several mistakes and misdeeds over the course of her employment, such as taking monies and belongings without Ketaki's permission, and emptying Ketaki's facial serum when she was unhappy that she got a scolding from Ketaki, Ketaki did not terminate Susi's employment as she viewed Susi as a good helper who could take care of her sons well.\n\n\"Save for scolding Susi whenever she did not do a good job in caring for her sons or household chores, Ketaki denies causing any physical harm to Susi.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCharges withdrawn for teacher, husband accused of maid abuse\n\nWoman who joined daughter in torturing Myanmar maid to death gets 14 years’ jail\n\nMr Amarjit told the court that Ms Susi left her workplace at around 5am on June 13, 2016 and sought help at a shelter, alleging that she had been physically abused and that Ms Ketaki had owed her salary.\n\nThe police were then alerted.\n\nAfter the trial, the lawyer said in his submissions that it would be unsafe to convict Ms Ketaki, Mr Ahjay and Ms Varsha, adding: \"(Ms Susi's) non-appearance in court has caused irremediable prejudice to the accused.\n\n\"(Ms Susi's) evidence cannot be tested under the scrutiny of cross-examination.\"\n\nIf convicted of maid abuse, Ms Ketaki could have been jailed for up to three years and fined up to $7,500 for each charge.\n\nFor each count of forgery, an offender can be jailed for up to four years and fined.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n9 months’ jail for maid abuser whose helper ran away after she was assaulted multiple times\n\nCourts & Crime: Read more stories\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nMAID/DOMESTIC WORKER\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nCOURTS\n\nCelebrate home with SG60 exclusive discount code SG60 to get $6 OFF $60 spent.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2f0224e8d4663c96337abde623593e4b9ce1a0f83d5515f05483c7dd0e930ae7/yaohui-pixcourts-3224_0_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ms Ketaki Rai was given a discharge amounting to an acquital.

The majority were digital copies.\n\nAnother 5,000 average daily copies continued to be recorded in circulation numbers after contracts had lapsed, while 17,000 copies on average were recorded as a result of a failure to check that reported numbers were accurate against actual usage tracked in the system.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 12:27pm\n\nST has Government's full backing to stay relevant in digital age: PM Wong\n\nMore related stories\n\nThere was also a possible discrepancy of 19,000 average daily copies, which included a barter arrangement with another publisher, which SPH Media did not name.\n\nSPH Media said the Audit and Risk committee will, apart from focusing investigations on the above issues, commission legal advisers to assist in the probe and report its findings directly to the SPH Media board.\n\nThe committee is chaired by former managing partner of EY Asean & Singapore Max Loh, and comprises Allen & Gledhill co-head of mergers and acquisitions Lim Mei and HSBC Singapore's vice-chairman of global banking for South-east Asia Philip Lee.\n\nNews of the overstated circulation numbers broke after several senior employees of SPH Media left the company in December 2022 following the internal audit.\n\nIn its statement on Friday, the company said a total of seven employees had been taken to task over the matter at the end of December. As a result, four of them have left the company. The other three were served warning letters.\n\nSince the overreported numbers were uncovered, some advertisers have said publicly that they had contacted the company over the matter.\n\nIn an e-mail to advertisers on January 10, SPH Media Group's chief executive officer Teo Lay Lim had said that circulation data is not used as a basis for the company's advertising packages. Instead, media rates and advertising packages are based on reach and readership, which is an estimate of how many readers a publication has.\n\nThis data on reach and readership is collected periodically via a survey panel that is statistically representative of the Singapore population, Ms Teo had said.\n\nShe had also said that circulation data is a count of how many copies of a publication are distributed, such as through regular subscriptions or off-the-shelf purchase.\n\nThe company did not clarify what circulation numbers are used for and how inflation would have affected the company or stakeholders such as advertisers and shareholders.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nSenior SPH Media staff taken to task or have left company after review finds issues with circulation data\n\nAd rates based on independent third-party readership data, not on circulation numbers: SPH Media CEO\n\nIn Friday's statement, SPH Media said that circulation data reported in previous annual reports - when the the company was known as Singapore Press Holdings and was still listed on the Singapore Exchange - was stated to be in accordance with the rules set by the Audit Bureau of Media Consumption Singapore. This entity ceased operations in Singapore in 2019, as digital and media advertising grew and quantifying print circulation became less relevant.\n\n\"To obtain data on reach and readership, SPHL commissioned surveys conducted by independent third-party research agencies such as GfK,\" said SPH Media.\n\nIt added that in light of the changing media environment, the company is reassessing the methodology for the reporting of circulation data to establish a new framework and baseline to measure its performance, something publishers elsewhere have done as circumstances have changed.\n\nSPH Media said: \"SMT is committed to upholding integrity in every part of our business.\"\n\nThe company outlined three measures it will take to ensure data  accuracy and accountability.\n\nOne, it will strengthen the separation of duties among staff, with enhanced checks and balances. For example, it will ensure that staff who are reporting circulation numbers do not have the access rights to create or change entries in the customer database.\n\nTwo, it will ensure more frequent internal audit reviews such that reporting is done based on established methodology and verified to be accurate.\n\nThree, it will enhance data quality and improve the accuracy of customer details, which includes data cleansing and independent validation of data.\n\n\"In addition to reassessing the methodology for the reporting of circulation numbers, SMT is pressing on with other transformation efforts,\" the company added.\n\n\"SMT is focused on updating its policies and practices to ensure accountability. SMT remains steadfast in its mission to deliver quality journalism.\"\n\nTham Yuen-C\n\nSenior Political Correspondent\n\nSPH MEDIA TRUST\n\nmedia\n\nSINGAPORE COMPANIES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22, 2025, 09:56am\n\nNew website, new features, New Paper: TNP unveils fresh look and interactive upgrades\n\nMar 8, 2025, 12:49am\n\nS'poreans still rely on public service media for credible news: Minister\n\nNov 4, 2024, 03:09am\n\nSPH Media lays off 34 employees amid tech division restructuring\n\nNov 26, 2023, 06:07pm\n\nWhat keeps one newspaper vendor going despite increasingly tough times\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nRecession-Proof Investments to Know in 2025\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/739b1e17544879891174f74b4063853d70e985625b0b4f69af0d510f3a77ce42/IMG6757_2.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Seven employees had been taken to task over the matter.

When I came here, I didn't see any faces that looked like me, and there were not many roles representing who we really were,\" says Yeoh, who went on to star in the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and the award-winning crossover martial arts hit Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000).\n\n\"But I think that got me motivated to say there has to be better representation, true representation.\"\n\nThings have improved since then, but there is a tendency towards tokenism, she believes.\n\nShe adds: \"The times have changed because everybody is talking about inclusivity and diversity. But you can't have them just tick a box of, 'Oh, I have a Chinese actor, that means I've diversified.'\"\n\nReal change looks like projects such as the hit 2018 romantic comedy film Crazy Rich Asians, in which Yeoh had a key supporting role as Eleanor Young, the domineering mother of leading man Nick (Henry Golding).\n\n(From left) Harry Shum Jr, Stephanie Hsu, Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan with the Best Picture award for Everything Everywhere All At Once at the 28th Critics Choice Awards in Los Angeles.

But it was, thanks to (Chinese-American director) Jon Chu's brilliance,\" says Yeoh.\n\n\"That's what we need - good storytellers who understand what are the stories that need to be told and who give us more opportunities.\"\n\nThe star also credits the \"visionary film-makers\" whom she has worked with for advancing representation.\n\nProducers Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson, for instance, cast her in her breakout Hollywood role as Bond girl Wai Lin because they knew the iconic franchise \"had to evolve\".\n\n\"And then I was blessed to be involved with Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings and Destin. We had our own Chinese superhero and that was another huge step forward,\" she says.\n\nBut the role of a lifetime was Everything Everywhere All At Once, which allowed her to draw on her martial arts background while also flexing her comedy muscles for a change.\n\n\"It was all the things an actor could hope for,\" says Yeoh.\n\n\"So, yes, I think we've broken that glass ceiling. I hope we have ninja-kicked it to hell, but the only way we can keep this going is by getting the right storytellers and having studio executives understand and keep pushing it forward, which will create more opportunities (for Asian actors).\"\n\nThe cast of Everything Everywhere All At Once accept the Best Picture award for the film during the 28th Critics Choice Awards. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nQuan, a former child star who appeared in the iconic films Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom (1984) and The Goonies (1985), explains why he retreated from acting for many years.\n\n\"When I started out, it was very difficult being an Asian actor. There were just not a lot of opportunities,\" he says.\n\nFrom the late 1990s till 2018, he turned to jobs in film production instead. \"I was working behind the camera, and I was content doing that until I noticed that the landscape had changed drastically.\"\n\nNow, Quan is \"very thankful for what Hollywood has been doing for the last five years\". He adds: \"There is a lot more progress.\"\n\nIn American Born Chinese, Quan plays Freddy Wong, an actor who starred in a popular 1990s sitcom on which his character was an Asian stereotype - a part he was offered before Everything Everywhere All At Once was released.\n\nHollywood trailblazers such as Yeoh and Cretton, a Hawaii native of Japanese descent, also inspired him to return to his first love, acting.\n\n\"They were the ones who really gave me the courage to dream again,\" says Quan.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nBanshees, Fabelmans and Everything Everywhere All At Once rack up film nominations\n\nWhy Everything Everywhere actress Stephanie Hsu deserves more awards this season\n\nAlison de Souza\n\nMovies\n\nactors\n\nAWARDS AND PRIZES\n\nAsian Celebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTrump's Tariffs & Market Volatility: What Investors Need to Know Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/47c4d929c8d2d3be9b8c8d461a67a614d302bf4a8d6e3d23c0fb0ccc245cbd60/us-entertainment-bafta-035018.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Vietnamese-American actor Ke Huy Quan and Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh will reunite for the Asian comedy television series on Disney+.", "caption": "Vietnamese-American actor Ke Huy Quan and Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh will reunite for the Asian comedy television series on Disney+.

Halls signed a plea agreement for the charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, Ms Carmack-Altwies said in her statement. Set armorer Gutierrez Reed had handled the gun before Halls.\n\n\"After a thorough review of the evidence and the laws of the state of New Mexico, I have determined that there is sufficient evidence to file criminal charges against Alec Baldwin and other members of the 'Rust' film crew,\" Ms Carmack-Altwies said, adding charges would be filed by month's end.\n\n\"On my watch, no one is above the law, and everyone deserves justice.\"\n\nThe movie's director, Joel Souza, was hit and wounded by the same .45-caliber bullet that killed Hutchins.\n\nProsecutors must prove on-set firearm safety began with Gutierrez Reed, who was in charge of weapons; applied to Halls, who checked the gun and handed it to Baldwin, then extended to the actor, who also was a producer on the film.\n\nBaldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will be charged \"in the alternative\" with two counts of manslaughter, meaning a jury will decide not only if they were guilty, but under which definition of involuntary manslaughter, the prosecutor said.\n\nSimple involuntary manslaughter for negligence is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a US$5,000 (S$6,600) fine. Should prosecutors prove there was more than simple negligence involved in the use of a firearm, they could face a five-year jail term.\n\nBaldwin has denied responsibility for Hutchins' death and said live rounds should never have been allowed onto the set of the low-budget movie. Halls told Baldwin the gun was \"cold,\" an industry term meaning it is safe to use, according to police records. It remains unclear how live ammunition got on the set.\n\n\"Mr Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun - or anywhere on the movie set. He relied on the professionals with whom he worked, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds. We will fight these charges, and we will win,\" his attorney Mr Nikas said.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nIn a statement released on behalf of the Hutchins family, lawyer Brian Panish said their own investigation also found charges were warranted.\n\n\"It is a comfort to the family that, in New Mexico, no one is above the law,\" the statement added. \"We support the charges, will fully cooperate with this prosecution, and fervently hope the justice system works to protect the public and hold accountable those who break the law.\"\n\nThe family sued Baldwin in 2021 alleging the Emmy-winning 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live actor had a responsibility to check the gun did not contain live rounds, not point it at the cinematographer, and not cock the weapon and pull the trigger.\n\nThe family subsequently reached a settlement in which Mr Matt Hutchins became an executive producer of Rust and production was set to resume early in 2023 outside New Mexico.\n\nBaldwin told ABC News in 2021 he did not pull the trigger of the replica Pietta .45-caliber long Colt revolver and it fired after he cocked it while rehearsing camera angles with Hutchins.\n\nAn FBI forensic test of the revolver found it \"functioned normally\" and would not fire without the trigger being pulled.\n\nNew Mexico's worker safety agency in April fined the film's production company US$137,000 the maximum amount possible for what it described as \"willful\" safety lapses leading to Hutchin's death.\n\nThe agency found Rust Movie Productions knew firearm safety procedures were not being followed and showed \"plain indifference\" to the hazards.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nAlec Baldwin files cross-complaint in fatal movie-set shooting\n\nAlec Baldwin, Rust producers reach settlement with family of slain cinematographer\n\nMovies\n\nactors\n\nSHOOTING - GUN CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\n2\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\n4\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nCOURTS\n\nSG60 exclusive celebration deals for home, check out with code SG60 now.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/26598d76e52f8599fe3a4ca881e608f6f642d562e573f0a9cdd5a183036a2e28/baldwin_4.png?w=965", "alt_text": "Actor Alec Baldwin has denied responsibility for the shooting, which resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.", "caption": "Actor Alec Baldwin has denied responsibility for the shooting, which resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nWithin two minutes the hosts were level as Haaland ended his three-game goal drought by heading in Mahrez's ball across the face of goal.\n\nIt was Tottenham who should have struck next as Ivan Perisic's shot from Kulusevski's inviting cross deflected off Rico Lewis onto the post.\n\nInstead, it was City who got the decisive fifth goal with questions set to be asked again of goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.\n\nRiyad Mahrez scores City’s third goal. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nThe former French captain's own goal handed Arsenal the perfect start at the weekend and he was beaten again at his near post, although Mahrez's strike did take a deflection off Ben Davies.\n\nMahrez then took his tally since the World Cup break to six goals in seven games as he anticipated a slack touch from Clement Lenglet and this time left Lloris with no chance with a dinked finish over the advancing goalkeeper.

He finished ahead of Qaidoom and War Pride, with a short head splitting the trio.\n\nNunes jumped off with nothing but praise for the Thai-owned gelding after such a thrilling first barrier trial.\n\n\"It was his first trial this prep. Tim just told me to put him at the back and let him finish off,\" said the four-time Singapore champion jockey.\n\n\"I feel he has improved after the break, he will be up to Class 3 now. He responded very quickly even if I didn't have to ask him much.\n\n\"He trialled very well. I'll leave it to Tim to decide if he needs another one.\"\n\nThe newly crowned Singapore champion trainer actually felt it was not necessary.\n\n\"I was very happy with his trial this morning. He's pulled up well and I will run him in the Class 3 1,400 next week (Jan 28),\" said the Australian.\n\n\"If he keeps improving, the Derby is his ultimate goal. Time will tell.\"\n\nThe Group 1 Singapore Derby (1,800m) is the third and last leg of the Singapore Four-Year-Old Challenge and will be run on July 23.\n\nLast year, Fitzsimmons had one of the pre-race favourites in Relentless, who eventually came up short against Lim's Kosciuszko.\n\nThe son of Hallowed Crown lost a bit of his sparkle at his subsequent starts, but his trainer put it down to racing fatigue.\n\nThe December break seems to have done Relentless a world of good as could be seen at the trials on Thursday, one before Dream Alliance.\n\nHe looked spot-on even if Vlad Duric just let him saunter around at the back.\n\n\"I'm also very happy with Relentless. He'll have a more serious trial in two weeks' time,\" said Fitzsimmons.\n\n\"He'll run in the Kranji Stakes A race over 1,400m on Feb 12.\"\n\nStablemate Boomba, with Nunes up, was a lot more industrious in the same trial, albeit more than five lengths off easy winner Be You (Matthew Kellady).\n\nNunes was pleased no end with the Barree Stable-owned son of Showcasing.\n\n\"Boomba trialled very good. The issue with him is that sometimes he doesn't jump,\" said the Brazilian ace.\n\n\"He needs to go in last, and blindfolded.\n\n\"The gates must open shortly after, or else he jumps slowly.\n\n\"That cost him the race at his last start when he ran second to Quarter Back. But today, he jumped beautifully.\"\n\nThe only other one matching Be You in terms of ease at the trials was, interestingly, a horse who is set down to run this Monday - Tom Cat.\n\nDespite coursing out three deep throughout, the Michael Clements-trained Wandjina six-year-old was simply unbeatable when Duric cut the ribbons in the home straight.\n\nA visitor at the Kranji winner's circle only twice, Tom Cat runs in the Chinese New Year meeting's opener, the $30,000 Class 5 Division 1 race over 1,200m and breaks from the second alley for Duric.\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ba9f8ff62ccc4ccea600a7ddf49c02a6c4c15c9c833a6472f62bd2792a580b83/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Dream Alliance (Manoel Nunes) sprouting wings to just touch off the fighting pair of Qaidoom (Simon Kok, centre) and War Pride (Wong Chin Chuen, inside) in barrier trial No. 4 on Thursday.", "caption": "Dream Alliance (Manoel Nunes) sprouting wings to just touch off the fighting pair of Qaidoom (Simon Kok, centre) and War Pride (Wong Chin Chuen, inside) in barrier trial No. 4 on Thursday.

But fortunately, he has sorted both out, even if one of them may recur.\n\n\"I didn't ride on the first day because my employment pass was not cleared yet,\" he said.\n\n\"I got it last week and was all set for Saturday (two rides), but then I had to pull out because of my left knee.

I now feel better, I rode this morning and felt no pain, hopefully it stays that way till Monday.\"\n\nYusoff's name figures on Monday's special Chinese New Year racecard, but he can avoid the early morning rush to the track. His two rides, King Arthur and Winning Stride, both for his former trainer Donna Logan, are in the last two events of the 12-race programme.\n\n\"As I am coming back from a long break, I decided myself to take only two rides,\" said Yusoff, explaining why he is easing back into the saddle.\n\n\"I weighed around 56-57kg when I came back from Johor Bahru. I did my usual workouts and it's now down to 52-53kg.\n\n\"This week I got one ride on King Arthur, and ma'am gave me one extra ride on Winning Stride.\n\n\"I've never ridden Winning Stride before, not even in trackwork. I think she just wanted to give me that ride to get my fitness back.\n\n\"He's drawn one. I think he's got a good chance, probably even better than King Arthur.\"\n\nKing Arthur was one of Logan's brightest sparks in 2022. The Fortuna NZ Racing Stable-owned I Am Invincible five-year-old won seven races, including a four-in-a-row with Yusoff up, to bring his total tally to nine wins.\n\nHe even nearly turned giant-killer at his first feature race when a bold second to Lim's Kosciuszko in the Group 1 Lion City Cup (1,200m) in August.\n\nBut the Daniel Meagher-trained star beat him comprehensively at his last start in a Class 1 contest over 1,200m on Nov 19.\n\n\"I've won four times on King Arthur last year and he's my favourite horse. But I think he wasn't fit enough at his last start,\" said Yusoff who was in the irons.\n\n\"I've been riding him in trackwork and he felt good, but he has a bad draw (11) this week. I hope he can just get cover and relax.\"\n\nThe $100,000 Kranji Stakes A race over 1,200m comprises the usual suspects such as Grand Koonta, Kharisma and Fame Star, but the 2022 top three-year-old Golden Monkey (now four) and up-and-coming stayer Cyclone are also in the mix.\n\nYusoff cannot wait to get back in the thick of the action as he embarks on a new chapter of his riding career.\n\nHe will now have to fend for himself among the big boys, even if Logan has not completely cut the apron strings.\n\n\"I still have a two-month contract with ma'am, and I do most of my trackwork for her,\" said Yusoff.\n\n\"But now that I am a senior rider, I want to ride trackwork for other trainers to give myself a better chance.\n\n\"As I'm taking it easy now, I ride for ma'am now but from next week onwards, I will go looking for trackwork rides from other stables.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The men cannot be named to protect the victims' identities.\n\nOne of the victims, a girl who was aged between 10 and 12 at the time, was molested on multiple occasions between 2018 and 2020 by a 25-year-old man, the police said on Wednesday.\n\nA 50-year-old man is also suspected of molesting a girl, 13, at a staircase landing of a Housing Board flat in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 in 2019. Charge sheets obtained by The Straits Times said that he had held on to her and kissed her on the lips.\n\nThe accused individuals in the two other cases involving child victims are a man, 27, who allegedly molested a 14-year-old boy at a restaurant in Paya Lebar in August 2020, and a man, 24, who allegedly molested an 11-year-old girl in a lift lobby in Bishan Street 22 in July 2022.\n\nThe 24-year-old is also accused of exposing his genitals while standing behind the girl in the lift.\n\nSeparately, another four cases of outrage of modesty allegedly occurred in nightlife establishments.\n\nThree of these took place at Singapore's largest nightclub, Marquee, which is located in Marina Bay Sands, according to court documents. The offences occurred between September and December 2022.\n\nThe men, aged between 21 and 45, are said to have touched the victims, all women aged between 22 and 27, inappropriately while in the nightclub.\n\nA man, 33, is also accused of molesting a woman, 34, at a pub in Neil Road on Nov 13, 2022.\n\nLast July, a man, 33, had also allegedly molested a woman, 27, at a coffee shop in Jurong East.\n\nAnother man, also aged 33, committed a similar offence against a woman, 31, while both of them were onboard a bus travelling along Alexandra Road.\n\nThe police said: \"Outrage of modesty cases remain a key concern... The police have zero tolerance towards sexual offenders who threaten the personal safety of those in the community, and offenders will be dealt with sternly in accordance with the law.\"\n\nIn the first half of 2022, cases of outrage of modesty increased by 4.6 per cent to 773, up from 739 cases from January to June 2021.\n\nSince March 2022, the maximum jail term for outrage of modesty has been increased from two to three years, as part of tougher measures to deter offenders.\n\nThe police said it will continue to work closely with various stakeholders, such as public entertainment outlets, public transport operators and the community, to prevent and deter such cases.\n\nMembers of the public are urged to be vigilant and to report incidents of outrage of modesty immediately to the police.\n\nBy\n\nJessie Lim\n\nRead articles by Jessie Lim\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6abf2d979208c6f0a61863f4bc68d6cb4a5de263a75e78620df427c52da0ad88/gavel.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He was arrested in February 2021 and charged with cheating and fraudulent trading.\n\nHe now faces 105 criminal charges for his alleged involvement in the scam. Previously out on a $4 million bail, he is now in remand until the full bail is made. He was allowed by the State Court to make three phone calls to secure additional funds.\n\nDeemed the \"main protagonist in a large-scale fraud\" in a State Court hearing on Thursday, Ng is accused of perpetrating a nickel trading scheme that allegedly cheated investors out of US$1.1 billion (S$1.45 billion).\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 23, 2025, 03:51am\n\nTwo men charged with procurement fraud involving Singapore Prison Service\n\nMore related stories\n\nThat Ng faces a sentence that far exceeds 20 years now that his case is to be heard by the High Court and has access to overseas assets of about $107 million held mostly by various individuals in China, translates to a potential increase in flight risk, Deputy Public Prosecutor Gordon Oh told the court on Thursday.\n\nCalling the application for bail increase crushing and baseless, Dentons Rodyk & Davidson partner Navindraram Naidu, who represents Ng, noted that his client had known of the transfer to High Court since July 2022 and has not absconded.\n\n\"He has serious bail conditions attached and time curfew. That's sufficient to secure his attendance here. If he is trying to run, why would he discuss with the authorities about bringing assets back that could go to restitution?\"\n\nMr Navin added that \"any bail increase or my client going into remand would severely hamper his defence preparation\" for a High Court trial.\n\nFurthermore, the bailor, who is Ng's father, has ensured that Ng complied with bail conditions, he said. \"The bailor is a retiree, 72, and has liquidated all his savings and stock options to raise bail for his son. Ng would not want to see his father (who is living on CPF payouts) suffer financial hardship,\" Mr Navin added.\n\nAsking for leniency on his bail, Ng said: \"I am currently on electronic tagging, which detects any movement as soon as I step out. I have no intention to abscond at all, and the information (I have) provided is to help with investigations.\"\n\nOn the issue of flight risk, District Judge Terence Tay, in his oral decision on Thursday, said: \"The prosecution loses the edge because, factually, the accused is here. But not all factors can be reviewed in the same vein by flight risk alone.\"\n\nThat the prosecution has \"not provided particulars of how Ng's assets are linked to the 105 charges is not critical, as the main concern is whether he has sufficient assets overseas should he abscond\", the judge added.\n\n\"The court is of the view that the disclosure of substantial assets overseas and that (Ng) has access to the funds is an important factor to take into account, and the fact that the monies are unaccounted for... I agree with the prosecution in increasing bail quantum to $6 million,\" the judge said.\n\nMr Robson Lee, partner of Kennedys Legal Solutions, noted: \"The bail amount is not unreasonable in view of the scale of the alleged scam, the severity of the criminal charges, and the enormous sums of monies involved. There is basis for the court to be concerned that the accused is a flight risk.\"\n\nAbout 1,000 investors, including Vickers Venture Partners founder Finian Tan and former Law Society president Thio Shen Yi, sank their money into the scheme, which touted average quarterly gains of 15 per cent.\n\nThe bankruptcy order was made against Ng on Dec 22, 2022. This came after a bankruptcy application was taken out against Ng shortly after the High Court in May 2022 cleared the way for liquidators to pursue hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly transferred wrongfully into Ng's personal accounts.\n\nIn addition to the criminal charges, Ng and three others were sued in the High Court in November 2021 by the liquidators of Envy Global Trading, Envy Asset Management and Envy Management Holdings to recover $416.5 million and US$17.7 million from his personal assets.\n\nCourt documents state that Ng's three companies received about $1.09 billion, US$277.1 million and €980,000 (S$1.4 million) in investor funds, supposedly for nickel trading.\n\nOf those sums, $578.4 million, US$192.5 million and €880,000 remain outstanding.\n\nNg was also charged with receiving $110.3 million in his personal bank accounts from EAM. He was further charged with transferring US$108,000 and $3.4 million in his personal accounts to other parties, as well as US$6.6 million to foreign bank accounts in Britain, Vietnam, Cambodia, France and Taiwan. He had also made transfers amounting to $9.8 million within his personal accounts.\n\nGrace Leong\n\nSenior Business Correspondent\n\nFraud\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 2, 2025, 02:52am\n\nNvidia chips probe: Man allegedly linked to case out on $1m bail, may face more charges\n\nApr 23, 2025, 01:39am\n\nPolice investigate 88 for suspected involvement in registering SIM cards for criminal activities\n\nApr 17, 2025, 03:03am\n\nBriton in Netflix show Con Mum offered $50k bail; alleged offences involve around $500k\n\nApr 15, 2025, 10:17am\n\nSingaporean woman nabbed in Taiwan for alleged scam, money laundering offences\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5c74f2ffcb61f2ac059fe4de95d47df7908dc53b0d15daa0653e8abb2b01a518/2023011710991453518176984-5d14-4d81-af6d-ac0904f15685_13.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ng Yu Zhi is accused of perpetrating a nickel trading scheme that allegedly cheated investors out of US$1.1 billion (S$1.45 billion). \n", "caption": "Ng Yu Zhi is accused of perpetrating a nickel trading scheme that allegedly cheated investors out of US$1.1 billion (S$1.45 billion).

Why don't you get him out of the stadium?\"\n\nFour fans, beer in hand, were later shown being escorted out.\n\nThe dogged win set up a clash against Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov, who swept past another Serb, Laslo Djere, 6-3, 6-2, 6-0.\n\nWith three top 10 seeds - Rafael Nadal, Casper Ruud and Taylor Fritz - already out of the tournament, and world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz injured, Djokovic's route to another title, and a 22nd Grand Slam crown, has become easier.\n\nThat's if his hamstring holds up.\n\nDjokovic aggravated a hamstring injury during his run to a 92nd tour-level title at the Adelaide International earlier in January and his left thigh was again heavily strapped.\n\nAfter racing through the first set, he went off for a medical timeout for treatment at 4-5 in the second set, with his movement hampered.\n\nHe returned to lose the tiebreak before recovering his poise.\n\n\"There was a lot happening tonight and Enzo deserves credit, he played some really great tennis, especially in the second set,\" said the 35-year-old, who is into the third round for a 15th time on his 18th visit to Australia.\n\n\"We both had medical timeouts and struggled a little bit, but I managed to respond in the third set and especially the fourth.\"\n\nIn an early setback for Couacaud, he turned his ankle when stretching for a volley as he was broken to go 3-1 down in the opening set.\n\nThe Frenchman sought treatment but played on.\n\nFourth seed Djokovic exploited the injury, pushing him around the court, and broke again to stroll through the set in 41 minutes with Couacaud managing just three winners.\n\nBut Couacaud refused to give up.\n\nThe next set, dominated by long rallies, went with serve before Djokovic sought treatment at 4-5 after wincing on a backhand.\n\nHe returned with his thigh seemingly re-taped and Couacaud forced the set to a seesawing tiebreak where he prevailed.\n\nDjokovic found a new wind in the third set, banking an early break and never looking back.\n\nWith the injury seemingly forgotten, he raced through the next set after the rowdy fans were kicked out and is now 7-0 for the season after winning in Adelaide.

Before the pandemic, there were 104 molestation cases in 2019 and 143 cases in 2018.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 13, 2025, 06:09am\n\nHSA raids nightclub in Coleman Street as agency turns up heat in anti-vaping drive\n\nMore related stories\n\nA total of 36 cases of rioting, affray, disorderly behaviour and serious hurt were reported in the first nine months of 2022, up from 10 cases in the same period in 2021.\n\nSpeaking at the campaign's launch at Marquee nightclub at Marina Bay Sands on Thursday, Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling said there is a need to remain vigilant as the nightlife industry emerges from the pandemic and restores its vibrancy.\n\nSaid Ms Sun: \"Intoxicated patrons may sometimes put themselves and others in dangerous situations, especially when they find themselves involved in fights, assaults or cases of outrage of modesty.\"\n\nBars, pubs and clubs were allowed to resume nightlife operations in April 2022.\n\nMarquee, one of the glitziest and most popular nightclubs in Singapore, had at least three alleged cases of outrage of modesty between September and December 2022.\n\nThe men, aged between 21 and 45, were said to have inappropriately touched the female victims, aged between 22 and 27, at the nightclub. All three men were charged in court on Thursday.\n\nIn her speech, Ms Sun highlighted a case in Colorado in the United States, where a 22-year-old gunman fired at patrons in a nightclub in November 2022, killing five and injuring 25 others.\n\n\"While Singapore might be safe from gun violence, a patron armed with other offensive weapons can inflict a lot of harm.\" she said.\n\n\"We have seen incidents of suspects with knives or swords in the heartlands. Can you imagine if they were to bring such items into a crowded public entertainment outlet?\"\n\nThis is the third edition of the campaign, after the first two in 2018 and 2019.\n\nSimilar to its earlier editions, this year's \"smart clubbing\" campaign urges clubs and patrons to implement good practices to raise the safety of clubbing spaces.\n\nIt includes checking patrons to ensure they are at least 18 years old and blocking the entry of contraband items or weapons.\n\nNightlife outlets are also encouraged to enhance the training of staff so they are familiar in dealing with drunk or uncooperative patrons who may harm or take advantage of others.\n\nMs Sun said outlets should develop procedures to manage such patrons, such as refusing to serve them more drinks or ensuring their friends look after them.\n\n\"Some clubs even provide a care room or corner for patrons to sober up, so they will not become victims or perpetrators of crime,\" she added.\n\nMarquee had at least three alleged cases of outrage of modesty between September and December 2022. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nThe police have engaged 100 nightlife outlets in the central region of Singapore in the lead-up to this year's campaign and aim to bring on board other nightlife spots islandwide.\n\nThey commended Marquee for using the downtime during the pandemic to enhance security measures, including piloting a walk-through detection system.\n\n\"Guests need not remove items like car keys or mobile phones for security screening and they can walk through the system with their bags,\" said the police.\n\nThe system will trigger an alarm when it detects items shaped like weapons.\n\nThe police said those who commit outrage of modesty or are involved in fights will be dealt with sternly.\n\n\"To enhance police presence at public entertainment-related hotspots, the police will be deploying more surveillance cameras, including the SPF Enhanced Mobicam,\" they added.\n\nThese cameras come with visual and audio broadcasting capabilities to remind patrons to abide by the law.\n\nWong Shiying\n\nNightlife\n\nBARS & CLUBS\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 23, 2025, 01:47am\n\nBlow to LGBTQ scene as two gay bars close doors\n\nMay 31, 2024, 01:30pm\n\nSouth Korean DJ's act in Singapore cancelled\n\nMay 22, 2024, 08:04am\n\nNightclub says S.

You can't see anything because there's snow on both sides... You just follow the road and keep driving,\" he said.\n\n\"So (at) the very last minute, like maybe 150m or something, I saw the stop sign. Then I started applying the brakes, but it was too late to stop.\n\n\"The only thing I could hear was my wife screaming in the car, like one loud scream. And I can still hear it. After that, I blacked out probably for a few minutes.\"\n\nHis smart watch alerted him that he had been in an accident. He got out of the car to help his family.\n\nAs local drivers came to their aid, Mr Karthik's wife, who was bleeding badly, lay on his lap.\n\nHe tried blowing air into her mouth while a passer-by compressed her chest to try to resuscitate her.\n\nAn ambulance that arrived shortly after took Ms Lin and Aahana to the hospital.\n\nThere, doctors tried in vain to revive Ms Lin's heart. Aahana did not suffer any physical injuries but could not recover from the shock of the accident, Mr Karthik said.\n\nMr Karthik Balasubramanian said the sound of his wife crying out just before the crash still haunts him. PHOTO: SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS\n\nThe couple's three-year-old daughter, Aanya, needed stitches on her head, while Mr Karthik suffered a hip fracture.\n\nHe was given the option of surgery or to let it naturally heal while taking painkillers, and he chose the latter.\n\n\"I cannot be bedridden because I have a daughter to take care of,\" he said.\n\nThe father and daughter returned to Singapore on Wednesday night. The funeral of Ms Lin and Aahana is on Friday.\n\nMr Karthik said the trip was going well before the accident. The family visited places such as a zoo in Asahikawa to watch a penguin march.\n\nHe added that he and his wife were confident about travelling with their baby as she was a fuss-free and quiet child.\n\nAlthough this was their first trip to Japan as a family, the couple had travelled there many times, including six visits to Hokkaido - two of which were also in the winter. They preferred driving on their own rather than joining tour groups.\n\nMr Karthik said he fell in love with the country during his first visit in 2016. As a vegetarian, he had reservations initially as he thought that the country would not have many food options for him.\n\nThe rental car Mr Karthik Balasubramanian was driving in Hokkaido. PHOTO: HOKKAIDO BROADCASTING\n\nMr Karthik, who is originally from India, met Ms Lin in 2006 through a mutual friend and they began dating in 2007, before marrying in 2014.\n\nHe said: \"In India, it is not like how it is here (Singapore). Interracial relationships are not really very common in India. (But) my parents were very agreeable to Xiuyue because she was such a nice person.\"\n\nMr Karthik's sister flew to Singapore from India after the accident to support him, and his mother will be here next month.\n\nHe said Ms Lin's family and friends have been supportive, and he is confident that he will not face any issues in raising Aanya.\n\n\"They have been very supportive and encouraging, helping to motivate me to carry on,\" he said.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nHokkaido\n\nDeath\n\nFAMILIES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Both players took turns to lead in another closely contested affair, which did not see either player gain an advantage of more than two points.\n\nThat was until the Loh made it 20-17 when his 37-year-old opponent's attempted interception hit the net.

My husband called management, (who) insisted that they did not know (about the) camera. We were then told that it was not working.\n\n\"How did they know the CCTV was not working if they were not aware there was a CCTV in the first place?\n\nThe stomper added that they had seen a CCTV monitor at the payment counter earlier. But when her husband asked to see the recording, the spa refused.\n\n\"My husband rushed to the counter to see if there was any ongoing recording (and) there was indeed CCTV footage in the room.\"\n\nThe arrow indicates the room the Stomper was in.\n\nThe spa pleaded with the couple not to call the police, assuring that they would delete the footage, but the stomper later filed a report at Larkin Police Station.\n\n\"The manager of the massage parlour was already at the station when we got there. I spoke to an investigation officer and was told that the manager handed over the hard disk with the footage already deleted.\n\n\"I do not know if there was any further investigation on the case.

He was examined by Dr Lin Hanjie, who referred him to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for treatment, at about 10.20pm.\n\nHe was transferred to a padded cell, before being escorted to the IMH at about 3am on July 8, 2017. He was discharged from IMH at about 7pm on the same day.\n\nIn 2020, Mr Mah, who represented himself, sued the Attorney-General representing the Singapore Police Force, and the two officers.\n\nMr Mah proposed that he be awarded $4,620.95, referring to what an individual in Malaysia was awarded in compensation.\n\nThe Attorney-General suggested that if Mr Mah's claims are made out, he was entitled to not more than $15,000 for false imprisonment and not more than $4,000 for assault and battery.\n\nJustice Jeyaretnam said in awarding $20,000, he took into account that Mr Mah was handcuffed and kept in a police cell, rather than taken directly to IMH, which would have been less stressful for him.\n\nThe judge also considered the invasions of his privacy when his bag was searched and his mobile phone accessed.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMan arrested for allegedly hurting 4 CNB officers with knife in drug raid\n\nCourts & Crime: Read more stories\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\npolice\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 12:23am\n\nKallang Wave Mall knife attack: Man to be charged with attempted murder\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:21am\n\nPolice probe 536 over scams, unlicensed moneylending\n\nJul 13, 2025, 02:40am\n\nDriver arrested after fatal crash at Geylang pasar malam\n\nJul 12, 2025, 04:11am\n\nMore NSFs may be deployed to fight scams online, say police\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

This means more people are susceptible to contracting it, said the agency, urging \"urgent collective action\" to stop mosquitoes from breeding.\n\nA total of 279 cases were reported last week and, as at Jan 18, there were 82 active clusters. Of these, 13 were classified as large ones with 10 or more cases. In 2022, 147 cases were recorded in the same week.\n\nNEA said the number of cases recorded in 2023 has remained high, with the figure hovering around 280.\n\nThe virus is spreading relatively quickly in three of the large clusters - in Hougang Avenue 1, Lorong 4 Toa Payoh and Hougang Avenue 6, said the NEA.

Lessons from the end of the world\n\nWith Chernobyl (2019), a series that dramatised the well-known nuclear disaster, The Last Of Us creator Craig Mazin proved that an audience can see everything that is coming yet still be held rapt by masterful storytelling.\n\nAnd it is just as well, because there is nothing terribly original about the premise here: A mutated fungus spreads across the globe, turning infected humans into zombie-adjacent monsters bent on infecting the healthy.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:26am\n\n'I consider Chow Yun Fat more a friend than an idol': Li Nanxing\n\nMore related stories\n\nTwenty years after the outbreak, a smuggler named Joel (The Mandalorian's Pedro Pascal) is tasked with escorting Ellie (Bella Ramsey) - a teenage girl who may hold the key to ending the pandemic - across what is left of America.\n\nThere has been a surfeit of such TV shows in the last decade, from The Walking Dead (2010 to 2022) to The Passage (2019) to Station Eleven (2021 to 2022), all of which share DNA with this latest tale.\n\nBut The Last Of Us eloquently teases out the social and political implications of this single, seismic biological change, and how hearts and minds can unravel, or rally, as a result.\n\n2. Pandemic politics\n\nThe contagion leads to many people living in walled quarantine zones controlled by a repressive military agency that leverages fear of the infected to maintain its grip on power.\n\nOutside, there are other survivors, including an embattled resistance as well as less benign groups.\n\nWhether the writers intended it or not, it is impossible not to view this at least in part through Covid-19-tinted glasses, adding an extra layer of meaning to the narrative.\n\n3. Vignettes of humanity\n\nGame Of Thrones (2011 to 2019) alumni Pascal and Ramsey\n\nanchor the show with a slow-burning buddy chemistry\n\nthat is delightful to watch unfold.\n\nAnd you wish you had more time with supporting players such as survivalists Frank (Murray Bartlett) and Bill (Nick Offerman), whose standout story is the pandemic fairy tale you did not know you needed.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nAlison de Souza\n\ntelevision\n\nST BINGE-WORTHY\n\nSTREAMING - MUSIC/VIDEO/CONTENT\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 1, 2025, 07:13am\n\nChow Yun Fat returns to Star Awards after three decades\n\nMay 16, 2025, 11:55pm\n\n'His criticisms have no effect on me': Quan Yifeng addresses fallout with former friend Addy Lee\n\nApr 23, 2025, 07:08am\n\nNetflix Singapore raises fees for subscription plans again\n\nApr 22, 2025, 12:04am\n\nMark Lee, Dennis Chew, Marcus Chin dress up as 'little nyonyas' in Emerald Hill parody\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The next three-month quota starting in February, which the Land Transport Authority is due to release soon, is also expected to be slightly larger.\n\nThe premium for commercial vehicle COE - used for vans, trucks and lorries - also eased slightly, ending 0.2 per cent lower at $77,109.\n\nThe motorcycle premium finished 1.9 per cent higher at $11,101.\n\nMr Nicholas Wong, general manager of Honda agent Kah Motor, said this round's increases are \"not so bad given that we had the motor show\", adding that the previous tender on Jan 5 saw prices fall by as much as $8,000, \"which was a lot\".\n\nHe said the supply of COEs for the February-April quota period is expected to be bigger, with the mainstay category for cars up to 1,600cc growing by around 10 per cent.\n\nHolding a slightly different view, Nissan agent Tan Chong Motor's head of sales and marketing, Mr Ron Lim, said the price increase in the latest round had reasons other than the Singapore Motorshow.\n\n\"The number of bids for Category A (cars up to 1,600cc) was actually fewer,\" he said. \"And for Category B (cars above 1,600cc), the number was only slightly higher.\"\n\nThe LTA said there were 627 bids for Category A and 514 for Category B - from 649 and 487 previously. iFrameResize();\n\nMr Lim said the traditional rush to register new cars in time for the Chinese New Year this weekend was probably a stronger reason for the rise in car premiums.\n\nHe added that the dip in Open premium was likely because of expectations of more certificates coming on stream from February. \"The market is watching out for the new quota,\" he noted.\n\nMarket watchers said there was no sign of Tesla or private-hire operators submitting aggressive bids this time. The US electric carmaker had recently cut prices, ostensibly in the face of cooling demand.\n\nThe next tender is three weeks away - longer than the usual two-week gap - which usually means more vehicle sales. But because of the Chinese New Year break, with more people going away, the net effect of the longer gap would be negligible, traders said.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nIt’s time to put the brakes on high COE premiums\n\nWhat’s really driving COE prices up and up\n\nChristopher Tan\n\nSenior Transport Correspondent\n\nCars\n\nCOE\n\nLTA\n\nmotorcycles\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025, 05:22am\n\nCar services company admits to posting fake reviews on sgCarMart\n\nJul 1, 2025, 12:26am\n\nMalaysia's VEP enforcement kicks in with 10 Singapore drivers fined in first hour\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:28pm\n\nGround sensors on roadside parking spaces could make payments automatic under new URA pilot project\n\nJun 10, 2025, 11:59pm\n\nIssues reported in 5,400 out of 300k cars with ERP on-board unit installed\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It is expected that the process will conclude no later than Feb 7.\n\nNew Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson, who also serves as finance minister, said in a statement that he would not seek to stand as the next Labour leader.\n\nMs Ardern became the world's youngest female head of government when she was elected prime minister in 2017 at age 37.\n\nShe led New Zealand through the coronavirus pandemic as well as major disasters, including a terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch.\n\nMs Ardern was expected to seek a third term at this year's general election, although she faced an uphill battle as memories fade of her strong leadership during the early stages of the pandemic and voters focus on the soaring cost of living and a darkening economic outlook.\n\nThe central bank is forecasting as recession this year as it hikes interest rates at record pace to regain control of inflation.\n\nMs Ardern will remain a Member of Parliament until April to avoid a by-election. - REUTERS, BLOOMBERG\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nJacinda Ardern: New Zealand's people-person PM\n\nNew Zealand's Jacinda Ardern is a star abroad, but losing her shine at home\n\nNew Zealand\n\nPOLITICIANS\n\nJACINDA ARDERN\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22, 2024, 07:58am\n\nNew Zealand man fined for 'stupid' attempt to 'body slam' orca\n\nJan 16, 2024, 08:39am\n\nNZ MP Golriz Ghahraman resigns over shoplifting allegations\n\nJan 15, 2024, 02:18am\n\nFormer New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern weds long-time partner\n\nJan 5, 2024, 02:50am\n\nNew Zealand fisherman rescued after treading water for 23 hours\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9fd1f24c37b332b3fff2f009c03f460c3447d04f0f8fc249b6462b5b729292b6/KAR3067_16.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ms Jacinda Ardern’s last day as prime minister will be on Feb 7.

Here are some of the questions that you may have about booster shots.\n\nQ: I am not keen on getting another booster shot but I do not want to risk becoming very sick if I become infected. Is it safe to skip it?\n\nA:\n\nThe benefits of getting a booster shot every year\n\nare clear for those who are 80 and above,\n\nas well as those with severely compromised immune systems. These persons are at high risk of developing severe Covid-19 disease. They should go for regular booster shots to protect themselves, said Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, an expert on infectious diseases.\n\nThe benefits of repeated boosters are not that clear for those who are young and healthy, because they have already been vaccinated and are at low risk of developing severe disease in the first place, he noted.\n\nEarlier in the week, Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an expert in emerging infectious diseases at Duke-NUS Medical School, was quoted as saying that people here who have received their first booster shot are well-protected against severe Covid-19, even with new variants.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 15, 2025, 12:05am\n\nSingapore's Covid-19 wave eases as weekly cases and hospitalisation numbers dip\n\n2\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe benefit of getting a fourth shot is minuscule for most people, except the elderly, those with poorly controlled diabetes, transplant patients and other vulnerable groups, he added.\n\nProf Hsu, who is vice-dean of global health at National University of Singapore Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said\n\nthe protection of three mRNA jabs (or four Sinovac ones)\n\nlasts for a few months, after which people can get infected again.\n\nThe protection against severe disease also wanes over time but much more slowly, he added.\n\nHe said the bivalent vaccines do not offer a more significant boost than the original vaccines, partly because the \"new\" variants that they target are no longer the main circulating strains in the world.\n\nQ: What about those in their 40s or 50s who are living with elderly parents in their 70s and 80s? Should they take a bivalent booster?\n\nA:\n\nGenerally, those below 60 are at lower risk of severe disease after the initial vaccination doses and a booster because they are fairly healthy, said Prof Hsu.\n\n\"So at an individual level, they derive little benefit from boosters other than being protected against infection for a short few months,\" he added.\n\n\"However, this protection also means that they are far less likely to transmit Covid-19 to their close contacts, including elderly parents or immunocompromised household members.\"\n\nSo it will still be good to get regular vaccine boosters for that reason, he said.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nElderly urged to get 2nd Covid-19 booster jab to protect against severe illness\n\n3 mRNA jabs enough to keep healthy people well-protected, even for new Covid-19 variants: Expert\n\nQ: Is it possible to get a new side effect from a second booster shot?\n\nA:\n\nCovid-19 vaccines are one of the best studied vaccines in the world, and no new side effects have been reported with additional doses. In fact, the risk of side effects, especially the serious ones, drops with subsequent vaccine doses, said Prof Hsu.\n\nThe side effects are mostly mild, with the common ones being pain at the injection site, fatigue or fever. These typically resolve within a day or two, he noted.\n\nQ: What about the risk of getting a stroke after taking a booster shot?\n\nA:\n\nWhile there was such a concern in the United States with the Pfizer bivalent vaccine initially, the signal disappeared after millions of people were vaccinated.\n\n\"It had most likely occurred by statistical chance, and data from a higher number of vaccinations helped dispel that early signal,\" said Prof Hsu.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has also said that\n\nit has not seen an increased risk of strokes\n\namong those who have received the Pfizer bivalent vaccine.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\naskST: Should I take a third vaccine booster and will it affect my immunity system?\n\nIs a fourth Covid shot necessary?\n\nRelated Stories\n\n‘Kraken’ coronavirus subvariant: Why it is causing concern\n\nAll around the world, Covid-19 surveillance is faltering\n\nWe may be entering Covid-19’s least predictable year yet\n\nWill a China Covid-19 wave set back endemic living in Singapore?\n\nCovid-19 variants in China also detected in Malaysia\n\nHow bad is China’s Covid-19 outbreak?

May I help you?\".\n\nIn 2020, a man and a woman aged 30 and 39 respectively were arrested for stealing milk powder from a supermarket on five occasions, and were charged in court for theft in dwelling with common intention.\n\nIn 2014, another couple was jailed for stealing milk powder to resell for profit.\n\nGabrielle Chan\n\nand\n\nAmanda Lee\n\nFairPrice\n\nBukit Batok\n\nshoplifting\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 7, 2025, 07:49am\n\nFairPrice offers discounts on housebrand products over 12 weeks\n\nJan 14, 2025, 04:02am\n\n151 FairPrice outlets to open on Day 1 of Chinese New Year\n\nJan 3, 2025, 06:34am\n\n$6 return voucher for $60 worth of CDC vouchers spent at FairPrice\n\nDec 5, 2024, 07:14am\n\nFalling beer ad injures elderly woman at Woodlands FairPrice\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

That honour goes to the Kranji Stakes \"A\" contest which is Race 11.\n\nBut that Class 4 sprint over the 1,400m coming up at 4pm is shaping up to be a three-way cracker.\n\nIt was after Tuesday's trackwork that you were pointed in the direction of Melody Fair.\n\nWell, hold that thought. Melody Fair is still right up there but from what unfolded on the training track on Wednesday morning, you might want to add two more to the boil.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThey are Born To Win and Mariana Trench.\n\nBoth worked up a storm and, together with Melody Fair, they loom as a terrific trio, capable of getting racegoers off their seats when the going gets serious.\n\nIn his work, Born To Win was not asked to do more than was necessary and he went on to clock 42.1sec for the 600m.\n\nAs for Mariana Trench, he ran as if in contempt of the clock, returning 37.1sec for the same trip.\n\nAlready a seven-year-old, the Tim Fitzsimmons-trained Born To Win appears to have suddenly found his second wind.\n\nHe closed the 2022 season really well and his scorecard for his last three runs reads 2-2-2.\n\nIn September, he ran second to Istataba, beaten by under a length after being held up for a run in the straight.\n\nA month later, and again over the mile, Born To Win came within a head of levelling it up with Prodigal.\n\nAnd at his last start on Nov 19, he came up against an absolute talent in Street Of Dreams, and we know the rest.\n\nRidden by visiting hoop Jamie Kah, he went down by 3½ lengths.\n\nBut he was not disgraced. If anything, it boosted his stock and garnered him new fans.\n\nThey will be in his corner on Monday when he looks to make it a seventh Kranji win.\n\nHe will need all the support he can get because Mariana Trench is no softie.\n\nStill a youngster with just nine starts under his girth, the four-year-old missed out on making it two from nine when, at his last start, he lost out to Ima and Aftermath in a blanket finish.\n\nThat was over the 1,200m on Jan 7 and, on the day, Mariana Trench had to plot a course from near last to finish in the money.\n\nMariana Trench is better than that.\n\nIt was in July that he began paying for his keep at trainer Michael Clements' yard, beating Street Of Dreams - no less - in a race over the mile.\n\nA handsome chestnut who races in the colours of the Tivic Stable, Mariana Trench could have a grand 2023 season.\n\nBut come Monday, and with the race over the shorter 1,400m, he will have to get his motor running sooner than later.\n\nAnyhow, in the shape he is in, he should make a race of it.\n\nIf there was one who really burnt up the training track on Wednesday, it had to be Class 5 campaigner Cizen Lucky.\n\nWith Benny Woodworth on the reins, the Jerome Tan-trained galloper clocked 34.7sec for the 600m.\n\nYes, he is in that kind of form and it should serve him well when he takes on Class 5 rivals over the 1,200m on grass.\n\nCizen Lucky was a winner under similar conditions three starts back in October and, last time out, he ran third to Den Of Thieves.\n\nA wager on him in the opening event on Monday could get the Year Of The Rabbit off to a Lucky start.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6caced38461b4128663a39c4b3a122f7ff6396524fa3dfc47bb8e2bef59038/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mariana Trench (Vlad Duric) at the winner's circle after his only win on July 31, 2022.", "caption": "Mariana Trench (Vlad Duric) at the winner's circle after his only win on July 31, 2022.

After all, he had a strong hand at the trials on Tuesday morning.\n\nIt kept him busy and he came away with three winners from the four trials contested.\n\nHe took the opener with Sirbring Colt in the Official Race Trial (ORT), followed in the second by Proof Perfect, who also passed a bleeder's test.\n\nFinally, in the last hit-out, Sportscaster led from go to whoa to score with plenty still left in the tank.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nOf the three trial winners, Proof Perfect seemed the standout.\n\nThe eight-year-old, who began his Kranji racing career only in mid-2020 after nine starts for three wins in Australia, took command at the 700m mark and never surrendered the lead.\n\nRidden by apprentice Jerlyn Seow, Proof Perfect held off some late challenges, most notably from Benny Woodworth on Happy Wonderful, to win by a clear ½ length\n\nProof Perfect clocked 1min 00.66sec for the 1,000m.\n\nSure, it was a grinding sort of victory but Proof Perfect had shown plenty of resolve.\n\nIt was also his second trial win in as many starts, having beaten his rivals over the same distance on Dec 27. That day, and over the trial trip, he clocked 1min 00.25sec.\n\nProof Perfect's last win was on June 18, 2022. It was the second leg of a running double.\n\nIt came a month after he had beaten a Class 4 field by two lengths over the 1,200m on the Polytrack.\n\nBoth times, he had Ronnie Stewart doing the steering.\n\nProof Perfect is not going to be a pin-up boy in any horsey magazine.\n\nBut he can still raise a mighty gallop and, if he drops back to Class 4, we could see him notch up his fourth Kranji victory.\n\nAt nine years old, Sportscaster is really getting long in the tooth. But he seems young at heart and still races like a juvenile.\n\nLike we saw at the trials, his rider Ng Choon Kiat jumped him cleanly from an inside alley and, from then, his rivals were left chasing his lengthening shadow.\n\nThree furlongs out and he had his five rivals eating his dust.\n\nTwo hundred metres from home and he was five lengths clear of Manoel Nunes on Jewel Sixty-One and Vlad Duric on the highly rated Mr Black Back.\n\nHaving given his all over 900m of the trip, his rider allowed him a breather over the final 100m.\n\nSo it was, his two nearest rivals closed in. But they were never going to catch him.\n\nSportscaster eventually won by 1 3/4 lengths in 1min 02.03 sec.\n\nUnlike Sportscaster, Sirbring Colt did it the hard way, coming from way off the pace to score a neck win over trainer Stephen Gray's February and the Jerome Tan-trained Tantheman.\n\nSirbring Colt is by top sire Sebring, a classy horse who went on to sire eight individual Australian Group 1 winners.\n\nIf the three-year-old Sirbring Colt is anything like his late dad, he should do well when Crutchley sends him to the races.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/42898f3c8ff202a93c2e60006b0f99c11759dcc770a97584e0024dd40aff0da7/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Proof Perfect (Jerlyn Seow) staving off Happy Wonderful (Benny Woodworth) and Quadcopter (Marc Lerner) in Tuesday's barrier trials.\n", "caption": "Proof Perfect (Jerlyn Seow) staving off Happy Wonderful (Benny Woodworth) and Quadcopter (Marc Lerner) in Tuesday's barrier trials.

They are a young family and her younger daughter is barely half a year old,\" said the 38-year-old civil servant.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 19, 2023, 02:33pm\n\nHokkaido fatal accident: 'The only thing I could hear was my wife screaming'\n\nHe had found out what had happened from his wife, who spoke to Ms Lin's husband, Mr Karthik Balasubramanian, on the day of the accident.\n\nMr Karthik, a 44-year-old engineer, and his older daughter, Aanya Karthik, who is three years old, escaped the crash with minor injuries and were discharged from a hospital in Hokkaido a few days ago.\n\nMr Chan said Mr Karthik was naturally devastated after what had happened and that he and Aanya were due to return to Singapore on Wednesday night.\n\nMr Karthik and Ms Lin, who was a teacher at Nan Chiau Primary School, were married in 2017. They left for Japan a few days after the turn of the new year. The holiday had taken place just before Ms Lin was scheduled to return to work.\n\nThough Hokkaido, the northernmost island in Japan, is a popular ski destination for Singaporeans during the winter months, Mr Chan said it was unlikely the couple would have been planning to go skiing with two young children in tow, and they had probably gone there for sightseeing.\n\nMr Chan said Ms Lin, the eldest of three siblings, was an important pillar in the family who would take lead in handling family members.\n\nHe added that Ms Lin's aged parents were grief-stricken following the deaths of their daughter and granddaughter, but they are coping better now.\n\nFamily and friends paying their respects at the wake of Ms Lin Xiuyue and her daughter Aahana on Jan 18, 2023.

The quality in the SPL has gone up in the last few years and we hope to add to that quality this season.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, DPMM announced their four foreign players for the 2023 SPL season on their website.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 22, 2023, 12:40pm\n\nBalestier Khalsa's Daniel Goh all out to become full-fledged Lion\n\nMore related stories\n\nHeading the list is 2019 SPL top scorer and former Belarus international Andrei Varankou, who plundered 21 goals in 22 games for the title winners. Former Spanish youth international Angel Martinez, Uzbekistani goalkeeper Akmal Tursunbaev and Croat midfielder Josip Balic are the other three foreigners in the squad.\n\nDPMM will host home matches at the Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium in Bandar Seri Begawan, said Ali, which will give SPL teams the full away experience for the first time in three years.\n\nThe team's return will boost the quality of the league as they will come up against defending champions Albirex Niigata, 2021 champions Lion City Sailors, Hougang United and Tampines Rovers in the battle for the championship.\n\nHougang head coach Firdaus Kassim said: \"Although the composition of the DPMM squad is unknown, over their past seasons in the SPL, they have traditionally competed for top spots.\n\n\"I am expecting the same in the upcoming season from them. Especially after they won the league in their last participation so I am very sure they are keen to (win) the league title.\"\n\nTampines Rovers head coach Gavin Lee also welcomed DPMM's return and previously told ST: \"The travel over there is always a nice change for local teams, and most importantly DPMM are always a good side, and have good quality.\"\n\nThe FAS has yet to officially announce DPMM's return and details of the 2023 season have not been revealed. Last Thursday, the SPL's official Facebook page uploaded a poster of the logos of all nine clubs for the 2023 season, including DPMM, only to take down the photo later.\n\nA provisional date of Feb 19 has been set for the Singapore Community Shield, the traditional curtain-raiser to the football season here, with the SPL to kick off on the 26th.\n\nDPMM first joined Singapore's domestic competition, known then as the S-League, in 2009. But, midway through that season, the team were expelled by Fifa for government interference in the affairs of the Brunei Football Association. However, they managed to win the League Cup before the suspension.\n\nThey returned to the S-League in 2012 after the ban was lifted and competed till 2020 as the club went on to win three more League Cups in 2012, 2014 and 2016.\n\nIn March 2020, DPMM started their SPL title defence with a 2-0 win over Tampines - a result that was eventually voided as the club could not return to complete the season.\n\nST has contacted the FAS for comment on DPMM's return and details on the 2023 SPL season.\n\nBy\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nRead articles by Deepanraj Ganesan\n\nspl\n\nBrunei DPMM FC\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 13, 2023, 02:33pm\n\nNSF disciplined after training with Sailors while on MC\n\nJan 27, 2023, 01:50pm\n\nS'pore Premier League to use VAR for 2023 season\n\nNov 28, 2022, 03:36pm\n\nStars, key backroom staff depart Lion City Sailors following owner Sea Ltd's financial woes\n\nNov 3, 2022, 02:28pm\n\nThree Sailors fined $500 each for failing to perform post-match handshake\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The man was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic, said a police spokesman.\n\nWhile investigations are ongoing, the police do not suspect foul play. Details of the man are not known.\n\nShin Min Daily News earlier reported that a cleaner smelled a stench from the man who was lying on a mattress, went to check and realised that he was dead. The cleaner informed his employer.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 02:50am\n\n77-year-old petrol station worker dies after being hit by reversing car at Geylang Esso\n\nMore related stories\n\nA couple told The Straits Times that they saw the man sleeping at the void deck of the block almost every night for the past two weeks before he was found dead.\n\nAnother resident, who wanted to be known as Madam Rosmah, said she had seen the man a few times in the estate.\n\nThe 61-year-old added: \"I felt quite sad to hear about his death and how he was there for a few days before people realised he was dead. We all just assumed he was sleeping and did not want to bother him.\"\n\nMr Seah, who is a Marine Parade GRC MP, said there is a very small number of rough sleepers in his constituency. They often have their own homes but opt to sleep on the streets for various reasons, such as family disputes.\n\nThey include a woman who chooses to sleep rough in Serangoon as it is nearer to her workplace, even though she has a home.\n\nMr Seah said his grassroots leaders will try to engage these people and offer help if needed. They also work with social service offices and other government agencies to follow up on these cases.\n\nMr Abraham Yeo, co-founder of Homeless Hearts of Singapore, whose volunteers render help, said many of those who are homeless are at higher risk of heart and other medical problems, given their poverty, poor health and nutrition.\n\nA few years ago, the group started to partner Mount Alvernia Hospital, which provides free medical and dental care to the homeless people referred to it.\n\nMr Yeo said some of the homeless folk \"don't want to go to a hospital (when they are ill) as they see it as a place to die. Others may be worried they cannot afford the hospital bills\".\n\n\"So we have to assure them and take them to medical care,\" he added, noting that befriending those who are homeless is vital.\n\nThe man found dead in Serangoon was the second instance of a senior whose death was detected only after neighbours or the public smelled a stench since 2023 started and which the media reported on.\n\nOn Jan 8, the police were alerted and found a 69-year-old woman lying motionless in her one-room rental flat in Aljunied. She is believed to have lived alone.\n\nSocial service agencies which work with seniors said cases of the elderly dying alone are uncommon. This is because they have set up a range of services and programmes to support and monitor vulnerable seniors, especially those who live alone.\n\nSuch services include getting befrienders, who are volunteers, and staff to check on these seniors regularly to ensure, for example, that they are well and taking their medicine.\n\nFor example, Care Corner Singapore keeps a watch-list of frail seniors with no family or little social support. Staff will monitor these seniors or get neighbours to keep an eye on them, said Ms Sharon Tang, manager of Care Corner Senior Services.\n\nNTUC Health principal social worker Jess Ho said its teams working with the seniors will visit the vulnerable ones, such as those who are frail and have no or little family support, as often as once a week.\n\n\"They make assessments of the psycho-social care needs of seniors and devise strategies to support their physical and mental well-being and increase their coping strategies,\" she added.\n\nIn 2022, NTUC Health had two seniors who died at home and their neighbours reported the death.\n\nThe Lions Befrienders comes across fewer than three such cases a year for seniors under its care.\n\nIn 2021, it started its I-ok@LB system, where a senior presses a button on a tablet at a scheduled time every day to signal that he or she is well.\n\nIf the person does not do so after a specified duration and does not respond to calls, the charity will alert next of kin, a neighbour, or send a staff member to check.\n\nSocial workers said the elderly who were found dead often repeatedly declined help or contact by staff from social service agencies.\n\nTouch Active Ageing assistant director Wong Li Peng noted that reaching out to some seniors can be challenging as they refuse help, but it will continue trying to engage them. These seniors could also be suffering from dementia or have other health or mental health problems.\n\n\"Our staff at our active ageing centres also work alongside befrienders, volunteers, neighbours and shopkeepers, who can be our eyes and ears on the ground as they help flag cases to us,\" she said.\n\nIf you encounter a rough sleeper who requires support or shelter, you can e-mail MSF_PEERSOffice@msf.gov.sg or call the ComCare hotline on 1800-222-0000.\n\nTheresa Tan\n\nand\n\nSyarafana Shafeeq\n\nDeath\n\nSerangoon\n\nhdb\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:25am\n\nDriver who killed motorcyclist in crash had view obstructed by sunshade\n\nJul 4, 2025, 03:08am\n\n69-year-old woman found dead in Changi flat after days of foul smell\n\nJun 9, 2025, 08:05am\n\nCollision involving lorry claims life of 27-year-old e-bike rider\n\nJun 2, 2025, 02:34am\n\nPrivate-hire driver who worked 15-hour shifts 'for my kids' dies of stroke\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The accused remained visibly agitated and continued to threaten to hurt herself if the police officers did not back off.\"\n\nDuring the confrontation, Juliana also held the knife to her neck and left wrist multiple times.\n\nA Taser round was then discharged in an attempt to subdue the offender, but it missed her.\n\nOfficers later subdued Juliana and arrested her. They searched her belongings and found a knife, as well as a penknife blade, in her possession.\n\nInvestigations revealed that she had bought the knife about three days earlier, and that she had initially intended to use it to replace a blunt knife at home.\n\nBut on Sept 19, 2022, Juliana carried the new knife with her in public instead of leaving it at home.\n\nAs for the penknife blade, she claimed that she used it for cutting straws for the purpose of drug consumption.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9b9643021033319e149867e5bbfaca7ebf7ed22d074d56a1c0a5f734e2c241b0/ads-knifecp-210922_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Juliana Abdul Kadir pleaded guilty to being in possession of a knife and a penknife blade outside St Hilda's Secondary School in September 2022. \n", "caption": "Juliana Abdul Kadir pleaded guilty to being in possession of a knife and a penknife blade outside St Hilda's Secondary School in September 2022.

But even when police officers told her she was being scammed, she refused to believe them until it was too late.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner (DAC) Aileen Yap from the police's Anti-Scam Command talked about this case during a panel discussion during the Scaminar! ACT Against Scams event at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre on Wednesday.\n\nThe session was moderated by Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 06:24am\n\nMan charged for collecting $150k in cash, jewellery for scammers\n\nMore related stories\n\nSaid DAC Yap: \"She believed when (her lover) recovered, he would come to Singapore and take care of the three children with her.\"\n\nDAC Yap said they were two, nine and 12 years old.\n\nOver three months, police officers tried to convince the woman, an accountant, that she was a victim of a love scam.\n\nThey immediately recognised the photographs the woman's lover had sent, which he claimed were taken at a hospital, were heavily photoshopped.\n\nDAC Yap said: \"My officers spoke to her many times but she just did not believe us.\"\n\nThe woman finally accepted the truth after she noticed the e-mails the hospital was sending her had originated from the same e-mail address her lover used.\n\nAlthough police officers were unable to prevent the initial transfer of more than $200,000, they recovered $170,000 of the losses by freezing the bank accounts to which the woman sent the funds.\n\nDAC Yap said: \"She faced more than financial losses. Her husband said they were unable to reverse their relationship. The three children suffered and she borrowed from her friends and relatives. They might not get the money back.\n\n\"The impact the scam caused is really very devastating. We need to act against scams, to come together to add, check and tell.\"\n\nDAC Yap said the public can add security features to their devices, check for warning signs and tell the authorities and people around them about scams.\n\nOther panellists included Ms Loretta Yuen, head of group legal and compliance at OCBC Bank; Mr Dan Yock Hau, assistant chief executive of the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore; and Ms Grace Ann, chief executive of social enterprise Friendzone.\n\nMs Yuen said: \"We have seen all education types (of scam victims). From illiterate folks to PhD holders. From students, hawkers, and cleaners to office workers. Even university professors and company chief executives. No one is spared.\n\n\"Scammers prey on hopes, dreams and fears. You want a better financial future, you want to find love and happiness, so we have love scams. Nobody wants to be in trouble with the law, so we have government impersonation scams.\"\n\nDuring the panel, the speakers also discussed the importance of remaining vigilant, with Ms Sun reminding the public not to fall for job scams, the most common variant in 2021.\n\nShe said: \"Anytime you come across such an offer, always check, not only the signs of a scam, but also your own emotions.\"\n\nShe said whenever people receive a phone call or message asking for their personal information or to send money, they can always check with the organisation involved, whether it is a bank, government agency or delivery company.\n\nMs Sun said: \"You can also tell your family and friends about the latest scams so as to protect them. In the fight against scams, everyone can play a part.\"\n\nBy\n\nJessie Lim\n\nRead articles by Jessie Lim\n\nSCAMS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:21am\n\nPolice probe 536 over scams, unlicensed moneylending\n\nJul 12, 2025, 04:11am\n\nMore NSFs may be deployed to fight scams online, say police\n\nJul 10, 2025, 07:48am\n\nMan charged over $80,000 money mule activities\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/521b2061035f6e98a0be54d320198e51f1624cf905b52a00a403b895e9da5006/btscam20230118_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Over three months, police officers tried to convince the woman that she was a victim of a love scam. \n", "caption": "Over three months, police officers tried to convince the woman that she was a victim of a love scam.

I feel sad and scared. Is it wrong to be Indian? I didn't choose to be Indian... I wish this didn't happen.\"\n\nWong, 32, is claiming trial to one count each of assault and wounding Madam Nita's racial feelings. The Singaporean is accused of committing the offences near Northvale condominium in Choa Chu Kang on May 7, 2021.\n\nShortly before the trial started, Madam Nita burst into tears as she stood in the courtroom.\n\nShe then stepped out to compose herself before returning to testify from behind an opaque screen set up in the courtroom. The reasons for this were not disclosed.\n\nOn the first day of Wong's trial, Madam Nita testified that at the time of the alleged assault, she worked at a fast food restaurant at Choa Chu Kang Stadium in the morning, and as a private English tutor in the evening.\n\nShe told Judge Shaiffudin that she was brisk-walking to the stadium with her mask down on May 7, 2021 when she heard somebody shouting from behind.\n\nShe said that she turned around and saw Wong and a female companion. She added that she did not know the pair before the alleged assault, and they told her to \"mask up\".\n\nMadam Nita added that she knew that it was mandatory to don a mask outdoors at the time due to the Covid-19 pandemic and that exceptions were made for those who were exercising. She had pulled her mask down as she needed to breathe.\n\nShe testified that she had told the couple that she was brisk-walking.\n\nWong then stepped towards her and used racially charged vulgar words to insult her, she told the court.\n\nShe added: \"I don't like to fight, so I said, 'God bless you'... Before I could think, he went towards me and kicked my chest. I was unprepared. It was very fast. I fell on my back... I cried out in fear.\n\n\"Before I could react, he ran back towards the lady, and they jogged (away), casual, like nothing happened.\"\n\nMadam Nita said another woman who had witnessed the incident came forward and helped her to her feet.\n\nShe said the woman helped her to apply a plaster to a wound on her left forearm.\n\nMadam Nita said she made a police report after her tuition classes that evening.\n\nShe told the court that she still felt scared about a month after the incident.\n\n\"Every single time when I walked (in the area), I felt scared as I thought (my assailant) would hit me... I wish I didn't have to go there,\" she added.\n\nShe eventually took another route to the restaurant.\n\nWhile questioning Madam Nita, defence lawyer Sim Bing Wen said that according to his client, she had told Wong to mind his own business and spat at him. Madam Nita denied this.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMan charged over racially aggravated attack against S'porean woman in Choa Chu Kang\n\nRacial abuse at East Coast Park: Charges abated for alleged offender following his death\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nassault\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e915d9eed8071befc621cf1304fa6403d97ee18aa478fcdb11ee1dddafa402b2/hindocha-nita-vishnubhai-racial-slur-kick-injuries-1-.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mrs Hindocha Nita Vishnubhai was brisk walking on her usual route from Choa Chu Kang MRT station to Choa Chu Kang Stadium when she was allegedly assaulted by Wong Xing Fong on May 7, 2021.

The Heist, a Singapore-Malaysia co-production.\n\nPHOTO: GOLDEN VILLAGE\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 18, 2023, 07:53am\n\nMark Lee's CNY double bill: What! The Heist and The King Of Musang King\n\nShare this article\n\nIn the new local\n\ncaper comedy What! The Heist\n\n, a lottery company is targeted by a group of con artists looking to fix the draw. It is payback for the profits lotteries raked in over the years, say the crooks by way of justification.\n\nSingaporeans and Malaysians have a love-hate relationship with the lottery, especially around Chinese New Year, when the ticket-buying lines swell.\n\nOpening in Singapore cinemas on Thursday, the movie offers a measure of wish fulfilment because the bad guys make it so they are guaranteed to win, says Malaysian actor Jack Lim, 47.\n\n\"The lottery represents hope. It's a human desire. But when you don't get the big prizes, you hate the company,\" he adds.\n\nLim, his castmate Singaporean actor-comedian Mark Lee and Malaysian director Matt Lai were speaking to The Straits Times at a press event at the Park Regis Singapore on Tuesday.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"The lotteries might raise funds for charity, but that doesn't matter when your ticket doesn't win,\" says Lim.\n\nWhat! The Heist can be called a Singapore-Malaysia co-production, say the two leads Lim and Lee. According to Lee, 54, the two of them had been talking about creating a project together for over a decade. But the timing was never right until last year, when schedules aligned and filming started, around the Kuala Lumpur area.\n\nBut viewers will not be able to pinpoint exactly where events in the film are happening, as the team took great pains to obscure the locations - special non-specific car licence plates were used and the usual Malaysia movie landmarks, such as the Petronas Towers, are avoided. Instead, they opted to shoot in lesser-known areas.\n\nSays Lim: \"We want the audience to feel this is not the usual kind of movie. From the music to post-production, we wanted to make it feel different.\"\n\nThe story opens by showing the criminal Choy Gor (Lim) released from prison after taking the fall for his leader Big Boss (Henry Thia). Lee plays Chao Yan Fatt, who happens to be a version of Chow Yun Fat in real life.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nChao, whose name is a joking reference to the Hong Kong superstar with the similar-sounding name, is a money-strapped actor who ventures into crime to pay medical bills.\n\nThe gang hatches a plan to tamper with the lottery's draw equipment. They pool their skills in acting, computers and sleight of hand to achieve the impossible.\n\nWhat! The Heist has an ironic sense of humour. Chao is an actor with a Golden Horse Awards nomination, like Lee in real life. One character speaks disparagingly of intrusive product placement in films and, a few minutes later, there is a scene with product placement in it.\n\nWhat! The Heist can be called a Singapore-Malaysia co-production, say the two leads Jack Lim and Mark Lee.  PHOTO: GOLDEN VILLAGE\n\nLee says: \"As long as it's done the right way, and as long as the sponsor placement is funny, it's okay.\"\n\nCoincidentally, Lee has two movies out this Chinese New Year, the other being the comedy-drama The King Of Musang King, directed by and starring Jack Neo, which opens on Saturday.\n\nLike Heist, Musang King was filmed in Malaysia. It tells the story of Mei Lian (Yeo Yann Yann), a struggling durian farmer and single mother who turns to neighbouring farmer Mao Shan (Neo) for help. Lee plays her estranged husband Jin Shui.\n\nJack Neo (left) and Mark Lee in The King Of Musang King. PHOTO: MM2 ENTERTAINMENT\n\nLee says it just so happened that last year, he worked on both projects that would open this Chinese New Year. His characters are vastly different, however - he is a brash businessman in Musang King and a soft-spoken crook in Heist. Tonally, the films are also different, he adds.\n\n\"If you like family pictures, you can go to Musang King. If you want more comedy, see Heist,\" he says.\n\nWhat! The Heist opens in cinemas on Thursday, while The King Of Musang King opens on Saturday.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nJack Neo announces new CNY movie The King Of Musang King\n\nJack Neo defends product placements in his movies as it is hard to make money\n\nJohn Lui\n\nFilm Correspondent\n\nMovies\n\nactors\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d5e158ceca9d1d01f319ef547ce05c58213805161e32eb4c5842a7fbedd67e64/whattheheist.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mark Lee in comedy caper What!

At about 10.30am, all of the building's occupants were evacuated after SCDF officers arrived, he said.\n\nThe staff member added that no one had indicated feeling unwell when asked by SCDF officers.\n\nAfter the checks by SCDF and police officers were made, the occupants were allowed to re-enter the centre at about 12.20pm.\n\nService at Crossings Cafe, located on the building's first floor, was allowed to proceed as normal.\n\nResponding to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore confirmed that it had made a police report on the incident.\n\n\"We understand that the police and the SCDF are investigating the report made at the Catholic Centre in Waterloo Street this morning,\" said the spokesman, who added that the archdiocese is \"unable to make a statement at this time\".\n\nWhen ST arrived at the centre at 12.25pm, only one SCDF vehicle remained on site. Markings were seen on the walls of two sides of the building. Dark stains were also seen in the building's foyer.\n\nPolice said on Tuesday that at about 11.40am that day, a case of \"white substance found at a location along Armenian Street\" was reported.\n\nThe SCDF was called in to investigate, it took a sample of the substance and the tests did not detect harmful substances.\n\nBoth incidents are under investigation.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nDozens of Mexico students mysteriously poisoned\n\nNg Keng Gene\n\nand\n\nMichelle Chin\n\nSCDF\n\npolice\n\nSingapore\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 12, 2025, 02:49am\n\nCar tips onto side after crash near Joo Koon; 2 taken to hospital\n\nJun 29, 2025, 08:34am\n\nMotorcyclist taken to hospital unconscious after Tuas Checkpoint accident\n\nJun 26, 2025, 02:17am\n\nMan dies after CTE accident involving 2 lorries, driver arrested\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:06am\n\n'I didn't know it was so bad': Neighbours rally to help after fire broke out in Holland Close\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nHome & Decor Singapore\n\n5 Living Room Wellness Hacks You’ll Wish You Knew Sooner!\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/225b679d0edd2982e7302a1568b45cf1213010ad7bae84d7803fc035b51286bd/crossingscafe.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Stains spotted on the floor outside the Catholic Centre at Waterloo Street on Jan 18, 2023.

He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:39pm\n\nAnxious Harvard-bound Singaporeans press ahead with plans, even as some still do not have visas\n\nMore related stories\n\nMr Elluswamy said Tesla's Autopilot team set out to engineer and record a \"demonstration of the system's capabilities\" at the request of Mr Musk.\n\nMr Elluswamy, Mr Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has warned drivers that they must keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of their vehicles while using Autopilot.\n\nThe Tesla technology is designed to assist with steering, braking, speed and lane changes but its features \"do not make the vehicle autonomous\", the company says on its website.\n\nTo create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla's then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.\n\nDrivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla's parking lot, he said.\n\n\"The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,\" Mr Elluswamy said, according to a transcript of his testimony.\n\nWhen Tesla released the video, Mr Musk tweeted, \"Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.\"\n\nTesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nTesla accused of false autopilot, full self-driving advertising\n\nMany US drivers treat partially automated cars as self-driving: Study\n\nThe US Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla's claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.\n\nWhen asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Mr Elluswamy said: \"It does not.\"\n\nMr Elluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang.\n\nMr Andrew McDevitt, the lawyer who represents Mr Huang's wife and who questioned Mr Elluswamy's in July, said it was \"obviously misleading to feature that video without any disclaimer or asterisk\".\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board concluded in 2020 that Mr Huang's fatal crash was likely caused by his distraction and the limitations of Autopilot. It said Tesla's \"ineffective monitoring of driver engagement\" had contributed to the crash.\n\nMr Elluswamy said drivers could \"fool the system\", making a Tesla system believe that they were paying attention based on feedback from the steering wheel when they were not. But he said he saw no safety issue with Autopilot if drivers were paying attention. - REUTERS\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nLong, bumpy road for self-drive cars\n\nTesla offers discounts in S’pore on cars in inventory\n\nunited states\n\nTESLA\n\nElon Musk\n\nADVERTISING AND MARKETING\n\nACCIDENTS - TRAFFIC\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 30, 2025, 07:03am\n\nSingaporeans travelling to US advised to check latest entry requirements and comply: MFA\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nS'poreans looking to pursue studies in US can still submit visa applications: US Embassy\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:02am\n\nConfused, nervous, told to 'wait for updates': Singapore students at Harvard react to US ban\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/db79ea18683edebd34f620ccc9977108c51ae807f5757a95556140fab4b981de/2022-06-21T161646Z778603220RC2FWU9WMYDJRTRMADP3TESLA-AUTOPILOT-INVESTIGATION_2.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "The video was promoted on Twitter by chief executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself”.", "caption": "The video was promoted on Twitter by chief executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself”.

The best defence against scams is becoming an aware, watchful and discerning public, who will protect ourselves and also act to protect others from scams.\"\n\nShe was speaking at the second edition of the anti-scam seminar held in a hybrid format at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre and virtually via live stream.\n\nTitled Scaminar!

This is not true - the statistics tell us that everyone is vulnerable to scams.\"\n\nShe also warned that scams can have dire consequences on victims and their loved ones, impacting them beyond just financial losses.\n\nST previously reported about how there have been instances here where scam victims have turned to suicide and self-harm.\n\nMs Sun urged the public to take heed of such stories.\n\n\"The scam cases reported in the media are not just another story,\" she said.\n\n\"The victims involved are someone else's family member, a loved one, a friend, a relative.

He was also given a lifetime driving ban.\n\nHe was under a driving ban in Nov 17, 2017, when he was stopped by the officer in Bedok Reservoir Road for not wearing a seat belt.\n\nWhile the officer was standing next to the driver's door, Lee suddenly reversed the car and then accelerated forward.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nAdditional jail term for driver of Maserati that dragged police officer\n\nCompany CEO who assaulted cop in Sentosa Cove gets 10 weeks’ jail\n\nThe officer's uniform got caught in the door and he was dragged by the moving vehicle for 124m before falling onto the road.\n\nWhile he was on bail pending his appeal against his conviction and sentence, Lee repeatedly drove a BMW rented by one of his friends.\n\nHe was handed more charges for traffic offences. In one incident on March 12, 2021, he drove through a police roadblock, drove dangerously by speeding at 140kmh and beat two red lights.\n\nIn January 2022, he was sentenced to a further jail term of one year, nine months and 16 weeks.\n\nThe 15 charges also included offences for corruption and remote gambling. Another 54 charges were taken into consideration.\n\nThe second sentence was ordered to start after Lee completes serving his first sentence.\n\nThe time for Lee to file an appeal has elapsed, but he filed a motion in a bid to lower his overall sentence, arguing that the sentences for some of his charges should run concurrently instead of consecutively.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutors Timotheus Koh argued that the second sentence involved offences that were distinct from the 2017 case that comprised the first sentence.\n\nHe added that Lee had committed similar offences while on bail, and that Lee's dangerous driving was similar to his conduct that resulted in the first sentence.\n\nJustice Abdullah said he saw no reason to disturb the sentences imposed, which he said were \"not high at all\".\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMan admits to assaulting 2 cops in 'one of the worst attacks on police officers to date'\n\nCourts & Crime: Read more stories\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nTRAFFIC OFFENCES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with StarHub all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a510c76f52cd205fa8e1808b82bbffa09a3a51d79b613bcd0d313b16238b7dce/lee_cheng_yan_4.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Lee Cheng Yan, 38, who faced a total of 79 charges, was sentenced in two sets of proceedings.

He is in good form and can give trainer Leslie Khoo his third winner in 2023 on Monday.\n\nST FILE PHOTO\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 17, 2023, 02:03pm\n\nKhoo's Melody Fair is right on song\n\nThe five-year-old can help Singaporean trainer keep up his momentum for 2023\n\nShare this article\n\nIt is always good to see trainer Leslie Khoo saddle winners.\n\nAnd, so far, he has been enjoying a grand start to the new year of racing.\n\nUnlike the previous season, when it took him quite a while to land his first winner, 2023 has been great for the top local jockey who, in the 1970s and 1980s, was a household name in the racing game.\n\nTo date, and after just two days of racing, Khoo sits pretty with two winners - Super Generous on the season's opener on Jan 7 and Wild Bee last Saturday.\n\nKhoo has entered a lean team of just three horses for the Chinese New Year meeting on Jan 23 and he could add another win to the year's tally with Melody Fair.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nA trim and taut five-year-old, Melody Fair worked like he meant business at Kranji on Tuesday morning, when covering 600m on the Polytrack in 38.4sec.\n\nRidden by bang-in-form jockey Wong Chin Chuen, who pulled off a treble to add to the two he had on Day 1, Melody Fair gave Super Generous a two-length headstart over the short and sharp sprint.\n\nAt the finish, he had eaten into that lead and finished just half-a-length behind.\n\nSuper Generous is down to contest Monday's Class 5 sprint over 1,200m.\n\nHowever, on the morning, it was all about Melody Fair.\n\nThe two-time winner has been running into a rich vein of form and it could spell another success for the youngster, who began his career only in March.\n\nMelody Fair's last two runs produced a second (2,000m) and a third (1,600m).\n\nHe goes over the 1,400m on Monday. It might seem a tad short for the son of Duelled but Melody Fair can sprint and stay.\n\nEarly in his career, he ran second and fourth over 1,200m and 1,400m respectively, and it is a winnable Class 4 race that Khoo has picked for his up-and-coming galloper.\n\nThe same could be said for Super Generous.\n\nClass 5 is the five-year-old mare's \"comfort zone\" and the 1,200m on turf will be right up her alley.\n\nOn the season's opening day, she stuck to the leader, Per Incrown, before issuing a challenge over the final furlong.\n\nGathering speed, she rolled to the front to win by a neck.\n\nOn the strength of her current form, she could make it two-from-two in 2023.\n\nAnother who caught the eye on Tuesday morning was Beyond Sacred.\n\nFrom the stables of Jerome Tan, he ran out the 600m trip in 38.7. Benny Woodworth was the pilot.\n\nA last-start winner from 15 outings, that victory came on Nov 26, the last day of the 2022 season.\n\nIn a tough Open Maiden sprint, which featured some rising talents like last-start winner Great Command, Beyond Sacred held a midfield spot until the final 200m.\n\nHe then unleashed a big run which carried him to victory over Great Command and Ahorsewithnoname.\n\nGreat Command, trained by Ricardo Le Grange, won last Saturday and gave new rookie Rozlan Nazam his first career winner.\n\nOwned by the Raffles Racing Stable, Beyond Sacred is still a work in progress.\n\nTwice before, he had to play bridesmaid. One of those defeats, on Oct 2, was at the hands of a real talent in Street Of Dreams, who made it four off the reel last Saturday.\n\nBeyond Sacred goes over the mile in a Class 5 event on Monday. It could be what he wants.\n\nWatch out also for Mercury Storm. He had Louis-Philippe Beuzelin doing the steering when he ran the 600m in 36.9. He was paced by Ricvelo.\n\nEven as an eight-year-old, the former Lim's Pride still has zest for racing.\n\nWe saw that at his last start when he ran third to Super Generous, after having to overcome problems along the way.\n\nIt was on Feb 2, 2022, that Mercury Storm, who was then trained by Daniel Meagher and racing as Lim's Pride, won a 1,200m race under Danny Beasley.\n\nMonday will be his third start under Mahadi Taib.\n\nDo not be too hasty in ruling him out. He is getting on in years but he still brings his best to the races.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of StarHub with 3Gbps Broadband deal\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d5363579565e1e477c7261e148a643f3e5d57de46a91041ec302bce41a42706d/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Melody Fair (No. 2, Benny Woodworth) scoring the first of his two victories on June 11, 2022.

The strong booking of the in-form Karis Teetan warrants consideration, especially from an ideal draw in Class 5.\n\n3 Concerto also steps down in grade. He is better than his record suggests. He also has the ideal booking of Silvestre de Sousa and is worth supporting at a price.\n\n2 Blustitch makes the dip to Class 5. His trials have been sound and it would not surprise to see improvement against this lot.\n\n9 Fortune Master did not finish far behind the winners in four starts this term. He was fourth at his penultimate start. One for value hunters.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nRace 2 (1,650M)\n\n9 Jolly Honour is a two-time Class 3 winner racing in Class 5. If he can reproduce his best - which his latest effort seemed to show glimpses of - then he is more than capable of winning. The booking of Hugh Bowman is a bonus.\n\n1 Flash Famous, who scored his sixth success two starts back, is holding his condition. He just needs to offset the tricky draw.\n\n4 Medic Elite is racing well and is capable of turning his last-start failure around.\n\n5 Our Creed regularly catches the eye of top riders in Hong Kong. He is drawn well and must have decent each-way claims.\n\nRace 3 (2,200M)\n\n7 Winning Steps had much more to offer last start than what he was able to produce. He still managed to finish a solid sixth. From an inside draw, with de Sousa up, more is expected of the four-year-old.\n\n6 Vincy is consistent and drawn ideally. He can take up a nice position here.\n\n10 Management Folks broke through impressively last time. The wide draw is a concern but Zac Purton's booking is not.\n\n9 Sunny Baby is another last-start winner who is capable of backing up with the big drop in weight for going up a class.\n\nRace 4 (1,200M)\n\n8 King Of The Court has the ability and he returns following a setback in 2022. He has since trialled well and looks well placed to return a winner, as long as he can overcome the awkward draw.\n\n6 Island Surprise is in form and will perform once more. De Sousa hops up and he must be kept safe.\n\n4 Faribault is chasing back-to-back wins. Gate 1 will afford him every opportunity.\n\n11 Flying On The Turf steps up in grade but pairs up again with Purton. Expect a bold run.\n\nRace 5 (1,200M)\n\n3 Flaming Passion closed off well last start. He might get a race to suit, especially with Teetan sticking aboard. The in-form Mauritian rider knows the horse well.\n\n12 Noir Rider can lead. He might be worth taking a chance on at a price, especially as he knows how to lead and win at Happy Valley.\n\n1 Sugar Sugar is classy and suited in this grade and at this course. Expect vast improvement from him returning to Happy Valley.\n\n2 Rattan Kingdom is after a hat-trick. He can figure again.\n\nRace 6 (1,650M)\n\n2 Villa Fionn was interfered with late last start but he still managed to close off for a competitive fourth. Expect him to be ridden for luck at the rear once more, but his closing speed - especially in Class 4 - is strong enough to win.\n\n8 Young Life Forever roared home last start. He took a liking to the course and distance and bears watching again.\n\n11 Theta Hedge is ticking along. He won well two runs back and has proven competitive in this grade.\n\n3 Viva Popcorn notched his fourth victory last start. Remaining in Class 4, he can make his presence felt despite picking up 6lb (2.72kg).\n\nRace 7 (1,650M)\n\n12 Samarkand is better than his form suggests. With the use of 10lb-claiming apprentice Angus Chung, chances are they are planning on rolling forward. He could take a bit of reeling in, as he did his best racing in Australia from the front.\n\n3 Zone D has the ideal draw and is racing well. Purton hops up once more and the pair are favoured from Gate 2.\n\n6 Happy Daily missed narrowly last time. He is in sound condition.\n\n11 Master Tornado can improve over this trip. An each-way chance.\n\nRace 8 (1,000M)\n\n2 California Deeply is a super impressive prospect. He appears well placed to notch a hat-trick, especially after a sound trial effort at Sha Tin. Jockey Luke Ferraris, who rode him to his last-start victory, will still be aboard. The horse won second-up with Matthew Chadwick astride.\n\n4 Gorgeous Vitality should improve second-up from the break. Purton sticks aboard which adds confidence regarding his chances.\n\n3 Harmony N Blessed would have preferred an inside draw but, nevertheless, should prove competitive. His latest trial was eye-catching. Good each-way proposition.\n\n5 Pretty Queen Prawn has a few more points to climb. Next best and likely to show decent odds.\n\n*Comments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with StarHub all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/50fc0112f628219bfe374059a8096547004a93723ab7656f0592247fe24a4ce0/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jockey Luke Ferraris is partnering last-start winner California Deeply again in the last race at Happy Valley.

He found one too good and the drop to a sprint on the Poly could see him home. (2) FIRE TONIC ran well below form over 1,400m last time and drops in trip. He makes his Poly debut. (7) GRANDE LUPO caught the eye when starting at long odds last time. He could be coming to hand and also makes his Poly debut. (5) VIVIR MI VIDA comes from a very much in-form yard. She takes on the males but made a promising Poly debut and this trip should suit.\n\nRace 2 (1,400m)\n\n(8) STEALTH ATTACK has been knocking on the door since being switched to the Poly. Her last run was possibly a furlong too far. She can make amends. (3) SKY CAFE has gone well on the Poly and this trip should suit. (6) FRENCH PRINCESS has finally secured a nice draw. She was given far too much to do last start and can make big improvement. (4) ISIPHETHO has improved with each outing. She makes her Poly debut and can feature.\n\nRace 3 (1,400m)\n\n(3) LADY MCBETH was beaten narrowly on the Poly as the favourite last time. The three-time winner has shown signs of coming back to hand. (4) LUNA ECLIPSE got a four-point rise in the handicap after her last win. Her best form has been on this surface and she should make another bold bid. (2) CRAZY BLUES was not far back when taking on much stronger rivals last time. The mare has a big weight but the drop in class could suit. (9) PRINCESS JO won well second-up. She looks to have some scope.\n\nRace 4 (1,400m)\n\n(8) COUNT MARSH is over his best course and distance. Although drawn a touch wide, he should be right there. (2) GENTLEMAN'S WAY is back on his preferred surface and goes well over this trip. (1) MAC HARDY is lightly raced but has shown up well in all three Poly starts. The extra 200m suits. (3) HEAD GARDENER is battling for his second win but his best recent showing has been over this course and distance.\n\nRace 5 (1,400m)\n\n(7) BLACKWHITEDYNAMITE has been close-up in his last two starts on the Poly. He has a useful claiming apprentice up and can go one better. (2) PREEMPTIVE STRIKE has shown his best recent form on the Poly. He went down narrowly last run and the 1.5kg allowance will be a big plus. (1) SON OF SILK nearly upset at long odds over this course and distance last time. All three of his local runs have been on the Poly. (3) ROY'S JULY MAGIC has come to hand. He was a recent maiden winner but is lightly raced and can make further improvement.\n\nRace 6 (1,600m)\n\n(3) QUIZ MASTER has been in good form on the Poly. He steps up in trip and has a strong chance. (4) BLUE EYES steps up to a mile but has improved in sprints with a tongue tie. He should stay the trip. (5) MISS LIALAH takes on the males but has not been far off in her recent outings. With a handy weight, she is not out of it. (6) EXCEED EXPECTATION has taken on stronger rivals and found market support last run.

(7) MAJESTIC POWER is way better than his last effort. He was beaten narrowly by Teichman in his penultimate start and is 2.5kg better off at the weights. (8) FINAL DESTINY steps up in trip and has a light weight.

Is my voice clear?\" Chou then asked the crowd - to which the crowd responded with loud cheers.\n\n\"I'm singing so many more songs, isn't it just for my friends in Malaysia?\", said the singer in reply.\n\nSubtle shade\n\nSome fans in Singapore think Chou's comments in KL implied that his Singapore fans were not appreciative of his performance.\n\nSome have even complained of being shortchanged, while drawing comparison between his Singapore and Malaysia shows.\n\nInstagram user @hp4yong took to Chou's official Instagram to gripe: \"I only get to listen to two hours and 10 minutes of the concert (in Singapore) but if you attend the concert in Malaysia, you get to listen to three hours of performance.

Veeranesh Babu and Mr Mohamad Isa Mohamad Basir.\n\nDuring the proceeding, the prosecution asked for bail to be set at RM70,000 for each of the accused, with the additional condition that they report to the MACC office here once a month until the case is over.\n\nMr Veeranesh, who represented Law, asked for lower bail of RM40,000 and said the accused worked as a mobile phone repairman and had to take care of his 66-year-old mother.\n\nMr Mohamad Isa, who represented Sia, informed the court that the accused was a student at a college in Kuala Lumpur and his expenses were borne by his parents, who are in Singapore. The Bernama news agency said Sia is a Singaporean.\n\nHe also requested bail of RM40,000, adding that his client had to take care of his girlfriend and three-month-old child.\n\nThe court then set bail at RM40,000 with one surety for each of the accused, as well as the additional condition.\n\nIt also set Feb 19 for next mention.

letters admonishing the person.\n\nIn a post on Facebook group Complaint Singapore on Monday (Jan 16), the upset resident showed photos of the notes pasted onto the sofa that was obstructing access to the walkway and lift.\n\nThere were several notes - written in English and Chinese.\n\nThe Facebook post has since been removed.\n\nIn the English note, which was written in cursive, the resident

how their actions caused a potential fire hazard while reducing accessibility for \"physically challenged\" residents.\n\nThere were also other notes written in Chinese, though it's unclear if they were written by the same resident.\n\nIn the Chinese variation, that writer took a more poetic approach.\n\n\"In society, there are people of high and low status, but there's no lowliness or nobility

She also said Cai had returned to Thailand to try to prove his innocence of any crimes linked to the scheme.\n\nAccording to the Department of Special Investigation, the scheme involved the use of the website\n\nwww.forex-3D.com\n\nas a channel to lure investment in foreign exchange by offering returns of 60 to 80 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, another Singaporean, Ong Jian Zhen, who is suspected of hacking multiple accounts on social media platforms in Singapore, was arrested at a condominium in the Huai Kwang district in Bangkok on Jan 12.\n\nAccording to the Bangkok Post, he was arrested for using a fake passport to enter Thailand on Oct 26, 2022.

Loh's family also paid more than $14,000 to repair his unit.\n\nOn Jan 28, 2022, Loh had poured kerosene in his living and bedroom room and used newspapers to scrub the floors. He was alone in the unit then.\n\nWhile cleaning up, Loh consumed alcohol and felt depressed and lonely, DPP Ee said.\n\nSince April 2020, Loh was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He was assessed to have depression due to the condition and started taking anti-depressants.\n\nDPP Ee said when Loh was last seen at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) outpatient clinic in November 2021, he was noted to have a persistent low mood.\n\nIn an IMH medical report issued by Dr Ang Ren Xuan, the doctor expressed the view that there was a contributory link between Loh's mental illness and the alleged offence, but added that he was not of unsound mind.\n\nDPP EE said that at 10.15pm on the day of the fire, Loh sent a message to his family WhatsApp chat saying: \"Boys, I've always loved you but things had to end this way. Goodbye.\"\n\nAt 10.29pm, Loh, who was resting in his bedroom, lit a cigarette.\n\nWhile smoking the cigarette, Loh felt tired and dropped it onto the floor which had kerosene.\n\nDPP Ee said that within minutes, the unit caught fire.\n\nBetween 10.29pm and 10.47pm, SCDF and the police received more than 30 calls to the police that a fire had broken out in the Tampines flat.\n\nDPP Ee said: \"When SCDF arrived at the unit, the main door to the unit was locked and SCDF had to break open the main door to enter the unit.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Loh, who was unrepresented, told District Judge Eugene Teo: \"I just want to plead for leniency. That's all.\"\n\nHe was accompanied by his sister, who declined to speak with The Straits Times.\n\nDistrict Judge Eugene Teo called for a report to assess Loh's suitability for a mandatory treatment order. He also told Loh to attend any and all appointments required by IMH.\n\nAddressing Loh, the judge said: \"I want you during your sessions to be forthcoming with them about what you are going through about your anxieties and what you are concerned about.\n\n\"You have never been in prison before that is why we are trying to keep you out. That is why we are asking you to go for this assessment, so cooperate during this period.\"\n\nHe added that Loh has some \"reconciling to do with your family members\".\n\nThe case has been adjourned to Feb 14 for sentencing.\n\nHelplines\n\nMental well-being\n\n•  Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222 (24 hours)\n\n•  Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444 (24 hours) /1-767 (24 hours)\n\n•  Singapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-283-7019\n\n•  Silver Ribbon Singapore: 6386-1928\n\n•  Tinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788\n\n•  Community Health Assessment Team 6493-6500/1\n\nCounselling\n\n•  TOUCHline (Counselling): 1800-377-2252\n\n•  TOUCH Care Line (for seniors, caregivers): 6804-6555\n\n•  Care Corner Counselling Centre: 1800-353-5800\n\nOnline resources\n\n•\n\nmindline.sg\n\n•\n\nstayprepared.sg/mymentalhealth\n\n•\n\neC2.sg\n\n•\n\nwww.tinklefriend.sg\n\n•\n\nwww.chat.mentalhealth.sg\n\nJessie Lim\n\nFIRES\n\nTampines\n\nSCDF\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:06am\n\n'I didn't know it was so bad': Neighbours rally to help after fire broke out in Holland Close\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:01am\n\nFire breaks out in empty bunk at Pulau Tekong's Basic Military Training Centre, no injuries\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:22am\n\n4 people, including 2 firefighters, taken to hospital after fire in Holland Close flat\n\nJun 7, 2025, 03:35am\n\n20 people evacuated after fire at Home Team Career Centre\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c25e8aac0da3d16bff32a5190048c0e2f5a464d1418a8af59e951acdfab29400/tampinesfire_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Loh Fu Wah dropped a lit cigarette onto his bedroom floor, which he had earlier scrubbed with kerosene.", "caption": "Loh Fu Wah dropped a lit cigarette onto his bedroom floor, which he had earlier scrubbed with kerosene.

It didn't work out as I hoped and I'm really hungry to show myself, to help the team.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Of course, I want to score goals here. I'm a striker and I think every striker knows it - you are living for scoring goals.\"\n\nWeghorst was at Old Trafford on Saturday as he watched United come from behind to\n\nbeat rivals Manchester City 2-1.\n\nErik ten Hag's men have now won nine matches in a row in all competitions as they prepare to head to Selhurst Park to face Palace.\n\nThey are fourth in the Premier League standings, level on 38 points with Newcastle United, who have played a game more. City are second on 39 points, eight behind leaders Arsenal.\n\nIt is too early to say if United are in the title race, or if they can finish in the top four, but Weghorst has high hopes.\n\n\"We are on a really good track now,\" he added.\n\n\"The last couple of weeks, months actually, it's going really positive here and I just want to contribute and give my best for the club. I'll try to be a part of the successful way we are going.\"\n\nA win on Wednesday could lift United to second, while ten Hag will also have Sunday's big clash with Arsenal on his mind.\n\nInfluential Brazilian midfielder Casemiro and compatriot Fred are both on four yellow cards, so it remains to be seen if the former will be rested for the Palace game so as not to risk a suspension for Sunday.\n\nAnthony Martial, who has been struggling with injuries all season, remains a doubt.\n\nDonny van de Beek, Diogo Dalot and Jadon Sancho are all out because of injuries or fitness issues.\n\nDespite the absentees, United are the favourites to clinch all three points against 12th-placed Palace.\n\nThe Eagles have lost four of their last five Premier League matches, failing to score in all of them except a 2-0 win over Bournemouth.\n\n\"It is about scoring, we should score more goals, that is a fact,\" said Palace boss Patrick Vieira.\n\n\"We have quality players who can do that.

A formal extradition request from the US was submitted on Nov 22.\n\nOn Dec 21, she was produced before District Judge Chee Min Ping. Evidence was given by the state, represented by the Attorney-General's Chambers, in support of its request for Fadaak to be committed to prison, pending the Law Minister's order for her surrender to the US.\n\nJudge Chee ordered her to await the Law Minister's warrant. Under the Extradition Act, she can apply for a review of the order and will not be surrendered until after 15 days have passed from the date of the judge's order, unless she waives her right to a review.\n\nThe evidence included an autopsy report on the victim Darwin Garcia Franco, mobile phone records including deleted call logs, and photographs of Fadaak and Saif Al Obaidi - who allegedly stabbed her husband - taken on her birthday while Mr Garcia Franco was out of town.\n\nIn a written judgment published on Tuesday, Judge Chee found that sufficient evidence has been presented to show a strong case that Fadaak had committed the alleged offences, justifying her extradition.\n\nShe is wanted in the US on two charges - one for first degree murder and the other for conspiracy to commit first degree murder against her husband.\n\nFadaak left the US on a one-way flight to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with her child three months after the killing in May 2019. Details of how she ended up in Singapore were not mentioned in the judgment.\n\nAt the time of the alleged murder, she lived with her husband and their son on the upper floor of a split-level apartment in Kirkland, Washington. The lower floor was occupied by Ms Nelida Zuniga and three children.\n\nAccording to an affidavit by the lead investigator of the Kirkland Police Department, Fadaak and her alleged accomplice Al Obaidi had a romantic relationship and met from time to time in her personal apartment in Bellevue, Washington.\n\nInvestigations showed that on May 17, 2019, Mr Garcia Franco confronted Fadaak about his belief that she was unfaithful.\n\nOn May 22, 2019, she began looking for life insurance coverage for her husband.\n\nShe was informed by an insurance salesman that the policy premium could be reduced if her husband first obtained a physical examination, but she insisted that she needed insurance immediately.\n\nOn May 28, 2019, Fadaak submitted a policy request with a US$250,000 (S$330,000) life benefit, listing her and her child as beneficiaries.\n\nThe next day, she was told that her husband could not be insured as he did not have citizenship.\n\nOn May 31, 2019, Al Obaidi entered the residence and attacked Mr Garcia Franco while he was asleep, stabbing him about 30 times. Investigations showed no signs of forced entry.\n\nMs Zuniga tried to intervene but was stabbed multiple times too.\n\nAfter chasing Mr Garcia Franco down the hallway, Al Obaidi continued his attack on Ms Zuniga. She ultimately survived, sustaining about 18 stab wounds.\n\nMs Zuniga later told investigators that Fadaak stood by and quietly watched Al Obaidi attack Mr Garcia Franco.\n\nShe said Al Obaidi did not attempt to harm Fadaak, and the latter did not scream or try to stop the attack on her husband.\n\nHowever, in a seemingly frantic phone call to the police at about 2.10am on the same day, Fadaak claimed that somebody came to her residence and an altercation ensued.\n\nThe dispatcher asked if Fadaak recognised the person. She claimed to have seen only her husband covered in blood and did not mention Al Obaidi.\n\nPolice officers who arrived at the scene found a knife under Mr Garcia Franco's bed.\n\nIn interviews with the police, Fadaak continued to omit mention that Al Obaidi was at the apartment.\n\nShe showed investigators her mobile call records but it was later ascertained that certain records of calls with Al Obaidi on May 30, 2019 had been deleted.\n\nIt was also established that several calls to the insurance companies made by Fadaak on May 30, 2019 were placed from her Bellevue apartment, while Al Obaidi was with her.\n\nInvestigators discovered calls from his phone to Fadaak at 2.14am and 2.29 am on May 31, 2019.\n\nArrested on the same day, he was charged with the murder of Mr Garcia Franco in the first degree and attempted first degree murder, and is being held in pre-trial confinement with no bail.\n\nFadaak flew to the UAE on Sept 4, 2019 and a warrant was issued for her arrest.\n\nOn Sept 25, 2022, following a request by the US, a team of police officers arrested her at the Parkroyal hotel in Beach Road. The US and Saudi Arabia embassies were informed.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nMURDER/MANSLAUGHTER\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nGet the right WiFi routers for the best connection with StarHub\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f7ddc459438ff3e2a5567e7273abc9e6d5525a13fcf7c46916f948953c2c21b7/yaohui-pixcourts-3224_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A district judge found that sufficient evidence has been presented to show a strong case that the woman had committed the alleged offences.", "caption": "A district judge found that sufficient evidence has been presented to show a strong case that the woman had committed the alleged offences.

My parents were charged $57.60 for 1kg.

As there have been cases of consumers being given items that weigh less than what was paid for, this has alerted me to weigh the bak kwa.\n\n\"True enough, it was short by almost 500g. In other words, my parents were charged double for the amount given to them,\" said the Stomper.\n\nThe wrapped bak kwa on a weighing scale showed that the weight was 576.6g.PHOTO: STOMP\n\nIn response to a Stomp query, Bee Cheng Hiang said: \"We are already in contact with the customer to clear up this misunderstanding. Thank you for reaching out to Bee Cheng Hiang.\"\n\nBee Cheng Hiang did not elaborate on what the misunderstanding was.\n\nOn the company's website, the sliced pork bak kwa is listed as $33 for 500g, $39.60 for 600g and $66 for 1kg.\n\nThe customer told Stomp: \"I have given my feedback to Bee Cheng Hiang. They told me it was a misunderstanding. I told them it is very straightforward. My parents paid for 1kg, but they only received slightly over 500g. Hence, I do not know what the misunderstanding is about.\"\n\n\"Bee Cheng Hiang agreed to issue us back a packet of 1kg bak kwa. I shall update you again after we have received the bak kwa.\"\n\n\"I added that if I had not discovered this case, does that mean their business process would continue as it is?

About 100 million litres of illicit beers - or about a third of total consumption - are sold every year, it says.\n\nThe loss in revenue to the government is estimated at RM1.5 billion (S$459 million).\n\nMalaysian Anti-cheap Liquor Movement chief coordinator P. David Marshel said a 375ml bottle of cheap, legal, compounded liquor costs less than RM10 a bottle.\n\nIt is made with 40 per cent alcohol, mixed with water, caramel, sugar and flavouring. A regular bottle of beer, with under 5 per cent alcohol, costs about RM18.\n\n\"The pandemic and economic recession have led to more people relieving stress through alcohol consumption.\n\n\"Imported liquor is more expensive due to the currency exchange, so the demand for cheap liquor is growing,\" said Mr Marshel.\n\n\"Many consumers, especially those in the lower income group, are unaware of the health hazards posed by the high alcohol content of cheap liquor. They don't just end up being drunk, but also suffer from alcohol poisoning,\" he said.\n\nMr Marshel urged the government to review regulations on the sale of cheap liquor, which are sold at sundry shops.\n\n\"They should only be sold at dedicated stores. A floor price must be set to ensure that such liquor is not easily affordable,\" he said.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nToxic alcohol kills 37 in 'dry' Indian state Bihar\n\nTobacco, alcohol are main causes of cancer worldwide: Study\n\nMr Marshel said his group was not against the selling of liquor.\n\n\"We want cheap liquor to be tightly controlled because of the social ills they bring,\" he stressed.\n\nThere are about 5,700 shops in the country licensed to sell liquor, with about 30 local companies producing cheap liquor. - THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nmalaysia\n\nalcohol\n\nAlcohol abuse\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6d9cd5dc6cbbc379d497780b2e71f71bb3890ed306cde0082a3cca5b8004c286/alcohol_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "With the cost of living rising, many in Malaysia are turning to cheap, illicit liquor to feed their drinking habit.

He then turned it around again to show the other passengers, chatting and laughing.\n\nSeconds later, the phone lost focus but a deafening crash and screaming could be heard. Then, it kept recording.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 9, 2024, 10:43pm\n\nBody of retired teacher Harry Tan brought home\n\nMore related stories\n\nThere were flames and the sound of an engine screeching. When it refocused, it was already on the ground pointing at a tree before it seemed to have been yanked out of focus again. Then, there was the sound of heavy breathing before the video ended.\n\nAnother video, taken from the ground, showed the plane levelled with the ground as it approached the airport before it suddenly took a hard swerve to the left.\n\nThe plane, which took off from the Nepali capital of Kathmandu just 30 minutes before it crashed, had 68 passengers and four crewmen on board.\n\nNone is believed to have survived in what is now Nepal's worst air disaster in nearly 30 years.\n\nMr Jaiswal was with three of his friends, all from Ghazipur in India, who had gone to a grand shrine on the outskirts of Kathmandu dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva before they flew to Pokhara, a picturesque tourist town, to paraglide.\n\nThe BBC reported that his friends and kin had told reporters they watched the video on his Facebook account, and confirmed its authenticity.\n\nMr Abhishek Pratap Shah, a former lawmaker in Nepal, told Indian news channel NDTV that rescuers recovered Mr Jaiswal's phone from the plane's wreckage.\n\n\"It (the video clip) was sent by one of my friends, who received it from a police officer. It is a real record,\" Mr Shah told NDTV.\n\nMr Jaiswal's father, Mr Rajendra Prasad Jaiswal, told the BBC he could not bear to watch the clip himself.\n\n\"I have only heard about it from Sonu's friends. Our lives have come crashing down,\" he said.\n\nThe Nepali government announced on Monday that rescuers had found the plane's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.\n\nThe data on the recorders may help investigators determine what caused the Yeti Airlines ATR 72 aircraft to go down in clear weather.\n\nBoth recorders were in good shape, Mr Teknath Sitaula, a Kathmandu airport official, told Reuters.\n\nMinutes before the aircraft was to land, the pilot asked for a change of runway, Mr Anup Joshi, a spokesperson for Pokhara airport, said on Monday.\n\n\"The permission was granted. We don't ask (why). Whenever a pilot asks, we give permission to change approach,\" he said.\n\nTwo more bodies were recovered on Monday, taking the death toll to 70.\n\nOne of the pilots, Ms Anju Khatiwada, was married to another pilot who died in a 2006 plane crash.\n\nnepal\n\nAIR CRASHES\n\nIndia\n\nsocial media\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 4, 2024, 07:40am\n\nBody of retired S'pore teacher found near Mount Everest\n\nSep 28, 2024, 01:13pm\n\nSingaporean man missing in Mount Everest region\n\nJan 10, 2024, 08:17am\n\nNepal police arrest 'Buddha Boy' over followers' disappearances, rape allegations\n\nJul 27, 2023, 10:53am\n\nNorwegian woman, Nepali sherpa become world's fastest to climb all 14 tallest peaks\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9cc58d812b226e72a6bff9933429b090fd27df61212976616013b567105d5ef0/2023-01-16T131526Z469775853RC2NRY9OMBGIRTRMADP3NEPAL-CRASH.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Mourners and protesters gather for a memorial and rally for the victims of Nepal's worst air disaster in nearly 30 years.", "caption": "Mourners and protesters gather for a memorial and rally for the victims of Nepal's worst air disaster in nearly 30 years.

He's a horse we had always earmarked for the 3YO races, anyway, but he just wasnt't going in that direction.\"\n\nLuckily, the stable was able to identify the root cause of the problem and adjusted accordingly.\n\n\"He was just over-anxious at all of his three runs,\" said Clements.\n\n\"He was always charging through and wanted to get it over and done with. There wasn't much left in the tank in the end.\n\n\"It was highlighted even more so at his last start when he was trapped wide. He did too much early, and the winkers didn't help.\n\n\"He's only a young horse and we gave him a break. The idea behind was for him to mature mentally.\n\n\"After the break, we put an emphasis on him settling and not hanging like the way he did, and teach him to come from behind.\n\n\"Nunes let him settle and conserve his energy and do his best at the end. The plan has worked out.\"\n\nAt times, trials and races are like chalk and cheese, but not this time.\n\n\"He benefited from those teachings on Saturday. Jerlyn (Seow) went up in front (on Red Maned), and we sat behind,\" said Clements.\n\n\"It was a fast-run 1,000m, and he ran on really well in the end.\"\n\nSome water will still flow under the bridge until the first leg of the 3YO series - the Group 3 Singapore Three-Year-Old Sprint (1,200m) on April 8 - but Clements is keen to strike the iron when it is hot.\n\n\"I have entered him for the Novice race over 1,200m on Chinese New Year (Jan 23), but we'll discuss with the owners first,\" he said.\n\nPetrograd is among a quartet of three-year-olds bought by the Gandharvi Stable of Indian medical entrepreneur Kuldeep Singh Rajput.\n\nCoin Toss is the only other winner, while Mewar was unplaced at his only start and Leg Day is unraced.\n\nRajput has only just hit the ground running around the world. But, as the upwardly mobile owner builds up his racing empire, Clements is confident his outfit will be a force at Kranji soon.\n\n\"The owner has new young stock coming through, and in New Zealand and US as well,\" said Clements.\n\n\"Muraahib was the first horse they sent me, but he was getting on. He's been retired to Kuala Lumpur as a leisure horse.\n\n\"Coin Toss was their first Singapore winner. He could be a three-year-old runner, too.\"\n\nThree-time winner Ejaz, last-start winner Mykyta and Shihab are worthy bullets to a trainer with a proven 3YO track record with the likes of Countofmontecristo, Top Knight and Tiger Roar.\n\nOne candidate, who got off to a flying start but has since fizzled out, is Pacific Star.\n\nClements, however, cautioned that the son of Boulder City can redeem himself at weight-for-age.\n\n\"The form around Pacific Star was strong at his first prep. We put him away and we expect to see some improvement at this second prep,\" he said.\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of StarHub with 3Gbps Broadband deal\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/791169302cf2c76929f6a78a0b29b1d1f882d9f69e9dff8d646c20187679f2e3/unnamed_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Petrograd (Manoel Nunes) drawing away to a pulsating win in the Open Maiden race over 1,000m on Saturday.

Strongly supported, the four-year-old Australian-bred gelding paid $10 for a win.\n\nST PHOTO: SHAHRIYA YAHAYA\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 16, 2023, 02:56pm\n\nReluctant jockey rides first winner\n\nRozlan just wanted a job to do with horses, but he is now hungry for more victories\n\nShare this article\n\nRozlan Nazam could not possibly expect a routine evening trip to his neighbourhood coffee shop in Yishun in 2004 would change his life.\n\nThe animal lover and then Secondary 3 student's curiosity was piqued by the horse racing chatter among a few uncles tucking into their zi char.\n\nOne of them suddenly saw the scrawny 15-year-old and blurted out excitedly: \"Young man, you're so small. Why don't you become a jockey?\"\n\nLike most Singaporean teenagers, Rozlan thought jockeys spun turntables or parked cars at expensive hotels.\n\nAfter heeding a complete stranger-cum-career adviser's wild suggestion, he discovered it was instead a job with horses - and a new calling.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nOn Saturday - 19 years later - apprentice jockey Rozlan rode his first winner, Great Command, at Kranji.\n\nA few days on, he is still pinching himself.\n\nIn truth, he had never quite believed in himself until late. Hence, the unusually long time he took to become a jockey.\n\n\"I'm very excited and happy. I've been smiling since Saturday,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm still nervous and can't believe I won my first race. I didn't think I could become a jockey to begin with, as I'm very light at 45kg and don't have as much strength.\n\n\"It can also be a disadvantage as I carry a lot of dead weight, like sometimes my saddle weighs up to 9kg.\"\n\nRozlan's constant fear that he was punching above his weight is probably why he is now a mature-aged apprentice at 33, albeit his boyish appearance makes him look 10 years younger.\n\n\"In 2005, I joined Bruce Marsh as track rider under the STAR (Singapore Training Academy for Racing) programme. At the time, I was not really keen on a career as a jockey,\" explained Rozlan, the middle of a brood of three brothers from a non-racing family.\n\n\"I was more interested to work with animals. To me, it wasn't just about riding horses, I wanted to be part of the industry.\n\n\"Besides, there were quite a number of apprentices in front of me, H.K. (Han Kok) Cheng, Aidil Feiruz and C.S. (Chee Seng) Chin.\n\n\"That's probably why I started off very slow. I rode only three to four horses every morning, I was just learning how to ride.\n\n\"But one day, just before he returned to New Zealand, Bruce asked me: 'Are you ready to become a jockey now?'.\n\n\"I thought: why not up my game. I applied for a C grade apprentice licence, and it's taken me three years to get my first ride.\"\n\nRozlan, who also held a stable supervisor licence, continued to learn the ropes under Jason Ong, who took over the stables after Marsh left in September 2019.\n\nHe had his first race-ride aboard Fight To Victory for Ong on July 9, 2022. The horse ran unplaced.\n\nMore unplaced finishes followed. But gone was the meek and mild Rozlan who did not mind blending into the background.\n\n\"Jason has given me good guidance and advice, and I'm forever grateful to him, and Bruce as well,\" he said.\n\n\"But I wanted to see how far I could go and give myself the best opportunities. When Krisna (Thangamani) became a senior rider, I approached Ricardo to see if he needed a new apprentice.\n\n\"He's very stern and strict, but he's got years of experience and is a very good master. He teaches me a lot, and I've learned a lot since I joined him on Dec 6.\"\n\nWhile Rozlan had to wait until his 32nd career ride to finally break his duck on Saturday, it came at only his ninth under the new tutelage.\n\nThe merit was even greater, given Great Command was an even-money favourite.\n\nHe had to stalk and chase down a tenacious Lim's Betterready (A'Isisuhairi Kasim) in a one-off position throughout.\n\n\"Around the 600m, from where I was, I still had plenty of gas. I just decided to go for it, and luckily, he didn't stop,\" said Rozlan.\n\nA noted tough taskmaster, Le Grange was delighted his new protege has lived up to his usual high expectations.\n\n\"I'm old school, this is how I was brought up. When an apprentice walks into the yard, he will have to work hard. But, on the other side, he will get rides and winners from me,\" said the South African.\n\n\"Rozlan's been with us only a month, but he's a hell of a nice guy, and he's kind to horses.\n\n\"He will need more opportunities to kick him off. We have to keep his confidence up, and the owners are also happy to support him.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a8753dcedd9791983a540ea05d4cb8b251d20566b6b4c98e859b9e58593315a5/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Ricardo Le Grange-trained Great Command giving apprentice jockey Rozlan Nazam his first career winner on Saturday.

He has been gelded but again has to face another Tarry-trained debutant, (5) AMERICAN GRAFFITI, on 2.5kg difference. The comment on American Graffiti is quite positive. (6) GODSPEED was only 0.40 lengths behind Xplicit Content and is also 2.5kg better off. The filly is expected to relish the longer trip. Follow the betting moves on all the first-timers. They are bred for speed.\n\nRace 2 (1,000m)\n\nThe well-bred What A Winter filly (7) WOMEN OF FAME and (4) ICE STAR both need to be closely monitored. (2) DIVINE MOONLIGHT made a fair debut, finishing third in an 800m contest. She should much appreciate the longer trip and can go close. (3) DUELLONA and (6) WHITE HILLS (speedy) have a bit of work to do to turn the form around with Divine Moonlight. But they are open to any amount of improvement. White Hills had things go wrong and could be a lot better than her first run suggests.\n\nRace 3 (1,600m)\n\n(1) ORARARI GOLD has yet to win over 1,600m but those were races at very high level. She did not disgrace herself. Best weighted, she is expected to go close. (2) TIPSY TARRAGON impressed earlier in her career and was entered in two strong Western Cape features. She lost form but could be looking for a change and now races on the Highveld for a new yard. Watch out. (3) TULIP TREE has very good form and may be better than rated. She had a bit much to do last time and can improve. (5) QUE CEU AZUL will be looking to go all the way over her best trip.\n\nRace 4 (1,500m)\n\n(1) QUIXOTE found one too good in his last two outings, after trying different tactics in both. He can go one better but has drawn widest and will need a bit of luck. (2) SILVANO'S SONG could take advantage. He has been making steady progress and, from a better gate, could get his head in front. (7) MO THE MAN rates the dark horse. After a fair debut, he had things go wrong thereafter and finished last. Interestingly, top jockeys Gavin Lerena and Keagan de Melo switch rides in relation to Quixote and Mo The Man. (9) POWERS THAT BE, (3) RAPTOR ISLAND and (4) TO THE KING have shown some potential and could earn.\n\nRace 5 (1,500m)\n\n(2) CHERINGOMA, who ran a fair race after a rest, may have needed time to mature. The mare could be coming back to her best form but still needs to produce a winning run from a wide stall. (4) OCTOBER FAIR won her maiden well enough to suggest she has more to come. The slightly longer distance could be ideal. (3) LIGHT OF DAY found her last race over 2,000m too far. She has draw No. 1 and could get away if given the chance. (8) TOTO'S DREAM is back home after a fair run on the Polytrack in KwaZulu-Natal. (7) JUST BE NICE is also fairly consistent and would be deserving.\n\nRace 6 (1,800m)\n\n(7) ELEMBEE won second-up easily last trip, despite the going being sticky. The daughter of Pomodoro could be above average. (2) LADY REGENT battled the wet ground last time. She is better than that run and should be in the fight. (1) LITTLEMARYSUNSHINE has shown class. The drop in ratings and class could get her confidence boosted. (3) TINDER DRY and (5) CALL THE WIND have run decent races and just need a bit of luck.\n\nRace 7 (1,200m)\n\n(6) PERMESSO AVANTI impressed the handicapper last time as her merit rating has gone up a couple points. She is back to form and, from draw No. 2, could get the timing right. (3) EYJAFJALLAJOKULL showed something like his best form when reverting to this sprint distance and should build on that effort. (7) STORM DICTATOR brings fair Western Cape form into the race. He could be better than rated. (4) WIND WATER won in good style and could be on the up. (1) IPSO FACTO, (2) THYMETOSHINE and (8) SMITH AND WESSON all have some sort of claim.\n\nRace 8 (1,450m)\n\n(1) WAQAAS could step up on form as he should enjoy the drop in class. He has also drawn well and has a 2.5kg apprentice claim. (3) ROBERT BURNS is a lot better than his last race when finishing fatigued. Interestingly, he was drawn pole position when he won over this course and distance in his penultimate start. (4) PINCH HIT and (6) RATTLE BAG have been in the vanguard recently and deserve a turn. (2) FOG BANK may have found his second start a bit short and could bounce back to his best.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9ca8551ed865e47a825b6334cf14ab48e71d62ca3266eedf8f83d44dd54c12a6/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He had a one-year spell in charge of Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) in 2013, leading the club to third in the league.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 25, 2025, 02:29am\n\nFandi takes Pahang to Malaysia Cup final again\n\nMore related stories\n\nSilverware has eluded five-time league champions Pahang since their 2018 Malaysia FA Cup triumph.\n\nThe last time they won the league was in 2004, with JDT winning the league in the last nine seasons.\n\nPahang's new Brazilian forward Lucas Silva is looking forward to the season under Fandi.\n\nHe told Malaysian daily The Star: \"Fandi is a good coach. He was a very good striker before and we are learning a lot from him.\n\n\"There are also a lot of Pahang legends in the team, like Dollah Salleh, Jalaluddin Jaafar and Ahmad Shaharuddin Rosdi.\n\n\"So you are constantly learning and being inspired. My target is to make Pahang an indomitable force that they used to be.\"\n\nFandi's coaching journey in Singapore ended on June 30, 2022 when\n\nhe left the Football Association of Singapore (FAS)\n\nafter a seven-year stint. His last appointment was its head of elite youth.\n\nHe could not be reached on Monday, but had told The Straits Times earlier that he still has \"more to give as a coach\".\n\nAs a player, he enjoyed much success in Malaysia. He led Kuala Lumpur to a hat-trick of Malaysia Cup titles from 1987 to 1989.\n\nAfter winning the double with Pahang in 1992, he repeated the feat with Singapore in 1994.\n\nAfter retiring in 1999, Fandi made a successful transition to coaching, winning the S-League twice with Singapore Armed Forces FC in 2000 and 2002.\n\nHe also helped Pelita Jaya win promotion to the Indonesia Super League and guided the LionsXII to Malaysian FA Cup glory in 2015.\n\nHe had three spells with the Young Lions, and was the interim national coach in 2018 before guiding the Singapore Under-22s to the 2019 Merlion Cup.\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nFandi Ahmad\n\nSingapore Football\n\nmalaysia cup\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 21, 2022, 11:25am\n\nFandi Ahmad joins Pahang as technical advisor\n\nJun 30, 2022, 08:05am\n\nFandi Ahmad calls time on FAS stint after seven years\n\nMay 29, 2022, 03:21pm\n\n'60 years old?

This amount was paid over 13 occasions between 2017 and 2019.\n\nHe also admitted to two forgery charges.\n\nEight other charges, including graft ones linked to the remaining amount, were considered during sentencing.\n\nSoh was also ordered to pay a penalty of $24,850 and will have to spend an additional eight weeks behind bars if unable to pay the amount.\n\nHe has since voluntarily surrendered $30,000 to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.\n\nAt the time of the offences, Yong, 40, was working at Euro Bremse (EB) while Wong, 48, was employed at CEE Technologies. Their cases are pending.\n\nLee was then working at Alturan, and court documents did not disclose the outcome of his case.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Louis Ngia said that as an assistant buyer, Soh was responsible for supporting SMRT's procurement and sourcing activities.\n\nThese included the procurement of parts for the company's trains, buses, and taxis.\n\nThe prosecutor told the court that the transport provider uses a system called \"Ariba\" to support its procurement process.\n\nWhen SMRT requires procurement of items below $200,000, it will call for a request for quotation (RFQ) via closed invites.\n\nAfter that, assistant buyers initiate what is referred to as a \"sourcing event\" within Ariba.\n\nThey source from relevant vendors quotations, which are then submitted by a stipulated date.\n\nIn early 2016, Soh told Yong that the latter's firm was not awarded purchase orders in SMRT's RFQ as the prices it quoted were not competitive.\n\nDPP Ngia said: \"The accused offered to provide Yong with the confidential information if Yong should 'help' him, which they both understood to mean that Yong should provide him with corrupt monetary gratifications.\n\n\"EB could use the confidential information to guide its RFQ bids, giving it an unfair advantage. Yong agreed.\"\n\nThe prosecutor added that about once to twice a month on average between 2016 and 2020, Soh supplied Yong with confidential information regarding quotations from EB's competitors for past RFQs.\n\nAccording to court documents, Soh obtained at least $6,000 in bribes from Yong over six occasions.\n\nAround November 2017, EB was selected in SMRT's RFQ and was awarded the purchase order for spare parts.\n\nAs part of Soh's job scope, he had to draft a letter of award between SMRT and EB, and then route the document to SMRT's senior category manager for the man's approval and signature.\n\nSoh, however, did not circulate the letter to the senior category manager after drafting it.\n\nInstead, he cropped and affixed a digital copy of the man's signature onto the document without the latter's authorisation.\n\nDPP Ngia said that Soh also committed graft-related offences involving Wong on three occasions in 2017 and four occasions in 2018 to obtain at least $27,500 in bribes in total.\n\nIn May 2018, SMRT granted an approval to award CEE with a one-year contract for the supply of train parts.\n\nThe prosecutor told the court: \"The accused was beholden to Wong as a result of their corrupt arrangement, and wanted to 'help' Wong advance CEE's business interests with SMRT... As such, the accused made a false document - a supply contract dated May 4, 2018.\"\n\nOn this document, Soh falsely specified the contract as being for a two-year term, when in fact the contract awarded to CEE was for a one-year term.\n\nAfter that, Soh affixed a digital image showing the signature of SMRT's then-director of procurement without the man's authorisation.\n\nSoh's employment with SMRT was terminated on April 27, 2020 following an internal audit.\n\nHis bail was set at $50,000 on Monday, and he is expected to surrender himself at the State Courts on Feb 10 to begin serving his jail sentence.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncorruption\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She claimed that, as a result, the four officers, who were members of the forensic team, had breached protocol.\n\nShe also alleged that this would result in the chain of custody of evidence being compromised and thus be inadmissible in court.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nKoh\n\nfaces four charges,\n\nincluding making false representations to MOH over Covid-19 vaccinations and obstructing a policewoman from performing her duties.\n\nDetails of her complaint were published in grounds of decision by Senior Magistrate Hamzah Moosa in January.\n\nAccording to Mr Hamzah, Koh was concerned that fraudulent evidence could have been planted in her electronic devices.\n\nIn his decision, Mr Hamzah said: \"Her belief that the chain of custody of evidence seized during her arrest was compromised and no longer admissible in court are matters that are directly connected to and within the sole purview of the Trial Court.\"\n\nHe said they should be dealt with by the judge during a trial instead.\n\nIn her complaint, Koh also alleged the four officers had failed to assist a member of the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) team.\n\nOn Nov 4, 2022, Koh asked one Mr Sivakumar from the AGC if the extraction of exact copies from her digital devices was ready. Mr Sivakumar said it was not ready but would be by Nov 7.\n\nShe said the four officers, who were present when she spoke to Mr Sivakumar, had remained silent and accused them of trying to mislead her with their silence and reticence.\n\nKoh claimed the officers had committed an offence by providing false information to a public servant, in this case Mr Sivakumar, and omitting to assist him, citing Section 182 and 187(1) of the Penal Code.\n\nOn Nov 7, when Koh was provided the copies from her three devices, she wondered how they had come about, as the room where her devices were kept had been sealed each time she left the room.\n\nShe also realised that day that her devices were not sealed in tamper-proof bags, and she was concerned that \"fraudulent evidence\" could be planted in her devices.\n\nIn response, Mr Hamzah said Koh did not provide any credible evidence that the police officers had committed an offence under the Penal Code.\n\nIn dismissing her complaint, he said there was insufficient reason to proceed on it.\n\nMr Hamzah said he informed Koh she could lodge a complaint with the police or raise the matter with the AGC regarding her concerns or allegations of the possible misconduct of one or more of the four police officers.\n\nKoh has filed an appeal against the Magistrate's Court's decision.\n\nJessie Lim\n\nVACCINES\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\npolice\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMar 5, 2025, 12:19am\n\nIris Koh edits social media posts after prosecution says they are in contempt of court\n\nFeb 21, 2025, 07:54am\n\nAnti-vax group founder Iris Koh gets new bailor\n\nFeb 11, 2025, 12:22am\n\nShingles vaccine subsidies for citizens and PRs from September\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0345e04013720c467a1d49671355d103e2107bc1d7f0123872cf00ed94237b06/hzkoh1601222_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Iris Koh claimed four police officers had mishandled personal items seized from her after her arrest in January 2021.", "caption": "Iris Koh claimed four police officers had mishandled personal items seized from her after her arrest in January 2021.

Assuming they were kidnapped, Junaid filed a missing persons report.\n\nAfter conducting an investigation at the home the next day, police discovered a diary belonging to one of the girls.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 17, 2024, 01:45am\n\nFamily of S'pore woman who goes missing in Spain appeals for information\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"They intended to go to Korea to meet and join BTS as they were extremely inspired by the band. From the diary, we saw mentions of train timetables.

He also urged parents to monitor their children's screen time so they are aware about the contents their children are viewing online.\n\nBTS is a seven-member boy band formed in 2013. Its eldest member, Jin, 30, enlisted for his mandatory military service last month.\n\nThe remaining six are currently focusing on their solo projects.

I share this with you all.\"\n\nBlanchett has two Oscars for her work in Blue Jasmine (2013) and The Aviator (2004).\n\nShe won a Golden Globe\n\nfor her performance as a fictional lesbian conductor in Tar last week, but did not attend that ceremony.\n\nSeveral other awards shows, including the Film Independent Spirit Awards, MTV Movie & TV Awards, and music's Grammy Awards, have switched to gender-neutral acting prizes.\n\nThe Critics Choice Awards, like the Oscars and most other Hollywood shows, still divides its acting prizes between male and female categories.\n\nBlanchett's comments came moments after Brendan Fraser gave a highly emotional speech in which he thanked voters for his Best Actor prize for The Whale.\n\nFraser, a major Hollywood star in the late 1990s and early 2000s with hits such as The Mummy trilogy (1999 to 2008), endured a long fallow period before\n\nhis performance as a morbidly obese teacher in his new drama drew widespread acclaim.\n\n\"I was in the wilderness.

The siblings called him \"Papa\" and he moved in to live with them.\n\nThe siblings' mother held various jobs and was often at work, while the man helped her to care for her children.\n\nIn 2006, the couple broke up over unrelated matters, and he moved out of their flat.\n\nOn Dec 12, 2016, following a dispute between the mother and her daughter, the son sent text messages to his mother, revealing to her for the first time that the accused had abused them when they were young.\n\nOne message said the man \"touched us and made us do weird things\".\n\nThe son also wrote: \"Then, whenever you're around, he pretends (it's) nothing. And we didn't tell you, because we knew how hard you work.\"\n\nFollowing this revelation, the mother told the children to report the matter to the police, and the siblings did so the next day.\n\nThe accused admitted to three of the 11 charges brought against him: one for asking the girl to perform acts depicted in pornographic images they viewed together and two for performing a sexual act on the boy on two occasions.\n\nHe contested one charge of attempted rape and four charges of molestation committed against the daughter when she was between seven and 13 years old.\n\nHe also contested two charges of unnatural sex and one charge of molestation committed against the boy when he was between 11 and 13 years old.\n\nThe man claimed that the victims concocted the alleged incidents, noting that the siblings did not tell anyone about the alleged assaults for over a decade.\n\nThe sister testified that she did tell anyone about the abuse as she did not think her mother would believe her or do anything about it, and also because she felt ashamed.\n\nThe brother testified that he did not tell his mother as he felt that she was happy with the man, and he wanted to preserve her happiness.\n\nIn April 2022, Justice Tan Siong Thye convicted the accused of all eight charges, concluding that the siblings were unusually convincing witnesses and that the delay in reporting did not undermine their credibility.\n\nIn contrast, the judge found the accused's evidence unreliable. In particular, the accused was evasive and inconsistent when he was asked what he was apologising for in his 2010 Facebook message to the sister.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nabuse\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSalary Insights in Singapore - Where Do You Stand?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/23db1f8f6820cdceeac4be993d66bf5152ab71a67ea239811ef1dc8019468e9b/rape.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "ST PHOTO ILLUSTRATION"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Domingo has not admitted any wrongdoing.\n\nThe latest accusation came from an unidentified singer in Spain's La Sexta television channel.\n\nAppearing as a dark figure, she alleged that Domingo asked to touch her at a theatre in Spain at the start of the 21st century. On another occasion, he tried to kiss her, she said.\n\n\"One of the first things they tell you is don't go up in the lift alone with Placido Domingo,\" the woman told La Sexta.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 26, 2025, 08:46am\n\nDisagreement leads to shoving, shouting between troupe members and temple officials\n\nMore related stories\n\nShe related how Domingo allegedly asked to touch her after a rehearsal.\n\n\"The first time that I felt unease was when we were rehearsing. He (Placido) told me in front of everyone: 'Listen, can I put my hand in one of these lovely pockets of yours.' I was wearing trousers with an embroidered back pocket,\" she said.\n\n\"I had a bad stomach because I thought what can I say to (Domingo) to carry on normally. If I tell him no, there will be consequences and if I say yes, I don't even want to think about it.\"\n\nThe singer said she did not report him to her bosses or the authorities.\n\n\"He is Domingo. He is untouchable. He should not be, but I am in the shadows,\" she added.\n\nRepresentatives of Domingo did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe 2020 investigation by the American Guild of Musical Artists (Agma) concluded that he had behaved inappropriately.\n\nDomingo said in a statement at the time that he respected the women's decisions to speak out and that he was \"truly sorry for the hurt I caused them\".\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nShe Said explores the investigation that took down Harvey Weinstein\n\nSquid Game actor Oh Young-soo indicted for alleged sexual misconduct\n\nThe findings prompted Spain to cancel planned performances by the tenor-turned baritone at publicly funded theatres. American institutions including the Metropolitan Opera in New York and San Francisco Opera also scrapped planned engagements.\n\nDomingo resigned as general director of the Los Angeles Opera, whose own enquiry found 10 allegations about him to be \"credible\".\n\nNo criminal case was brought to court over any of the claims.\n\nIn an interview with Spanish newspaper El Mundo in January 2022, Domingo denied harassing anyone and said he felt he had been convicted in the court of public opinion because he did not speak out.\n\nAgma's investigation was partial, he said, and contained few concrete facts.\n\nDomingo returned to Spain to perform in a charity concert in June after an absence of almost a year and a half, and has performed in other countries. - REUTERS\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nArcade Fire singer Win Butler denies sexual misconduct allegations\n\nR&B singer R.

The first day of Chinese New Year this year falls on Sunday.\n\nICA said in a statement that traffic flow through the land checkpoints has returned to pre-pandemic levels during peak hours, and that during the peak of the Chinese New Year period in 2019 - before border closures during the Covid-19 pandemic - the average waiting time for travellers departing or arriving by car via Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints was about three hours.\n\nMore than a million travellers passed through the checkpoints during the year-end holiday season in 2022, with about 361,000 crossing daily.\n\n\"Motorists are also reminded to avoid queue cutting as it can cause severe congestion and compromise the safety of other motorists,\" said ICA, which also urged motorists to observe traffic rules, maintain lane discipline, and cooperate with officers on-site.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 12:23pm\n\nMan who evaded NS used fake Malaysian passports at checkpoints over 800 times\n\n4\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe agency advised motorists to check the traffic situation at both checkpoints through the Land Transport Authority's One Motoring website, or by the expressway monitoring and advisory system installed along the Bukit Timah Expressway and Ayer Rajah Expressway, before embarking on their journey.\n\nUpdates on traffic conditions will also be posted on ICA's Facebook and Twitter accounts, and broadcast on local radio stations Money 89.3, Kiss92, One 91.3, Hao 96.3 and UFM 100.3.\n\nAll short-term visitors, including holders of in-principle approval for long-term pass, are required to submit their Singapore Arrival Card (SGAC) with health declaration within three days prior to their arrival in Singapore.\n\nDue to the high volume of traffic and daily commuting for employment and studies, Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders are exempted from submitting a health declaration if they are returning to Singapore via the land checkpoints. They will have to do so if they enter Singapore via the sea and air checkpoints.\n\nTravellers should not bring in\n\nprohibited items such as firecrackers and \"bak kwa\" or roasted meat,\n\nwhile departing travelled in Singapore-registered cars are reminded to observe the \"three-quarter tank\" rule, said the ICA.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n‘Can’t wait to go back home’: Malaysians in S’pore look forward to CNY reunion despite high costs\n\nMore Singaporeans heading overseas for CNY with bookings almost back to pre-pandemic levels\n\nICA\n\nCauseway\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 4, 2025, 03:09am\n\nWoodlands Checkpoint extension works to begin in Q3 2025\n\n1\n\nJun 3, 2025, 08:19am\n\nSole registered voter in Tampines Changkat SMC polling district gets verbal advisory for old address\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:00pm\n\nNearly 200 travellers fined for not declaring large cash amounts, evading GST and taxes on tobacco\n\nMay 31, 2025, 09:52pm\n\nU-turns, bans await motorists who jump queue at land checkpoints\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of StarHub with 3Gbps Broadband deal\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b69c71d7806795dcdc285142506c19d30676181f978829d1f7a1a346442ea175/woodlandscheckpoint.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Authorities anticipate continuous heavy traffic at both the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints, with tailbacks expected from Malaysia.", "caption": "Authorities anticipate continuous heavy traffic at both the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints, with tailbacks expected from Malaysia.

That has exacerbated a housing crisis in New York and a worsening homeless crisis in the city.\n\nMr Adams's trip to El Paso comes after he said the migrant influx into New York could cost the city as much as US$2 billion (S$2.6 billion), at a time when the city is already facing a major budget shortfall.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 17, 2024, 09:03am\n\nMuch ado about butter chicken\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn recent months the Republican governors of Florida and Texas have sent thousands of migrants seeking sanctuary in the US to cities run by Democratic politicians, including New York, Chicago and Washington, DC. - REUTERS\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nBuses of migrants arrive at US V-P Kamala Harris’ home on Christmas Eve\n\nBiden visits US-Mexico border as immigration issue heats up\n\nnew york\n\nunited states\n\nmexico\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\nMIGRANTS/MIGRATION (LEGAL)\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 26, 2024, 02:48am\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs' properties in L.A. and Miami raided by federal agents\n\nDec 26, 2023, 08:02am\n\nBody of woman who fell off a cliff returning to S'pore on Dec 27\n\nDec 19, 2023, 01:45am\n\nActor Jonathan Majors convicted of assault, dropped from Marvel films\n\nNov 24, 2023, 09:19am\n\nNew York mayor denies sex assault claim amid flurry of last-minute suits\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0a8a2a137690bf34867255b20c04c5e701bc7bcdf4e1b3c6c71aada21efb0d92/NYADAMSBORDER5_2.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Eric Adams speaks with a group of migrants at a shelter run by Sacred Heart Church in El Paso, Texas, on Jan 15, 2023.", "caption": "Mr Eric Adams speaks with a group of migrants at a shelter run by Sacred Heart Church in El Paso, Texas, on Jan 15, 2023.

The price increases range from five cents to 65 cents a textbook, it added.\n\n\"In recognition of the economic challenges posed by the Covid-19 situation, textbook publishers have absorbed the costs of textbooks over the past two years,\" said the ministry.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 4, 2025, 06:37am\n\nDriver, 76, unconscious after car crashes into wall at polling station\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"But with changes in global economic conditions as well as rising operational and raw material costs due to supply chain disruptions, some publishers have found it necessary to adjust textbook prices.\"\n\nMOE added that schools have the flexibility to use books outside the approved textbook list, depending on their assessment of the textbook's suitability for the learning needs of their students.\n\nIn these cases, schools must ensure the textbooks are aligned to syllabus aims and learning outcomes, and that they are affordable and value for money.\n\nBooks not on the MOE-approved list include literature books, and some of them have seen bigger price jumps.\n\nFor instance, a copy of Boom, a play by Jean Tay used in some secondary schools, spiked in price from $14.90 to $18.10 on one school's reading list - a 21 per cent increase.\n\nThe Principles Of Accounts textbook, published by Marshall Cavendish and used in secondary schools, rose in price by 6 per cent, from $17.15 to $18.20.\n\nAmong the biggest jumps was that for a Secondary 2 Express textbook called Distinction In English Text Editing, also published by Marshall Cavendish. Its price surged from $7.70 to $9.65 - a 25 per cent increase.\n\nWhen asked, Marshall Cavendish and Shing Lee, major publishers of texbooks here, declined to elaborate on the reasons for the price increases.\n\nParents said they are feeling the pinch.\n\nMs Toh Ji Rong, 38, an educator whose son is in Primary 5 this year, said: \"These textbooks last for the whole year and they are necessary.

Prof Ooi said: \"These are also potent in limiting the spread of infection in our bodies.\"\n\nLikening the immune system to the Singapore Armed Forces defending the country against invasion, he said: \"Neutralising antibodies can perhaps be thought of as the first line of defence. If the invading forces slip through that net, then the other arms of the army, for example, artillery, armoured vehicles and special forces, can be deployed and reservists mobilised; that's on top of the air force and navy.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe vaccine similarly primes all of the body's different defensive mechanisms, of which neutralising antibodies are just one. Because they are the easiest to measure, they are the one most commonly referred to.\n\nHe said this was shown by phase three clinical trials of the mRNA vaccines. Against the placebo arm, the number of Covid-19 cases in those vaccinated started to tail off 12 days after the jab, although it takes 21 days following vaccination for the neutralising antibodies to appear.\n\nProf Ooi said: \"Whatever that protects must happen at around day seven to day 10. The data shows it is sufficient to protect against symptomatic infection. At that time, there were antibodies, but there were absolutely no neutralising antibodies.\"\n\nHe added that although only 2.2 million people here are officially listed as having been infected, experts estimate that roughly 90 per cent of the population have had a brush with the Sars-CoV-2 virus.\n\nIf they have been vaccinated, they would have hybrid protection, which provides even better defence against severe sickness than either vaccination or infection alone.\n\nHe said: \"There is sufficient data now to be confident that in those who are not immunocompromised by chronic diseases or medication, the resultant hybrid immunity protects robustly against subsequent symptomatic infection, and especially severe Covid-19.\"\n\nSo, for healthy adults, he said, one booster shot - that is, three mRNA jabs, or four if it is Sinovac - should provide enough protection against severe Covid-19 disease, even with new variants. This is what Singapore refers to as minimum protection - which 83 per cent of eligible people here now have.\n\nWhile new emerging variants might be somewhat different, they all share over 90 per cent of the viral proteins, which the immune system would recognise. It might take slightly longer to do so, but in a normal healthy person, the body will mount a response in time to prevent severe disease.\n\n\"For them, the benefit of an additional jab is minuscule, because they already have very good protection. Then the risk of even rare events like myocarditis becomes very real,\" he said, adding that in medicine, you only do something, including vaccination, when benefits clearly outweigh risks.\n\nHowever,\n\npeople who are at higher risk\n\nmight need to take boosters regularly because their natural immunity is lower. This includes the elderly, people with poorly controlled diabetes, cancer patients on certain medication, and transplant patients. For them, protection against infection might be important.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCovid-19 vaccinations set to head the way of the flu jab: Ong Ye Kung\n\nElderly urged to get 2nd Covid-19 booster jab to protect against severe illness\n\nSalma Khalik\n\nSenior Health Correspondent\n\nVACCINES\n\nCOVID-19 - SINGAPORE\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES\n\nPANDEMICS\n\nDUKE-NUS MEDICAL SCHOOL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMar 5, 2025, 12:19am\n\nIris Koh edits social media posts after prosecution says they are in contempt of court\n\nFeb 21, 2025, 07:54am\n\nAnti-vax group founder Iris Koh gets new bailor\n\nFeb 11, 2025, 12:22am\n\nShingles vaccine subsidies for citizens and PRs from September\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nJune FOMC Meeting Recap: Rates Held Steady, Markets React\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/95f595c261548ced17e6a168ecef924b0ba3ba0096bfd1162f8467d1289ad0f8/20221212147475178960f5f3-8a30-4c96-bf36-5eedbfef899f_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The vaccines play a big part in preventing severe illness and death as they would have primed other functions of our immune system.", "caption": "The vaccines play a big part in preventing severe illness and death as they would have primed other functions of our immune system.

He has eight caps for Ukraine.\n\nMudryk will reinforce Chelsea's attack after Graham Potter lost forwards Christian Pulisic and Raheem Sterling to injury.\n\n\"He's a hugely exciting talent who we believe will be a terrific addition to our squad both now and in the years to come,\" Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly and co-controlling owner Behdad Eghbali said, in a joint statement.\n\n\"He will add further depth to our attack and we know he'll get a very warm welcome to London.\"\n\nArsenal had reportedly been in talks to sign Mudryk as the Premier League leaders sought cover in attack following Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus' long-term absence due to knee surgery.\n\nBut as they negotiated the price and structure of payments, Chelsea swooped in with Shakhtar saying on Saturday that their president Rinat Akhmetov was close to agreeing Mudryk's transfer to Stamford Bridge.\n\nChelsea, who play Crystal Palace later on Sunday, are 10th in the standings, 10 points off the top four.\n\nFelix's red card on debut has also thrown a spanner in the works ahead of next Saturday's league trip to Liverpool, where Mudryk could make his debut.

It's something I do every year.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 3, 2023, 10:06am\n\nICA foiled attempt to smuggle more than 1,400 vapes on third day of CNY\n\nMore related stories\n\nWhen The Straits Times arrived at Ci Yuan CC at around 10am, more than 30 people were queueing for new notes, with fewer than 10 in the queue for fit-for-gifting notes.\n\nA sign at the start of the queue for new notes gave an estimated waiting time of two hours.\n\nMs Shane Lim, 32, said she arrived 30 minutes before the pop-up ATM for new notes opened at 10am and was surprised to see more than 10 people already in the queue.\n\n\"I'm collecting new notes for my mother-in-law, who loves to give them to her grandchildren every Chinese New Year. She also prefers the serial numbers on her notes to be in running order. As for myself, fit-for gifting notes will do,\" said the sales representative.\n\nAccording to MAS, fit-for-gifting notes are used currency notes that are generally clean and of suitable quality for recirculation, including for festive gifting.\n\n\"I don't think I'll be giving out e-hongbao anytime soon as I feel like it could be quite awkward, especially when meeting relatives face-to-face. Some older folk may not even understand the concept or know how to receive it. So I'm willing to queue,\" said Ms Lim, who waited in line for more than an hour.\n\nAt Clementi CC, around 35 people were lining up for new notes at around 10.30am.\n\nPeople queueing to withdraw notes for Chinese New Year at Clementi Community Centre at 10.40am on Jan 15, 2023. ST PHOTO: SHERLYN SIM\n\nMr Gan, 40, who works in construction and was queueing with his wife and toddler, said: \"Chinese New Year is a special occasion, and this year we can finally meet up in person. So giving out physical hongbao the traditional way is more sincere. And kids love to receive them too.\"\n\nHe waited about 30 minutes to get his new notes. Those who wanted new notes at other CCs did not have to wait as long.\n\nAt Toa Payoh Central CC, Ms Irene Tan, 51, walked right up to the pop-up ATM to get new notes.\n\nThe teacher, who arrived at around 1pm, said: \"I live in Bukit Panjang but I was in the Toa Payoh area so I decided to see if I could quickly get new notes here. I heard the pop-up ATMs in Bukit Panjang sometimes have long queues, so I'm lucky I got what I needed without much hassle.\"\n\nMost people ST spoke to were in favour of sticking with the traditional way of giving red packets and were reluctant to opt for e-hongbao.\n\nA 75-year-old retiree, who wanted to be known only as Mr Seng, said: \"For young people, e-hongbao may be convenient. But for an elderly person like me, it'll be troublesome because I don't know how to give e-hongpao and I'm worried about sending money to the wrong person.\"\n\nMadam Serenee Ong, 52, will also be sticking to physical hongbao this year. \"I feel that when you give someone a physical red packet, it is a lot more sincere. Banks have been promoting e-hongbao over the past few years, but I think it'll take quite a while for this way of giving to become a norm here,\" said the sales engineer.\n\nMadam Venlaura Kong, 43, who works in sales, was among a handful who were open to going digital.\n\n\"Over the past few years when we could not visit family due to Covid-19 restrictions, we had to opt for e-hongbao. I'm not sure what the trend is this year, but I will be giving both physical and digital red packets,\" she said.\n\nCyber-security consultant Bryan Sng, 25, said he does not mind receiving e-hongbao.\n\n\"To me, it doesn't matter. It's all about the gesture, and it's really the thought that counts,\" he said. \"But I believe that while most young people are okay with getting e-hongbao, many older folk aren't quite accustomed to it yet.\"\n\nNadine Chua\n\nand\n\nSherlyn Sim\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\natm\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 26, 2023, 10:29am\n\nCustomers frustrated after non-delivery of CNY gift hampers\n\nJan 25, 2023, 01:29pm\n\nNursing home residents whip up special home-cooked CNY dinner\n\nJan 25, 2023, 04:36am\n\nWet weather expected for remainder of CNY festive period\n\nJan 24, 2023, 12:07pm\n\nHow local celebrities celebrated Chinese New Year\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/92ee2f506c154177ed184ea76a14ce078563f69d16fd9c27d1059e8025dc8bee/wj8432_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "People queuing for new Chinese New Year notes at pop-up ATMs at Ci Yuan Community Centre on Jan 15, 2023. \n", "caption": "People queuing for new Chinese New Year notes at pop-up ATMs at Ci Yuan Community Centre on Jan 15, 2023.

He leaves the Sailors as their all-time top goalscorer with 32 goals (since 2020).\n\nHaving made 220 appearances for the Sailors including 168 in the SPL, Song's time with them may not be over yet.\n\nHe added: \"One day, I hope I'll be back to play for them and the club again.\"\n\nOther current Lions plying their trade in Thailand are the Fandi brothers Irfan and Ikhsan with top-tier team BG Pathum United, and Ryhan Stewart with Chiangmai FC in Thai League 2.\n\nErvin Ang\n\nLion City Sailors\n\nSONG UI-YOUNG\n\nthailand\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 24, 2024, 06:04am\n\nHeart condition forces Adam Swandi to hang up his boots at age 28\n\nJul 25, 2023, 11:53am\n\nWhy so serious, Ange?: Weary of questions about Harry Kane, Spurs boss in no mood to mess about\n\nMar 13, 2023, 02:33pm\n\nNSF disciplined after training with Sailors while on MC\n\nDec 26, 2022, 03:38am\n\nSailors sign SPL Player of The Year Kodai Tanaka\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of connectivity with 5Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c89812f9ff74644dfafeb1ae0454d8a342776900ab4076adb619d9ccfdc078a1/acsongui200922.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Lion City Sailors midfielder Song Ui-young (No. 15) has represented Singapore on 12 occasions, scoring thrice.\n", "caption": "Lion City Sailors midfielder Song Ui-young (No. 15) has represented Singapore on 12 occasions, scoring thrice.

The weather was clear, said Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority spokesman Jagannath Niroula.\n\nAs night fell, Mr Niroula said the search for four more still missing would resume on Monday.\n\nLocal TV showed rescue workers scrambling around broken sections of the aircraft. Some parts of the ground near the crash site were scorched, with licks of flames visible.\n\nThe crash is Nepal's deadliest since 1992, the Aviation Safety Network database showed, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A300 crashed into a hillside upon its approach to Kathmandu, killing all 167 people on board.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 9, 2024, 10:43pm\n\nBody of retired teacher Harry Tan brought home\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Yeti Airlines plane in Sunday's crash made contact with the airport in Pokhara from Seti Gorge at 5.05am GMT (1.05pm Singapore time), said the aviation authority. \"Then it crashed.\"\n\n\"Half of the plane is on the hillside,\" said local resident Arun Tamu, adding that he reached the site minutes after the plane went down.\n\n\"The other half has fallen into the gorge of the Seti river.\"\n\nMr Khum Bahadur Chhetri said he watched from the roof of his house as the flight approached.\n\n\"I saw the plane trembling, moving left and right, and then suddenly its nosedived and it went into the gorge,\" he told Reuters, adding that local residents took two passengers to a hospital.\n\nThe government has set up a panel to investigate the cause of the crash, and it is expected to report within 45 days, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel told reporters.\n\nAmong the 72 people on board were two infants, four crew members and 15 foreign nationals, said airline spokesman Sudarshan Bartaula.\n\nThe foreign nationals comprised five Indians, four Russians, one Irish, two South Koreans, one Australian, one French and one Argentinian, added an airport official.\n\nRescue teams working at the crash site of a Yeti Airlines ATR72 aircraft in Pokhara, Nepal, on Jan 15, 2023. PHOTO: EPA-EFE\n\nThe plane was 15 years old, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24.\n\nThe ATR 72 is a widely used twin-engine turboprop plane manufactured by a joint venture of Airbus and Italy's Leonardo.\n\nYeti Airlines has a fleet of six ATR 72-500 planes, according to its website.\n\n\"ATR specialists are fully engaged to support both the investigation and the customer,\" the company said on Twitter, adding that its first thoughts were for those affected, after having been informed of the accident.\n\nLocal television showed thick black smoke billowing from the crash site as rescue workers and crowds of people gathered around the wreckage of the aircraft.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nAir accidents are not uncommon in Nepal, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains, including Everest, as the weather can change suddenly and make for hazardous conditions.\n\nNepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal called an emergency Cabinet meeting following the crash, a government statement said.\n\nThe country's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people to hard-to-reach areas, as well as foreign trekkers and climbers. But it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nNepal also has some of the world's most remote and tricky runways, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge, even for accomplished pilots.\n\nCheck out this tweet!\n\nlink\n\nJanuary 15, 2023\n\nAircraft operators say the Himalayan country lacks the infrastructure for accurate weather forecasts, especially in remote areas with challenging mountainous terrain, where deadly crashes have taken place in the past.\n\nIn May 2022, all 22 people - 16 Nepalis, four Indians and two Germans - on board a plane operated by Nepali carrier Tara Air died when it crashed.\n\nAir traffic control lost contact with the twin-propeller Twin Otter shortly after it took off from Pokhara towards Jomsom, a popular trekking destination.\n\nIts wreckage was found a day later, strewn across a mountainside at an altitude of around 4,400m.\n\nAbout 60 people were involved in the search mission, most of whom trekked uphill for miles to get there.\n\nAfter that crash, the authorities tightened regulations, including allowing planes to be cleared to fly only if favourable weather was forecast throughout the route.\n\nIn March 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines plane crash-landed near Kathmandu's notoriously difficult international airport, killing 51 people.\n\nThat accident was Nepal's deadliest since the 1992 Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed all 167 people on board.\n\nJust two months earlier, a Thai Airways aircraft had crashed near the Kathmandu airport, killing 113 people.

He just pushed him up there without too much trouble.\n\n\"It looks like a bad habit that he has picked up. He did the same at his last barrier trial.\n\n\"Without this, I think he should have won more easily in the end.\"\n\nTan had made it clear that only a convincing win on Saturday would justify pressing on towards the Singapore Three-Year-Old Challenge, which kicks off with the Group 3 Singapore Three-Year-Old Challenge (first leg 1,200m) on April 8.\n\nThe next step is to nurture some versatility into the exclusively Polytrack four-time winner.\n\n\"I'll now look for a turf race for him to test him out as the Three-Year-Old races are all on turf. I'll have to discuss with Nunes,\" said Tan.\n\nCash Cove did try turf out at his first two starts, but finished out of the placings, albeit not beaten out of his ground.\n\nTan will worry about ticking that box another day. For now, he will enjoy unboxing his belated 54th birthday present.\n\n\"It was a nice belated birthday present. I turned 54 yesterday,\" said the Singaporean.\n\n\"It was Black Friday, so in a way, I got lucky one day later.\n\n\"The owners are also very happy they won, and with Chinese New Year around the corner, it was a great day of celebration.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/64d97d8bccf12c43892d5f01357ad57b70a273cbcd92230b5f24dbb16087f863/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Alwin Tan-trained Cash Cove (Manoel Nunes) justifying the $6 favouritism by beating The Shadow in Saturday's $50,000 Class 4 Division 1 event over the Polytrack 1,100m.

He was third three times from his last four starts. Unless one of the three newcomers can score, he could receive his just reward. (9) MOTHER OF PEARL looks the only danger. She gets a 2.5kg gender allowance and can only improve on her decent debut. The rest will have to improve to feature. (3) AIR FUSION can only improve so much on his debut seventh. Place chance at best. (7) LETSGOGLOBAL makes his debut and is worth a market watch.\n\nRace 2 (2,000m)\n\n(2) FLASHY APACHE is in top form and the trip is ideal. Stablemate (1) EXPRESSFROMTHEUS is improving but could be held by (3) DIESEL AND DUST on their recent meeting. (4) TOTAL PROTECTION was a good second in the London News Stakes and should make his presence felt.\n\nRace 3 (1,400m)\n\n(9) VITELLIUS drifted in the betting on debut but flew home late. He rates the one to beat. (2) STEPPING OUT finished ahead of (1) GIMME A DIAMOND in October and should hold form. (8) MARQUEZ and (7) LORD NELSON are looking to improve over the extra distance.\n\nRace 4 (1,400m)\n\n(2) HUMDINGER ran well after a rest. She should prove hard to overhaul with a run under her belt. (3) HOLLYWOODBOUND would not let her get far ahead and could challenge. Respect. (1) UNDER YOUR SPELL gives them 4kg, which could find her wanting. (4) SUPREME QUEST and (5) FOLLOW ME are looking for the quartet money.\n\nRace 5 (1,400m)\n\n(9) RULE BY FORCE is the obvious form runner, with two wins and two seconds from as many starts. Although the colt is tackling stronger opposition, he could pass the test. (7) TRIDENT KING has come well and rates a live threat from a good barrier. (2) FAST LOVE is holding form and must be considered for the trifecta. (1) BEY SUYAY (ignore latest run), (4) PICTURE PERFECT, (5) GOLDEN SPOON and (11) DESTINY OF SOULS (needed their last runs) can be Included in the quartet.\n\nRace 6 (2,000m)\n\nStable companions (2) LAST CHEER and (3) LIVERPOOL LEGEND have won seven races between them. Either could win. (4) GO FLICHITY was blowing last time and should do better. (10) WINNING QUEEN , (7) UNITED EXPRESS and (6) MIDNIGHT CRYSTAL can be considered.\n\nRace 7 (2,000m)\n\n(1) BELLEVARDE is course-and-distance suited. Despite a hefty 64kg to shoulder, the mare could double up. (2) SOUTHERN SONG would not go down without a fight. The 3.5kg reprieve should be beneficial. (3) FRANKLIN (blowing last time) could feature if in the right frame of mind. (4) TRUMP MY QUEEN beat (7) STUNNING KITTEN last time, but they could get a lot closer on weight difference.\n\nRace 8 (1,160m)\n\n(14) BIG CITY GIRL, (7) BACK TO BASICS and (5) WRITTEN IN STONE are possible winners.

The police and MOM are investigating the accident. No foul play is suspected.\n\nMOM has told ISOTeam C&P to stop using the gondola and to halt all work-at-height activities at the condominium. The company, a subsidiary of building maintenance firm ISOTeam, will be barred from hiring new foreign workers for three months due to its poor risk controls, MOM said.\n\nISOTeam C&P's managing director, Mr Sam Chen, will also be required to personally account to MOM for the lapses, and take responsibility for rectifications.\n\n\"MOM will not hesitate to prosecute those responsible if wrongdoing is found,\" a spokesman said on Saturday.\n\nAccording to his profile on ISOTeam's website, Mr Chen is a certified safety supervisor and a work-at-height assessor.\n\nUnder the law, no person should enter or leave a gondola unless it is at rest on the ground, or at any level which allows safe access.\n\nWorkers should also be given appropriate safety equipment to prevent falls when working at height, MOM added.\n\nFalling from a height was among the top causes of workplace deaths in 2022. The year saw 46 workplace fatalities, the highest recorded since 2016 when 66 people died.\n\nOn Sept 1, 2022, MOM imposed a six-month heightened safety period that will run till Feb 28. During this period, firms will be barred from hiring new foreign workers for up to three months if severe lapses are found following a serious or fatal workplace accident.\n\nFollowing this measure, the average number of workplace fatalities nationwide per month fell from 4.5 between January and August 2022 to 2.5 from September to December 2022.\n\nBy\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\nACCIDENTS - WORKPLACE\n\nbedok\n\ncondo\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:05pm\n\nSingaporean falls from height in workplace accident near Padang, dies\n\nMay 13, 2025, 06:27am\n\nJail for lorry crane operator who lifted 4.4-tonne lamp post footing, fatally toppling it onto worker\n\nMay 6, 2025, 01:03am\n\nSMRT Trains fined $240,000 over accident that killed technical officer\n\nApr 5, 2025, 12:37am\n\nMOM strengthens worker protection against extreme weather events\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nDiscover Thousands Of Jobs In SG's Healthcare Industry\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d6e9d1d216092d1d477719a084443ccc492db5ab517b5956a60d13b514c033ac/afwaterfrontisle140123_6.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The worker was standing on a concrete ledge at Waterfront Isle condominium when he fell. \n", "caption": "The worker was standing on a concrete ledge at Waterfront Isle condominium when he fell.

And every year, we refresh our plans, we roll out ideas for new homes, improve schools, new parks, new cycling ways, new facilities, keeping everything up to date, but this is a work which never ends.\"\n\nAn exhibition showcasing the redesign and upgrading of the amenities and facilities in Ang Mo Kio over the next few years was opened on Saturday and will run till Jan 28.\n\nPM Lee had announced the rejuvenation of Ang Mo Kio town centre in August 2022, and the first phase of the town centre's upgrading project will stretch from the square outside AMK Hub and 51@AMK to the outdoor shopping street, through to the Ang Mo Kio Central Stage.\n\nIt will end near Block 720 in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, close to Jubilee Square.\n\nWork on the first phase of the town centre's upgrading project will start in the first quarter of 2023 and will be completed by the end of 2024.\n\nThe town centre will be upgraded with sheltered rest areas and improved barrier-free access for the elderly and wheelchair users.\n\nThe current playground beside Ang Mo Kio Central Stage will be revamped and named the Saga Seed Playground.\n\nChildren will be able to walk on hammocks or tumble on sprawling nets there, inspired by the red seeds of the saga tree.\n\nSaid PM Lee: \"So, every year, we think of what are we going to do next year and every few years, we review our plans, and we look ahead and put all the ideas together, and we show the residents.\n\n\"This is what we can look forward to.\"\n\nAmong other plans for Ang Mo Kio is a new park at Lentor Hills Estate, about 8ha in size and scheduled to be completed progressively starting from the end of 2024.\n\nThe park will link the Central Catchment Nature Reserve to Khatib Nature Corridor. It will combine an existing forested hillock with a new therapeutic garden and a nature play garden.\n\nThe park will also be connected to a new 1km-long park connector at Lentor Canal that will be completed by end-2024.\n\nThe park connector will link residents to a larger recreational network including Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and other neighbouring green spaces, providing more opportunities for nature-based activities.\n\nThere will also be more new public housing projects like Yio Chu Kang Beacon near Yio Chu Kang MRT station, which is expected to be ready in 2024.\n\nNew and extended MRT lines are also in the works. The Cross Island Line Phase 1, which comprises 12 stations from Aviation Park to Bright Hill, is expected to be completed by 2030.\n\nAmanda Lee\n\nConsumer Correspondent\n\nAng Mo Kio\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:54am\n\n2 children among 3 taken to hospital after accident in Ang Mo Kio\n\nMay 8, 2025, 12:53am\n\nBed bugs crawl out of AMK flat; residents stock up on insecticide\n\nMay 4, 2025, 06:37am\n\nDriver, 76, unconscious after car crashes into wall at polling station\n\nApr 16, 2025, 01:39am\n\nTwo men clash - apparently over women - outside Ang Mo Kio hawker centre\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nFree WiFi 7 router, installation & more with 3Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f8d587480fdd736831679b3061ccf601a15a16437dec8bd6bb37e8c168b0877c/alfchern-alamk14-3203_4.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "PM Lee Hsien Loong touring an exhibition showcasing the amenities and facilities in Ang Mo Kio which will be redesigned and upgraded. \n", "caption": "PM Lee Hsien Loong touring an exhibition showcasing the amenities and facilities in Ang Mo Kio which will be redesigned and upgraded.

If we demand products with less packaging or choose energy-efficient appliances, companies will start to adopt greener and more sustainable products and solutions.\"\n\nIn a dialogue with the scouts at the event, Ms Fu noted that the challenge is timely, with Singapore in 2022 raising its climate ambition to hit net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAs part of 2023's challenge, scouts will embark on learning journeys or community activities related to the environment in every quarter.\n\nIn support of the Steward Pillar of the year-long Forward Singapore exercise, the scouts will also be submitting a Green Nation Pledge to commit to making Singapore a green, liveable and climate-resilient nation.\n\nAmong those participating in the challenge is Ngee Ann Polytechnic student Elvin Kong, who hopes to make thrifting - the act of shopping second-hand - a culture in his school and for other scouts.\n\nThe final-year automation and mechatronic systems student said: \"In polytechnic, we tend to have to dress up when we come to school, so many of us have to go out and buy shirts.\n\n\"But some of my schoolmates and I realised in 2022 that maybe this trend will lead to us throwing a lot of shirts away, so with thrifting becoming more common, I think schools can promote this initiative.\"\n\nIn the next few months, Mr Kong and a few of his peers will be organising an exchange for his peers to trade clothes, he said.\n\nThe 20-year-old also hopes to hold a similar activity for scouts to recycle their uniforms.\n\nMeanwhile, fellow scout Mellina Mohamad Noor, 21, is planning to take bigger steps towards encouraging others to cut down on food waste, a cause that struck her during a trip to rural areas in Vietnam as a secondary school student.\n\nThe second-year Ngee Ann Polytechnic early childhood development and education student said: \"Most of the scout students only know that we throw a lot of trash, but they do not know what kind of trash is being thrown.\"\n\n\"So when I introduce the topic of food waste, they realise that we shouldn't waste food, that we should buy only what we can finish.\"\n\nBy\n\nAng Qing\n\nRead articles by Ang Qing\n\ngrace fu\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nbak kwa\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 22, 2025, 12:50am\n\n'We want to do right by S'poreans, balance needs of hawkers and consumers'\n\nNov 5, 2024, 10:34pm\n\nSingapore's east-siders discuss flood preparations\n\nSep 28, 2024, 12:07am\n\nSea off East Coast Park reopens for all activities\n\nJun 19, 2024, 03:32am\n\nUnderground reservoir to serve Bidadari residents\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ccd3d96eb39009fe9e88d56ec7320050ef61f00a652a2a37de41aca9edafe99b/yaohui-pixgeneric-4574_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Shoppers queueing at bak kwa shop Lim Chee Guan in Chinatown on Dec 26, 2022. \n", "caption": "Shoppers queueing at bak kwa shop Lim Chee Guan in Chinatown on Dec 26, 2022.

But ten Hag's men have lost just once in 19 games since.\n\nThe introduction of Casemiro has transformed United's midfield since the last Manchester derby and ten Hag's decision to play Fred alongside his Brazilian international teammate cut City's supply line to Erling Haaland.\n\nUnited's turnaround is reflected in Rashford's revival. The England international has now scored 16 times this season.\n\nHis pace was the biggest threat posed by either side in the first half and he should have done better after rounding Ederson than allowing the ball to be cleared off the line.\n\nAnother Rashford burst then took him beyond Rodri, but again the finish was lacking as Ederson hurried off his line to smother.\n\nUnited's new loan signing Wout Weghorst was watching on from the stands and Martial's lacklustre performance before being replaced at half-time by Antony underlined ten Hag's need for more forward options.\n\nBy contrast, City are blessed with an abundance of talent in the final third and Guardiola's ability to make game-changing substitutions looked to have swung the game in their favour.\n\nGrealish had been on the field for only three minutes before netting the biggest goal of his City career to date as he nodded in Kevin de Bruyne's cross on the hour mark.\n\nBut City have struggled this season to match the consistency that has won them four Premier League titles in the past five years and were undone by a hugely controversial equaliser.\n\nRashford was clearly offside as he raced towards Casemiro's pass, but crucially did not touch the ball and left it for Fernandes to sweep home.\n\nThe assistant referee initially flagged for offside and City were livid at the decision to allow the goal to stand. City manager Pep Guardiola felt aggrieved by the decision as he felt that Rashford was interfering with play as he was \"distracting our 'keeper and our centre-backs\".\n\nTen Hag said he understood City's frustration, adding: \"The rules, it's a confusing moment for the backline of the opponent. The rules say Marcus didn't touch the ball and he wasn't interfering. Bruno came from the back - but I can see it from the other side.\"\n\nCity were still rocking when they conceded again as Garnacho sprinted down the left and crossed for Rashford to prod home from close range.\n\nThere was still time for City to feel further aggrieved at referee Stuart Attwell as Haaland saw a penalty appeal waved away.\n\nBut the champions now have a huge job on their hands if they are to maintain their dominance of English football in the Guardiola era.\n\nGuardiola, who has often added a tinge of sarcasm in his comments, then said he prefers playing with the right attitude than chasing silverware. \"I don't care about the Premier League and the (League) Cup, we cannot win. We won a lot, so it's not a problem,\" he said.\n\nAs for United, who have won nine consecutive games in all competitions, the belief is back, said ten Hag. - AFP\n\nepl\n\nManchester derby\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nEnjoy free installation & more with 10Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5446bf1be68deb281af9ffd9b7a9376ab8cd7d22592e59da43d2efb1b6df2964/2023-01-14t141534z878082988up1ej1e13lwccrtrmadp3soccer-england-mun-mci-report_6.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Manchester United's Marcus Rashford (left) scoring their second goal past Manchester City's Ederson. \n", "caption": "Manchester United's Marcus Rashford (left) scoring their second goal past Manchester City's Ederson.

The timing for the 1,200m on Polytrack was 1min 11.22sec.\n\nTrainer Steven Burridge was both pleased and relieved with that gutsy performance. It was another step in the right direction, but the veteran Australian is aware tougher tests must be passed in order to beef up his Singapore Derby credentials.\n\nThe third leg of the Singapore Four-Year-Old Challenge and Group 1 contest will be run on July 23 while the first two legs, the Group 3 Silver Bowl (June 11) and Group 2 Stewards' Cup (July 2) will serve as both prep runs and guides.\n\n\"After all that's been said and done as far as his condition is concerned, he's done a good job. Hopefully, he pulls up good and we go from there\", said Burridge.\n\n\"We'll probably go for a Kranji Stakes A in four weeks' time. There is a Class 3 1,400m coming up, but he'll get 59kg, which makes it hard with the weights.\n\n\"From there he will then go to a mile race. It's onwards and upwards, hopefully he can move to better class fields and get a lighter weight.\"\n\nBurridge defended Nunes' decision to draw first blood early in the home straight, even if his lack of fitness seemed to tell towards the business end.\n\n\"We had him ridden a little closer today. If he didn't push out before the home turn, he could have got hemmed in,\" he said.\n\n\"When the grey horse (Gold Ten Sixty-One) moved off the fence, he went through. He probably hit the front too far from home, but the main thing is he's won and got it over and done with.\"\n\nThe inside alley could have been a nightmare for Street Of Dreams, but Nunes sure knows how to elbow his way out of a pickle.\n\n\"He's a lovely horse. Steven and his team have done a great job with him,\" he said.\n\n\"He was a bit fresh today and was ready to go. From the barrier, it was a little bit tricky to ride him.\n\n\"But I rode him like the best horse. He's a straightforward horse, he put himself there and got the job done.\n\n\"He's definitely looking for more ground. I would say 1,400m to 1,600m, maybe next time.\n\n\"I'll have to see with Steven. He's a lovely horse on grass as well, he's a nice horse for the 4YO series.\"\n\nWith at least seven from his book of nine rides well in the market, the Brazilian was strongly tipped to dominate Saturday's card.\n\nIn the end, five of his expected winners came from Cash Cove ($6), Wild Bee ($14), Petrograd ($9), Street Of Dreams ($8) and General Command ($13). January and Bizar Wins were his only favourites to be rolled, the former beaten a whisker by Bionics ($57).\n\nNo doubt, only two race meetings from the entire season of 47 meetings have been put to bed, but with a tally of seven winners already under his belt, Nunes has begun his title defence for a fifth title in the best possible way.\n\nAfter calling in sick at the first meeting, his arch-rival Vlad Duric got his season under way only on Saturday, bringing up the perfect one-from-one result aboard even-money favourite Vittoria Perfetta.\n\nThe Australian is giving a big start, but should not be underestimated. Despite commanding fewer rides because of his heavyweight status, he remains a classy rider who knows where the winning post is.\n\nBoth are four-time Singapore premiership winners with Duric leading the tally of winners on 652, 60 more than Nunes' 592. Duric has, however, ridden in Singapore over a longer period, nine seasons versus Nunes' seven.\n\nSaturday's Singapor Results\n\n:\n\nres15.pd\n\nf\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nEnjoy ultra-smooth streaming with 3Gbps Broadband.\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/efb327f5490fb11528393afb03f47f6a4207d935f975ee985d147c798e1a5d8a/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Street Of Dreams (Manoel Nunes) staving off Gold Ten Sixty-One (Wong Chin Chuen, No. 6, second) and Vgor (Koh Teck Huat, No. 11, third) to win the Class 3 race over 1,200m on Polytrack on Saturday.\n", "caption": "Street Of Dreams (Manoel Nunes) staving off Gold Ten Sixty-One (Wong Chin Chuen, No. 6, second) and Vgor (Koh Teck Huat, No. 11, third) to win the Class 3 race over 1,200m on Polytrack on Saturday."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1e42f2ebaf825e27fbdd96b8eb09029f407904f0079182b89b5cf6da850cce04/IMG_0407.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "Group 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It is even rarer still when those A-listers were formerly husband and wife.\n\nSong Joong-ki's Reborn Rich\n\n, which ended its run on Dec 25, is a bona fide smash hit, with ratings that made it the second most-watched series in South Korea's cable television history. In it, the 37-year-old leading man plays Yoon Hyun-woo, a loyal employee working in the present day for Soonyang Group, run by the ultra-rich Jin family.\n\nHe is murdered, but instead of dying, he wakes up in 1987 in the body of Jin Do-jun, the youngest grandson of the Jin patriarch. He plots to wrestle control of the company and seek answers to his death.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMeanwhile, Song Hye-kyo's The Glory, which dropped on Netflix on Dec 30 and is currently the most-watched non-English language series globally, sees the 41-year-old actress break away from her usual romance genre.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 06:37am\n\n'A different kind of charm': K-star Park Bo-gum swops love for punches in action-comedy Good Boy\n\nMore related stories\n\nShe stars as Moon Dong-eun, a woman once violently bullied by her wealthy, cruel classmates in school. As an adult, she hatches an elaborate plan to torture her tormentors.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nThe Songs, who fell in love on the set of the hit romance drama Descendants Of The Sun (2016),\n\ndivorced in 2019.\n\nSo whose show is better? Here is how their on-screen vengeance stacks up.\n\nStory\n\nDue to a fantastical \"reborn\" set-up, Reborn Rich is a buoyant take on revenge. Retaining all his memories of his life as Hyun-woo after his rebirth, Do-jun is prescient.\n\nWatching him use his knowledge of the future, be it the results of presidential elections or the World Cup, to thwart his condescending extended family and win the favour of his grandfather - the fearsome leader of Soonyang, Jin Yang-cheol (Lee Sung-min) - is a fun and exciting ride. But it is one with diminishing returns, used too many times in the plot.\n\nThe drama's finale was also heavily criticised by some (and even voted by viewers as the show with the worst ending in a survey conducted by community portal site DC Inside), as it veers from the conclusion of the original webtoon it was based on. Instead of a straightforward revenge, Reborn Rich became more of a redemption tale.\n\nThe Glory, on the other hand, has no moments of levity.  This is a dark series that opens with scenes of school bullying so brutal they are difficult to watch.\n\nThe Glory is a dark series that opens with scenes of school bullying so brutal they are difficult to watch. PHOTO: NETFLIX\n\nUnlike Do-jun, Dong-eun has no magical ability that gives her smug \"gotcha\" moments. After suffering unthinkable abuse, what powers her is a burning hatred that has wholly consumed her.\n\nThere is no healing or moving on for Dong-eun. She has no hobbies, aspirations or relationships, and is set on one thing alone - to make the lives of those who tortured her hell.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe Glory. While its ending remains to be seen as part two is released only in March, for those looking for revenge stories, this is the far more wrathful tale.\n\nVillains\n\nIt can be argued that a revenge tale lives and dies on its antagonists. How can audiences enjoy sweet catharsis if there is not enough unalloyed hatred for those getting their just deserts?\n\nIn Reborn Rich, the extended Jin family members are rich and entitled, treat those who work for them like slaves, and have no hesitation in destroying the lives of ordinary people to line their wallets. Audiences will despise them, for sure.\n\nIm Ji-yeon plays Park Yeon-jin, the ringleader of a group of school bullies in The Glory. PHOTO: NETFLIX\n\nBut the villains in The Glory? They will make your skin crawl. Sure, the ringleader of Dong-eun's bullies, Park Yeon-jin (Im Ji-yeon), has typical baddie traits - bratty, wealthy and awful to the people she sees as beneath her. But she also delights in hurting people and seeing them utterly humiliated.\n\nWhen Dong-eun asks why Yeon-jin picks on her, the latter's unfazed reply is simple yet chilling - because she can, and without consequences.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe Glory, hands down. Don't mess with the mean girl.\n\nActing\n\nIn another coincidence, the stars of both series are not the acting highlights. In fact, it is often the antagonists or supporting characters who steal the show.\n\nIn Reborn Rich, the man to watch is Lee's Yang-cheol, a tough, ruthless self-made tycoon ruling over a dysfunctional family with an iron fist.\n\nLee Sung-min’s performance as Jin Yang-cheol in Reborn Rich contains multitudes, making him hard to hate. PHOTO: VIU\n\nWhile his character is objectively unscrupulous, Lee makes him hard to hate. His performance contains multitudes - the ego and greed of a man who clawed his way to the top, the pain of a father who has failed to parent children he respects, the fear of ageing and death.\n\nMeanwhile, The Glory is a fresh challenge for Song Hye-kyo, who is best known for her work in romantic comedies. She does a serviceable job here, but the nature of the character calls for her to just appear cold and detached.\n\nOf particular note instead are the teenage (Shin Ye-eun) and adult versions of Yeon-jin. Their crooked smiles and condescending glints put together a cohesive and convincing performance as the same character at different stages of life.\n\nVerdict:\n\nReborn Rich. Lee is hard to beat.\n\nThe Glory\n\nNetflix\n\n4 stars\n\nReborn Rich\n\nViu\n\n3.5 stars\n\nJan Lee\n\nK Drama\n\nnetflix\n\nREVIEWS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 1, 2025, 11:47pm\n\nPark Bo-gum to meet fans in Singapore on Aug 14\n\nFeb 27, 2025, 06:37am\n\nK-drama star Song Joong-ki spotted playing golf in Singapore\n\nDec 12, 2024, 11:51pm\n\nMixed reactions to Park Sung-hoon's transgender role in Squid Game 2\n\nSep 24, 2024, 07:50am\n\nClaudia Kim announces divorce after five years of marriage\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6e8b0151d1c8c557a8bc2defe1e7dc39bf649988a6ade5cae4e405ffdb7ef8b9/yusongsong-collage_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Song Joong-ki (left) and Song Hye-kyo.

Gate 2 will blend well with his speed.\n\nJanuary - with two wins, a second and a third from as many starts - is a horse going places.\n\nHe will take a lot of beating.\n\nStreet Of Dreams is a hat-trick winner, whose trial and gallops suggest a fourth success on the trot is achievable in Class 3.\n\nAfter all, his trainer, Steven Burridge, has high expectations, including getting him to November's $1 million Singapore Gold Cup.\n\nNewcomer General Command has been burning up the training tracks for his debut. He won both his trials impressively.\n\nNunes' remaining four mounts - trial winner Healthy Baby (Race 2), Wild Bee (Race 4), Luck Of Master (Race 5) and Wind Of Liberty (Race 9) - are also looking well and can score with some luck.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThese 5 S-REITs Are Outperforming in 2025 - Here’s Why\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e2cfcd96a8ad9db2f017f0c00f0a282bbc0c4748224f7426bb6afa737ebe14b/unnamed_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "With luck, champion jockey Manoel Nunes can possibly win half the 12-race card on Saturday.", "caption": "With luck, champion jockey Manoel Nunes can possibly win half the 12-race card on Saturday."}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1e42f2ebaf825e27fbdd96b8eb09029f407904f0079182b89b5cf6da850cce04/IMG_0407.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "Group 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The mare can go one better. (8) IF YOU SAY SO is lightly raced and her best effort has been over ground on this track. Trainer Kumaran Naidoo has two strong chances in (2) CRY FREEDOM and (3) LUCIA POPPOVA. Cry Freedom is improving steadily.\n\nRace 2 (1,600m)\n\n(1) PARIS RAIN is lightly raced and has also improved with each outing. (3) POWER STAR was beaten narrowly last time. He has thrived and has a nice barrier. (8) HARLEY STREET jumps to a trip that looks more suited to his pedigree and must come into all calculations. (11) ZABADAK is another that improved nicely second-up. He must have a strong chance.\n\nRace 3 (1,000m)\n\n(8) SUPER FAST has put in two smart efforts. He is the horse to beat with further progress. (2) TWICE THE TRINITY made marked improvement over this course and distance last start. The gelding looks ready to score. (1) GOLD ENSIGN has shown up well in two starts over this course and distance. He is worth taking a chance on with the blinkers off. (4) AXEL COLLINS is back over what looks like his best course and distance. Must have a decent chance.\n\nRace 4 (1,000m)\n\n(4) ISN'T SHE BONNY has run two crackers on this course. The drop in trip should suit. The one to beat. (12) RIO SUPREMO was chasing points in the Hollywood Sizzling Challenge and the blinkers saw her improve to finish second. (9) WILLOW CREEK was not far back on debut when well supported. Another to consider. (3) NABIAS came in for solid market support on debut but finished last. The run can be ignored. She looks better than that.\n\nRace 5 (2,400m)\n\n(9) TWICE GOLDEN loves this course and distance. Narrowly beaten last start, the gelding can score again. (5) RUN TO DENMARK stays well and may just have needed his last start after returning from a break. (2) SUNDAY ISLAND goes well over the trip. Strong chance. (6) WITH PLEASURE won well on the Poly last start. The four-year-old goes well this trip and the stable is in form.\n\nRace 6 (1,750m)\n\n(8) DAWNOFANEWDAY takes on the males but has competed against useful fields. She steps up in trip and looks more than competitive. (9) QUEUE WING was a very easy last-start winner. The gelding should put in another top showing. (3) AQUAE SULIS is a big strong filly who should enjoy the weight off her back. Can upset. (7) ARCTIC TUNE has been knocking on the door, finding one to beat in his last two starts.\n\nRace 7 (1,200m)\n\n(8) BEECHAMWOOD BOY has competed against stronger rivals. He finished second and third in his last two starts. The horse to beat. (6) NORTHERN WARRIOR goes well over this course and distance. With a 1.5kg allowance, he must have a strong chance. (4) EDDIE THE MOVER has been trying further. He should be competitive with a run back from a short break. (1) TRIBUTE TO YOU was not far back in his handicap debut and can still improve.\n\nRace 8 (1,000m)\n\n(9) IRFAANS BOY was an inspired gamble last time when second. He can make amends. (12) SABATINI is a smart filly. The stable is confident of a top showing. (6) WINTER BARON won well enough last run although the form has not quite held up. But he gets a drop in class. (2) RENAISSANCE MAN is lightly raced and can finish in the money.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nDance your WiFi troubles away with StarHub Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9ca8551ed865e47a825b6334cf14ab48e71d62ca3266eedf8f83d44dd54c12a6/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Now under the care of Tony Millard, he gets the right draw to nail his third victory in Race 5 at Sha Tin on Sunday.\n\nPHOTO: HKJC\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 13, 2023, 03:34pm\n\nDraw favours Speed Fay Fay\n\nShare this article\n\nRace 1 (1,200m)\n\n4 Compulsory looks sound and trialled impressively. He is well-placed stepping down to Class 5, which is more than suitable. He gets his chance. 2 Fighting Star has shown glimpses of ability. He has drawn favourably, which should ensure he gets the run of the race. 5 Sunshine Legendary is tracking towards a first win. He shapes as a solid each-way prospect on his powerful closing speed. 9 Euromissile gets top jockey Zac Purton aboard. He is also closing in on a first success.\n\nRace 2 (1,400m)\n\n6 Wins All steps away from a handy draw. He should take up a forward position on the rails, which should ensure he gets the run of the race. He has not won for a while but this should pan out in his favour. 1 Star Of Yuen Long has the class edge. He has been competitive in higher grades and he would not know himself in Class 5. 11 The Good Deal is tracking towards a first victory. Karis Teetan's pairing is a big positive. 9 Super Kingdom is finding his feet. Next best.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\n1 Regency Bo Bo brings the right form to this. With luck, he is the one to beat, despite getting long in the tooth. The nine-year-old has placed behind a stack of quality horses and a clean run should afford him every opportunity to end a lengthy run of outs. 5 Daring Pursuit returns after that luckless first outing. He has class, but there are queries about his fitness. 2 Brave Dreams has a powerful finish. He can be right there as usual. 8 Hurry Hurry Rich should fire ahead to lead on debut. Big watch.\n\nRace 4 (1,200m)\n\n2 Universal Horizon returns as a gelding. He impressed last season when winning on debut. Since then, he has been solid across two outings this campaign. He caught the eye in his latest trial, possibly benefiting from the gelding operation. 3 Multisuper has hit the ground running across two outings, finishing second and third. The strong booking of Purton warrants respect. 13 Super Highway has been consistent of late. He won well last start. 6 Denfield makes his debut. Keep safe.\n\nRace 5 (1,400m)\n\n11 Speed Fay Fay gets the right draw. He can save a stack of ground and, with luck, nail his third success. He has held his form this term. If he performs anywhere near his first-up effort, he is the one to beat. 2 Millennium Falcon is consistent and has improved back in Class 4. 7 Owners' Praise has impressed across both outings. The lightly raced galloper looks to have a stack of ability. 12 Joyful Genius romped in last start. He is up in grade but Purton stays on.\n\nRace 6 (1,400m)\n\n4 Sparky Star has done everything right this season, except win. He is looking well at trackwork and his latest effort for second was sound. Hugh Bowman sticks aboard and he could win. 3 Function Patch appeared to have a bit more in the tank when eighth last start. With a clean run, he could be a big threat. 13 My Intelligent can roll forward from the draw. He is fit and has shown this term that he is ready to score again. 6 Fast Buck did well for second last start. He is steadily improving with each outing.\n\nRace 7 (1,000m)\n\n9 Victory Moments has caught the eye ahead of his debut. He has shown potential in his barrier trials. Clearly, the booking of Purton signals strong intent. The wide draw is ideal down the straight. 7 We Are Hero was unlucky last time. He could have won with a clean run. Expect him to bounce back. 2 Metro Warrior kept on for an overdue third hurrah last start. He has held his condition and could make it back-to-back. 5 Pleasant Endeavor is always a threat down the straight. Three of his four runs this term were over the course and distance for a win and two seconds.\n\nRace 8 (1,600m)\n\n12 Happy Together has progressed nicely across his three outings in Hong Kong. He was a winner in Ireland over this trip and he proved last start that this distance suits at Sha Tin, as does the addition of a tongue tie. 4 Voyage Bubble is a nice horse who still appears to have plenty of rating points to climb. He gets his chance on the speed. 14 Happy Day slots in light and impressed last start over the course and distance. He will be in the finish. 7 Secret Vision placed against strong company last start. Next best.\n\nRace 9 (1,200m)\n\n5 Ready To Win was without luck last start in the straight. He is nothing short of consistent and is capable of atoning for that effort. 8 Pulsar Strider travelled wide and without cover last start. His second placing before that was excellent. The main threat. 3 Naboo Legend has done well at the trials but seemingly struggles to put it all together on race day. Expected to lead, he is worth an each-way ticket for the price. 12 Dream Pursuer has made improvement. Include him in the multiples.\n\nRace 10 (1,400m)\n\n7 Navas Two is capable of scoring on his best form. His last two outings could be forgiven. He had post-race issues and, two runs back, he travelled wide throughout. He can bounce back. 5 Galaxy Witness is much better suited on grass than dirt. He is expected to improve drastically on grass. 12 Tuchel has been handed a horror draw but should be in the thick of the action, regardless. 8 Tianchi Monster will be at a huge price. He might be worth an each-way ticket.\n\n*Comments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTrump's Tariffs & Market Volatility: What Investors Need to Know Now\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5fe100789a6bf50cf91aa476aabafab01e7048f4478c540772853c688d497ebb/unnamed_1_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Speed Fay Fay (purple headgear) winning in a tight finish in one of his two successes when trained by Benno Yung.

The first lasted 1 minute 55 seconds, the second 2 minutes 11 seconds, and the third 1 minute 48 seconds.\n\nAccording to the Chinese daily, Cao played multiple personas in the clips, promoting the joys of \"small gambles\".\n\nIn one video, the Singaporean portrayed two characters - one had lost $500 to gambling, while the other had won $50. At the end of the clip, the website's logo can be seen, suggesting the person had won money after he made a bet with it.\n\nThe police confirm that a report has been lodged and investigations are ongoing.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 23, 2024, 07:55am\n\nMarcus Chin in good spirits after second heart surgery\n\nMore related stories\n\nA Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) spokesman said it has completed its review into the matter, and directed the Infocomm Media Development Authority to order Internet service providers to disable access to the website.\n\nAs of Friday, access has been disabled, the spokesman added.\n\nThe Straits Times tried contacting Cao on Friday but he did not answer calls or reply to a message seeking further comment. ST also tried to access the videos and the website on Friday, but they were no longer available.\n\nCriminal defence lawyer Cory Wong, 33, from Invictus Law Corporation, said Cao may have advertised unlawful gambling, which is an offence under the Gambling Control Act. Singapore Pools is the only licensed operator to provide lotteries and sports betting services here.\n\nMr Wong said if the website does not have a valid gambling service licence, it will be classified as enabling a form of unlawful gambling - and whoever advertises, or assists to promote, this website will be breaking the law.\n\nThese regulations will apply to websites based overseas but available to users in Singapore, or websites based here but targeting overseas users, he added.\n\nAccording to the GRA website, all forms of advertising and promotion relating to licensed gambling are prohibited unless otherwise approved by it. It is an offence to advertise unlawful gambling in or from Singapore or from outside the Republic to persons in Singapore.\n\nIf found guilty, an individual can be fined up to $20,000.\n\nWhen a Lianhe Zaobao reporter called Cao earlier this week to ask about the circumstances under which he participated in the filming of the videos, he said he had been approached by a production company that he had never cooperated with before, and was not aware of the website's background.\n\n\"This is to tell people not to gamble,\" Cao added, before hanging up.\n\nCao appeared in three videos for a gambling website, where he played multiple personas.  PHOTO: SCREENGRAB FROM YOUTUBE\n\nThe reporter subsequently messaged Cao, saying the video is not advising people not to gamble but that \"small\" gambling is fun. The reporter asked if Cao could explain further but did not get a reply.\n\nThe reporter tried calling again but could not reach Cao who unlawfully hosted 12 guests at his home in October 2020 amid the Covid-19 outbreak. He was fined $3,500 in May 2021.\n\nOne organisation which collaborates frequently with Cao is luxury retailer Lovelotsluxury. Its co-founder, Mr Peter Ang, said it has worked with him for almost a year, and is impressed with his work ethic and professionalism.\n\nMr Ang added: \"We have no comment with regards to this incident. As for future collaborations, they are still in the pipeline.\"\n\nBenson Ang\n\nLifestyle Correspondent\n\nlocal actor\n\nGambling\n\npolice\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 20, 2024, 07:07am\n\nJeanette Aw holds on to tent during Mid-Autumn Festival\n\nSep 18, 2024, 01:40am\n\nActor Ryan Lian arrested for allegedly tampering with lock\n\nAug 15, 2024, 01:21am\n\nCyclist falls after riding into actor Chen Hanwei's car\n\nJul 31, 2024, 12:31am\n\nSuhaimi Yusof makes lifestyle adjustments post-stroke\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/86177631fa497020d46c1ac235673a97e07f95a51be7bb66f0501c6fc3670bcb/sv-terencecaoyoutube-130123_4.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Three short videos featuring Terence Cao had been uploaded on a gambling website.

The stall said it was \"a misunderstood communication\".\n\nThe Stomper claimed the staff pushed him around. The stall said Robert was \"emotionally unstable\" and he verbally attacked the staff until his saliva could be felt on the staff's face.\n\nTop Durian Station said it had made a police report. The Stomper called the stall a \"tenacious adversary\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt all started on Jan 5 at about 7.30pm when Robert went to the Top Durian Station outlet at Block 156, Bukit Batok Street 11.\n\n\"A young man kept insisting that I should buy four durians so that I would get one free,\" said Robert, who declined the offer because he did not want to walk home carrying so many durians.\n\n\"After he had opened the third durian to show me… he suddenly offered to give me a musang king durian free.\"\n\nSince the durian was free, the Stomper accepted the offer.\n\nBut when he went to pay for the four durians, a \"pretty lady\" began to weigh the musang king durian, implying that he would be charged for it. He stopped her and told her it was supposed to be free.\n\n\"She immediately claimed that I had heard her fellow worker wrongly,\" recounted Robert.\n\n\"I kept insisting that the young seller offered the free durian to me and even approached him to verify my claim. To my great consternation, he rebuffed me and pretended that nothing like what I had claimed happened.\"\n\nSo the Stomper rejected the fourth durian and purchased just the three Black Gold durians.\n\n\"I paid $110, which was reasonable at $15 a kilo,\" he told Stomp.\n\n\"The straw that broke the camel's back was when I was walking away indignantly, a scrawny and heavily tattooed bespectacled young man pointed his finger to his wrist and told me it was time for me to go home and it was just 8pm.\"\n\n\"How rude can he be by ordering me to go home as if I were his son!\"\n\nThe Stomper posted about the incident in the\n\nComplaint Singapore\n\nFacebook group.\n\nTop Durian Station saw the post and shared its side of the story on its\n\nFacebook page\n\n:\n\n\"The said customer, Mr Robert Yeo, came to our store looking to purchase three Black Golds,\" recounted the stall in its Facebook post.\n\n\"Our staff vaguely informed him that purchasing five Black Gold will entitle him to one free Black Gold. This is simply the way our in-store promotion runs, which is 'buy five Black Gold, get one free'. Regular patrons can vouch for us on this. And we do have prominent sign boards being put up in-store and via our Facebook page on such a promotion.\n\n\"A misunderstood communication by Mr Robert is likely to have occurred in this instance. We would like to emphasise here that at no point in time did we force Mr Robert to make his purchase.\n\n\"Mr Robert had earlier acknowledged that he would go ahead with the 'buy five, get one free' promotion, and our staff then went on to select and open the durians for him.\n\n\"When the fourth durian was opened, Mr Robert requested to have the four durians weighed first, and so we obliged. Upon seeing the four durians' weight on the weighing scale, Mr Robert found that the displayed weight was too much for his liking, and therefore, we took off one durian from the weighing scale.\n\n\"Mr Robert then asks us how come there was a fourth durian being weighed, and that it should be free as agreed.\n\n\"Our staff explained to him nicely about our promotion, which is 'buy five, get one free', and not 'buy three, get one free' as he had proclaimed. There could be a communication error earlier on with regard to the promotional freebie.\n\n\"In fact, we informed Mr Robert that he has the right to refuse the purchase and that he can void his purchase on-site. However, Mr Robert then decided to go ahead with his purchase of three Black Golds and left our store rather unhappily.\"\n\nIndeed, Robert was unhappy enough that he went back to the stall the next day.\n\nWhy?\n\n\"To tell the durian sellers of the stall not to use such underhanded methods to increase the sale of their durian,\" said the Stomper.\n\n\"Guess what? They surrounded me and pushed me around, especially another young man with a ponytail who claimed that his courage was greater than mine and kept shouting as loud as he could into my left ear as he was a head taller than me. He even challenged me to a fight. Luckily, an old man sternly told them to stop the ruckus and let me go.\n\n\"I believe they are Malaysians hired by a Singaporean. This stall is definitely what we call in Chinese a 'black shop'. Beware, everyone, of this stall and the underhand methods that the sellers of the durian in this stall use.\n\n\"They are unscrupulous and are cowards, especially, the one who offered me a free musang king durian and later didn't even dare to utter a word to refute me. I really feel sorry for him. He has to carry this shame with him for a long, long time. The boss even has the temerity to make a police report against me.\"\n\nIndeed, in its Facebook post, Top Durian Station said it had made a police report about the incident.\n\nAsked whether he made a police report himself, Robert told Stomp: \"I couldn't care less about making a report because they didn't hurt me physically, but they abused me verbally as one of them said he would have sex with my deceased mum.\"\n\nHere is the stall's side of the story: \"After heading home, it seems that Mr Robert wasn't satisfied with his purchases, 'felt cheated', and came back to our store on two separate occasions, hurling his loud voice towards our staff. Mr Robert did that while standing in close proximity to our staff's ears, and this went on despite our staff trying to explain things nicely to him.\"\n\nTop Durian Station claimed the Stomper said: \"Malaysians are a totally dishonest lot, and they should all go back to Malaysia rather than to work in Singapore if they are unable to fulfill their duties well.\"\n\nThe stall continued in the Facebook post: \"On the second occasion, Mr Robert came back to our store to create another verbal ruckus, allowing his emotions to get better of him. At that point in time, Mr Robert was totally emotionally unstable, and the verbal attack went on for a good five to eight minutes, to the extent of Mr Robert's saliva being felt on our staff's face.\n\n\"Our staff tried hard just to ignore him after Mr Robert refused any form of explanation. However, Mr Robert kept harping on, and continued with his verbal hurling.\n\n\"Our staff then got quite irritated, as he wasn't able to concentrate on store front operations. As a result, an altercation ensued, with some other staff members also trying to reason out with Mr Robert.\n\n\"This explains Mr Robert's statement of 'being surrounded and getting intimidated'. It is also vital to point out that we did not push Mr Robert. One of our staff was trying to pull both sides aside upon concerns of the matter escalating into a bodily scuffle. We have the CCTV footage to prove this.\n\n\"Mr Robert had also openly challenged our staff to land a strike on him, whereby our staff maintained his composure and remained calm. We decided against posting the CCTV evidence, as this will make the entire situation more awkward for Mr Robert. We respect Mr Robert as our patron, and we just wanted this matter to be addressed well, and move on with our business flow.\"\n\nTop Durian Station has since shared CCTV footage with\n\n8World News\n\n. Unfortunately, the CCTV did not record any sound.\n\n\"Gosh! I think he is hoping for a final showdown with me to see who will emerge vindicated,\" Robert told Stomp.\n\n\"What a tenacious adversary. Well, he has his durian business to think of. He is so afraid that his already tarnished image gets tarnished further.\"\n\nIn response to a Stomp query, Top Durian Station shared a link to the\n\n8World News\n\narticle.\n\nOng Su Mann\n\ndurian\n\ndispute\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 12, 2025, 04:20am\n\nMeet the new king of the hill: How weather and hype are shaping the future of durians\n\nJul 4, 2025, 02:40am\n\nMalaysia food better than Singapore's, says US traveller\n\nJul 2, 2025, 06:09am\n\nDurians from just $2 as season hits full swing, crowds snap them up\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:19pm\n\n'Tupai King' set to claim the crown in the world of premium durian\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nGet the right WiFi routers for the best connection with StarHub\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c0546f1f5d0cec3645d3c365289567e045380d822af51d720941ef7821afad6b/durian.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO: STOMP"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e7ac052d6dbb8f1d9448e171bfd56e59ed3af14c6a7eb95fa06a78a58dce4661/TNPKV38.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8ca41d705c3065959b8ab64f36578442bbe5a24b6352fdbf9ec1a22759f44f82/61960215_682811075510265_2354886854219661312_n_1.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9c18ea9de6c8f2c5ca86ad645df0df35843594e5fbc9c426110839f8ba769795/clfarmd5d2c853Attachment.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Meet the new king of the hill: How weather and hype are shaping the future of durians", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

She also heads the NanoBio Lab at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.\n\nThe company said the price of the ART kit will be competitive, and it is in talks with a retailer.\n\nOther local ART kit manufacturers such as Camtech Diagnostics and SG Diagnostics have not been able to get HSA approval for retail sale.\n\nCellbae chief executive Muhammad Tani Tabiin said: \"Our next products are RT-PCR assays for poultry tests and rapid test kits for food pathogens and meat speciation, which are very important for food safety and security.\n\n\"We are also working on rapid test kits for various infectious diseases as well as diabetes.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it is developing rapid test kits for avian influenza, mycoplasma gallisepticum, mycoplasma synoviae, and salmonella enteritidis, which are important diseases in poultry production and food safety.\n\nCellbae is also developing rapid test kits for E. coli strain O157:H7 and Salmonella enteritidis which are more sensitive than currently available test kits and faster than RT-PCR assays.\n\nIn addition, the company is creating glucose tests for the community screening of diabetes. The simple and affordable rapid test kits, which do not require fasting, will enable early diagnosis of diabetes at scale.\n\nAlso in the works are rapid test kits to detect mosquito-borne diseases dengue, chikungunya and zika, as well as sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nShermaine Ang\n\ncovid-19\n\nHEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5fd6e997dd3954ee0e44252bfe2695cd249fad742e44ed9688aa34ba09b3c3bb/cellbae_0.png?w=965", "alt_text": "(From left) Dr Nadjad Abdul Rahim, Dr Soh Jun Hui, and Cellbae co-founders Prof Jackie Ying and Ms Noreena AbuBakar.", "caption": "(From left) Dr Nadjad Abdul Rahim, Dr Soh Jun Hui, and Cellbae co-founders Prof Jackie Ying and Ms Noreena AbuBakar.

It's just human nature, right? You will have gossip, that's the way it is,\" said the star of the four-movie Ip Man martial arts franchise (2008 to 2019) and who has appeared in Hollywood films such as Mulan (2020) and the Star Wars film Rogue One (2016).\n\nIn Sakra, Qiao Feng (Yen) becomes a pariah after he is accused of being a Khitan, a people with whom the Han Chinese of the Song empire had been at war for generations.\n\nAfter being falsely accused of murder, Qiao Feng has to not only find the real perpetrators, but also return to the places of his youth to find the truth about his ancestry.\n\nIn Sakra, Qiao Feng (Yen) becomes a pariah after he is accused of being a Khitan, a people with whom the Han Chinese of the Song empire had been at war for generations. PHOTO: GOLDEN VILLAGE\n\nYen is known for including social themes in his movies. His Ip Man films, for example, touch on\n\nanti-Asian racism in the West.\n\nAt the conference, he spoke about how Hollywood has been influenced by Asian cinema.\n\n\"Hollywood films have not only been influenced by our films, some of them are shot-by-shot copies,\" he said.\n\nWhile he did not give specifics, others have pointed out that film-makers such as Christopher Nolan (science-fiction film Inception, 2010) and Darren Aronofsky (the drama Black Swan, 2010) are influenced by\n\nJapanese anime. Also, films such as the Matrix series (1999 to 2021) and the John Wick franchise (2014 to 2019) borrow heavily from Hong Kong martial arts classics.\n\nDonnie Yen plays Qiao Feng in Sakra. PHOTO: GOLDEN VILLAGE\n\nYen is\n\nset to appear in John Wick: Chapter Four\n\n, which opens on March 23.\n\n\"Everyone loves Hollywood movies. My kids and I watch Marvel and Disney movies. But do we sit back and look at our own culture and what we have to offer? Our own literature, our own material, is so rich with possibilities. As someone with a little bit of influence in this industry, I would like to continue to use that material as a way to raise the level of recognition in the world,\" he said.\n\nTales of fantasy as deep and rich as the ones found in Marvel comics are present in Chinese literature, such as the stories of Yong and other wuxia writers, he said.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nWith the right investment, the potential of these stories could be unlocked for a global audience, he said.\n\n\"We have so much content that we can explore. We just have to find a way to package it. What I've learnt working in Hollywood is that the way they make films is not different from how we do it here. The difference is money. How do we obtain it? That is the jackpot. We have to figure it out.\"\n\nSakra opens in cinemas on Monday.\n\nJohn Lui\n\nFilm Correspondent\n\nactors\n\nMovies\n\nmarina bay sands\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nJul 1, 2025, 07:13am\n\nChow Yun Fat returns to Star Awards after three decades\n\nJun 12, 2025, 07:53am\n\nActor Zhang Yaodong makes TikTok debut to express gratitude for support over being a stallholder\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSalary Insights in Singapore - Where Do You Stand?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c9514b8bfa7df0a897a3d2724cce472d57229bb0498f07a59506ed66f127460c/svdonnie130123_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Donnie Yen speaks at a press conference to promote his new film Sakra, at Marina Bay Sands Theatre, on Jan 12, 2023.", "caption": "Donnie Yen speaks at a press conference to promote his new film Sakra, at Marina Bay Sands Theatre, on Jan 12, 2023.

Her only son's suicide\n\nIn July 2020, Lisa Marie's only son Benjamin Keough, 27,\n\nwas found dead in California from what was later confirmed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nHis father was American musician Danny Keough, Lisa Marie's first husband from 1988 to 1994.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn August 2022, Presley opened up\n\nin an essay published in entertainment magazine People, in honour of National Grief Awareness Day\n\n, about how Benjamin's death \"completely detonated and destroyed\" her life.\n\n\"I've dealt with death, grief and loss since the age of nine. I've had more than anyone's fair share of it in my lifetime and somehow, I've made it this far. But this one, the death of my beautiful, beautiful son? No. Just no... No, no, no, no...\"\n\n2.

Her failed marriages\n\nLisa Marie Presley with pop legend Michael Jackson in Budapest in 1994.

The manipulation was a survival tactic for him,\" she reflected.\n\nHer August 2002 marriage to Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage was even more short-lived, with the latter filing for divorce less than four months later in November.\n\nHer fourth and most recent union, to American guitarist and music producer Michael Lockwood, lasted 15 years until their 2021 divorce. They share twin daughters Harper and Finley, both 14.\n\n4. Her addiction struggles\n\nLisa Marie's long battle with alcohol and drug abuse started in her adolescence.\n\nShe reportedly told American magazine Paper in 2003 that she used \"cocaine, sedatives, pot and drinking - all at the same time\" as a teenager, adding: \"I just couldn't be sober.\"\n\nIn 2019, she wrote a foreword to a book about opioid addiction in the United States, where she admitted to her addiction to opioids and painkillers.\n\nShe said: \"I'm not perfect. My father wasn't perfect, no one's perfect.

I have been waiting for this day for a long time,\" Ms Chu said from her Singapore home after packing her suitcase on Wednesday, the night before her flight.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:31am\n\nS'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe removal of inbound quarantine prompted a surge in demand for plane tickets in countries like Singapore, which have large communities of overseas Chinese.\n\nSingapore resident Chu paid S$2,264 for a one-way ticket to Shanghai, while a return journey used to cost her around S$600 before the pandemic.\n\nHowever, in the absence of a long quarantine, it was still a price she was willing to pay in order to spend with her family over the Chinese New Year holiday that starts on Jan 21.\n\nThe holiday is especially important to Chinese families, as it is often the only time of the year when relatives - distant and close - reunite and spend time with each other.\n\nHotel quarantine\n\nChina had imposed inbound quarantines on all arrivals from outside its borders since March 2020. The measure discouraged business travel into China and kept families separated for years, as it involved paying to stay inside a hotel room for two to three weeks.\n\nAnd even for those willing to endure the hotel quarantine, flights were often unavailable or overpriced as Beijing drastically cut the number of inbound flights in a bid to prevent imported Covid-19 cases.\n\n\"China remained closed off after Singapore reopened, so to go back, people needed to do PCR tests, undergo quarantine, and prices of flight tickets skyrocketed. There were too many obstacles,\" Ms Chu said.\n\nChina's\n\neasing over the past month of one of the world's tightest Covid-19 regimes\n\nfollowed historic protests against a policy that included frequent testing, curbs on movement and mass lockdowns that heavily damaged the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nMs Chu Wenhong poses for a selfie before boarding her flight to China ahead of Chinese New Year, her first time going home since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nMs Chu said she had missed her parents, her 83-year-old father and 78-year-old mother, and worried about their failing health.\n\nHer biggest wish was to spend as much time with them as possible when she goes back this time.\n\n\"I haven't seen them for three years, and they both got Covid, and are quite old. I feel quite lucky actually, as it wasn't too serious for them, but their health is not very good. So I want to go home and see them as soon as possible,\" she said.\n\nMs Chu said she felt exhilarated to be home after landing at the Shanghai Pudong Airport on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm so happy because I've been looking forward to it for three whole years. I want to see my mother the most and take a good look at her,\" she said.\n\nHer mother, Ms Cao Yafang, was equally relieved after reuniting with her daughter.\n\n\"She is pretty much the same as in the video chat.

In all, 25 automotive brands are present.\n\nMaking their debuts are no fewer than three Volkswagen electric models as well as one from Skoda. Sweden's Polestar is participating for the first time and Nissan is showcasing the Ariya electric crossover. And there is a multicolour Audi e-tron GT called Electric Dreams.\n\nBeyond the electric offerings, visitors can check out the last pure combustion-engined cars in town, including the Lotus Emira and Subaru Impreza WRX.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 08:49am\n\nCOE prices rise across the board\n\nMore related stories\n\nBe entertained by performances by British precision driver and three-time Guinness World Record Holder Russ Swift.\n\nHeading down to the show? Here is a list of cars you should not miss.\n\nSingapore Motorshow 2023\n\nWhere:\n\nSuntec City Convention & Exhibition Centre, Levels 3 and 4, 3 Temasek Boulevard\n\nWhen:\n\nTill Sunday, Friday, 11.30am to 9pm; Saturday and Sunday, 10.30am to 9pm\n\nAdmission:\n\n$8, free for children below 1.2m; tickets available at Suntec Singapore Concourse Level 3 or via Sistic (go to\n\nwww.sistic.com.sg\n\nor call 6348-5555)\n\nInfo:\n\nhttps://motorshow.com.sg/2023/\n\nBMW M3 Touring\n\nThe BMW M3 Competition Touring. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nCross a sports car with a station wagon and you might get something like the M3 Competition Touring.\n\nBMW's first 3-series steroidal wagon packs 510hp within an inline-six turbocharged engine which is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive ensures maximum traction, whether its 500-litre stowage is full or empty.\n\nBYD Seal and Dolphin\n\nThe BYD Dolphin. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nThere are worse things than to name cars after marine mammals. But in this case, the two BYD electric cars in question look delectable enough to carry it off.\n\nThe Dolphin is a small, tallish hatch which is reminiscent of the BMW i3 - chic, cute and compact.\n\nThe Seal, on the other hand, is a sizeable saloon meant to take on the Tesla Model 3. In its home country of China, the Seal is selling like hot cakes, which may or may not be indicative of how it will perform elsewhere. Check the car out and decide for yourself.\n\nCitroen e-C4\n\nThe Citroen e-C4. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nThe e-C4 is the first electric Citroen in town and also the first new Citroen to make it here in a while.\n\nIt shares the excellent platform of the Peugeot e-2008, so expect superb ride and handling. It has 97kW of power, which means it falls under Category A certificate of entitlement (COE). And with a fast charger, you can add 100km of range in just 10 minutes.\n\nOf course, the proof of the pudding is still in the eating, so stay tuned to this section for a review of this car.\n\nKia Niro EV\n\nThe Kia Niro EV. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nThe second-generation Kia Niro EV is here, just weeks after the Niro Hybrid was launched.\n\nThe battery-powered crossover offers more space and a slightly bigger battery than its predecessor. Its wheelbase has grown by 20mm to 2,720mm, which should mean more space.\n\nBut its performance remains unchanged, with a century sprint of 7.8 seconds. Consumption has risen slightly to 16.2kWh/100km, so its range should not be very different despite the bigger battery.\n\nBut crucially, the car qualifies for Category A COE, while its predecessor was a Category B car.\n\nLexus RZ\n\nThe Lexus RZ. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nLexus' first electric model, the UX300e, was a trial car which had neither range nor performance. But the new RZ promises to be a quantum leap.\n\nThe RZ450e is powered by two motors and an adaptive all-wheel-drive system. The front motor makes 150kW, while the rear produces 80kW - which means you can expect an adrenaline-pumping time at the helm. It is estimated to have a range of 360km, which is more than decent in Singapore's context.\n\nThe car looks good too.\n\nMercedes-AMG SL\n\nThe Mercedes-AMG SL55. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nClassic lovers will remember the seminal 300SL Gullwing, a car made in the 1950s which will still put many modern-day beauties in the shade. The latest descendent of this car is the Mercedes-AMG SL, which returns as a soft-top 2+2.\n\nThe SL55 has a twin-turbocharged 4-litre V8 making 476hp and 700Nm of torque. For the first time in an SL, power goes to all four wheels.\n\nThere will also be an SL43, powered by a 381hp/480Nm turbocharged 2-litre four-cylinder - the first for an SL. Its uniqueness extends to its electric turbocharger, which promises seamlessness in the way power pours out.\n\nMG 4\n\nThe MG 4. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nThe MG 4 is an electric rear-wheel-drive compact hatch with edgy crossover-like styling.\n\nIt has 150kW of power and 250Nm of torque, enabling it to reach 100kmh in 7.9 seconds. With a 64kWh battery and a relatively low kerb weight (under 1.7 tonnes), it promises a range of up to 450km.\n\nThis is a VW Golf-size car. Find out at the show if it is as roomy as the Golf.\n\nNissan Ariya\n\nThe Nissan Ariya. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nThe Nissan Leaf was the first modern-day mass-production electric car when it was launched in 2010. The Ariya is the second electric car from Nissan, promising more performance, space and range.\n\nThis model was launched in 2020, but may not reach showrooms here until early 2024, although Nissan agent Tan Chong Motor is trying to make it available for sale by the end of 2023.\n\nPeugeot 408\n\nThe Peugeot 408. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nThe new 408 is a compact fastback saloon which qualifies for Category A COE. It has a crossover-like front section, which makes it rather different from the elegant and bigger 508.\n\nFor those who are not ready for electric cars or not partial to sport utility vehicles, the 408 may be an interesting option.\n\nSkoda Enyaq Coupe iV\n\nThe Skoda Enyaq Coupe iV. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nThis icoupe variant of the Enyaq iV is Skoda's first electric model. It shares the same platform as the Volkswagen ID4. But being a Skoda, it offers more utility.\n\nWhat is less utilitarian, however, is its illuminated grille, which may not be approved for Singapore. So, the Singapore Motorshow may be the only place you can view this unique glowing grille.\n\nSubaru Solterra\n\nThe Subaru Solterra. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nSubaru's first electric model shares the same platform as the peachy Toyota bZ4X. It is a departure from Subaru cars to date, which are known for their grunt and gutsy performance.\n\nLike the Nissan Ariya, the Subaru Solterra is unlikely to be in showrooms any time soon. So, do not miss this preview.\n\nToyota GR86\n\nThe Toyota GR86. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nThose who love the sound and fury of fossil-fuel cars should not miss the new GR86.\n\nSharing a platform with the Subaru BRZ, the GR86 is powered by a four-cylinder Boxer engine paired with a six-speed manual gearbox. It packs 231hp and 250Nm of torque. The output may seem modest, but should be adequate in such a taut 2+2 package.\n\nThe car should be more affordable than the Supra and less daunting than the GR Yaris.\n\nVolkswagen ID Buzz\n\nThe Volkswagen ID Buzz. ST PHOTO: ONG WEE JIN\n\nThis electric minivan may well be the coolest car at the show. Just look at its smiley face.\n\nIt is also the first electric car here to have sliding doors. Currently available with five seats and an enormous cargo area, the ID Buzz is ideal for road trips. It has more than 400km of range and the rear seats can be collapsed flat against its raised boot platform to form a surface area large enough for a bed.\n\nOpt for a version with a panoramic glass roof and you can literally sleep under the stars.\n\nFollow Christopher Tan on Instagram @chris.motoring\n\nCars\n\nELECTRIC AND HYBRID VEHICLES\n\nBMW\n\nmercedes\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025, 05:22am\n\nCar services company admits to posting fake reviews on sgCarMart\n\nJul 1, 2025, 12:26am\n\nMalaysia's VEP enforcement kicks in with 10 Singapore drivers fined in first hour\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:28pm\n\nGround sensors on roadside parking spaces could make payments automatic under new URA pilot project\n\nJun 10, 2025, 11:59pm\n\nIssues reported in 5,400 out of 300k cars with ERP on-board unit installed\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The food and table setup alone cost NT$30 million, she added.\n\nAs it is difficult to find a venue that could accommodate so many people at once, the company decided to set up the banquet on an empty plot of land, she said, noting that preparations for the event began last September.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 11, 2025, 10:35pm\n\nSingaporean woman given six months' jail in Taiwan for stalking singer, threatening her online\n\nMore related stories\n\nWhile most of the 26,000 attendees were the company's employees and sales representatives, including those who flew in from branch offices including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan, other business partners and guests were also involved, local media reports said.\n\nThe dinner, themed \"No Hold Back\", was held to celebrate the company's 15th anniversary. It was also the company's\n\nweiya\n\n, an annual dinner banquet typically held by companies in Taiwan ahead of Chinese New Year to thank workers for their hard work.\n\nWeiyas are often a company's biggest staff event of the year, but even then, Riway's banquet stood out for its massive scale.\n\n\"Riway leaders from all over the world gathered to celebrate this meaningful day… This spectacular scene is definitely the best motivation to start a new year,\" the company wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nAccording to its website, Riway's flagship product is a type of capsule made using deer placenta, which is consumed as an anti-ageing supplement.\n\nIn 2021, the Ang Mo Kio-headquartered company was fined S$3,000 by Singapore's Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for making false and misleading claims that the product prevents, alleviates or cures diseases and medical conditions such as cancer and diabetes.\n\nHSA advised members of the public to be wary of such claims, and said that the product is not meant for treating or managing medical conditions.\n\nThis comes after the authority in 2019 directed the company to\n\neducate its sellers to ensure they do not make false claims\n\nabout the product.\n\nMusic acts including Taiwanese rockers Power Station and singer-songwriter Ricky Hsiao (pictured) were also part of the performance line-up.  PHOTO: RIWAY INTERNATIONAL / FACEBOOK\n\nYip Wai Yee\n\nTaiwan Correspondent\n\ntaiwan\n\nWORKING LIFE\n\nculture\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 11:50pm\n\nActor Wong He says he was drugged and sexually assaulted twice in 2024 at his friends' homes\n\nMay 12, 2025, 12:42am\n\nLoh Kean Yew beats Chou Tien-chen to win Taipei Open crown\n\nApr 15, 2025, 10:17am\n\nSingaporean woman nabbed in Taiwan for alleged scam, money laundering offences\n\nMar 6, 2025, 10:10am\n\nBarbie Hsu's final resting place might be next to Teresa Teng's\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/97663af110b339323ab9aa187bf716dc1a8d40bef4f2f07cb9bbc1f7b4b3e741/riway20dinner_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The event included fireworks and stage performances by Wakin Chau, Power Station and Ricky Hsiao.", "caption": "The event included fireworks and stage performances by Wakin Chau, Power Station and Ricky Hsiao.

One of the men was seen to be bleeding from his knee.\n\nTwo of the men - aged 31 and 41 - are being investigated by HSA, said the police.\n\nAn owner of a business nearby who declined to be named told The Straits Times that he has observed police raids targeting illegal sexual enhancement drug peddlers in the area before, and said the selling of the contraband within the vicinity had affected his business.\n\nFollowing the raid, Assistant Commissioner of Police Justin Wong, the commander of Bedok Police Division, said the police, HSA and ICA work closely together as part of an inter-agency work group to tackle illegal activities in Geylang.\n\nHe said: \"Frequent joint patrols and enforcement operations are conducted on an ongoing basis. Today's operation is the first inter-agency operation to be conducted in the new year. Those found engaging in unlawful activities will be dealt with sternly.\"\n\nCash and handphones siezed during the anti-gambling enforcement.

One of them - a 24-year-old man - was also arrested for the offence of carrying a scheduled weapon in public, while another 24-year-old man was also arrested for the offence of carrying an offensive weapon in public.\n\nA push dagger, a knuckle duster and a knife were seized as case exhibits, according to the police.\n\n(Clockwise from top left) The knuckle duster, kife and push dagger seized as case exhibits.

After all, in the closing stages, he managed to put nine-time winner King Arthur to the sword.\n\nThe margin was just a shorthead, but the manner in which the son of Star Turn finished the job was top notch.\n\nHardly pushed in the early stages, Golden Monkey clocked 59.29sec for the Polytrack 1,000m. It was the fastest time of the morning.\n\nFitzsimmons would have been pleased with that showing - and the preparations will continue.\n\nAt his last outing on Singapore Gold Cup Day on Nov 19, Golden Monkey ran second to Lim's Kosciuszko in a $100,000 sprint on the undercard.\n\nWhile a win would have sent his connections dizzy with joy, taking second behind that other great horse was surely something to savour.\n\nNo doubt, Golden Monkey's campaign has already been mapped out.\n\nWatch for him when he opens his 2023 season - and beyond.\n\nAs it looks right now, the sky is the limit and Nunes, who has yet to partner him in a race, may want to now claim that saddle.\n\nWith rides in five of the six trials, Nunes was a busy man.\n\nHe was second on three and was most impressive when steering Flying Nemo home in the last.\n\nA smashing winner over the Poly 1,000m on debut last October, when beating Italian Revolution by two lengths in 59.31, Flying Nemo has been getting better.\n\nIt all came to light on Thursday. A tad slow from the chute, he was quickly into his stride.\n\nMaking the turn for that run home, we saw the familiar blue-and-white silks, which Nunes dons for the trials, come into the picture.\n\nAt that stage, Flying Nemo was still lengths behind the leader Lonhro Gold (Wong Chin Chuen), Cizen Lucky (Benny Woodworth) and Shihab (Ibrahim Mamat). But he was closing in fast.\n\nHitting his stride when clicked into action by the Brazilian, Flying Nemo quickly disposed of Cizen Lucky and Shihab.\n\nBut, by then, Lonhro Gold was home and hosed.\n\nThe eight-year-old veteran, who plies his trade in Class 5, clocked 1min 0.33sec, with Flying Nemo coming in just 0.2sec slower.\n\nPrepared by Desmond Koh, Flying Nemo certainly looks the real deal.\n\nWith natural progression, this three-year-old could enjoy a sterling second season.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

So apt.\n\nWhen stars are aligned, it is a good omen. Something good is likely to happen.\n\nThat could be the fortune of the Falcon Racing No. 7 Stable-owned promising three-year-old New Zealand-bred with the first calendar-month moniker.\n\nTrained by 2022 runner-up Donna Logan, January is a youngster on the rise and looks destined for better things.\n\nThe handsome son of Swiss Ace and Musically has yet to finish further than third in four Kranji starts, winning his last two in fine fashion.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe bay gelding looks the logical best bet in Saturday's $50,000 Class 4 Division 2 event over the Polytrack 1,100m in Race 8.\n\nHaving pride of place as the topweight with the No. 1 saddlecloth, he looks the standout against beatable rivals.\n\nExcept for the Young Keah Yong-trained Bionics, who is a last-start winner, the rest have not made the frame in their last start.\n\nThe only concern is January's ability to handle the Polytrack, as all his four runs were on turf.\n\nThe 1,100m may also seem a tad short - both his successes were over 1,400m - but he should be fresh for the task.\n\nHis last race was on Nov 19, when he led all the way for an easy 1¼-length victory on a yielding track in a Novice event.\n\nBut he has had plenty of conditioning work during the December racing break.\n\nHe looks fit on the training track and would be fitter after the comeback run on Saturday.\n\n\"He's ready to run a good race but, of course, he's going to take a world of improvement from this race,\" said Logan.\n\n\"This is his first time on the Poly and looking for 1,400m. But he hasn't been out of the money in four starts and is a very progressive type.\"\n\nWith jockey Simon Kok, who rode January to score the double, sidelined through injury, January's connections have found the perfect replacement in four-time Singapore champion Manoel Nunes.\n\nFrom a handy Gate 3, the hotshot Brazilian should secure a nice position or even lead.\n\nIt will be a surprise if his mount gets beaten.\n\nNunes started the 2023 season last Saturday with a bang by winnng the first race on Mister Dynamo and doubled up with newcomer Cosmic Dancer.\n\nHe is in for a grand harvest on Day 2 with his book of 10 winnable rides.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

K. Rai and Mr Anil Balchandani, contended that as a result of Mr Salvin's death, they both suffered from persistent complex bereavement disorder and could no longer work.\n\nThus, Madam Tan, who left her job as a school counsellor in 2019, and Mr Steven, who left his job in the civil service in 2020, suffered a reduction in income.\n\nThe suit was heard in the High Court on Thursday. The trial has been adjourned to September.\n\nDr Lee, who practises at The Psychological Wellness Centre, treated Mr Salvin between November 2011 and July 2016. He diagnosed Mr Salvin with bipolar disorder and ADHD, and prescribed Concerta from April 2012.\n\nMr Steven and Madam Tan said their son developed a dependence on the drug, but Dr Lee continued to prescribe Concerta and did not advise Mr Salvin against taking more than the prescribed dose.\n\nThey said Mr Salvin began showing symptoms of psychosis, such as hearing voices or believing that people were plotting against him.\n\nIn May 2015, after being charged with the assault of two police officers, Mr Salvin was remanded at IMH and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nHe was returned to Dr Lee's care in June 2015. Mr Steven and Madam Tan alleged that, in spite of being provided with the diagnosis, Dr Lee continued to prescribe Concerta to Mr Salvin and did nothing to prevent him from overdosing.\n\nDr Kandasami took over Mr Salvin's care in August 2016, after he was sentenced to a one-year mandatory treatment order for the assault.\n\nThe couple alleged that Dr Kandasami did nothing to prevent Mr Salvin from overdosing on Concerta and ignored his psychotic symptoms.\n\nDr Lee, who is represented by Mr Jansen Aw, said his diagnosis of ADHD and bipolar disorder was reasonable in light of the symptoms and medical history.\n\nThere was a lack of overt and persistent psychotic symptoms supporting a diagnosis of schizophrenia, he said.\n\nDr Lee said Mr Salvin showed improvements when he was on Concerta and, for the first time in many years, managed to get a job in a warehouse in July 2015.\n\nIMH, which is represented by Senior Counsel Kuah Boon Theng, said Dr Kandasami's care and treatment of Mr Salvin was appropriate.\n\nMr Salvin's response to medication was closely monitored during his mandatory treatment, and he did not show signs of psychosis, it said.\n\nIMH said there were no red flags of imminent risk of suicide on Sept 6, 2017.\n\nIt disagreed with the couple's assertion that Mr Salvin's death was caused by psychosis, noting that the coroner had found his fall to be a \"deliberate act of suicide\".\n\n\"The plaintiffs are understandably devastated, and IMH empathises with them for their loss. However, the deceased's unfortunate demise was not the result of any negligence on the part of IMH and its doctors or staff,\" said Ms Kuah in her opening statement.\n\nHELPLINE SERVICES\n\nFor mental well-being:\n\n- Care Corner Counselling Centre (for Mandarin speakers) (1800-3535-800)\n\n- Fei Yue's Online Counselling Service (eC2.sg)\n\n- Viriya Therapy Centre (6256-1311)\n\nFor marital and parenting issues:\n\n- Community Psychology Hub's Online Counselling Platform (CPHOnlineCounselling.sg)\n\nGeneral helpline services:\n\n- Hear4U (WhatsApp 6978-2728)\n\n- Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline (6389-2222) (24-hour)\n\n- Sage Counselling Centre - The Seniors Helpline (1800-555-5555)\n\n- Samaritans of Singapore (Hotline: 1-767; CareText: WhatsApp 9151-1767) (24-hour)\n\n- Singapore Association for Mental Health Helpline (1800-283-7019)\n\n- Silver Ribbon Singapore (6386-1928)\n\n- Tinkle Friend (7-12 years) (1800-2744-788)\n\nFor reporting of violence or abuse:\n\n- National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline (1800-777-0000) (24-hour)\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nPsychiatrists\n\nlawsuit\n\nIMH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 30, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nDepression cannot be 'willed away'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It wasn't at the start of the season, but now he is in the right moment,\" he said.\n\nPundits have also been impressed. Former United captain Roy Keane, who is normally critical in his assessment of players, believes that Rashford - who also scored three goals at the World Cup - can be the Red Devils' most important player now.\n\n\"This is what I expect from him now. I'm not surprised by what I've seen from him. I think he's now becoming one of the main players for United,\" he said recently.\n\n\"Can he get them back competing for trophies? He's taking responsibility. I kind of expect (good performances) from Marcus every week. When he gets full-backs in one v ones, he's going to go by you.\"\n\nRashford's turnaround in form is no coincidence and two major factors have contributed to his renaissance -\n\nthe departure of hero-turned-villain Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nand the appointment of ten Hag.\n\nRonaldo's arrival in 2021 was seen as a vanity signing as United were not a team who were struggling to score while Rashford was also on the rise having completed a second straight season with 20-plus goals.\n\nBut even as Ronaldo added to his burgeoning goals tally with 24 strikes, the rest of the team suffered as United struggled to their worst-ever Premier League points total of 58 last season.\n\nEnter ten Hag, who laid down the law very early on and benched the ageing Ronaldo and changed their style of play to get the best out of all players on the pitch.\n\nRonaldo was left seething but United slowly began winning games again and the Portugal forward's acrimonious exit lifted a pall that had hung over the club ever since they missed out on Champions League qualification.\n\nDisciplinary issues marked the end for Ronaldo, who left games early after being upset at being benched, but Rashford has graciously accepted punishment and come out the better for it.\n\nThe England forward was left out of the starting line-up against Wolverhampton Wanderers in December after missing a team meeting but, instead of sulking, he came off the bench and scored the winner in a 1-0 win.\n\n\"We draw a line under it and move on, I was a little bit late for a meeting. I overslept but it can happen,\" Rashford said then.\n\n\"Obviously it's team rules, I made a mistake... but I understand the decision.\"\n\nSince losing 6-3 to Manchester City in October, United have won 15 of their 18 games, losing only once.\n\nWith games coming thick and fast, their eight-match winning streak will be put to the test when City visit Old Trafford on Saturday.\n\nAlarm bells rang when City signed Erling Haaland, who has more than proved his worth with 27 goals in 22 games while United failed to land a striker in the market.\n\nBut in Rashford, ten Hag has a determined and dependable forward as United look to consolidate a top-four spot and return to the Champions League. - REUTERS\n\nepl\n\nManchester United\n\nmanchester city\n\nerik ten hag\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The victim is the man's ex-wife. The girl is their child. The couple finalised their divorce in 2017 and in 2018, the man married again.\n\nThe girl had a close relationship with her stepmother.\n\nThe two women, however, had a highly acrimonious relationship as the girl's birth mother blamed the stepmother for the breakdown of her marriage.\n\n\"The victim occasionally sent insulting text messages to the accused and posted comments of a similar nature targeting the accused on Facebook. Consequently, the accused became increasingly stressed and angry with the victim,\" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Kwang Jia Min.\n\nOn Jan 4, 2020, the stepmother asked the girl how she would address her in the victim's presence. When the girl said she would call her \"jie jie\", which means sister in Mandarin, she was upset as she believed she treated the girl like her daughter.\n\nShe then threw a tantrum and told the girl not to speak to her any more as the girl did not love her. The girl became distressed at this and asked how she could make it up to her stepmother, said the DPP.\n\nAt the time, the stepmother had in her possession some tablets which she had bought from a pharmacy in Vietnam as she previously experienced pain and had trouble sleeping after undergoing surgery in 2019.\n\nAs she was angry at what the girl had said and at what the victim had said about her, she came up with the idea to get the girl to spike the victim's drink with one of the tablets, which were found to contain bromazepam, a poison.\n\nDPP Kwang said the consumption of bromazepam can lead to impaired memory, impaired visual information processing and sensory data, and impaired psychomotor performance, among other things.\n\n\"While bromazepam is not known to cause death, there are a host of adverse reactions in the usual therapeutic doses,\" she added.\n\nA few days after she thought of it, the stepmother crushed a tablet and put it in a plastic packet before instructing the girl to spike the victim's drink at an opportune time.\n\nShe also suggested that the girl could kill her own mother once she fell unconscious by either turning her to lay face-down so she would not be able to breathe, or by suffocating her with a pillow.\n\nThat same month, the victim found the packet of powder in the girl's bag. When she questioned her daughter, she denied knowing what the powder was.\n\nOn Jan 25, 2020, at around 5am, the girl woke up and told her mother that she was thirsty.\n\nThe victim poured a cup of water for her daughter, who then put some of the powder into the cup and asked her mother to drink it.\n\nWhen the victim saw some foam in the spiked water, she emptied it, thinking that the girl might have spat in the cup. The girl then prepared another cup of water, poured more of the powder into it and asked her mother to drink it.\n\nThe victim became suspicious when she saw a thin layer of powder at the bottom of the cup. She did not drink it as she realised the powder in the cup came from the packet of powdered substance she saw in her daughter's bag.\n\nWhen the victim confronted her daughter about it, she admitted that her stepmother had instigated her to spike her drink. The victim then called the police.\n\nBefore meting out the sentence, District Judge Lim Wee Ming said the woman's instigation of the child to commit this offence against her own mother is aggravating.\n\n\"The accused was such a strong influence over the child that the child made not one, but two attempts to poison the victim by spiking her water,\" he added.\n\nThe woman asked for her sentence to be deferred to Jan 26 as she needs time to finalise caregiving arrangements for her own child and to spend time with her family during Chinese New Year.\n\nThose convicted of causing hurt by means of poison may be jailed for up to 10 years, fined, or caned.\n\nNadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nPOISONING\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

We couldn't buy things as simple as bread from BreadTalk… when we moved to Singapore… Your comment spoke volumes on how ignorant you seem because of your wealth,\" said the eldest of four siblings, who is being home-schooled.\n\nView post on TikTok\n\nCharles & Keith reached out to Zoe after seeing her TikTok clip.\n\nThe company's spokesman told ST in an e-mail: \"Our hearts really went out to Zoe, but we were so impressed with (how gracefully) she handled the situation, displaying wisdom far beyond her years and values that resonated with us greatly.\n\n\"Our founders believe that our products should spark joy, empower fashion lovers and give them confidence, something we believe she presented so eloquently in her video and for which we are so grateful.\"\n\nCharles & Keith was founded by siblings Charles and Keith Wong in 1996, who learnt the ropes by working at their mother's shoe store in Ang Mo Kio.\n\nCharles & Keith was founded by brothers Charles and Keith Wong in 1996.

One netizen commented that it is not branded and 'high street at most'. But Topshop was already beyond what I could afford.\"\n\nShe added: \"This incident highlights the blind spot of people who grew up with privilege and take it for granted. They can't imagine what it is like for peers to grow up in a low-to-middle income background.\n\n\"However, it is also heartening to witness those who have called out the ignorance of people who shamed this teenager. They show awareness of the inequalities that exist and do their part to level the playing field.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCharles & Keith invites viral ‘luxury bag’ TikTok teen to meet its founders, tour brand’s headquarters\n\nThe rise and rise of Charles & Keith: From humble shoe store to S'pore's most successful fashion export\n\nTIKTOK\n\nShopping\n\nLUXURY BRANDS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 30, 2025, 01:52am\n\nBoy, 10, loses pocket money watching Pokémon on TikTok\n\nJun 27, 2025, 02:42am\n\nElderly man loses $55,000 in TikTok 'store' scam after being lured by 'beauty'\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:04am\n\nWoman called 'embarrassing' for using CDC vouchers on date, sparks online debate\n\nJun 17, 2025, 07:29am\n\n'For which country?': TikTok video of National Day roadblock sparks debate about who really calls Singapore home\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/866298ed7d1de3da6503bfd1a1b810399e60c4b1a073084caed675b6a955768b/hzcharles120122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Charles & Keith invited Zoe Gabriel (in white) and her father to have lunch with its founders and tour the brand's headquarters.", "caption": "Charles & Keith invited Zoe Gabriel (in white) and her father to have lunch with its founders and tour the brand's headquarters.

To get one, one must be at least 18 years old and produce their vaccination record to be advised of eligibility.\n\nA Raffles Medical spokesman said last week: \"We expect a steady increase as Chinese Nationals begin their overseas travelling again. Some possible push factors include the need to maintain their fully-vaccinated status depending on the countries that they are travelling to, and to stay protected against Covid-19.\"\n\nParkway Shenton's medical director Dr Edwin Chng attributed the interest in the vaccine from Chinese travellers to the lack of access to non-mRNA vaccines in their home country.\n\nHe said: \"They want to get better protection with mRNA vaccines.\"\n\nmRNA vaccines, like the ones manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna most Singaporeans have received, are not readily available in mainland China, which has mostly administered its home-grown Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines.\n\nThese use the traditional inactivated virus technology and are generally understood to be less effective than mRNA vaccines.\n\nInactivated vaccines - an older technology used in the polio and influenza vaccines, among others - are made up of dead viruses, unlike mRNA vaccines, which use just parts of the virus' genetic material to stimulate an immune response.\n\nStudies here and abroad have found that mRNA vaccines stimulate a stronger immune response to the Covid-19 virus than inactivated vaccines, though inactivated vaccines have been shown to prevent severe disease.\n\nChina is currently in the grip of a surge of Covid-19 cases, brought on in part by the relaxation of tight restrictions.\n\nInfectious diseases specialist Dr Leong Hoe Nam told The Straits Times on Thursday that Singapore and its low Covid-19 death rate are viewed by many as reputable, which may be an important factor for many Chinese deciding to come here for the vaccine.\n\nHe said: \"They may also trust in Singapore's healthcare system, with its high level of transparency, and Singapore is a tourist destination, so they may also want to kill two birds with one stone.\"\n\nNg Wei Kai\n\ncovid-19\n\nChina\n\nVACCINES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

They are given a conditional place, and will need to meet a minimum O-level grade to secure entry.\n\nJamie got into the NP Common Media Programme, and will need a combined O-level score of 26 for one language subject, two relevant subjects and her two best remaining subjects to get in.\n\nJamie's health issues began in July 2021 but she thought nothing of it at first. When it started to return frequently and affect her concentration, she grew concerned.\n\nShe said: \"Sometimes it's throbbing, other times it's splitting and it becomes impossible for me to study or do anything for long hours. The pain travels around my head and it's hard to pinpoint.\"\n\nHer headaches also affected her hobbies and her role as chairman of the school's modern dance troupe.\n\nShe said: \"I enjoy reading, mostly romance and murder mysteries. I also write songs and play instruments as well as dance... The headaches made it difficult to do all these things for any extended period of time,\" she said.\n\nDespite trips to various specialists, Jamie and her parents - who work in financial services and engineering - are still not entirely sure what is causing them, or what condition she has, as she has received a few diagnoses such as a rare syndrome known as New Daily Persistent Headaches.\n\n\"It's definitely frustrating not knowing what is causing the pain, which I am still coping with, but my family, friends and teachers are really supportive especially when I was taking the O levels in 2022,\" said Jamie who has an older brother who is in National Service.\n\nHer social studies teacher, Ms Ellie Soh, was particularly caring and helpful, she added.\n\n\"Ms Soh really looked out for me, she took the time to coach me one on one after I missed almost a month of school because I was in the hospital. She also talked about her own struggles with a similar problem which made me feel less like I was alone.\"\n\nShe said: \"I have always been excited by behind-the-scenes footage in films and the media industry is so interesting and so wide. I really want to go and see what's out there.\"\n\nNg Wei Kai\n\nSINGAPORE EDUCATION\n\nSecondary School\n\nO Levels\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 2, 2025, 11:52pm\n\nTuition centres say they do not use unethical, fear-mongering tactics in ads\n\nJan 1, 2025, 10:27pm\n\nQuality of teachers more important than size of classes\n\nDec 18, 2024, 10:29pm\n\nNational kayaker Yeo Min aces IB exam\n\nDec 18, 2024, 08:31am\n\nS'pore remains above global average in IB exam results\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0ab94f6ffd800b19d036de49ea6efe67509d7bdcb645fead754fa4dca1fa1099/202301121006612545e2d45d6-9dac-442e-be72-7bf67aaed398_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Former Beatty Secondary School student Jamie Wong has suffered from frequent migraines since she was in Secondary 3.", "caption": "Former Beatty Secondary School student Jamie Wong has suffered from frequent migraines since she was in Secondary 3.

He had also pleaded guilty to two theft-related charges, one count of cheating and one count of driving without a licence.\n\nHe cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity.\n\nReformative training involves detention in a centre with a strict regimen that can include foot drills and counselling.\n\nIt is a rehabilitative sentencing option for young offenders aged under 21 who are found to be unsuitable for probation.\n\nOn Sept 21, 2021, the 14-year-old girl, a secondary school student, met the accused at a mutual friend's flat. There were five people present in the flat, including the victim and the accused.\n\nThe accused mixed an alcoholic drink for the victim, who drank it and began feeling tipsy and unwell. She vomited in the toilet, dirtying her clothes in the process, and lay on the floor.\n\nSeeing that the victim had vomited on her clothes, the accused proceeded to remove her pants. She thought he was trying to help her clean up and did not object.\n\nThe accused then removed her underwear and performed a sexual act on her. He stopped only when she asked him twice to do so. She continued lying on the toilet floor as she still felt unwell.\n\nThe group later left the flat and, because the victim was still unconscious, the accused and their friend attempted to carry her down the stairs. When the friend dropped the victim, the accused dragged her halfway down the stairs by her arms before letting go. She then slid down the remainder of the flight of stairs.\n\nThe group found this funny and one of them took a video. The victim was subsequently taken home by her grandparents, after they had been contacted.\n\nAfter she regained consciousness the following day, she messaged the accused on Instagram asking him what had happened. He admitted that he had performed a sexual act and apologised for doing so.\n\nOn Nov 20, 2021, their mutual friend made several posts about the incident on Instagram. He uploaded the video of the girl sliding down the stairs and also stated that the accused had performed a sexual act on her.\n\nTwo days later, at their mutual friend's behest to make a public apology about what had happened in the flat, the accused joined an Instagram Live - a live stream where participants can comment and react.\n\nThe accused was questioned during the live stream, and he admitted to performing the sexual act.\n\nThe incident went viral and led to the public lodging police reports. The accused was arrested on Nov 23.\n\nSeparately, the accused stole bottles of alcohol from a Cold Storage supermarket outlet in Takashimaya in July 2021. He also stole bottles of alcohol from the Velocity outlet of the supermarket chain that same month.\n\nHe also rented a car using a GetGo car-sharing account that he purchased from a seller in September 2021. The following month, he drove the car to ferry his friends around, despite not holding a driving licence then.\n\nIf convicted of sexually penetrating a minor below 16 years of age, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years, fined, or both.\n\nBy\n\nNadine Chua\n\nRead articles by Nadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/772789e73bc689cf4419ccdaea8d4b8d168d79ed7ffdc1013aa8b020348dd0a5/molest.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "He communicated privately with the girl, helping her with her schoolwork and providing a listening ear for her non-school-related matters.", "caption": "He communicated privately with the girl, helping her with her schoolwork and providing a listening ear for her non-school-related matters.

His relatives and friends also began chasing him for repayment of their loans to him.\n\n\"The accused then hatched a plan to create a fake investment package to cheat others into giving him their money so that he could repay his loans.\"\n\nIn 2020, Farhan bumped into a 47-year-old friend, who was then working as an engineering technician, and spoke to the latter about a purported group investment scheme.\n\nThe friend told a colleague - a 64-year-old engineering supervisor - about Farhan, and the trio later met at a coffee shop.\n\nFarhan then lied to the two men that he was a trader. He also told them about the purported scheme and promised returns of 20 per cent.\n\nThe engineering technician later handed $25,000 to Farhan while the engineering supervisor transferred $104,000 to the scammer.\n\nDPP Lee told the court: \"The accused also deceived the victims into believing that there was a short-term scheme where (they) would be able to get the same benefits - capital protection and 20 per cent returns - for a three-month investment... Again, the accused was well aware that this was a fictitious scheme.\"\n\nAs a result, the engineering technician gave Farhan $10,000 and the engineering supervisor transferred to the conman $42,000 for this other purported scheme.\n\nWhen the pair later asked Farhan for their returns, he sent them fake screenshots, purportedly from banks, as a delaying tactic.\n\nThe police were alerted on May 11, 2022.\n\nBy using similar methods, Farhan also cheated a 62-year-old retiree of $71,000 in late 2021.\n\nThis third victim made a police report on Jan 11, 2022.\n\nFor each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncheating\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

NBC tore up its longstanding multi-year Globes broadcast deal, and only agreed to bring back this year's show on a one-off basis.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 9, 2024, 09:02am\n\nActor Mark Hamill has a Star Wars 'family reunion' at Golden Globes\n\nMore related stories\n\nStill, the 80th Golden Globes on Tuesday night\n\nsaw many A-list stars return to the event's Beverly Hills gala,\n\nwith\n\nSteven Spielberg winning best director,\n\nColin Farrell collecting best actor in a comedy, and Eddie Murphy receiving a lifetime achievement award.\n\nWhile the presence of so many stars suggested many in Hollywood are happy with the reforms the HFPA has recently enacted - including the admission of black members, after a Los Angeles Times expose revealed the group had none - questions remain.\n\nA plan by American billionaire Todd Boehly to spin off the awards show into a for-profit entity and pay salaries to members has raised eyebrows.\n\nAnd several prominent winners did not attend on Tuesday, citing scheduling difficulties, including Cate Blanchett, who best actress in a drama for Tar.\n\nIn an email to AFP, an NBC spokesman pointed out that the \"Globes historically airs on Sunday nights\", when ratings are usually higher, and in previous years benefited from following a National Football League game on the channel.\n\nThe awards were moved to a Tuesday evening slot this year to avoid clashing with the wildly popular American football league.\n\nUpdated final figures including ratings from streaming platform Peacock, which also showed the Globes live on Tuesday, will be issued at a later date.\n\nLive television ratings have slumped generally for awards show in recent years, as younger audiences in particular change the way they consume entertainment, gravitating more toward social media and streaming.\n\nBut the Oscars last March bounced back significantly from their pandemic slump, recording over 16 million American viewers, up from around 10 million a year earlier.\n\nAt Tuesday night's Globes, Spielberg's The Fabelmans was named best drama and The Banshees Of Inisherin, starring Farrell, won best comedy. - AFP\n\nGolden Globes\n\nAWARDS AND PRIZES\n\nMovies\n\nTV series\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 8, 2024, 06:13am\n\nOppenheimer tops Golden Globes on bittersweet night for Barbie\n\nJan 8, 2024, 03:32am\n\nCillian Murphy wins best drama film actor Oppenheimer, Emma Stone wins best comedy film actress\n\nDec 12, 2023, 05:39am\n\n'Barbenheimer' tops newly revamped Golden Globes nominations\n\nJan 11, 2023, 06:42am\n\nGolden Globes: Banshees, Fabelmans win top awards\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He pleaded guilty to two charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Three other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Jaime Pang said Ang was a workshop supervisor at New Hope Food Industries, a bakery located in Changi Prison where inmates are taught to make pastries.\n\nDue to his role, Ang was granted access to the Changi Prison compound and was subject to stringent checks as no one was allowed to bring in contraband items unless approved by the relevant authorities.\n\nAng became friends with an inmate, Ismail Musun Mollah, 57, as they worked closely together. Some time in August or September 2021, Ismail asked Ang to smuggle 100 Epam pills into the prison for him.\n\nEpam, which is generally used to treat insomnia, is deemed to be a contraband item by the prison authorities since it is not prescribed by the prison's medical team, said DPP Pang.\n\nAng accepted Ismail's offer of $200 to buy the pills for $50 and keep the remaining $150 for himself. He later smuggled 100 Epam pills into the prison and passed them to Ismail.\n\n\"Ang did so despite knowing at all times that Epam pills were contraband and he was not authorised to bring the Epam pills into Changi Prison for Ismail,\" said the DPP.\n\nOn Sept 5, 2021, Ismail's brother paid Ang via PayNow.\n\nAng's success in smuggling the pills soon spread among the inmates, and several of them approached him to do the same for them.\n\nAng received a total of $1,200 in bribes from four inmates on five occasions over the course of a few months, said DPP Pang. His offences came to light when the smuggling was detected by prison authorities.\n\nNoting that Ang's offences had compromised the security of Changi Prison, DPP Pang said in his submissions: \"He has abused the unique access and trust reposed in him by virtue of his position. These are grave offences which impugn the integrity of Changi Prison and risks eroding public confidence in the maintenance and security of Changi Prison's inmates.\"\n\nIn mitigation, Ang said: \"I hope you will give me a chance to turn over a new leaf. I'm sorry for what I did and I regret it. I have learnt my lesson.\"\n\nBefore meting out the sentence, District Judge Janet Wang noted that the amount of gratification received by the accused was not insignificant.\n\nShe acknowledged that Ang did not initiate the enterprise but said he had a \"misplaced sense of camaraderie\" with the inmates involved.\n\n\"Paradoxically, as a trainer at the workshop, he should be training the inmates positively. But he led them astray,\" added Judge Wang.\n\nNadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncorruption\n\nPRISONS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

What precautions can you take?", "publish_date": "2023-01-12T02:11:00", "content": "Experts say the chances of mobile devices exploding are five in a million.\n\nPHOTO: UNSPLASH\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 12, 2023, 02:11am\n\nWhat causes power bank fire? What precautions can you take?\n\nShare this article\n\nTwo passengers were slightly injured on a Scoot flight set to take off from Taoyuan International Airport in Taiwan for Singapore on Tuesday evening after\n\na portable charger caught fire.\n\nThe fire was put out and flight TR993 was rescheduled.\n\nThe incident prompted questions on battery safety - in particular why power banks catch fire, why they are not allowed in checked-in baggage and what safety precautions users should take.\n\nQ. What causes electronic gadgets like power banks to catch fire?\n\nA:\n\nThe batteries in these gadgets are flammable.\n\nLithium-ion batteries, first developed in the 1970s, are extremely popular because of the high amount of energy they can deliver at a given size and weight compared with nickel metal hydride or lead acid batteries. Today, lithium-ion batteries power everything from smartphones and power banks to electric vehicles and even the International Space Station.\n\nHowever, lithium-ion batteries are inherently flammable. They store and release electrical energy through electrochemical reactions that produce heat. Lithium-based batteries can overheat under extreme conditions - such as extreme temperatures (below 0 deg C or above 65 deg C) and mechanical stress - and when designed to charge fast.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:25am\n\nMedics treat 7 after Chai Chee block lift lobby blaze\n\nMore related stories\n\nAn important component in a lithium-ion battery to prevent what is commonly known as a short circuit is the separator between the positive (cathode) and negative (anode) electrodes. This separator is often made of a microporous polymer material.\n\nTo make batteries charge faster and last longer, battery makers tend to reduce the thickness of the separator film. During charging, the separator often comes under mechanical stress as the electrodes swell. A thinner separator has a greater chance of rupturing, which then puts the electrodes in direct physical contact, creating a short circuit. Intense heat can then be generated, melting the separator, which could lead to further short-circuiting. This is how smoke emissions, fires and explosions come about.\n\nBattery makers tend not to use thick separators as they create greater internal resistance, slowing down the charging. A thick separator also means less space for electrode materials, which store energy. The cost of fast charging is - unfortunately - safety.\n\nDefects in manufacturing can also produce unsafe batteries.\n\nQ. Should consumers be worried?\n\nA:\n\nExperts say the chances of mobile devices exploding are five in a million. But there has been an increase in the number of product recalls as well as fires due to faulty batteries in recent times.\n\nIn 2022, Singapore's Consumer Product Safety Office told Harvey Norman Singapore to stop selling the Urban.Power N.Brandz PD18W 10000mAh Power Bank. The safety office also told online retailer TMALL1688 to stop selling Portable Power Bank 20000mAh. The power banks in question caught fire during safety tests.\n\nIn October 2020, LG Electronics offered a free replacement service for the power board on 18 models of its Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) televisions which were produced from February 2016 to September 2019. This could have been due to issues with overheating.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n2 injured after power bank catches fire on Scoot flight bound for Singapore from Taiwan\n\nPreventing power bank fires: Is it risky to overcharge batteries? How about if they’re bloated?\n\nIn 2019, there were five product recalls due to faulty batteries that could overheat and pose fire hazards:\n\n1. The OnNight 410 Trail Running Headlamp, sold between February 2014 and September 2018, recalled by retailer Decathlon.\n\n2. Selected 15-inch MacBook Pro units sold between September 2015 and February 2017, recalled by Apple.\n\n3. Pocket power charger banks sold by retailer Cotton On between October 2018 and January 2019.\n\n4. Hybrid power adaptors for power banks, recalled by Dell because of design flaws that could expose the internal components and pose an electric shock hazard.\n\n5. HP's battery safety recall programme was expanded to include spare batteries for its ProBook 4xx Series laptops.\n\nIn 2018, Singapore's Consumer Product Safety Office found that 17 power banks caught fire during its safety tests, and issued alerts to retailers to stop selling them.\n\nThe world's first major mobile phone recall took place in 2016, when Samsung recalled a total of 2.5 million of its latest flagship Samsung Galaxy Note7 device, sparked by\n\nincidents in which they caught fire when the batteries overheated.\n\nThe number of fires that started from personal transportation devices has also increased over the years. Most recently in December 2022,\n\na fire that engulfed a one-room flat in Woodlands\n\nstarted from a personal mobility aid in the unit's living room. The device's battery, bought online, was found to have expired.\n\nIn April 2022,\n\na fire that broke out at a flat\n\nin Bukit Merah originated from the battery pack of an electric bicycle that was charging in the living room. In 2021, there were 32 fires involving personal mobility devices and 23 involving power-assisted bicycles.\n\nQ. What precautions should consumers take?\n\nA:\n\nSince there is no way of telling if a battery is good or faulty, consumers should not leave devices to charge overnight. Consumers should also avoid cluttering any area where devices are plugged into power extension sockets for prolonged charging. Consumers should also use original power cords to charge their devices.\n\nMechanical stress can be created when a phone or power bank is dropped. This alters the internal structure of the battery, leading to short-circuiting and overheating. Once the battery is damaged, it often swells. Consumers are advised to throw out gadgets if they see the batteries have swelled, or replace the batteries. Consumers should also check for the presence of corrosion or a powdery residue on their batteries, which are signs of damage.\n\nStore lithium-ion batteries in a well-ventilated and dry area away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Batteries should be stacked so that they are stable and cannot be bumped, knocked over or damaged.\n\nBuy batteries from reputable sources and use original batteries. Avoid buying second-hand batteries as there is no way to tell if they have expired. The typical estimated life of a lithium-ion battery is about two to three years, or 300 to 500 charge cycles.\n\nQ. What electronic devices must be hand carried on a flight? What can be checked in?\n\nA:\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration in the US advises that devices containing lithium metal or lithium-ion batteries - including laptops, smartphones and tablets - should be carried in carry-on baggage when possible. When portable electronic devices powered by lithium batteries are in checked baggage, they must be completely powered off and protected to prevent unintentional activation or damage.\n\nSpare lithium metal and lithium-ion batteries (or power banks) are prohibited in checked baggage and must be hand carried. It would be catastrophic if the devices combusted unnoticed in the luggage bay of the aircraft.\n\nSimilarly, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore requires power banks and personal transportation devices powered by lithium-ion batteries to be hand carried.

He was 78 years old.\n\nA guitar virtuoso and innovator who was also one of the world's great rhythm and blues interpreters, Beck died \"peacefully\" after a sudden bout of bacterial meningitis.\n\n\"On behalf of his family, it is with deep and profound sadness that we share the news of Jeff Beck's passing. After suddenly contracting bacterial meningitis, he peacefully passed away yesterday,\" a statement on the English-born musician's website said. \"His family ask for privacy while they process this tremendous loss.\"\n\nBeck's death quickly reverberated around the music world, with tributes pouring in from rock icons like Ozzy Osbourne, with whom Beck once collaborated, and Kiss lead singer Gene Simmons, who called Beck's passing \"heartbreaking\".\n\n\"No one played guitar like Jeff,\" Simmons posted on Twitter. \"Please get ahold of the first two Jeff Beck Group albums and behold greatness.

Nine in 10 travellers are planning international trips, compared with about five in 10 in 2022.\n\nTraveloka president Caesar Indra said demand for CNY travel has returned to pre-Covid-19 levels, with destinations like Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City and Kuala Lumpur popular among people jetting off for durations of eight to 13 days.\n\n\"To make the most of the CNY holiday, travellers will start departing from Singapore between Jan 17 and 21,\" he said. \"One reason these three destinations feature high on people's lists is because they are major cities located near Singapore, making them a good port of call for those planning to explore the region.\"\n\nThe huge demand is bolstered by the extended weekend for CNY this year, he said. Travellers are also ready to spend on travelling, having saved a fair amount over the last couple of years when travel was limited.\n\nExpedia spokesman Lavinia Rajaram said CNY has always been a popular period for overseas travel among Asians, including Singaporeans. The top destinations for CNY travel among Singaporeans on its platform are cities in Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia, with most going for three- to four-day trips.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nSingapore passport remains second-most powerful in the world\n\nSingaporeans not putting off travel plans to Thailand despite new Covid-19 rules\n\nCruise companies have also reported brisk sales. Royal Caribbean said its CNY cruises are almost sold out, with cruises on Jan 12, 16 and 20 in high demand. These are three- to five-night itineraries from Singapore to Penang and Phuket, and most travellers are multi-generational families.\n\nA Resorts World Cruises spokesman said cruises departing between Jan 20 and 25 were sold out in November. Its two- and three-night cruises to KL and Penang during the CNY break are popular, especially among families. The company has curated some CNY activities, like talks on Chinese zodiac forecasts, on board the cruises.\n\nSome agencies said the demand for CNY travel would have been even better if the festival had come at a later date.\n\nMs Kay Swee Pin, chief executive of SA Tours, said that due to \"revenge travel\" in the last three months of 2022, some who have already made recent trips may choose not to travel during CNY.\n\nMr Jeffrey Choo, marketing communications officer of ASA Holidays, concurred, saying most Singaporeans had already travelled since borders opened in the past few months.\n\nMs Mandy Ooi, Nam Ho Travel's marketing director, said: \"CNY is too early this year, too close to the year-end holidays in 2022.  Most Singaporeans will not choose to travel for two consecutive months.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some travel agencies are expecting the return of China travellers as\n\nChina's inbound quarantine rules\n\nare eased. Travel booking company Trip.com Group listed Singapore as one of the top 10 destinations outside the mainland with the fastest-growing search volume among China travellers.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nBusiness missions, leisure travel between Singapore and China poised to restart as curbs ease\n\nChina expects CNY travel surge, this could be most complicated holiday in years\n\nSiam Express has received four to five inquiries, with the earliest arrival date being on Jan 20. It is waiting for confirmation on travel regulations and visa requirements from China.\n\nMs Xia Jingwen, its digital business development manager, said the agency has been preparing for the Chinese market since December, such as updating its packages, translating itineraries into Chinese and training Chinese-speaking tour guides. However, she said the bulk of the Chinese tourists will likely return only in March or later.\n\nTraveloka's Mr Indra said: \"Since the removal of its mandatory Covid-19 quarantine for overseas arrivals from Jan 8, we are seeing a steady increase in inbound travel from China to Singapore, including during the CNY period.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n‘Can’t wait to go back home’: Malaysians in S’pore look forward to CNY reunion despite high costs\n\nChinatown CNY festivities hop back in full force ahead of Year of the Rabbit\n\nChin Soo Fang\n\nSenior Correspondent\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nCRUISES\n\nChina\n\nTourism\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 26, 2023, 10:29am\n\nCustomers frustrated after non-delivery of CNY gift hampers\n\nJan 25, 2023, 01:29pm\n\nNursing home residents whip up special home-cooked CNY dinner\n\nJan 25, 2023, 04:36am\n\nWet weather expected for remainder of CNY festive period\n\nJan 24, 2023, 12:07pm\n\nHow local celebrities celebrated Chinese New Year\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

We didn't play good, we didn't play well in the beginning. There are many games you can start not good and overcome and we didn't do it.\n\n\"When you are not prepared to play this game, you arrive one inch late and don't score a goal. When you are prepared, you score the goal.\n\n\"Today was a bad night, the opponents were better so we have to congratulate them. To win games, you have to deserve it and tonight we didn't deserve it.\"\n\nGuardiola had named a strong side with Joao Cancelo, Jack Grealish, Ilkay Gundogan and Kalvin Phillips among the starters, yet apart from an early shot dragged wide by midfielder Gundogan, they made little impression on the game.\n\nGuardiola's sentiments were echoed by Gundogan, who was disappointed with his side's performance.\n\n\"It's definitely not what we wanted,\" the German told Sky Sports. \"We had hopes of going through in the League Cup but with that (performance), there was no chance. It was not enough from us.\n\n\"With the ball, we made a lot of mistakes, missed a lot of passes, gave them the ball too easily and that resulted in the two goals.\n\n\"Today we were not good enough to create chances, not good enough to score a goal. The mix of the performance from all the team gives this result.\"\n\nCity will need to improve on Saturday for their next game, a Premier League derby away to neighbours Manchester United, who have won all of their last eight competitive games.\n\nSouthampton, bottom of the Premier League table, scored twice in the first half through Sekou Mara and Moussa Djenepo and City never seriously threatened to get back into the match.\n\nMara scored his first goal for Southampton in the 23rd minute as he connected well with a whipped cross by Lyanco and the hosts doubled the lead five minutes later when Djenepo spotted City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega off of his line and curled a stunning effort into the top corner.\n\nEven the second-half introduction of substitutes Kevin de Bruyne and Erling Haaland failed to spark a revival for Guardiola's side.\n\nSouthampton captain James Ward-Prowse told Sky Sports that his side played without fear and praised new manager Nathan Jones.\n\n\"(It is) a special night. These games are special to play in especially when you're struggling in the league. We knew this was a distraction from the league and a great showcase. We showed no fear.\n\n\"It's always tough when you're in the position we are. The manager has been excellent and has given us fresh ideas and new energy. He wanted us to be bold and aggressive.\n\n\"We have been guilty in the past of having a result at half-time and dropping off. We showed a different part of our game. We thoroughly deserved the win.\"\n\nCity came into the game off the back of a 4-0 demolition of Chelsea in the FA Cup on Sunday but failed to replicate the free-scoring form.\n\nIt was Grealish who had made the error which led to the hosts' opening goal, giving away possession to Lycano who raced up the wing before providing the cross for Mara.\n\nJones has failed to halt Southampton's poor Premier League form since taking over in November, but has won all three of his team's games in cup competitions - against Lincoln City, Crystal Palace and now City.\n\nNext up for the Saints will be Newcastle, who beat Leicester 2-0 on Tuesday.\n\nManchester United will face Nottingham Forest in the other semi-final.\n\nThe semi-finals will take place in the weeks commencing Jan 23 and Jan 30. - REUTERS\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: City just want to win, says Guardiola\n\nFootball: Guardiola urges City to be ready amid New Year ‘distractions’\n\nLEAGUE CUP\n\nmanchester city\n\nFOOTBALL MATCHES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 24, 2024, 01:38am\n\nChelsea thrash Middlesbrough 6-1 to reach League Cup final\n\nNov 2, 2023, 02:12am\n\nMan United booed off after Newcastle loss, West Ham knock out Arsenal\n\nOct 10, 2023, 11:44am\n\nFormer Real Madrid and Chelsea winger Hazard retires at 32\n\nSep 28, 2023, 11:20am\n\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp lauds 'top performance' after beating Leicester City\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Under a cloudy sky and running in separate trials, Gold Reward and Fame Star showed us that although they are getting on in years, they have still not lost their navigation.\n\nGold Reward was off first. Ridden by apprentice Roslan Nazam in Trial Two, he latched himself onto the withers of the leader, Briggs, and never surrendered a centimetre.\n\nA furlong out and with Briggs waving the white flag, Gold Reward charged to the front.\n\nUp in the saddle, the apprentice had a cushy time. Gold Reward knew just what to do and he carried Roslan to an easy 3½-length victory.\n\nAn American bred by Warrior's Reward, the Chelsea Stable-owned galloper clocked 1min 01.73sec for the 1,000m journey.\n\nIt was not the fastest time of the morning, which saw five trials being run. But it certainly was the most comprehensive of victories.\n\nTrainer Ricardo Le Grange, who has been in his corner since March 2021, will ensure that he is kept young forever.\n\nThen, in the very next trial, we saw Fame Star throw in a punch for the wrinkled warriors.\n\nThe Group 2 winner from Stephen Crutchley's barn dictated things from go to whoa and eventually consigned The August and Hamama to the ranks of the beaten brigade.\n\nRidden by Jeryln Seow, who scored a smashing win on stablemate Mesmerizing on opening day, Fame Star did not give the others a look-in.\n\nJockey Wong Chin Chuen, on The August, kept Fame Star busy all the way but never could throw in that knockout punch and eventually settled for second - by a ½-length.\n\nFame Star, who clocked 1min 04sec, has been a prolific moneyspinner for the Toast Trusts & Shane McDonnell Stable.\n\nFrom nine wins dating back to April 2018, Fame Star has fattened the coffers to $758,000.

He is likely to start at ultra-short odds in the opener on Saturday.\n\nST PHOTO: SYAMIL SAPARI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 11, 2023, 05:05pm\n\nMoment of truth for Cash Cove\n\nSaturday's Class 4 race will be the best guide to three-time winner's 3YO dreams\n\nShare this article\n\nTrainer Alwin Tan will get the answers he needs as early as Race 1 this Saturday.\n\nThe Singaporean saddles a small team of only three runners, but there is no doubt his three-year-old Cash Cove will keep him on tenterhooks.\n\nThe good news is Tan will not have to wait long before he can get the weight off his shoulders. The $50,000 Class 4 Division 1 race over 1,100m on Polytrack that the son of Charm Spirit contests is slated as the opening event.\n\nWhile his three wins from six starts in 2022 made Cash Cove a shoo-in for the Singapore Three-Year-Old Challenge, Tan would rather treat Saturday's race as the perfect litmus test - either way.\n\n\"Looking at the handicaps this Saturday, I think he should run a good race even if he's up against some experienced horses of better quality,\" said the 2016 Singapore champion trainer.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"He carries 57.5kg, which is not too bad, even if he does give weight all round.\n\n\"If he wins easy, then no need to say where he's going. We'll get him ready for the 3YO races.\n\n\"But if he struggles to win or even loses, then we need to think about whether we keep going towards the 3YO races. We'll have to work it out with (Manoel) Nunes and seek his opinion.\"\n\nThe Brazilian maestro has paired up only once with Cash Cove. It came at his impressive last-start win in a Class 4 race over 1,100m on Nov 13.\n\nOviously impressed, Nunes has since continued the association with the grey during the December break, even if no deal has been inked between the two parties.\n\nThe Challenge kicks off with the Group 3 Singapore Three-Year-Old Sprint (1,200m) on April 8, before culminating with the relaunched Group 2 Singapore Guineas (1,600m) on May 20.\n\n\"I have to thank Ivan Neo for giving me such a good horse to train. But I'm so lucky to have Nunes as his jockey,\" said Tan.\n\n\"Based on his feedback after his workout yesterday, he was happy with his condition and action, and said he was ready to go.\n\n\"But Nunes has yet to commit to the horse for the 3YO races as he's got a few options. We also have to test the horse over 1,200m on turf first.\n\n\"He's had only a couple of runs over that course and distance but he was still green then. He's had only six starts, but he has improved since.\n\n\"Nunes also said he can improve further. He said he could still feel something underneath him in trackwork.\"\n\nOn the race itself, Tan has done his homework and sounded reasonably bullish of \"landing the cash\" again with the noted speedster.\n\n\"Barrier No. 7 is okay. But Jason Ong's horse Opunake can also set a fast pace. I hope the pace is not too crazy,\" said Tan.\n\n\"You must also respect Wecando, who showed some pace at his last start. Sun Ace is also speedy.\n\n\"Nunes was happy with his two barrier trials during the break, even if the horse was a bit slow at the second trial.\n\n\"I'm not sure if it's a problem, but he did stay inside the barrier a bit longer.\"\n\nTan's other two runners on Saturday are split between the two $30,000 Class 5 Division 1 races over 1,100m: Griffin in the Division 1 race and Bizar Wins in the Division 2 race.\n\nNunes is booked on Bizar Wins, a Brazen Beau five-year-old Tan races himself, and who is not exactly a model of consistency even if he ran second at his last start.\n\nFrench jockey Louis-Philippe Beuzelin rides Griffin, an All American five-year-old who has shown precious little in 13 starts at Kranji.\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

(3) MEMORIAL DAY disappointed somewhat last time when blowing. She will have no problem with the extra distance and deserves another chance. (13) IMPERSONATION and (16) THREE STRANDS are improving and could challenge.\n\nRace 2 (1,000m)\n\n(2) KARANGETANG will try and get a lead over the minimum distance but (1) SWING UPON A STAR, first time on this short trip, will be catching late. (4) HIGHEST HONOUR comes off a long break. May need it. (5) MANDALAY just got off the mark. Can make the trifecta.\n\nRace 3 (1,600m)\n\n(4) TOFFAS is having his peak run and rates the one to beat. Also ripe and ready is (1) THUNDERSTONE but he has to concede 5kg. May battle a bit. (8) FUTUREWOLFF touched (7) ROSY LEMON off last time but the latter is 1kg better off. (2) ROLL OVER REDROVER won well at his second start but the form has yet to be franked.\n\nRace 4 (1,600m)\n\n(1) IN CAHOOTS bounced back to his best last time and the combo could go in again. However, he meets (9) GILDA GRAY on 8½kg worse terms for 7¼ lengths. Also, he has yet to win over the 1,600m trip. (2) ADMIRALTY ARCH and (3) BURMESE TIARA are serious contenders for trifecta money.\n\nRace 5 (2,400m)\n\nTricky. (4) ARLINGTON ACTION is worse off against (3) WHITE FANG and (8) GREAT AFFAIR but he keeps on winning. He is looking for five successive marathon-distance wins on the trot but it will be difficult. (10) FLYING FIRST CLASS is fancied. Watch the form. (5) CAPTAIN CHORUS and (11) MONSIEUR CHEVELLE could pull it off.\n\nRace 6 (1,000m)\n\n(6) INSATIABLE finished a neck ahead of (4) ROSE FOR TRIPPI (won subsequently) recently and is 9½kg better off. However, the latter needed that run and found traffic problems then. Stablemates (1) REMEMBER WHEN and (3) BIG EYED GIRL could upset calculations.\n\nRace 7 (1,000m)\n\n(5) IN THE ETHER and (7) BEADED GOWN are hard to split on their recent meeting, but the latter was hampered enough to turn it around. (10) BIG CITY GIRL is finding form and could show up. (8) QUICK RUN is back to best and could go in again.\n\nRace 8 (1,200m)\n\n(2) METEORIC should make a bold bid. But, if covered early, her task could be easier. (1) COOL WINTER was disappointing last start, but could bounce back. (3) PINCH HIT is running well and could challenge. (9) BACK TO BASICS is improving again and deserves respect.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But the driver maintained that he was simply following procedure and would have to call SBS Transit's headquarters to check.\n\n\"I also told him that I would (send) feedback on this issue, and he challenged me to go ahead,\" she said.\n\nWhile waiting, a middle-aged man offered her a mask, to which she declined, stating that she already had masks in her bag, and that her son would have a meltdown if forced to wear one.\n\n\"The guy seemed pissed and walked away,\" she said. \"I (was) quite pressured with glares from the passengers as the bus driver refused to start the bus.\"\n\nUltimately, the call took too long, and she chose to alight the vehicle with her husband and son.\n\n\"This is the first time such an unfortunate incident has happened as we have met some really awesome drivers previously,\" she wrote.\n\nShe urged for more awareness from the general public on those with special needs. \"It is not easy to be a caregiver of special needs. We hope to be treated fairly with due respect too.\"\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health guidelines, authorities should exercise flexibility in enforcing mask-wearing for some groups, including children with special needs.\n\nSBS Transit addresses incident\n\nIn response to queries from MS News, Mrs Grace Wu, SBS Transit's vice-president (special grade) of customer experience and communications, explained that as mask-wearing on public transport is mandatory, the bus captain wanted to be sure and sought clarification from SBS Transit's Operations Control Centre (OCC) before continuing with the journey.\n\nUnfortunately, the OP and her family alighted from the bus before OCC could respond affirmatively.\n\n\"We will remind our bus captain of the guidelines so that he can better manage such situations in the future,\" she added.\n\nSBS Transit\n\ncustomer complaint\n\nmasks\n\nautism\n\nspecial needs\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 12, 2025, 12:35am\n\nSBS Transit to pilot smart bus braking system in 2026\n\nMay 9, 2025, 09:22am\n\nFirst 2 new Sengkang-Punggol LRT trains handed over to SBS Transit, service starting in Q3 2025\n\nApr 20, 2025, 06:39am\n\nNew Woodleigh Bus Interchange opens after years of delay\n\nApr 7, 2025, 03:17am\n\n3 new bus services in Toa Payoh, Tampines and Whampoa to be rolled out by June\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/35feb43bef637070b219d943d2d2f45e4a7b98467627ee8b105f6be820ca520f/msn-featured-47_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO: BUSINTERCHANGE.NET"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e1adb76ab131e3999d83813323137305975589b2aeaca4b9029f7def677a7f31/aibus190525.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "New bus service 230M linking Kim Keat and Toa Payoh Bus Interchange to start on June 8", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/53edf06d6d5efa5e1d26d5e30255ca06f0a12cb336c7aabc466f3cace0f96405/file7zlr227y3lt25knoxuxjpg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "SBS Transit to pilot smart bus braking system in 2026", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He has five goals and three assists in 20 games in all competitions.\n\nFelix scored once in five World Cup appearances as Portugal exited at the quarter-final stage. He started in Atletico's 1-0 home loss to La Liga leaders Barcelona on Sunday and was substituted after 73 minutes.\n\n\"Chelsea is one of the great teams in the world and I hope to help the team reach their objectives, so I am very, very happy to be here and very excited to play at Stamford Bridge,\" Felix said in a club statement.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\nFelix became the fourth most expensive player of all time when he joined Atletico for 126 million euros from Benfica in 2019 as a teenager.\n\nA versatile forward, Felix can play as a striker, attacking midfielder or on the flanks but has struggled to live up to his price tag since moving to Spain. He has scored 34 goals in 131 appearances for Atletico and won the 2020-21 league title.\n\nChelsea have already been active in the January transfer window, bringing in French defender Benoit Badiashile, Ivorian forward David Datro Fofana and Brazilian midfielder Andrey Santos.\n\nFelix will further bolster their injury-hit squad as well as strengthen their options in attack, with Raheem Sterling, Christian Pulisic and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang all sidelined.\n\nGraham Potter's side have scored only 20 goals in 17 Premier League games so far and sit 10th, 10 points off the top four.\n\nChelsea have lost five of their last seven games in all competitions and been knocked out of the FA Cup and League Cup. They return to action at Fulham in the league on Thursday. - REUTERS\n\nepl\n\nchelsea\n\nPortugal\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

A day later, she received an anonymous e-mail with explicit photos of her that he had taken.\n\n\"I was living in fear and was quite paranoid then. If someone took a longer glance at me on the streets, I would start to wonder if my photos had been leaked and they had recognised me,\" she said, adding that she lodged a police report.\n\nDistressing online experiences like these are becoming increasingly common among young women. Findings from a 2022 poll by the Sunlight Alliance for Action to tackle online harms found that females aged 25 to 34 were most likely to have experienced actions like sexual harassment, stalking and non-consensual distribution of intimate images.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 05:45am\n\nFemale primary school teacher charged over alleged sex acts with male student, 13\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe poll found that 61 per cent of women in Singapore are not aware of where to seek help.\n\nFrom Jan 19, girls and women who face such online harassment can tap a new support centre in Waterloo Street. Called SheCares@SCWO, it is run by non-profit organisation SG Her Empowerment (SHE) and the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (SCWO).\n\nFor a start, the centre will have two full-time trained counsellors manning helplines from Monday to Friday between 9am and 9pm, said veteran lawyer and chairman of SHE Stefanie Yuen Thio at an event held at TSMP Law's office on Wednesday announcing the launch of the centre.\n\nAbout 50 volunteer lawyers from Pro Bono SG and TSMP Law will also be available to offer guidance at the centre's legal clinic. It operates on the first, third and fifth Wednesdays of the month from 7pm to 9pm.\n\nThe lawyers will be able to give advice on lodging appropriate first information reports, how to notify relevant Internet platforms and assist on getting urgent court relief for victims.\n\nMs Yuen Thio added that SHE is hoping to forge closer ties with community partners to help victims. \"We're also working very closely to become trusted flaggers with the various Internet platforms so we can hasten the speed of reporting… and hopefully they will be able to remove any offending information very quickly,\" she said.\n\n\"We're also hoping in due course to share other survivors' journeys on the website. I think the idea is to build a community of people that have gone through this and will understand what it's like, so victims know they're not alone,\" she added.\n\nThe new support centre, called SheCares@SCWO, is located in Waterloo Street. PHOTO: SG HER EMPOWERMENT\n\nThe police will pilot an initiative where victims of select serious sexual assault cases can be interviewed at the centre's premises.\n\nLaw and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said in a doorstop interview at the event that the pilot can better support victims by reducing the number of times they have to recount their traumatic experience.\n\n(From left) Law and Home Affairs Minister K.

He alleged that Poon had sent several forged passports to Beijing that were detained at customs.\n\nLater on, a man who claimed to be an interpol police officer in China told Poon she was being investigated for masterminding a money laundering scheme. As a result, the money in her bank account in China would be frozen for two years.\n\nPoon was born in Shanghai and still maintained a bank account there.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:31am\n\nS'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat\n\nMore related stories\n\nPreying on her distress, the scammer then offered to \"help\" her. They even got a female \"police officer\" to hand her documentation of her \"crimes\" as proof.\n\n\"Both times, the person would meet me at the carpark (at her condo in Singapore),\" said Poon, who was told repeatedly that \"the police were secretly helping her\" and she must not tell anyone about the ongoing \"investigation\".\n\nPoon soon fell into the web of deceit as she heeded every instruction from the scammers. This included logging on to a website \"operated by Chinese police\", and more crucially, pressing the \"OK\" button on her bank's digital token every three seconds to \"verify her fingerprints\".\n\nPoon later realised that each time she pressed the button, tens of thousands of dollars were syphoned out of her account.\n\n\"I lost 50,000 yuan (S$9,800) every three seconds,\" she said.\n\nPoon logged into her China Zheshang Bank account a total of 266 times in 20 days, with the outflow of bank transfers amounting to a whopping 14.86 million yuan.\n\n\"That was the equivalent of 3.03 million Singapore dollars then,\" said Poon, who was unaware her life savings were being emptied during those 20 days.\n\nPoon logged into her China Zheshang Bank account a total of 266 times in 20 days, with the outflow of bank transfers amounting to a whopping 14.86 million yuan.\n\nIn addition to her savings, the scammers also instructed Poon to remit more money from Singapore to her Chinese bank account for various fictional purposes - from needing to prove her financial strength to Chinese authorities to paying for the burial fees of a victim who died because of her.\n\nTo raise the additional funds, Poon borrowed money from friends and loan sharks.\n\nShe only suspected it was all a scam when a friend told her of the possibility.\n\nBy then, it was too late.\n\nWhen she realised she could not log into her China Zheshang Bank account, she called the bank and was told she had just 0.76 yuan left in her account.\n\nShe flew to Shanghai and made a police report, but was told by the police there it was out of their jurisdiction as the crime did not happen in China.\n\nProperties sold off\n\nTo clear her loan shark debt, Poon was forced to sell off two of her properties.\n\nShe told Zaobao that she lost 10kg from the incident and had even thought of ending her life.\n\n\"Although I wouldn't have to care about anything if my life ended, what about others who I owed money to?\"\n\nShe decided to share her experience to serve as a warning to others.\n\n\"I would like to use this unfortunate incident to raise the public's awareness,\" she said.\n\nPoon said she took legal action against China Zheshang Bank for their alleged lapses in security, but the court did not rule in her favour.\n\nWhat did give her some comfort, though, was that her children did not get upset after finding out about the scam.\n\n\"I apologised and told them I was very sorry, as that sum of money was meant to have been theirs.\"\n\nChina\n\nSCAMS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 30, 2025, 03:04am\n\nSelf-driving public shuttles in Punggol by fourth quarter\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:52pm\n\nSingapore's first private assisted-living pilot ready by 2026\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nMay 16, 2025, 01:14am\n\nSingapore actress Eleanor Lee accused online of insulting China, allegedly dropped from Chinese show\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Umi's core duty was to take care of her.\n\nIn June 2022, the employer, 64, moved his valuables from his matrimonial home to his current home, and kept his cash and jewellery in a piece of luggage in his bedroom.\n\nDuring that period, Umi told her employer that she wanted to stop working in Singapore. Court documents did not state the reason.\n\nIn September 2022, after finding out that her employer would be away in Malaysia for a holiday with his daughter and her family, Umi decided to steal from him.\n\n\"She decided to commit theft as she wanted to enrich herself before leaving Singapore upon ending her employment,\" said SPO Lim.\n\nUmi stole around $56,700 in cash and gold jewellery, among other things. In October 2022, she messaged a Filipino maid to meet her near a rubbish chute and told her she was returning to Indonesia the next month.\n\nUmi passed some of the stolen jewellery to her friend to sell on her behalf. The other maid agreed, not knowing they were stolen items.\n\nShe sold the valuables to pawnshops for a total value of more than $22,000. She kept $1,700 of the sales proceeds as well as a gold necklace, and gave about $20,700 to Umi, who then gave her $500 for her help.\n\nSPO Lim said the Filipino maid will be dealt with separately.\n\nThat same month, Umi's employer realised some of his valuables in the luggage bag were missing. He informed his daughter, and she and her husband later checked Umi's belongings and found some of the stolen jewellery and cash.\n\nUmi confessed to the daughter that she had stolen the items.\n\nThose who steal from an employer in the capacity of a clerk or servant can be jailed for up to seven years and fined.\n\nBy\n\nNadine Chua\n\nRead articles by Nadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nMAID/DOMESTIC WORKER\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6abf2d979208c6f0a61863f4bc68d6cb4a5de263a75e78620df427c52da0ad88/gavel.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Shanmugam on Wednesday.\n\nThere are legitimate organisations and ways to support various causes that people believe in, \"but armed violence is different, unacceptable,\" he said.\n\n\"What we cannot do is to support terrorism, support armed conflict, plan to kill people.\"\n\nIndividuals who want to carry out armed violence abroad will be arrested, he added, just like\n\n38-year-old Ministry of Education teacher Mohamed Khairul Riduan Mohamed Sarip,\n\nwhom the Internal Security Department (ISD) announced on Wednesday had been arrested and detained under the Internal Security Act in October 2022.\n\nKhairul had been influenced by radical videos online, including the teachings of foreign preachers who convinced him to engage in armed jihad. He had planned to travel to Gaza to join Hamas and its military wing and carry out armed combat against the Israel Defence Forces, said ISD.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 9, 2025, 12:36am\n\nOver 20,000 devotees attend Sri Sivan Temple consecration, crowd almost breaks through barricades\n\nMore related stories\n\nSpeaking to media at the Ministry of Home Affairs headquarters in Novena, Mr Shanmugam said Singapore will take steps against such individuals when they are in the planning stage, unlike other countries who may only do so after their citizens are already involved or have committed attacks.\n\nSingapore also works closely with community partners and organisations to spread the message against terrorism, he added.\n\n\"I think that's one reason why you see far fewer people from Singapore, getting involved with this compared with many other countries,\" he said. \"But far fewer doesn't mean zero.\"\n\nAsked about a terror threat report that said the easing of Covid-19-related movement restrictions\n\ncould lead to a resurgence of terrorist activity in the region,\n\nMr Shanmugam said the solution cannot be to turn Singapore into a fortress.\n\nPeople want to be able to go about their lives feeling secure, but without feeling like they are in a prison, with many restrictions. This is why the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, and other Home Team agencies have the difficult task balancing the ease of movement in and out of Singapore with maintaining safety and security, he said.\n\n\"You cannot become a cantonment and a barricade because somebody from Singapore wants to go abroad to do bad things, or you're worried that somebody from abroad is going to come to Singapore and do bad things,\" said Mr Shanmugam. \"We are an international business city; you want to be open for business.\"\n\nA recent report by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) said the primary terrorist threat to Singapore still comes from self-radicalised individuals, but that there was evidence of terror groups renewing their outreach to Muslims in Singapore and the region as travel restrictions ease.\n\n\"(There is) a lot of assessment of information, assessment of travellers, a lot of intelligence work to see who is coming in, what do we need to do to pick up some who may be potentially troublesome, and also who within Singapore may potentially engage in such activities,\" he said.\n\nMr Shamugam also made clear that the authorities did not detain Khairul for his support of Palestine, but because he planned to carry out armed violence.\n\nHe said that there are many causes around the world, including Palestine, that Singaporeans can and do take views on and provide moral, financial and other means of support to advance them.\n\n\"There are legitimate organisations that Singaporeans can partner to support these causes all around the world, including the cause of helping Palestinians,\" he said.\n\nGoh Yan Han\n\nPolitical Correspondent\n\nK Shanmugam\n\nterrorism\n\nINTERNAL SECURITY ACT\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:53am\n\n'What kind of person will do this?': Shanmugam condemns abuse, killing of Yishun community cat\n\nMar 27, 2025, 11:54pm\n\nShanmugam: Time to move on from MPS disruption incident\n\nMar 25, 2025, 05:30am\n\nLaw Society VP quits after his comments about rape survivor sparked outcry\n\nMar 14, 2025, 02:23am\n\nNetizens praise Shanmugam for calm response after two women disrupt Meet-the-People session\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8619189b2f0eca8f56d252a7454a0e34d738cfe7fdbeb3419b617de8a0d2fe3f/unnamed20283829_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Individuals who want to carry out armed violence abroad will be arrested. said Minister for Home Affairs and Law K.

In 2015, they rented a flat together.\n\nIn February 2017, the man lost his job and could not remain in Singapore for long periods of time. By May 2017, she asked him to move out because she wanted to end the relationship.\n\nThe court pointed out that the woman had not communicated with the man since July 21, 2017, until he turned up at the flat unannounced on Aug 2, 2017. This was despite the fact that he had sent her more than 100 messages during this period.\n\nThe woman's response to his return, including staying with her aunt for two days, showed that she was totally uninterested in interacting with him, said the court.\n\nThe man's behaviour after the alleged rape also betrayed his guilt, said the court.\n\nAfter the assault, he took her to a nearby clinic, where she told the doctor that the man had sexually assaulted her. The doctor told his assistant to call the police, and the accused left before the police arrived.\n\nHe then sent the victim more than 60 messages apologising to her and begging her not to make a police report. He also sent voice messages to his family members, saying he was afraid that she would accuse him of \"attempted rape\".\n\n\"If he held the genuine belief that he and (the victim) had consensual sex, there would have been absolutely no reason for him to assume that the police was at the clinic because of him,\" said the court.\n\nFinally, the Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge that the woman's credibility was affected by inconsistencies in her evidence.\n\nThe apex court agreed that the woman was inconsistent when she told the clinic doctor she last had sex with the man in November 2016 and, later in court, admitted that the last time was in March 2017.\n\nHowever, this did not affect the pivotal point of the evidence that their relationship had ended before August 2017, said the court.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f04330b128984541e341c6e1eea855a6285ef5e2c2e45a0f462986521f403374/yuserape11_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The accused claimed that the bruises on the woman's neck were \"love bites\".", "caption": "The accused claimed that the bruises on the woman's neck were \"love bites\".

Shanmugam said on Wednesday.\n\n\"We've made clear our policy that if you think of going abroad to fight for any cause, we'll arrest you and we have a zero-tolerance approach,\" he said. \"We have arrested others who have similarly thought of going to fight.\"\n\nISD said in a statement that Khairul, who is Singaporean, was ready to travel to Gaza, Palestine to carry out armed violence, and had planned to do so under the guise of humanitarian aid to avoid detection.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 2, 2025, 09:39am\n\nTeen ISIS bride wannabe issued restriction order; first female teen dealt with under ISA\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe intended to join Hamas and its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (AQB), and take part in armed combat against the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), it added.\n\nKhairul was willing to abide by any instructions given by Hamas, including armed combat, kidnapping, and even executing prisoners of war. He was confident of applying the weapons-handling skills and fieldcraft acquired during his National Service, which he served from 2004 to 2006, to engage in armed combat, said ISD.\n\n\"Khairul was certain that he would achieve martyrdom if he were to die while performing armed jihad,\" said ISD.\n\nHe was willing to provide medical aid to Hamas and AQB soldiers using the basic first-aid skills he had acquired. He also attempted to learn Arabic to facilitate communication with Hamas and AQB soldiers when in Gaza.\n\n\"He believed that Hamas and AQB were the legitimate defenders of the Palestinians and that their acts of violence against the IDF were justified in Islam,\" said ISD.\n\nISD said Khairul also considered being a spokesperson and international recruiter for Hamas, and was prepared to facilitate the travel of any individuals interested in joining the armed conflict.\n\n\"He believed that it was his religious obligation to 'spread the truth' about the conflict, and intended to report on the situation in Gaza if he managed to travel there,\" said ISD. \"He was convinced that providing first-hand updates of the conflict on social media would increase the credibility of his postings and encourage others to join Hamas.\"\n\nISD said that apart from Khairul's support for armed violence, he also holds segregationist and hard-line religious beliefs, and had attempted without success to influence his family members and children to hold such views.\n\nFor example, he shared videos of lectures by radical Indian preacher Zakir Naik on his Facebook page, including one in which Zakir stated that Muslims should not wish Christians \"Merry Christmas\". He also forbade his children from celebrating birthdays.\n\nISD said its investigations so far showed that Khairul had acted alone and there was no sign that he tried to involve others in his plans to travel to Gaza to carry out armed violence.\n\nThere is also no indication thus far that Khairul harboured any intention to carry out attacks in Singapore.\n\nMr Shanmugam said that investigations have not turned up evidence that Khairul had tried to influence his students on his beliefs, such as towards armed violence or in support of Hamas.\n\nMOE said in response to queries that Khairul has not been teaching any classes since October 2022.\n\n\"This case reflects the ever-present dangers of radicalisation, including online radicalisation, which all of us must remain vigilant against,\" said the ministry. \"MOE regards this case very seriously and will continue to work closely with ISD and the community to safeguard our schools and students against such threats.\"\n\nSelf-radicalised online\n\nISD said Khairul's interest in the Israel-Palestine conflict began in 2007 after he viewed Facebook videos that purportedly showed Israeli acts of aggression against Palestinians, including women and children.\n\nHis subsequent online research into the conflict entrenched his belief that the Israelis, particularly the IDF, were oppressing the Palestinians.\n\nHe was further convinced of the need to engage in armed defence of the Palestinians after he watched videos by radical foreign preachers such as Ahmed Deedat and Zakir, which discussed the concept of armed jihad in defence of Islam.\n\nAhmed, who died in 2005, was barred from entering Singapore in 1982 after making inflammatory speeches here and inciting local Muslims to be militant against other groups. Zakir, his protege, was barred from entering Singapore since 2014 for his segregationist and extremist teachings.\n\nKhairul had first considered travelling to Gaza in 2012 after coming across a poster on Facebook calling for volunteers for a humanitarian mission to Gaza. Titled Panggilan Jihad! (Call to Jihad!), the poster indicated that Hamas and AQB were waiting for the volunteers.\n\nWhile he did not follow through on this intention in 2012, ISD said Khairul would feel compelled to travel to Gaza whenever the conflict escalated, such as in 2014 and 2021. But he did not do so each time as Israel had closed its borders to Gaza in 2014, while Covid-19 restrictions prevented him from travelling in 2021.\n\n\"Nonetheless, Khairul continues to harbour hopes of travelling to Gaza, and admitted that he would be motivated to act should the situation deteriorate further,\" said ISD.\n\nISD said Khairul had made preparations to travel to Gaza since 2012, with the aim of establishing contact with Hamas and AQB upon his arrival.\n\nHe researched travel routes and flights to Gaza, and sought the advice of foreign individuals who were either based in or intended to travel to Gaza. He also researched intensively into Hamas and AQB, including viewing materials on their tactics and operations, ISD added.\n\nISD said he was issued an Order of Detention under the Internal Security Act with effect from Nov 30, 2022.\n\n\"Given his deeply entrenched radical beliefs and support for armed violence, Khairul poses an imminent threat and has been issued an Order of Detention,\" it said.\n\nFirm action against anyone intent on armed violence\n\nFirm action will be taken against any individual in Singapore who supports, promotes, undertakes or makes preparations to undertake armed violence, regardless of how they rationalise such violence, or where the violence takes place, ISD said on Wednesday.\n\n\"This is particularly so if the person involved is a public servant,\" it said.\n\nISD said it has been working with other government agencies and community partners to reach out to different segments in the community, to raise public awareness of the threat of terrorism and online radicalisation.\n\nIn particular, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has been a key partner since 2007 to reach out to educators, students and youths.\n\nIn view of the growing trend of youth radicalisation, such outreach efforts have been intensified in recent years, it added. Eight self-radicalised Singaporean youths aged between 16 and 20 have been issued with Orders of Detention or Restriction Orders (RO) under the ISA since 2015.\n\nIn 2022, ISD organised at least 69 counter-terrorism or counter-radicalisation outreach events, both online and in-person, for more than 2,300 participants including student leaders, educators and other school staff.\n\nSeparately, ISD said on Wednesday that ROs under the ISA against three Singaporeans were allowed to lapse upon expiry as they had shown good progress in their rehabilitation.\n\nOne of them, Mohamed Rashid Zainal Abidin, 63, is a former Jemaah Islamiyah member who was detained in May 2006 and\n\nreleased on an RO in May 2014.\n\nHis RO was allowed to lapse in May 2022.\n\nDian Faezah Ismail, 40, a self-radicalised individual who supported the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria,\n\nwas issued with an RO in August 2016.\n\nHer RO was allowed to lapse in August 2022.\n\nThe last person is Razali Abas, 60, a self-radicalised individual who supported the use of armed violence against the perceived enemies of Islam who was\n\nissued with an RO in October 2018.\n\nHis RO was allowed to lapse in October 2022.\n\nPeople with ROs are not allowed to change their residence or employment or travel out of Singapore without the approval of the Director of ISD. They also cannot access the Internet or social media, issue public statements, or be a member of any organisation, association or group, among other restrictions, without the approval of the Director of ISD.\n\nGoh Yan Han\n\nPolitical Correspondent\n\nINTERNAL SECURITY ACT\n\nSECURITY ISSUES\n\nterrorism\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 10, 2025, 06:29am\n\nStudent, housewife dealt with by ISD\n\nJan 9, 2025, 06:29am\n\nISD detains 3 self-radicalised men who made preparations to fight overseas\n\nNov 22, 2024, 06:04am\n\nS'pore woman under probe for suspected terrorism-related activities\n\nJul 15, 2024, 02:04pm\n\nSelf-radicalised S'porean teen, 14, given ISA restriction orders\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nNo foul play is suspected based on preliminary investigations.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 26, 2025, 02:17am\n\nMan dies after CTE accident involving 2 lorries, driver arrested\n\nMore related stories\n\nMacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling, who was at the block on Sunday, told ST that she believes the deceased lived alone.\n\n\"My grassroots volunteers knew about her and reached out to her regularly, including offering to help clean her house,\" said Ms Tin.\n\n\"She didn't really engage with us. Even on the rare occasion she opened the door, she didn't open it fully.\"\n\nBlock 100 in Aljunied Crescent has 12 floors with 198 one-room rental flats.\n\nResidents who live on the block's 10th floor said the deceased mostly kept to herself and rarely spoke to her neighbours. It is unclear if she had any relatives.\n\nMr Seah Quee, 64, a long-time resident who stays two units away from the deceased, said: \"I've lived here for 13 years and spoken to her only briefly once or twice. I've never seen anyone visit her.\"\n\nAnother resident, Mr Rahmat Asjadi, said he sometimes saw the deceased at the void deck feeding cats.\n\n\"When I saw her along the corridor or in the lift, I would say 'hi', but she wouldn't return the greeting. Her door was always closed, and she didn't speak to the other neighbours,\" said the 54-year-old electrician.\n\nWhen ST visited the block on Tuesday, many units on the 10th floor had their doors shut, and there was an odour coming from the flat where the dead woman used to live.\n\nShin Min Daily News reported on Tuesday that the deceased's flat was extremely cluttered. The place had to be cleaned before her body could be removed from it.\n\nMs Tin said it is heartbreaking when she hears of such cases where seniors die alone at home.\n\n\"We can only keep reaching out in hopes that seniors will feel encouraged to open up and engage with us.

He would put in a morning's worth of work, helping to take orders and handling cashier duties at his father's chicken rice stall.\n\n\"I would usually help out before going to school in the afternoon,\" he said, adding that he would be back at the stall after school to help clean and wipe down utensils and cutlery.\n\nAt 27, he is already a seasoned hawker - he joined the family-owned Seng Heng Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice, a mainstay at Bukit Timah Market and Food Centre, after he completed his national service in 2016.\n\n\"I was 21 at that time. I studied up till ITE Nitec and decided to stop studying and help out in the business,\" he said.\n\nMr Jermaine Choo De Wei, head chef at the newly opened Dan Lao at Maxwell Food Centre, which sells scrambled-egg rice bowls, is also no stranger to the food and beverage industry, having helped his parents during his primary school days at French restaurant Vis-a-vis, which closed in 2012.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 29, 2025, 05:02am\n\nCashback for purchases via DBS PayLah app returns from July 12\n\nMore related stories\n\nHis cooking adventure began then - at age 11, he was helping to put out cold sides at the restaurant.\n\n\"I've been in the F&B industry my entire life - it's all I know,\" said the 23-year-old.\n\nIn a trade where the median age of practitioners is 60, the two Singaporeans' youthfulness stands out.\n\nBut they are not alone. Efforts aimed at injecting fresh blood into the trade over the past five years - starting from before Singapore's hawker culture was\n\nadded to the Unesco Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\n\nin 2020 - have brought in 64 new hawkers, whose median age is 35.\n\nThey come from two main programmes. One is the National Environment Agency's (NEA) Incubation Stall Programme (ISP), begun in 2018, where newcomers run their businesses at pre-fitted stalls with reduced stall rental for 15 months.\n\nIn 2020, NEA also\n\nlaunched the Hawkers Development Programme\n\n(HDP) to equip aspiring hawkers with the skills to run their own businesses. It provides classroom training, apprenticeships with veterans and mentorship support.\n\nSome new, younger hawkers have taken a practical approach when it comes to tackling the perennial issues of long hours and manpower shortages in the industry.\n\nMr Leong Gwo Wei, 40, owner of Lim Bo Fresh Fruits Rojak at a new hawker centre in One Punggol, which opened in October 2022, has implemented shorter operating hours at his stall - from 12pm to 6pm - to ensure that working hours are attractive to staff.\n\nHe has also hired a 78-year-old man as a shop attendant.\n\nLim Bo Fresh Fruits Rojak owner Leong Gwo Wei has implemented shorter operating hours at his stall to ensure that working hours are attractive to staff. ST PHOTO: JASON QUAH\n\nMr Leong, who entered the trade two years ago, said: \"We don't really get inquiries from people below 40 and among those, some would not even turn up for their scheduled interviews.\"\n\nHe is glad to have taken on his helper, describing him as the most reliable worker he has had.\n\nAnother pet peeve among those in the trade - a difficult working environment - may also be addressed as new and better-designed hawker centres come on board, while existing ones undergo refurbishments to become cleaner and more productive.\n\nFor instance, the new One Punggol Hawker Centre has high ceilings to maximise airflow, as well as a conveyor-belt tray-clearing station. This keeps the hawker centre relatively breezy and uncluttered, with no uncleared trays.\n\nAt the\n\nnewly opened Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre,\n\nhawkers can tap a mobile app that allows customers to place orders and be alerted when their food is ready, helping to take the headache out of queue management.\n\nMeanwhile, Geylang Serai Market and Cheng San Market and Cooked Food Centre will be the first two existing centres which will be refurbished under the Hawker Centres Transformation Programme from the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe scope of the works will include the reconfiguration of seats to enhance circulation, ventilation enhancements such as new fittings and fans, and changes to existing infrastructure such as toilets for greater ease of cleaning and maintenance, said NEA.\n\nSeng Heng's Mr Lee and Dan Lao's Mr Choo said work as a hawker is no walk in the park.\n\n\"The hardest part of being a hawker is the amount of sacrifice needed,\" Mr Lee said, noting how having to wake up early and ending late at night often means the end of one's social life.\n\n\"You'll just be too tired at the end of the day,\" he added.\n\nFor Mr Choo, one of the biggest adjustments he has had to make as a hawker is the much smaller space at his stall in Maxwell Food Centre compared with the commercial kitchen he was used to at Eggslut, his last workplace.\n\n\"In Maxwell Food Centre, you have to wash your own dishes,\" he added.\n\n\"Cooking and prepping are very quick, but washing takes a million years,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nMr Jermaine Choo De Wei hopes to make his scrambled-egg rice bowl a hawker staple within a decade. ST PHOTO: JASON QUAH\n\nDespite the hardship, both men are set to remain hawkers.\n\nMr Lee is hoping to expand the business of his family's 42-year-old chicken rice stall some day.\n\nHe added that this can happen only when he is confident of the quality and consistency of the food across stalls.\n\nFor now, he remains focused on nailing down the basics of the business.\n\n\"There's always room for improvement, even if we are doing the same thing over and over again every day,\" he said.\n\nMr Lee Jiaming is hoping to expand the business of his family’s 42-year-old chicken rice stall some day. PHOTO: COURTESY OF LEE JIAMING\n\nMr Choo said he is in it for the long haul, and hopes to make his scrambled-egg rice bowl a hawker staple within a decade.\n\n\"I want to keep refining my craft here so I can maintain the quality of food I'm serving,\" he said.\n\nStill, concerns remain over whether more young people will join the trade. The 64 new hawkers who did so were among more than 540 people who participated in NEA's programmes or similar programmes led by its operators, according to NEA's data.\n\nHawker bosses are also unable to offer the perks associated with working in an office, such as pay increments and opportunities for advancement.\n\nBut for Ms Lee Kai Jun, 25, the hawker trade is not without its draws.\n\nMs Lee Kai Jun (centre), a second-generation hawker at Guo Qin Noodle, with her husband Andrea Goh and sister Lee Xiu Er.

With more people helping out, she said she has been able to take more days off.\n\nShe added: \"Unlike office work, when my work day is over, I don't have to think about work any more and can simply enjoy my time.\"\n\nAndrew Wong\n\nand\n\nGena Soh\n\nHAWKER CENTRES\n\nHAWKER FOOD\n\nmakan\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 29, 2025, 07:43am\n\nMan arrested for allegedly assaulting diner after noodle stall collision\n\nMay 22, 2025, 11:47pm\n\nSpell it wrong, cook it right: Meet the smiling owner of Happy Briyani\n\nMay 15, 2025, 02:32am\n\nHotpot horror: Diner blames restaurant's faulty chopsticks for loose tooth, seeks compensation\n\nMay 13, 2025, 03:11am\n\nTo help the needy, hawker sells Malay food for $2.50\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/35423b81786ee5d5366d4b21e56f999f7afddfe46b40898bba3e348da4f3b158/hznew070122_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Hawkers (clockwise from top left) Lee Jiaming, Jermaine Choo De Wei, Leong Gwo Wei, Lee Xiu Er, Lee Kai Jun and Andrea Goh.

Her job included bathing and feeding the children.\n\nShe began teaching the boy in 2020 and was aware that he had been found to have delayed speech development. He had earlier been assessed to likely have autism.\n\nAt around 12.30pm on Dec 2, 2020, she escorted the pre-schoolers to a room for their nap time\n\nWhile her colleague attended to another child with special needs, she sat next to the boy to try and get him to sleep.\n\nThe offender, who was tired and had not eaten her lunch, became frustrated when he failed to doze off.\n\nAt about 12.35pm, she pulled him up by the shoulders and pushed him forward, causing him to roll on the floor.\n\nWhen he sat up, she grabbed him by his left arm and dragged him across the floor.\n\nShe pulled his ears, scratching his neck in the process. He covered both his ears in pain.\n\nDespite this, she pulled his left ear about three minutes later, and he cowered in pain.\n\nShe pushed his head up, grabbed his arms and turned him towards her before she pulled his ears again.\n\nAt 12.52pm, she pulled him towards her by the back of his T-shirt.\n\nAbout two minutes later, she pushed him from the back, causing him to fall forward. After that, she pulled him towards her again.\n\nHer colleague heard the boy crying during the incident, which was captured by a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera in the room.\n\nWhen a maid came to pick him up at about 4.30pm, the offender lied, claiming she accidentally scratched his neck when he struggled while she was trying to pat him to sleep.\n\nThe mother lodged a complaint with the pre-school after she noticed multiple scratches on her son's neck.\n\nLater that day, the offender lied to the principal about the incident, but was later shown the CCTV footage.\n\nOn Dec 3, 2020, the principal told the mother that the offender admitted to handling the boy in a rough manner.\n\nHe was taken to hospital for medical attention on Dec 4, 2020 and his abuser was fired that day.\n\nHis mother alerted the police on Dec 5, 2020, and officers arrested the offender on July 21, 2022.\n\nOn Wednesday, she was offered bail of $10,000 and told to surrender at the State Courts on Jan 30 to begin serving her sentence.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nCRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN/MINORS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6abf2d979208c6f0a61863f4bc68d6cb4a5de263a75e78620df427c52da0ad88/gavel.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nREUTERS\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 11, 2023, 08:21am\n\nGolden Globes 2023: A night of uplift for overlooked, underappreciated nominees\n\nShare this article\n\nThis year's Golden Globes took on the aura of a feel-good movie when artistes who had been overlooked or underappreciated walked away with prizes.\n\nOn Tuesday night in Los Angeles (Wednesday morning in Singapore), actors Ke Huy Quan, Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Coolidge and Tyler James Williams were among the winners whose speeches touched on validation and acceptance.\n\nThe Telugu-language action movie RRR, by earning India's first Golden Globe win, provided another uplifting moment. Its song, Naatu Naatu, written by M.M. Keeravani and sung by Rahul Sipligunj and Kaala Bhairava, won Best Original Song, beating tunes performed by Lady Gaga and Rihanna.\n\nIt all kicked off with Vietnam-born actor Quan, 51, winning the first category of the night, Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture award for his role in the hit action comedy Everything Everywhere All At Once. The child actor who first appeared as the boy sidekick Short Round in Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom (1984) saw doors shut in his face as he grew older.\n\n\"I started to wonder if that was it, if that was just luck. For so many years, I was afraid that I had nothing more to offer. Thankfully, 30 years later, two guys thought of me,\" said a teary Quan, referring to Everything's writer-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\nMore related stories\n\nLater that evening, it was the turn of his castmate, Malaysian veteran Yeoh, to receive a prize, for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.\n\nIt was her first Golden Globe nomination. Until that moment, the actress who established herself in Hong Kong gongfu cinema before taking her first Hollywood feature role in the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) had been largely ignored by major awards committees.\n\nDespite appearing in commercial and critical hits such as the Oscar-winning wuxia film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Yeoh's status in Hollywood was similar to that of the stars of the South Korean black comedy Parasite (2019) - she was admired, but was considered too foreign for mainstream awards voters in the United States and Europe.\n\n\"40 years,\" she said in her speech, referring to the period between the release of her first film, the Hong Kong action comedy The Owl Vs Bombo (1984) and the present day.\n\n\"I remember when I first came to Hollywood, it was a dream. Then I got here,\" she said, to laughter.\n\n\"I was told I was a minority. And then someone said to me, 'You speak English?' And I said, 'Yes, the flight here was 13 hours, so I learnt,\" she added, to more laughs.\n\nShe was also fighting the Hollywood stigma against older actresses.\n\n\"I'm 60. You women understand this - as the number of years gets bigger, the opportunities get smaller,\" she said.\n\nThe feel-good vibe carried on when American actress Coolidge, 61, won the award for Supporting Actress - Limited Anthology Series or Television Film for her role in The White Lotus 2, beating favourites Niecy Nash-Betts (Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story) and castmate Aubrey Plaza.\n\nIt was a fitting reward for an actress best known for her scene-stealing turns in comedies American Pie (1999) and Best In Show (2000), as she also starred in a satire about awards shows, For Your Consideration (2006).\n\nIn 2021, she became a fan favourite in the first season of The White Lotus, which caused show creator Mike White to bring her back for the second season.\n\nIn an emotional acceptance speech on Wednesday, she said that without the support of five Hollywood insiders who two decades kept her career alive with \"little jobs\", she would have given up.\n\n\"These little jobs kept me going,\" she said.\n\nLike Quan, Williams was a child actor. The 30-year-old broke out in his starring role in the sitcom Everybody Hates Chris (2005-2009). His career momentum slowed after the show ended. Then came the sitcom set in a school, Abbott Elementary (2021-present), in which he plays Gregory Eddie, a shy teacher.\n\nIn a surprise victory that spoke to the evening's mood of artistes finally getting their due, he beat predicted winners like veterans John Turturro (Severance) and Henry Winkler (Barry) in the Supporting Actor - TV Comedy or Drama category.\n\nIn his speech, Williams dedicated his win to teachers like his character.\n\n\"This is a win for Gregory Eddie. And for his story and for stories like his,\" he said.\n\nLIST OF WINNERS AT THE 80th GOLDEN GLOBES\n\nFEATURE FILMS\n\nBest Motion Picture - Drama: The Fabelmans\n\nBest Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy: The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nBest Director - Motion Picture: Steven Spielberg, The Fabelmans\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama: Austin Butler, Elvis\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama: Cate Blanchett, Tar\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy: Michelle Yeoh, Everything Everywhere All at Once\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy: Colin Farrell, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in Any Motion Picture: Angela Bassett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in Any Motion Picture: Ke Huy Quan, Everything Everywhere All at Once\n\nBest Screenplay - Motion Picture: Martin McDonagh, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nBest Original Score - Motion Picture: Justin Hurwitz, Babylon\n\nBest Original Song - Motion Picture: Naatu Naatu, Kaala Bhairava, M.M.

The Banshees O Inisherin, the story of feuding friends on an Irish island, won best movie musical or comedy.\n\nThe awards are likely to give both movies a boost on the road to the Academy Awards in March.\n\nCelebrities and broadcaster NBC abandoned the 2022 Globes because of ethical lapses at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the group that hands out the awards.\n\nA larger, more diverse membership and other changes by the HFPA persuaded many of the biggest movie and TV stars to support this year's ceremony, which provides publicity for winners and nominees and often boosts their chances at the Oscars.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 9, 2024, 09:02am\n\nActor Mark Hamill has a Star Wars 'family reunion' at Golden Globes\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe show unfolded largely as it had in years past, except for a biting monologue from comedian and host Jerrod Carmichael who opened the show joking, \"I'm here because I'm black.\"\n\n\"One day you're making mint tea at home. The next day you're invited to be the black face of an embattled white organisation,\" he said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on Comcast's NBC network and streamed on Peacock.\n\nRoughly 200 journalists and others from the international film industry voted on this year's Globes. Among those voters, nearly 52 per cent are racially and ethnically diverse, including 10 per cent who are black, according to the HFPA. - REUTERS\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nGolden Globes: Steven Spielberg claims top honours\n\nGolden Globes: Michelle Yeoh wins best actress in musical/comedy\n\nGolden Globes\n\nAWARDS AND PRIZES\n\nMovies\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 8, 2024, 06:13am\n\nOppenheimer tops Golden Globes on bittersweet night for Barbie\n\nJan 8, 2024, 03:32am\n\nCillian Murphy wins best drama film actor Oppenheimer, Emma Stone wins best comedy film actress\n\nDec 12, 2023, 05:39am\n\n'Barbenheimer' tops newly revamped Golden Globes nominations\n\nJan 12, 2023, 07:25am\n\nGolden Globes slump to new ratings low on return from scandal\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Many rocked elegant, floor-length dresses in hues of pink, blue and black, with actresses Anya Taylor-Joy and Lily James adding memorable pops of yellow and fiery orange-red.\n\nLeading men Austin Butler and Evan Peters - nominated for their roles in biopic Elvis and true crime series Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story respectively - played it safe in a sea of classic black tuxes.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nMore related stories\n\nHere are some of the best and worst looks of the event.\n\nBest\n\nJenna Ortega\n\nPHOTO: REUTERS\n\nThe 20-year-old American actress and breakout star of the season, who portrayed Wednesday Addams in the hit Netflix series Wednesday, looked all grown up in draped brown Gucci.\n\nFloor-skimming sleeves balanced out the tasteful cut-outs showing off Ortega's toned abs, while Tiffany & Co. jewellery pulled the somewhat bohemian look together.\n\nBe honest here - how many of us were expecting her to turn up in all black?\n\nMargot Robbie\n\nPHOTO: REUTERS\n\nIt is not exactly Barbiecore, but the Australian star of the upcoming film Barbie was still a vision - albeit a rather stiff one - in baby-pink Chanel haute couture, which reportedly included 30,000 elements of embroidery and took 750 hours to create.\n\nMichelle Yeoh\n\nMichelle Yeoh poses with her award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy Motion Picture for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” at the 80th Annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California.

He was successfully resuscitated by a team of doctors, but died the following day.\n\nThe Singapore Medical Council's disciplinary tribunal said the patient's chances of surviving the embolism was very low. But that chance may have been further lowered by Dr Islam Md Towfique's delay in recognising the changes in the patient's vital signs and consequent delay in taking action.\n\nDr Islam told the tribunal it was common practice for anaesthetists to leave the operating theatre for short periods of time.\n\nThe patient, 64, had surgery performed at Gleneagles Hospital on a fracture caused by his bone marrow cancer on Sept 1, 2016. Given his age, obesity, prior heart problems and cancer, he was \"considered a high anaesthetic risk patient\", said the tribunal.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 19, 2024, 04:03pm\n\nDoctor suspended for trying to record another showering at hospital\n\nMore related stories\n\nDuring the operation, his oxygen reading fell below 90 per cent, \"into the 80s and 70s\". In a normal person, the SpO2 or the amount of oxygen the blood can carry should be in the range of 96-99 per cent. Despite that, the oxygen given to the patient was not increased.\n\nThe hospital's parent company, Parkway Pantai ltd, pointed out in a letter to Dr Islam, \"Increasing the oxygen delivery is one of the first few actions that an anaesthetist should initiate when a patient's SpO2 falls, and yet for almost 50 minutes, with the SpO2 either un-recordable or in an unacceptable range, this remedial action was not taken.\"\n\nIn his defence, Dr Islam, a veteran doctor, said: \"I was with the patient and did apply my expertise to keep the Haemodynamics but I forgot to increase the oxygen to 100 per cent.\"\n\nParkway suspended him for six months in 2017, and reported the incident to the SMC.\n\nThe expert for the SMC, which was the prosecuting body, said things can go wrong very quickly \"so we need to be there … there's not at any point … that it's safe for an anaesthetist to leave the patient.\"\n\nHe added that \"all you need is less than a minute for things to go wrong\".\n\nThe tribunal agreed with the prosecution that the potential harm to the patient from Dr Islam's multiple departures from the operating theatre \"would be serious injury or even death\".\n\nAccording to the hospital CCTV in the corridor outside the operating theatre, Dr Islam left the operating theatre \"multiple times\". The longest period he was gone was nine minutes.\n\nAside from those times, Dr Islam also went several times to the adjoining induction room, but these were not recorded by the CCTV.\n\nDr Islam had argued that there was nothing wrong with his leaving the operating theatre for short periods as this \"behaviour would not be that different from that of his other anaesthetic colleagues\".\n\nThe surgeon who had carried out the operation and who gave evidence on behalf of Dr Islam at the hearing, said the anaesthetist has continued to leave the operating theatre to take phone calls.\n\nThe tribunal rejected Dr Islam's contention that the harm caused by his behaviour was minimal, as the prospect of surviving the blockage to the lung was minimal.\n\nIt said such a defence \"would lead to an illogical outcome where a doctor treating a patient whose condition makes the prospects of survival low, is able to take less care, because the chances of survival were small in any event\".\n\nThe tribunal also agreed with the SMC that such misconduct \"causes significant harm to public confidence in the medical profession and the healthcare system.\n\n\"The respondent's conduct in repeatedly leaving the operating theatre to attend to phone calls which he acknowledged were not urgent, would shock the public and harm public confidence in the medical profession.\"\n\nIt also disagreed with Dr Islam's claim that his conduct was not motivated by financial gain.\n\nMost of the calls were from patients both overseas and local, wanting to know when they could come for treatment, so he \"was simply servicing other patients who would be paying his fees after coming to Singapore for treatment\".\n\nDr Islam also asked for a one-third reduction of his sentence, given the long time it has taken for the case to be heard.\n\nBut given that he has continued the practice of accepting calls in the midst of surgery, the tribunal said a one-sixth reduction was more appropriate.\n\nIt reduced his 36-month suspension to 30 months. He also has to pay the costs and expenses of the proceedings, including the cost of SMC's lawyers, and undertake to refrain from such conduct in the future.\n\nSalma Khalik\n\nSenior Health Correspondent\n\nSINGAPORE MEDICAL COUNCIL\n\nDOCTORS/SURGEONS\n\nDISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS\n\nPATIENTS\n\nsurgery\n\nPrivate hospitals\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 19, 2023, 06:23am\n\nMOH investigating case involving firm allegedly offering healthcare awards for money\n\nDec 11, 2023, 06:48am\n\nDoctor who allegedly gave fake Covid-19 jabs asks for restrictions instead of suspension\n\nSep 5, 2023, 09:58am\n\nOrthopaedic surgeon suspended 18 months in interim move to protect public\n\nAug 1, 2023, 11:16am\n\nAt least 3 patients had urgent treatments delayed by doctor who put them through needless tests\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4ac88fd3393f8994adf220db559dd9543d9d781593accab80596596402da4cd4/svoperation100123_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "According to CCTV footage, the anaesthetist left the operating theatre “multiple times”, with the longest period being nine minutes.", "caption": "According to CCTV footage, the anaesthetist left the operating theatre “multiple times”, with the longest period being nine minutes.

Ignore his last run, as he had a torrid run in transit and finished last. He should bounce back in Race 7 at Happy Valley on Wednesday.\n\nPHOTO: HKJC\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 10, 2023, 02:42pm\n\nPacking Award should redeem himself\n\nShare this article\n\nRace 1 (1,200m)\n\n11 All Is Good has found a suitable contest. He has been knocking on the door and the inside draw should give him every possible chance to break through. 1 Exuberant has the class but needs to piece it together. He was a good third last start. Another win is nearing. 9 Prime Mortar has hit the ground running. He has shown improvement with each and every outing. 12 Miracles finished an impressive second last start. The light weight is a big plus.\n\nRace 2 (1,800m)\n\n3 Owners' Star is mixing his form but should improve sharply in Class 5. Drawn well, he should get every chance under the in-form Karis Teetan. 1 Regency Master is also much better suited in Class 5. He is in sound condition and will be finishing fast for Matthew Poon. 6 Jubilation missed narrowly last start. The wide gate is not ideal but the long run into the straight should afford him enough time to find a spot. 5 Sunny Baby is in form and pairs favourably with Zac Purton. Keep safe.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\n3 High Cloud is racing well and should relish the step back in trip. He pairs favourably with Teetan, who should be able to give him a sweet run in transit from Gate 4. 8 Melbourne Hall is holding his condition. Hugh Bowman and David Hall have formed a formidable jockey-trainer partnership and their good fortune can continue. 2 Hero Star can lead. He usually gets caught late but he will still give himself every chance. 10 Jazz Steed slots in light and knows what to do at Happy Valley. Keep safe.\n\nRace 4 (1,000m)\n\n2 Handsome Bo Bo should get a nice trail behind the leading duo. He can turn his form around at Happy Valley, which is where he clearly does his best racing. Expect some value. 1 Whizz Kid is ultra consistent. He has yet to finish further than fourth in 14 starts, winning five times. The speedster should roll forward and may take some catching. 5 Ping Hai Galaxy is holding his form this season. The grey gets his chance again. 8 Street Scream is already a three-time winner for trainer Tony Cruz this term. The strong booking of Vincent Ho commands respect.\n\nRace 5 (1,200m)\n\n5 Happy Fat Cat can roll forward. He is chasing back-to-back wins and the draw is more than suitable. He also remains in Class 4, which suits, and his racing pattern always affords him his shot. 10 Happy Soul is in form and is so close to a first win. He slots in light and will be finishing fast. 3 Momentum Galaxy is solid. He has been around for a while now and the seven-year-old knows exactly what it is all about. 6 Solar Partner can turn his form around. He is better than what his last start suggests.\n\nRace 6 (1,650m)\n\n6 Palace Pal was not suited to 2,200m last time. He can make an improvement back over this trip. His past performances have shown that this is where he is at his best. 10 Perfect To Great is chasing back-to-back successes. He slots in light and is suited in Class 4. 8 Smiling City is not without a chance. It is crucial for him that he saves ground throughout, which Gate 3 should afford. 3 Lucky Gold has been knocking on the door. He can win in this grade soon enough.\n\nRace 7 (1,800m)\n\n7 Packing Award is a very nice horse and he can turn his form around, after his torrid run in transit last start. He travelled wide and could not settle throughout. His first-up win is his true form. He is good enough to bounce back for win No. 7 at his 16th start. 5 Cheerful Days has been building up nicely for this contest. He caught the eye last start and should improve further. 2 Money Catcher can lead. He placed at Group 1 level last start, which holds him in good stead. 11 Nearly Fine loves the course and distance.\n\nRace 8 (1,650m)\n\n8 Gift Of Lifeline is dangerous with this rating and a return to Happy Valley should also spark sharp improvement. His latest trial at the city circuit was impressive. 3 Encountered is chasing back-to-back wins. He is in form and looks to have plenty of rating points in hand. 5 Master Delight mixes his form but is open to improvement. The booking of Purton suggests strong intent. 7 Maldives is in form and remains a huge threat. Keep safe.\n\nRace 9 (1,200m)\n\n3 Humble Star won on protest last time. He should get the win in his own right this time, as he appears to have a fair bit of ability. He has drawn well and is capable of scoring again. 1 Star Brite knows what he is doing and is favoured from Gate 2 with Bowman up. 11 Savvy Chic should lead this group from the innermost barrier. Chances are he will try to gap them turning for home, which could see him prove difficult to reel in. 4 Armour Eagle is racing well and can improve. But Gate 12 is tricky.\n\n*Comments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

After finishing runner-up in both starts over 1,200m, he can open his account. (1) CORSICAN finished third to stablemate Barbatti last time on Dec 28. Stripping fitter and favourably drawn in Gate 1, he could finish stronger. (3) L'ULTIMO was second last time on Dec 5. He finished ahead of Barbatti (second) and could give Corsican a hard time. Watch out for (2) CAPTAIN CORRUPT, who could be anything in his Polytrack debut.\n\nRace 2 (1,400m)\n\n(1) SEA OF TEARS has been campaigning over sprint distances but is bred to enjoy this longer trip. It is a maiden handicap and she could still get it right from Gate 1. (2) DILLUH showed potential in her penultimate start, coming from last to finish fourth on this surface. She was not too far off Sea Of Tears and could be dangerous at the weights. (6) MISSION ROCKS and (4) PIXIE IN LOVE look to be in the right race to put up their best effort. The Highveld-based (7) LITTLE LADY may relish the Poly surface.\n\nRace 3 (2,000m)\n\nThis could turn into a two-horse duel between (2) JOHNNY'S HOPE and (6) GREENBACKCURRENCY, who is rated one point higher. But Johnny's Hope has a 2.5kg-claiming apprentice aboard and a better gate. It could be a thriller. (7) VALERIAN NIGHT has not done badly in two starts and seems capable of showing a lot more. (1) AGAMEMNON has shown some potential and could get into the money.\n\nRace 4 (1,600m)\n\n(2) FLEET COMMANDER was most unlucky last time when not getting a clear passage at this tight track. That run is best ignored. From Gate 2, he rates a serious chance. (3) ZOOBERI found his last race too short and should relish the longer distance. He enjoys racing handy and should be right there at the finish. (1) CAESURA scored win No. 9 last time. He has drawn the inner-most barrier and should make them all run hard. (5) BEND THE RULES and (8) TOM'S ACT also need to be taken seriously.Race 5 (1,600m) (7) SPIRIT OF MY FATE looks well placed. His rating has come down a bit and he is back on his favourite surface. A slow start might have cost (4) RODRIGUEZ a win last time. He should run another honest race. (5) AL'S MY DADDY has been a bit disappointing but he was second to top Poly specialist Priceless Ruler a few runs back and is dropping in class. (1) GRIMALDI has gone from having the worst draw to the best. He, too, could be competitive again on his favourite surface.\n\nRace 6 (1,000m)\n\n(2) CASA ROSADA is consistent. Drawn well, she could score. (4) ASPOESTERTJIE won a nice race over the 1,000m trip for the first time. She could follow up if she brings that form to the Poly. (10) MAGICALLEE has the pace to overcome her wide draw and could be hard to catch. (8) VISION OF WILL is another that cannot be taken lightly.\n\nRace 7 (1,200m)\n\n(7) AISLING has been dominating on the Poly and looks capable of scoring again. (1) LOVE BOMB has shown high-class potential. From Gate 1, she could mount a strong challenge on her best form. (5) TOTO battled from a wide draw after a slow start last time. That run is best ignored. (3) LADY LEGEND and (2) RETAIL THERAPY deserve respect.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9ca8551ed865e47a825b6334cf14ab48e71d62ca3266eedf8f83d44dd54c12a6/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

South Korea's Hwang Yeon-ju took the bronze with 1,459 pinfalls.\n\nSingapore's Shayna Ng (1,457) and Jazreel Tan (1,453) were fourth and fifth respectively.\n\nVictory on the lanes in Hong Kong will be an early Chinese New Year hongpao for Tan, who won three individual titles in 2022, including the SEA Games women's singles gold, Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) Bowl TV Classic and Singapore Open title. She also finished as the top female bowler at the Brunswick Euro Challenge.\n\nThe 34-year-old said in a phone call from Hong Kong: \"Winning the gold medal feels great and it is a validation of the hard work that I have been putting in over the years.

Others include wastewater monitoring systems around points of entry, such as airports.\n\nXBB.1.5 is yet another descendant of Omicron, the most contagious - and now globally dominant - variant of the virus that causes Covid-19. It is an offshoot of XBB, first detected in October, which is itself a recombinant of two other Omicron subvariants.\n\nConcerns about XBB.1.5 fuelling a fresh spate of cases in the US and beyond are on the rise at the same time\n\nas a surge of COVID cases in China,\n\nafter the country pivoted away from its signature \"zero Covid\" policy last month.\n\nAccording to data reported by the WHO earlier this month, an analysis by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention showed a predominance of Omicron sublineages BA.5.2 and BF.7 among locally acquired infections.\n\nMany scientists - including from the WHO - believe China is likely under-reporting the true extent of its outbreak.\n\nMore than a dozen countries - including the United States - are demanding Covid tests from travellers from China. - REUTERS\n\nWHO\n\ncovid-19\n\nChina\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 1, 2024, 09:08am\n\nS'pore wins WHO Healthy Cities award for Nutri-Grade labels\n\nAug 25, 2024, 12:13am\n\nNo quarantine for residents returning from mpox-affected countries\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nFeb 2, 2024, 02:35am\n\nNew cancer cases to soar 77% to 35m by 2050, WHO warns\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Figures given are up to Nov 30, 2022.\n\nThe majority of successful appellants had already committed to buying the HDB resale flat and had obtained an option to purchase for the flat before the cooling measure took effect on Sept 30, 2022, Mr Lee said.\n\nAn option to purchase is a legal agreement for the sale of a residential property.\n\nAs part of a suite of\n\ncooling measures introduced on Sept 30, 2022,\n\nprivate home owners must wait 15 months after the sale of their current home before they can buy an HDB resale flat without housing grants.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 26, 2025, 06:36am\n\nToilet ceiling in Queenstown flat collapses as woman showers\n\nMore related stories\n\nPreviously, they were allowed to buy a resale flat on the open market if they sold their private property within six months of purchasing the flat.\n\nSince the announcement, some private home owners who recently sold their homes have\n\nfound it difficult to get\n\nalternative accommodation.\n\nMr Lee has said that the 15-month wait-out period is\n\na temporary measure to help moderate demand for HDB resale flats,\n\nas the market showed growing signs of overheating.\n\nOf the 1,284 appeals, 144 were from private home owners aged 55 and above who wanted to buy a five-room or larger HDB resale flat within the 15-month wait-out period.\n\nOf these, 102 appeals have been processed and about 34 per cent of them were successful, said Mr Lee, adding that the majority of successful appellants had obtained an option to purchase for their resale flat before Sept 30.\n\nThose aged 55 and above are exempted from serving the 15-month wait-out period if they buy a four-room or smaller HDB resale flat.

Dize Akira\n\nPerhaps a more compelling reason is the fact that as Kaelus is under two years old, his fare costs just 10 per cent of adult fare.\n\nTo his parents, this is \"a great steal\", especially for first class and Suites cabins that have limited seats.\n\nTheir own tickets are usually paid for using a combination of cash and air miles, says Kaelus' mother.\n\nShe adds that she and her husband's \"main concern has always been to make it easier for [them] to look after [Kaelus] while travelling\".\n\n\"The extra baggage allowance always comes in handy, so it's one less item off our minds when packing as we don't need to worry about weighing the luggages,\" she explained.\n\nThe extra attention from the flight crew also helps.\n\n\"Many of them will ask if we need help washing the milk bottles or cutting his food into bite-sized portions.\"\n\nAnd of course, being in first class gives them more \"peace of mind\" during the pandemic.\n\n\"As there are fewer people travelling in business or first class, there's less of a chance that our baby will fall ill.\"\n\nThough some netizens have pointed out how having kids in premium classes might be a nuisance to other passengers,  Kaelus's mum said: \"Those who have witnessed him on the flights know that he is extremely well-behaved,\" adding it's not just the flight crew who compliment his behaviour, but fellow passengers too.\n\nTIKTOK\n\nFLIGHT\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nparenting\n\ntravel\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 30, 2025, 01:52am\n\nBoy, 10, loses pocket money watching Pokémon on TikTok\n\nJun 27, 2025, 02:42am\n\nElderly man loses $55,000 in TikTok 'store' scam after being lured by 'beauty'\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:04am\n\nWoman called 'embarrassing' for using CDC vouchers on date, sparks online debate\n\nJun 17, 2025, 07:29am\n\n'For which country?': TikTok video of National Day roadblock sparks debate about who really calls Singapore home\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2458d22c30cbdd7e144ab710a828b78dbcb39cc9f35f46302fc17b7f8b9c02e4/20220901_baby_take_first_class.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "SCREENGRABS FROM KRYSFLYER/TIKTOK"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/46c75a7b55adbb6017231f0dc36e75981b5a8de14bdac55557b339024ef987ce/NEWS13.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer's dispute with Singapore fashion brand over wardrobe malfunction goes viral", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dbe1184496f13a898b81ac8b767b25b7bde6e70b813beb4d4b7ff52ba5d5f91a/Pokemon.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Boy, 10, loses pocket money watching Pokémon on TikTok", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIM\n\nTurning on fire hydrants to generate water supply is a basic drill that all firefighters learn in the first phase of their training. They have to get water from a fire hydrant to the fire engine within 45 seconds, and water jets spouting within 40 seconds.\n\nThe NSFs are also trained to handle different types of fires, such as engine room fires, flashover fires - fires that occur simultaneously when there is combustible material in an enclosed area - and ship fires that emerge from pipes and engines.\n\nFor oil refinery scenarios, teams of trainees learn to put out liquefied petroleum gas tank fires and rescue casualties.\n\nSCDF NSFs are trained to handle different types of fires, such as liquefied petroleum gas tank fires, as well as how to rescue casualties.

Thank you for your understanding and support.\"\n\nResponding to queries from The Straits Times, an SPH Media spokesman said that circulation numbers reflect the paid customer base, which is one of the key metrics tracked by media companies.\n\nOn Monday, an SPH Media spokesman had said that staff involved in the issues linked to circulation numbers that were revealed by the internal review had been taken to task or had left the company.\n\nThe inconsistencies in reporting of data resulted in a discrepancy of between 85,000 and 95,000 daily average copies across all titles, which represents 10 to 12 per cent of the reported daily average circulation, he said.\n\nThe spokesman also said that the company had immediately taken steps to strengthen processes.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Mr Wong Wei Kong, Editor-in-Chief of SPH Media's English/Malay/Tamil Media Group, had also sent out an e-mail to staff addressing the news of the issues with circulation data.\n\nMr Wong said that the review of circulation numbers, which began in March 2022 - three months after SPH Media was hived off from Singapore Press Holdings to become a company limited by guarantee - was started \"based on certain observations\".\n\nThe review period reached back to before SPH Media became a new company, he said. An SPH spokesman said on Monday that the review period was from September 2020 to March 2022.\n\nMr Wong said that even as the review was in progress, \"we rebased our numbers, once it's clear the historical bases may be inaccurate\".\n\n\"This affected us materially, and within EMTM, both ST and BT rebased our figures,\" he said, referring to The Straits Times and The Business Times.\n\nHe added: \"All this was painful, but necessary to put right what was once unknown, but now known. There is no choice - we cannot possibly continue reporting numbers that would now be questioned.\n\n\"However, with the rebasing and the steps taken, it's important to note that the numbers we're reporting now will bear up to scrutiny.\"\n\nHe noted that even with these measures, the company will be getting \"a lot of stick going forward\".\n\nHe said: \"We'll have to get through this together, but knowing that it's part of the journey to put things right. Ultimately, when the dust settles, we'll still be judged by our stories, our content, and how we go about doing our work, so I hope we will keep our focus on that even with what's going on.\"\n\nGoh Yan Han\n\nPolitical Correspondent\n\nSPH MEDIA TRUST\n\nmedia\n\nSINGAPORE COMPANIES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22, 2025, 09:56am\n\nNew website, new features, New Paper: TNP unveils fresh look and interactive upgrades\n\nMar 8, 2025, 12:49am\n\nS'poreans still rely on public service media for credible news: Minister\n\nNov 4, 2024, 03:09am\n\nSPH Media lays off 34 employees amid tech division restructuring\n\nNov 26, 2023, 06:07pm\n\nWhat keeps one newspaper vendor going despite increasingly tough times\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/49ace71574973efab955e124ba2403949d8ac057fab630a486bf2e482c0e9c82/dw-sphmt-circ-230110.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Circulation data is not used as a basis for SPH Media’s advertising packages, said CEO Teo Lay Lim.", "caption": "Circulation data is not used as a basis for SPH Media’s advertising packages, said CEO Teo Lay Lim.

It raged on for two hours before it was extinguished by SCDF firefighters.\n\nLooking on as the flames crept towards his house, Mr Pang said he felt helpless. His son, Michael, said he went to bed at about 11pm and was awakened by the acrid smell of smoke.\n\nThe 18-year-old woke his younger brother and maternal grandmother, who was visiting the family from Penang, Malaysia, and got them out of the house safely.\n\nHis paternal grandparents, mother and elder brother, who also live in the house, were not around at the time, with his mother overseas and his brother serving national service. His paternal grandparents returned from work at their Western food coffee-shop stall at about 1am when the road had been closed off.\n\nMichael said he heard explosions and loud crashes as he evacuated his family and gathered valuables such as his laptop and mobile phone.\n\n\"I looked up and the ceiling was red,\" he said, recounting that the flames had engulfed the top floor of the three-storey house.\n\nMr Pang, a real estate agent in his 40s, said he expects repairs to take about nine months because the structure of the house was badly damaged, as a part of the second-storey ceiling had collapsed.\n\nThe family, which has lived in the house for 13 years, is staying in the nearby Village Hotel Katong for the time being.\n\n\"Everyone is traumatised. It's something that no one should experience,\" Michael said. \"No one should ever lose their home. It's like an animal losing its habitat.\"\n\nHe said he lost most of his belongings including thrifted vintage clothing, several pairs of shoes and a gaming desktop PC, which amounted to thousands of dollars.\n\n\"I worked so hard to buy all that, and all the hard work was gone in minutes,\" said Michael, who has worked part-time jobs in food and beverage since he was 16.\n\nThe fire raged on for two hours before it was extinguished by SCDF firefighters.

PHOTO: SCDF/FACEBOOK\n\nMr Pang said the master bedroom wardrobe had $1,500 in new notes that had just been withdrawn for Chinese New Year red packets, his marriage certificate and photo albums, which were all burnt to a crisp.\n\nOther items that were lost include his wife's watches and gold jewellery, diamond necklaces and a diamond ring passed down from her mother, a few thousand United States dollars, a leather sofa and paintings. He estimates the loss would come up to about $200,000.\n\nHe also has about 100 bottles of spirits and wines which may go bad if they are not stored at the right temperature, since his home's wiring had been damaged in the fire.\n\nMichael and his 13-year-old brother missed school on Tuesday, as they did not sleep that night. The second-year polytechnic student's laptop and hard drive with all his school materials were damaged while his younger brother's laptop was lost in the fire.\n\n\"I have a lot of assignments coming soon, but my laptop and hard drive are not working. It's very worrying,\" he said.\n\nWhen The Straits Times arrived at the scene at 9am, a fire engine and SCDF personnel were conducting investigations, and residents were seen moving their belongings out of their homes.\n\nWhen The Straits Times arrived at the scene at 9am, a fire engine and SCDF personnel were conducting investigations.

ST understands they live in one of the affected homes.\n\nThe pair declined to comment.\n\nAbout 20 residents were evacuated from the row of terrace houses, and one person was taken to Singapore General Hospital with minor burn injuries.\n\nThe SCDF said it was alerted to a fire at 12S East Coast Road at about 11.50pm on Monday.\n\nSCDF said it used a combined platform ladder for aerial firefighting, as well as six water jets at the height of the operation. Two fire engines were deployed.\n\nThe fire was extinguished at about 1.50am, with four terrace houses sustaining damage.\n\nSCDF said that damping-down operations were still ongoing as at 2.40am, referring to the use of water to wet burnt surfaces to prevent the rekindling of fire.\n\nThe cause of the fire is being investigated.\n\nMarine Parade GRC MP Tan See Leng said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that six terrace houses were affected, four of which were severe. He added that an elderly pair suffered slight injuries and were taken to hospital for follow-up and observation.\n\nThe East Coast Road houses are worth some $4 million to $5 million each, according to listings on real estate portal PropertyGuru.\n\nA neighbour who wanted to be known only as Kim said she was also awakened by the billowing smoke.\n\nThe 29-year-old said residents in the area, including from the nearby Sea View condominium, had gathered around the burning houses on Monday night.\n\n\"The fire was huge, and the explosions were so loud. I was so scared for my grandparents,\" said Kim, who works as an analyst.\n\nAnother neighbour, who lives next to the affected houses, said his house was flooded and his family would not be able to return for several days.\n\nResidents went to offer words of sympathy to Mr Pang as he retrieved some of his family's belongings.\n\nMr Pang said he was close to his neighbours, many of whom are seniors who have lived in the neighbourhood for many years, and they have Christmas gatherings together.\n\n\"It is what it is, what can you do,\" he said. \"It could be worse.

They also discussed which routes to take and when to meet.\n\nOn Feb 27, 2022, at about 2am, more than 30 people met in the vicinity of Turf Club Road.\n\nFootage from CCTVs (closed-circuit television) captured a convoy of more than 30 cars speeding on the PIE.\n\nDPP Lim said the seven men drove at speeds that were dangerous to the public. Two videos of the cars speeding along the expressway were posted on Facebook and gained significant traction, she added.\n\nIn her submissions, DPP Lim said the dangerous speeding was deliberate and said this was in fact a joyride.\n\n\"They were speeding in a convoy of more than 30 cars... and this meant that there were increased chances of collision with one another or with other road users,\" said the DPP.\n\nShe said the accused individuals could have caused serious injury and damage to property and that the meet-up could have potentially turned into an illegal racing event.\n\nThose convicted of dangerous driving can be fined up to $5,000 and jailed for up to a year. For subsequent convictions, the maximum penalty is doubled.\n\nBy\n\nNadine Chua\n\nRead articles by Nadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nROAD SAFETY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2c4b7f17da2f1a90596a5e40008a0703ab6c78e4680a511d36248aa56bf16fd8/dw-car-speeding-230110_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(Clockwise, from top left) Kenneth Fu Yongli, Oh Jia Fu, Louis Lee Ren Jun, Brian Anthony Yap, Ian Khoo Ye Siang, Lim Yu Shun and Lincoln Peh Wei Qiang were fined and banned from driving.", "caption": "(Clockwise, from top left) Kenneth Fu Yongli, Oh Jia Fu, Louis Lee Ren Jun, Brian Anthony Yap, Ian Khoo Ye Siang, Lim Yu Shun and Lincoln Peh Wei Qiang were fined and banned from driving.

The suspension will take effect upon his discharge from bankruptcy.\n\nIn 2015, Mr Syn was engaged by JWR to sue the company's former lawyer in a claim for $8.9 billion. The suit was dismissed by the High Court in May 2019.\n\nFor his services, Mr Syn charged JWR a total of $1.36 million, comprising about $24,000 in disbursements, which are out-of-pocket expenses, and $1.34 million in professional fees.\n\nThe bills were rendered on a regular basis from December 2015 to April 2019 to JWR, which paid the sums in full.\n\nJWR later applied to the court for an order to assess the bills in a process known as taxation.\n\nMr Syn was ordered by the court to submit a bill of costs by Nov 7, 2019, but he did not file one until Nov 18, 2020.\n\nAt the taxation hearing on Feb 9, 2021, the costs for work done were taxed down to $288,000, and Mr Syn was ordered to refund the difference of $1.05 million.\n\nAfter he failed to return the sum, JWR applied for a bankruptcy order against him on July 30, 2021, and he was adjudged bankrupt on Sept 30, 2021.\n\nJWR also lodged a complaint with the Law Society, which brought three professional misconduct charges against Mr Syn.\n\nMr Syn pleaded guilty to the charges before a disciplinary tribunal, which found that there was cause of sufficient gravity for him to be sanctioned by the court on two of the charges.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nDISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS\n\nSINGAPORE LAWYERS\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 2, 2024, 01:50am\n\nLim Tean to testify in re-hearing of $30,000 cheque case\n\nNov 8, 2023, 11:15am\n\nLaw Society ordered to refund $32k to Christopher de Souza following acquittal\n\nOct 9, 2023, 11:59am\n\nLawyer suspended 6 months for promising but failing to supervise M.

They were: unattended cooking, the indiscriminate disposal of lighted materials, such as cigarette butts, and electrical fires, such as those caused by faulty electrical appliances or wiring.\n\nOn the Singapore Civil Defence Force's (SCDF) part, he said it has been organising a series of Community Resilience Days to raise the level of fire safety awareness in the heartland.\n\nAfter a fire breaks out in a home, the SCDF also conducts door-to-door engagements with the residents of the affected block to share fire safety tips. This includes distributing brochures with advice on how to prevent fires caused by issues with batteries and personal mobility devices (PMDs).\n\nSCDF also reviews the Fire Code regularly, Prof Faishal added, noting that all new residential premises have been required to install home fire alarm devices since June 2018.\n\nHowever, he also said that home owners have a critical role to play, for instance by using only electrical plugs that bear the Safety Mark and PMDs that are certified and have passed electrical safety tests under the UL2272 standard.\n\nElectrical appliances should also be switched off when not in use, and batteries and electrical devices should not be left unattended when charging, Prof Faishal said.\n\n\"Even though the numbers have been going down.

Go, in December 2022\n\nwas likely to be of electrical origin.\n\nAccording to preliminary investigations by the SCDF, the blaze had started in the bedroom of a fourth-storey flat at Block 91 Henderson Road.

This is the largest sum placed on such bets in the past decade, The Straits Times reported in December 2022. Some $6.6 billion was wagered in the previous financial year that ended in March 2021.\n\nThe Tote Board, a statutory body, governs lottery operator Singapore Pools and the Singapore Turf Club, which operates horse races. Lotteries comprise 4-D, Toto and Singapore Sweep, while sports betting refers to football and motor racing bets.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament on Tuesday, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said: \"(The) Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) focuses on tackling problem gambling as the negative impact goes beyond the individual gamblers, and also affects the gamblers' families and loved ones.\"\n\nHe added that MSF will continue to work closely with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) to monitor the situation and review the need to introduce further measures to address problem gambling if needed.\n\nMr Chua was responding to a parliamentary question raised by Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade GRC) on whether there was a need for additional measures to be introduced to curb gambling addiction given the significant increase in the amounts spent on lotteries and sports betting. Mr Seah is also the chairman for the government parliamentary committee for social and family development.\n\nSince November 2022, private clubs operating gaming machine rooms have been required to educate patrons about responsible gambling, problem gambling and help services. They also have to assist patrons who display signs of problem gambling, said Mr Chua.\n\nSince\n\nthe Gambling Control Act was enacted in March 2022,\n\nan exclusion regime which allows families to bar their loved ones from casinos, has been extended to gaming machine rooms and the Singapore Pools' online gambling platform.\n\nMr Chua said: \"Should an individual bet online excessively through Singapore Pools, family members can apply for a family exclusion order to suspend the individual's online betting account.\n\n\"In addition, financially vulnerable individuals such as those on government social assistance and subsidy schemes, legal aid, and tenants and occupiers of the HDB Public Rental Scheme, are automatically excluded by law from betting online with Singapore Pools , as well as from the casinos and gaming machine rooms.\"\n\nMr Chua said that those who need help with their gambling behaviour can call the National Council on Problem Gambling's helpline (1800-6-668-668) or use its web chat.\n\nHe said: \"Individuals need to exercise personal responsibility and avoid betting beyond their means…We also encourage family members and friends to look out for their loved ones, and advise them not to bet excessively.\"\n\nIn a supplementary question, Mr Seah asked whether pent-up demand for lotteries and sports betting would normalise in 2023 and whether there is a need to introduce more measures to address this.\n\nIn response, Mr Chua said: \"Over the past 10 years, gambling participation has remained quite stable... I'm happy to share that there hasn't been a marked increase in probable pathological and problem gambling rates (in Singapore) and that has consistently remained at 1 per cent.\n\n\"For social issues such as this, we do want to err on the side of caution which is why we have implemented quite a number of exclusions.\"\n\nJessie Lim\n\nGRA/Gambling Regulatory Authority\n\nGambling\n\nparliament\n\nSINGAPORE PARLIAMENT\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

(After that), the accused would go with Ashik to a pawnshop to pawn the items.\"\n\nTumulak knew that the items were not made of pure gold after hearing the two men talking to each other before committing the offences.\n\nOn July 5, 2021, Ashik drove Tumulak to a pawnshop in Bukit Batok.\n\nHe collected a fake gold bangle from Sulaiman and handed it to her.

Other matching passengers were allocated en route, and this often led to unexpected detours and delays if a new booking request suddenly came in.\n\nIt was a major bugbear that Grab had tried to resolve in 2019 with a\n\n\"wait and save\" option that offered slightly cheaper fares\n\nand a lower chance of a sudden detour in exchange for a waiting time of up to five minutes.\n\nThis allowed passengers to be matched before their trip and enabled the shared rides to be fulfilled within a stated time.\n\nWith the newest version of GrabShare, all shared rides will be matched upfront, which means a ride will be confirmed only after two passengers headed in similar directions are matched.\n\nThis may take up to seven minutes so that the best match can be found, Grab said in a list of frequently asked questions published on its website.\n\nIf passengers cannot find another commuter with a similar route, they will be prompted to book a regular non-shared ride instead.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nGrab eyes Prime’s taxi, private-hire businesses\n\nGrab raises commission from drivers ahead of GST hike; other platforms absorb rise for now\n\nOther changes that Grab made to the service include limiting the number of bookings per shared ride to two, and the number of passengers per booking to just one.\n\nPreviously, up to three bookings could be allocated to each shared ride and up to two passengers were allowed per GrabShare booking.\n\nGrab said passengers will now also be charged a $4 fee if they cancel their shared ride after it has been allocated to them.\n\nThis fee will go fully to the driver and the other passenger's booking will proceed, the company said.\n\nAdditionally, only cashless payment methods will be accepted with the new version of GrabShare, Grab added.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's waiting time grace period of three minutes for regular ride-hailing services will also apply to the shared service.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nGrab’s cost-cutting moves no surprise as firm strives towards profitability: Analysts\n\nS'pore tech stock rout intensifies with $148b wipeout in 2022\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nTransport Correspondent\n\ngrab\n\nRIDE-HAILING APPS\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 3, 2025, 08:16am\n\nGrab driver's $60-a-week gesture is winning hearts in Singapore\n\n30\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nVisually impaired users in Singapore may soon use voice commands to book a Grab ride\n\nApr 2, 2025, 06:31am\n\nGrab set to become Singapore's sixth taxi operator\n\nMar 10, 2025, 06:51am\n\nGrab signs new MOUs in ongoing exploration of self-driving technology\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/61e871c082db651597b965202db22bc2cc259d83c1f07359b28493d46007e4cd/IMG9312_6.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Fares for the shared rides are expected to be up to 20 per cent cheaper compared with non-shared rides.", "caption": "Fares for the shared rides are expected to be up to 20 per cent cheaper compared with non-shared rides.

But overall, Singapore's medical supplies, including oximeters and oxygenators, have been adequate to meet demand in the past year.\n\nAs Covid-19 becomes endemic and people treat it like other illnesses, there will also be fewer chances of panic-buying taking place, he said in response to a question from Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC).\n\nDr Puthucheary added that the routine use of mucolytics and expectorants is not necessary for most people, who have healthy lungs and baseline good health, when dealing with an illness such as Covid-19. \"There is no necessity to purchase branded medication. A variety of generic preparations will do the job just as well.\"\n\nThe demand for common medications for fever, cough and cold had risen significantly in late 2022 as many people opted to self-medicate, with some over-the-counter medications for these conditions reported to be in short supply. The Covid-19 wave in China also sent people scrambling to buy fever, cough and cold medicines,\n\nleading to drug shortages.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 12:20am\n\nAll Kpod cases to be recorded, vapes must be confiscated: MOH, HSA\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) had said in December 2022 that it was monitoring the situation closely, and that additional orders had been placed for over-the-counter medicines to treat fever, cough and cold amid a spike in demand for these medications.\n\nDr Puthucheary explained that retailers in general keep close track of their supplies of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and medical supplies, and bring in more stock or alternative brands when there is a surge in demand.\n\nMOH monitors the stock levels of commonly used medicines and medical supplies, especially when there are exceptional surges in demand or disruptions to supply. If necessary, it will work with the retailers to procure additional stocks to meet the demand, or issue relevant advisories, he said.\n\nIn addition, the Ministry maintains stockpiles of key medicines and medical supplies to be prioritised for the higher acuity patients in public healthcare institutions.\n\nIn extreme situations where there may be global shortages, MOH will take additional measures such as imposing sales limits to prevent hoarding, and ensure that the medicines and medical supplies are fairly distributed, he added.\n\nReplying to Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC), he said that short-term medicine supply issues here are largely managed through the vendors' stockpiles and a variety of data and ICT (information and communications technology) tools.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFairPrice, Guardian, Watsons limit sales of Panadol, Nurofen products amid higher demand\n\nMalaysia's influencers are causing people to hoard medicines believed to treat Covid-19\n\nJoyce Teo\n\nSenior Health Correspondent\n\nMinistry of Health\n\nmedicine\n\nFlu\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 04:15am\n\nLegal agility needed to tackle drug-laced vapes in Singapore: Experts\n\nJul 13, 2025, 12:20am\n\nGovernment may enhance vaping laws to tackle drug-laced vapes\n\nJul 11, 2025, 12:34pm\n\nAnti-smoking message added to samsui woman mural after public controversy\n\nJul 6, 2025, 06:55am\n\nMOH considering proposals to integrate TCM into public healthcare\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/409ec1edd91c9c8b747989f47a01bee1e25c26a720891c4ff595210de2d6409f/panadol_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "There were temporary localised shortages of specific brands of medicines used to treat fever, cough and cold towards the end of 2022.", "caption": "There were temporary localised shortages of specific brands of medicines used to treat fever, cough and cold towards the end of 2022.

He was taken out of the unit by crew members, who tried to resuscitate him. Sgt (1) Go was later taken to Singapore General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nHe was also certified medically fit before his enlistment and categorised as PES A. Servicemen under this category are considered suitable for front-line operational vocations such as firefighting.\n\nFull-time national serviceman Sergeant (1) Edward Go died while battling the blaze in a rental flat in Dec 2022. PHOTO: ST FILE\n\nThe NSF enlisted in the SCDF on Jan 5, 2022, and had aspirations to enrol in medical school upon completing his national service. After enlisting, he trained as a firefighter for 12 weeks, from Feb 3 to April 28. He was posted to the Central Fire Station on May 4.\n\nHe was part of the first response crew for the blaze on Dec 8, 2022, the SCDF said previously.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nNSF firefighter who died after Henderson Road blaze had experience, was among top 25% of cohort\n\n42 national servicemen have died while in service over past 20 years: Ng Eng Hen\n\nGena Soh\n\nSCDF\n\nnational service\n\nUNNATURAL DEATH\n\nFire\n\nhdb\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 12, 2025, 02:49am\n\nCar tips onto side after crash near Joo Koon; 2 taken to hospital\n\n3\n\nJun 29, 2025, 08:34am\n\nMotorcyclist taken to hospital unconscious after Tuas Checkpoint accident\n\nJun 26, 2025, 02:17am\n\nMan dies after CTE accident involving 2 lorries, driver arrested\n\n2\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:06am\n\n'I didn't know it was so bad': Neighbours rally to help after fire broke out in Holland Close\n\n8\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8b8e2106adbef3dc11ea1da82835f2ea7c330c2a38f77bd4c4ed7d0b820df952/202212082884316770940b33-03e4-45c0-8701-152af3021a922028129.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The tent was put up on the evening of Dec 7.

To be very honest, Covid-19 vaccinations have become part of the new norm. For an endemic disease like influenza, vaccinations are encouraged every year, which will help avoid many deaths. Covid-19 is heading the same way,\" said Mr Ong.\n\n\"The current situation, where we feel threatened by rising infections around us, is a clear illustration (of) why vaccination needs to be an integral part of our ongoing defence against endemic Covid-19,\" he added.\n\nAs at Dec 31, 2022, about 60 per cent of individuals aged 18 years and above are up to date with their vaccinations.\n\nA person is considered up to date with his Covid-19 vaccination if he has received at least the minimum protection - which is three mRNA or Novavax/Nuvaxovid doses, or four Sinovac-CoronaVac doses - and received an additional booster dose between five months and a year from his last vaccine dose.\n\nMr Ong said that with the introduction of the bivalent formulations for both Moderna and Pfizer, he hopes more will step forward to get better protection.\n\nIn response to a question by Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) on Singapore's definition of \"full vaccination\" for travellers, Mr Ong said the Republic is applying the World Health Organisation's definition, which is less stringent.\n\n\"It is not practical to fully align the vaccination definition for people living here and for travellers from all around the world because every country has its own definition. Having said that, the current definition has worked well for us so far,\" said Mr Ong.\n\nHe added that Singapore will study if there is a need to review the definition based on the spread of the disease.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nS'pore has not seen surge in Covid-19 cases from travellers from China\n\nWhy is S’pore not imposing any Covid-19 tests for travellers from China?\n\nRelated Stories\n\n‘Kraken’ coronavirus subvariant: Why it is causing concern\n\nAll around the world, Covid-19 surveillance is faltering\n\nWe may be entering Covid-19’s least predictable year yet\n\nWill a China Covid-19 wave set back endemic living in Singapore?\n\nCovid-19 variants in China also detected in Malaysia\n\nHow bad is China’s Covid-19 outbreak?

It is yet another hectic year, and I will need to adapt and adjust to the badminton and sporting calendar.\"\n\nAlso facing tough opposition at the Malaysian Open is compatriot and world No. 34 Yeo Jia Min, who will meet Thailand's SEA Games champion Pornpawee Chochuwong in the opening round of the women's singles. If she progresses, she could next meet former world champions P.V. Sindhu (India) or Spain's Carolina Marin.\n\nIn the women's doubles, Singaporean pair Crystal Wong and Jin Yujia will play Scotland's Julie MacPherson and Ciara Torrance in the first round.\n\nMixed doubles pair Terry Hee and Jessica Tan, who won a historic Commonwealth Games gold medal in 2022, open their campaign against Germany's Jones Ralfy Jansen and Linda Efler.\n\nBut the pair, who rose to a career-high 13th at the end of 2022, could find themselves up against Thai world champions Dechapol Puavaranukroh and Sapsiree Taerattanachai in the next round.\n\nTan, 29, said: \"We didn't really set any particular goals, each win is a breakthrough and each loss is learning experience for us.\n\n\"It's always harder when you're not a seeded pair, but the first match will be tough as well against the Germans.\"\n\nAfter a year of milestones, the couple are aiming for more.\n\nHee, 27, said: \"We hope to continue with good performances, and hope to be more consistent. Quota for doubles (at the Olympics) is little as compared to singles, so we really need to work hard for it.\"\n\nA total of 70 quota places - 35 for each gender - will be awarded for the singles events, while 48 pairs will qualify for the doubles (16 each for the men's, women's and mixed).\n\nSingapore Badminton Association technical director Martin Andrew said that the team have worked hard to improve during the pre-season. Noting that the next three months are crucial with Olympic qualification coming up, he said: \"They are all fine and feeling positive. It's the start of a series of tournaments, so it needs to be kept in perspective.\n\n\"They have had a good training block where we've been able to get rid of some niggly injuries. So they are ready, albeit with not much actual match play in their preparations.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nBadminton: Loh Kean Yew is first Singaporean man to reach World Tour Finals\n\nST Singaporean of the Year nominee: Hee and Tan sacrifice and soar as married mixed doubles duo\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nbadminton\n\nSINGAPORE ATHLETES\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nMalaysian Open\n\nLoh Kean Yew\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\nLoh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities\n\n5\n\nMay 12, 2025, 12:42am\n\nLoh Kean Yew beats Chou Tien-chen to win Taipei Open crown\n\nMay 4, 2025, 11:48pm\n\nShuttler Loh Kean Hean retires; aims to build 'badminton community'\n\nApr 12, 2025, 12:36am\n\nLoh Kean Yew topples world No. 1 Shi Yuqi in thrilling Badminton Asia C'ships quarter-final\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBest High-Interest Savings Accounts in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d7c3ccbfa6eb059527ff120ec3df54ec813d153a0727cb7cebb60ab405afbce4/CBK4112_0.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Singapore's leading shuttlers: (from left) mixed doubles pair Terry Hee and Tan Wei Han, former men's singles world champion Loh Kean Yew and women's singles player Yeo Jia Min have a challenging task at the Malaysian Open starting on Jan 10.", "caption": "Singapore's leading shuttlers: (from left) mixed doubles pair Terry Hee and Tan Wei Han, former men's singles world champion Loh Kean Yew and women's singles player Yeo Jia Min have a challenging task at the Malaysian Open starting on Jan 10.

They ended the match with seven shots, all off target, while Vietnam were relentless in attack.\n\nThey had 11 shots in total, with five on target.\n\nVietnam, semi-finalists at the previous edition in 2021 after lifting the trophy in 2018, could not extend their lead in the first half.\n\nBut within two minutes of the restart, Vietnam were two goals up. The source was a familiar one, as Dung whipped in a corner which Linh connected with a bullet header that gave Nadeo no chance at his near post.\n\nEven the normally stoic Park, who was appointed in September 2017 and besides the 2018 AFF title has also delivered golds at the 2019 and 2021 SEA Games, was caught up in the celebrations.\n\nThe South Korean, 65, jumped and danced with his bench, knowing his team were on their way into their fourth AFF final.\n\nThey will face either defending champions Thailand or Malaysia, who meet in the second leg on Tuesday night in Pathum Thani.\n\nThe Thais trail 1-0 after Faisal Halim's winner last Saturday in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nWith the in-form Linh leading the line and a stubborn defence looking largely untroubled, it could be the perfect send-off for Vietnam and Park.\n\nCheck out this tweet!\n\nlink\n\nJanuary 9, 2023\n\nAFF Championship\n\nVietnam\n\nindonesia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 27, 2024, 11:58pm\n\nLions believe in bid to accomplish Asean Cup mission in Vietnam\n\nDec 26, 2024, 10:37pm\n\nSingapore lose 2-0 to Vietnam after VAR mayhem\n\nDec 25, 2024, 12:12am\n\nSingapore-Vietnam matches to be screened at CCs\n\nDec 22, 2024, 11:10pm\n\nAsean Cup semi-final tickets for Singapore-Vietnam game sell out\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBuilding Wealth at Every Age: Essential Strategies for Your 20s, 30s, 40s & Beyond\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ca3bac44cc40b4035b04aeba7cc05a15a3f4417715f3e2cde0a01d868058e9a0/fbl-aff-2022-vie-ina-141121_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Vietnam's Nguyen Tien Linh celebrates with teammates after scoring against Indonesia. \n", "caption": "Vietnam's Nguyen Tien Linh celebrates with teammates after scoring against Indonesia.

We talked with many different coaches that fit the profile we were looking for, but there was only one official proposition which was done to Roberto.\"\n\nMartinez stepped down as Belgium coach following their World Cup group stage exit, saying he had made the decision to end his six-year tenure some time ago and would have left even if they had been crowned champions.\n\nIt ended a long spell in charge of the side in which he took them to No. 1 in the world rankings and third place at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\n\"I am delighted to be able to represent one of the most talented teams in the world,\" Martinez said.\n\n\"I understand there are great expectations... but I also understand there is a very large team (at the FFF)... and together we will achieve our goals.\"\n\nThe 68-year-old Santos, who was widely criticised for his tactics and for leaving forward Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench for two consecutive World Cup games, became Portugal coach in 2014 and led the country in 109 matches.\n\nThey won the European Championship in 2016 and the inaugural Nations League in 2018-19.\n\nQuestioned about the future of Ronaldo in the national team, Martinez said that he would contact the 37-year-old, who last month joined Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr on a 2½ year deal. The forward is international football's all-time record scorer with 118 goals.\n\n\"Footballing decisions have to be taken on the field. I am not a manager to make decisions in an office.\n\n\"I want to contact all the players in the squad, the list of 26 players, from the last World Cup. That is my starting point and Cristiano is one of the players on that list. He has spent 19 years in the national team. We will sit down and speak.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Belgium's all-time record scorer Romelu Lukaku has backed Martinez's assistant Thierry Henry to replace him. The France and Arsenal legend has had two stints as Belgium's assistant coach but has only twice helmed a team - Monaco and Montreal Impact.\n\nLukaku told Sky Italia: \"For me, Henry is the next coach of Belgium. There are no doubts. I say it openly: he will be the next coach.\n\n\"He has the respect of all the players, he has won everything. He knows how to coach, he knows what we have to do to get there.

The amounts exclude the goods and services tax.\n\nThe higher fees are necessary to cover the increasing cost of administering the haj registrations, Muis said.\n\nUntil then, new registrants need to pay an application fee of only $240, with Muis subsidising each registration by $90 \"in recognition of the current economic conditions as we move out from the pandemic\".\n\nZhaki Abdullah\n\nMuis\n\nhaj\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 4, 2025, 11:43pm\n\nTengah to get new mosque, Tampines North mosque to resume construction in 2027\n\nMar 3, 2025, 07:08am\n\nMuis warns against fake online ad offering $1,000 zakat assistance\n\nFeb 28, 2025, 11:57pm\n\nFasting month of Ramadan to start on March 2, zakat fitrah rates adjusted\n\nDec 31, 2024, 06:03am\n\n3 men allegedly rig bid for Sultan Mosque project\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

There was no contract of employment, the accused did not draw any salary from GSM, and GSM did not make any CPF contributions on the accused's behalf.\"\n\nDPP Menon said that on June 28, 2013, a recruiter from Reed Personnel Services submitted Liang's CV to SingPost for him to be considered for the vice-president position.\n\nAccording to court documents, Liang stated on his CV that he had been employed as head of project management at GSM Holdings since August 2012.\n\nSingPost then interviewed Liang with a view to hiring him, and on July 12, 2013, SingPost offered him a vice-president position.\n\nIn an \"application for appointment\" form that he was asked to fill, he stated that he had been a director at GSM.\n\nStressing that Liang was not formally employed by GSM, the DPP said: \"Rather, he assisted his friend Tan Yew Seng, who was a director and shareholder of GSM. The accused assisted Tan on an ad hoc basis, primarily with a factory that GSM was building (in Senoko Loop).\n\n\"Tan was unfamiliar with building permits, so he asked the accused to assist him. The accused reviewed documents and advised on correspondence with the main contractor and the relevant authorities.\"\n\nMr Tan had made at least one verbal offer to pay Liang, but this agreement was never formalised.\n\nThe DPP said Liang was very close to his mother, who died in February 2012, and he had also been diagnosed with persistent complex bereavement disorder and/or grief reaction with associated major depressive disorder when he applied for the SingPost job.\n\nSeparately, Liang is also accused of trying to obtain a bribe of $1 million in cash from Mr Wong Siaw Fun, the then chief operating officer of mechanical and engineering firm Bintai Kindenko, in 2015.\n\nIn exchange, Liang allegedly offered to recommend Bintai as a preferred subcontractor for works at the SingPost Centre in Eunos Road.\n\nThe prosecutor said: \"The possibility of corrupt gratification was raised. No corrupt gratification was ultimately paid or received by either party.\"\n\nLiang is represented by lawyers Eugene Thuraisingam, Johannes Hadi and Hilary Low.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncheating\n\ngraft\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nYour dream home, now more affordable with IKEA home design ​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ae89afc7b1f1d571df8ee09b6300feb4d6b2e25f59b15a016f410da60f6f5a95/ac1i657420copy_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Liang An Wey gave false information about his employment history and past remuneration. \n", "caption": "Liang An Wey gave false information about his employment history and past remuneration.

He's high in the ratings, but he's always trying his best - and is never far away,\" said Gray.\n\n\"He's been a great horse for the Chens, he has won close to $500,000 for them now. They are fantastic owners, great people.\n\n\"They have only two horses left (the other one is Sure Will Do, who in contrast, finished last in the same race). They need to get some new horses.\n\n\"This old boy keeps them going. It's not easy to keep an old horse going, though.\n\n\"I have to thank my staff, as I was away for three weeks. I'm really appreciative of that.\"\n\nAfter finishing 10th on 25 winners in 2022, the Kiwi handler can bank on a healthier stable of 40 horses to improve his score in the new season.\n\nZyrul, who is certainly not bereft of talent, is imbued with the same sentiments.\n\nBut the 34-year-old Singaporean has somehow not enjoyed the same opportunities as some of his peers, since his return from a successful apprenticeship in New Zealand in 2017.\n\nHe actually got the 2022 season off to a flying start as well when Leatherhead scored on Jan 2.\n\nThe good vibes stayed on with two more successes within the next six weeks.\n\nBut it then all went pear-shaped - only two more winners towards the end of the season to finish in the bottom quarter.\n\nZyrul, who has chalked up 43 Singapore winners on top of his 29 in New Zealand, is keeping his fingers crossed that lucky pick-up ride on Saturday was the harbinger of a brighter season ahead.\n\n\"I've ridden Darc Bounty a couple of times. I just followed the instructions, which were to get in the one-one if possible,\" he said.\n\n\"I was very confident he'll run a great race.

He led and weakened badly, but it was on a heavy track.\n\n\"I still got some info on him and found out he was all sound.\n\n\"As he was a two-year-old colt, and nobody was buying, I thought he was worth a risk. I got him for only A$7,000 (S$6,400).\"\n\nSuch cheap purchases can either live up to their price tags when they hit the tracks or go the other way - turn into a fairy-tale bargain basement buy.\n\nLim soon had a hunch the son of Vancouver, who was renamed Cosmic Dancer and gelded, might turn into the latter.\n\n\"I quickly realised he had some ability,\" he said.\n\n\"I then bought half of his shares for my dad Simon Lim, and syndicated him up for the remaining 50 per cent.\"\n\nThe lucky owners can certainly thank Lim - and filial son for one of them - for his sharp racing acumen.\n\nPunted down to $11 favouritism, Cosmic Dancer benefited from a trademark hold-up ride in the box seat from four-time Singapore champion jockey Manoel Nunes.\n\nOnce he was steered to the outside towards daylight as leader Simon (Shafrizal Saleh) punctured - softened up by the early attention from Great Command (Marc Lerner) - he extended nicely towards a ¾ length win.\n\nGreat Command hung on for second, with another 1¼ lengths to Tributo (Wong Chin Chuen).\n\nThe winner ran the 1,100m on the Polytrack of the $20,000 Open Maiden in 1min 05.01sec.\n\n\"I didn't expect Stephen Gray's horse (Simon) would be that fast. My plan was to lead,\" said Lim.\n\n\"But Nunes is a great jockey. I didn't tie him down to any instructions, I just told him 'you know the horse, you know what to do'.\"\n\nThe Brazilian ace was ringing up a riding double, after having saluted in the 2023 season kick-off race with the Tim Fitzsimmons-trained Mister Dynamo ($20).\n\n\"He's a very smart horse, he knows what he's doing. I looked after him in his trials,\" he said.\n\n\"Today, he broke the machine very well and travelled easy behind the speed.\n\n\"When I popped him out, he responded very well. He's a lovely horse, Jason will have a lot of fun with him.\n\n\"As he's still young, it's not necessary to whack him too much. He just does what you ask of him.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen if Cosmic Dancer can follow the hoofsteps of fellow Inglis Digital graduate Super Salute, who, at A$110,000, was no cheapie.\n\nBut, regardless of the size of the hole in his wallet, Lim is expecting better things to come from the son of I Am Invincible, already a winner of two from three Kranji starts.\n\n\"Cosmic Dancer is no superstar, but is a nice 1,200m horse. I think he can make it in Singapore,\" said Lim.\n\n\"He has some upsides, but I think Super Salute is more progressive and is stronger.\n\n\"Super Salute will need to have at least two trials before he returns from his break. I'll look at racing him in February.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - How SMEs Can Optimize Cash Flow & Financial Stability\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/767fd40930abec1884689d5efa6695e52aa825992d0700212c22de7a3ccd1c7a/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Jason Lim-trained newcomer Cosmic Dancer (Manoel Nunes) justifying his $11 favouritism with an easy victory in Saturday's $20,000 Open Maiden event over the Polytrack 1,100m at Kranji.

The majority are BA.5.2 and BF.7 strains, which have already been detected in Singapore and other countries for many months,\" he said.\n\nThis is consistent with findings from the WHO's technical advisory group on virus evolution that were released last Wednesday, he noted.\n\nWhile a new, dangerous variant that evades vaccine protection emerging from China has not materialised, Singapore will continue to remain vigilant, said Mr Ong.\n\nZhaki Abdullah\n\ncovid-19\n\nSINGAPORE PARLIAMENT\n\nONG YE KUNG\n\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH)\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0af94034d5ac5909501255bd28525af66cf812679395b31d244285888ab5e935/20220711713418507b6ca8e6-25db-4556-a0de-a1f3228b61e3_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Imported infections today account for between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of all Covid-19 cases detected in Singapore. \n", "caption": "Imported infections today account for between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of all Covid-19 cases detected in Singapore.

Another charge was taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nHis victim, 29, was left with a bruised chest wall and a scab on her lower lip.\n\nThe woman cannot be named owing to a gag order to protect her identity. Court documents did not state if Lim and her were in a relationship at the time.\n\nLim was serving a 21-month probation over an assault charge when he breached the probation order and committed the offences.\n\nProbation is a community rehabilitation sentence ordered by the courts that requires the offender to be supervised by a probation officer for a period between six months and three years.\n\nOn Monday, Lim was also ordered to spend an additional four months behind bars for breaching the probation order.\n\nOn Dec 2, 2021, Lim was with the victim in a bedroom in his flat at around 3pm when she asked him if he wanted to join her friends for dinner.\n\nHe declined, but later became angry when he learnt she had invited a male friend for dinner.\n\nAround three hours later, Lim confronted the victim and asked why she had invited another male friend to dinner instead of him. He flew into a rage when she did not answer his questions.\n\nLim pulled her out of the bedroom by grabbing her shirt and threatened to kick her out of the flat.\n\nWhen she tried to escape and headed towards the front door, he pulled her to the floor to prevent her from leaving.\n\nThe victim tried to escape through the front door again, but she fell in the process. While she was on the floor, Lim kicked her on the chest about four or five times.\n\nHe then lit a cigarette and walked towards the woman who was still on the floor. He continued asking her questions, but she did not answer them.\n\nLim then pressed the lit cigarette to the victim's lower lip for about four to five seconds while grabbing her face.\n\nFor using a heated substance to voluntarily cause hurt to another person, an offender can be jailed for up to seven years, fined, caned or receive any combination of such punishments.\n\nBy\n\nNadine Chua\n\nRead articles by Nadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/715fec9de2b95b2247cc9976bff2969c2c403d112c535e3a947ec3e7673f507b/ac1i668220copy_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Alfred Lim Qing Yuan was sentenced to six weeks’ jail after earlier pleading guilty to two charges.

The remaining 10 agents were issued warning letters for their disciplinary breaches.\n\nThese property agents were found to have breached the code set by the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) that requires them to ensure that no law, including those that apply to HDB properties, has been infringed as part of their work.\n\nCEA investigated 51 cases involving 69 property agents in the last five years, with 19 cases still under investigation, said Mr Lee in response to questions filed by nine MPs on the issue of Build-To-Order (BTO) flat owners flouting MOP rules.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:25am\n\nMedics treat 7 after Chai Chee block lift lobby blaze\n\nMore related stories\n\nThis comes after some seemingly vacant and unrenovated BTO flats were reported to be up for sale on property portals in December. Agents who listed the units described them as a \"blank canvas\" and \"never stayed in before, brand new\".\n\nProperty agents who have reasonable cause to suspect that MOP rules have been infringed should inform their clients of the potential consequences and stop marketing the property, said Mr Lee.\n\nThe Straits Times has asked the Ministry of National Development if property agents are required to report such suspected breaches to the CEA or HDB.\n\nHDB flat owners have to live in their units for five years before they can put it up for sale on the open market - a longstanding policy that is meant to reinforce public housing as a home to live in.\n\nMr Lee said owners who cannot fulfil their MOP due to changes in their circumstances must return their flat to HDB.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, a total of 258 BTO flats and 168 HDB resale flats were returned to HDB, mainly due to changes in owners' circumstances within the MOP which made them ineligible to own an HDB flat, he added.\n\nThese circumstances include divorce or separation, death of the owner and medical reasons, he said.\n\nMr Lee said owners who are genuinely unable to stay in their flat during the MOP, like those who posted overseas for work, should write to HDB to seek a waiver. These appeals will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nHe added that HDB detects potential infringement of HDB rules through a range of methods, including regular inspections, feedback from the public and property agents.\n\nData analytics and other tools are also used to detect potential infringement, he said, declining to go into details as some involve confidential investigative methods.\n\nSince 2017, HDB has conducted random checks on some 35,000 homes as part of its regular inspection routine, he said.\n\nHDB also received around 4,700 pieces of feedback on potential infringements relating to MOP rules from the public and agents, said Mr Lee. These include cases of flats being listed for resale in bare or \"brand new\" condition.\n\nHe said HDB tries to strike a balance in detecting and investigating breaches. \"On the one hand, we want to ensure that HDB rules are complied with by detecting and deterring errant owners who infringe the rules; on the other hand, we do not want to overly impinge upon the privacy of the 1.1 million HDB homeowners, the vast majority of whom abide by the rules.\"\n\nBetween 2017 and November 2022, 53 errant flat owners who did not live in their HDB flats during the MOP were taken to task. Of these, 21 had their flats compulsorily acquired by HDB.\n\nDepending on the severity of the breach, HDB may issue a written warning, impose a fine of up to $50,000, or compulsorily acquire the flat.\n\nOwners whose flats are compulsorily acquired by HDB will also be debarred from buying a subsidised flat, taking over such a flat by changing flat ownership or renting a public rental flat from HDB for five years.\n\nMr Lee acknowledged that the issue of MOP breaches has caused some unhappiness among Singaporeans.\n\n\"We also recognise the concerns by members of the public, sometimes anger, when they see such actions being taken by people around them when they, and many other HDB owners, comply with the rules and are concerned about whether the playing field is level,\" he said.\n\nHe reiterated that HDB takes rule violations seriously and will not hesitate to take enforcement action against errant owners.\n\nMichelle Ng\n\nHousing Correspondent\n\nhdb\n\nSINGAPORE PARLIAMENT\n\nHOUSING POLICY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 10, 2025, 02:49am\n\nPunggol resident harassed by debt collectors over former owner's loans\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:15am\n\nFrom noise complaints to posting photos: The five-year dispute between Woodlands neighbours\n\nJun 30, 2025, 05:35am\n\nSome 950,000 Singaporean households to get U-Save, S&CC rebates in July\n\nJun 26, 2025, 06:36am\n\nToilet ceiling in Queenstown flat collapses as woman showers\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a54dc005e3914058b8e7cc634a1629973def78d73778a8d58703e964b61e0e0c/rrbtoempty0701_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Some seemingly vacant and unrenovated BTO flats were reported to be up for sale on property portals in December.\n", "caption": "Some seemingly vacant and unrenovated BTO flats were reported to be up for sale on property portals in December.

In mid-2021, the child's mother started noticing bruises on her daughter's cheeks.\n\nWhen the mother asked the maid about the bruises, she said she did not know how the child had got the bruises. Assuming her daughter might have got them during her playtime, the mother did not pursue the matter further.\n\nIn January 2022, the mother suspected her child could have been abused at her pre-school after noticing a bruise on her back. She lodged a complaint with its principal and also alerted the police.\n\nAfter checking its closed-circuit television (CCTV) recordings, the pre-school management told the mother it could not find anything amiss concerning the toddler on its premises.\n\nDuring this period, the mother noticed the maid appeared nervous. The accused also asked her how she should respond to police officers if she were to be investigated.\n\nThe mother became suspicious of the maid, and the truth emerged when she checked CCTV recordings from her home and saw the maid repeatedly abusing the daughter.\n\nThe maid's acts of abuse included pinching the toddler's chest multiple times and slapping her face.\n\nOn one occasion, the accused pinched the child's torso three times. When the girl turned her body away, the maid grabbed her shirt and pulled her.\n\nThe mother confronted the maid on Jan 13, and she later came clean to the police about what she had done.\n\nBy\n\nNadine Chua\n\nRead articles by Nadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nHome & Decor Singapore\n\n5 Living Room Wellness Hacks You’ll Wish You Knew Sooner!\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6abf2d979208c6f0a61863f4bc68d6cb4a5de263a75e78620df427c52da0ad88/gavel.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

What if the owner or tenant of a flat linked to littering cannot respond within the 14 days of being required to do so?\n\nIf the presumed offender missed the letter of intended prosecution, he may contact NEA and give evidence on why he did not respond to the letter.\n\nEvidence includes air tickets and boarding passes to show that he was overseas at the time.\n\nNEA will assess the representation and, if accepted, withdraw the summons issued.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 3, 2024, 03:32am\n\nAlleged litterbug charged for trying to bribe cops\n\nMore related stories\n\n2. Will the new law apply to children, those who are elderly or people who are mentally or physically disabled?\n\nNo enforcement will be taken against children under 12. Instead, an advisory will be sent to their parents to educate them on how to dispose of litter correctly and refrain from littering.\n\nOffenders who are elderly or from vulnerable groups, as well as their family members or relatives, may write to NEA and provide relevant supporting documents of their age or circumstances.\n\nNEA will then review and consider each case before taking any action, which may include issuing a warning.\n\n3. What if NEA accuses the wrong person of high-rise littering?\n\nThe presumption\n\nof guilt applies only when it is proven, such as through investigations and in court, that the littering occurred from tha\n\nt residential flat.\n\nDuring investigations, NEA will ask the owner or tenant questions, including whether he was present in the flat when the offence was committed.\n\nEven if the owner or tenant provides information on the identity of the offender, this does not automatically mean that the named person will be prosecuted for the offence.\n\nAs in current processes, NEA will investigate the truth of the information provided.\n\n4. What if the owners of a flat linked to littering show that one of the rooms is being rented out?\n\nIn such cases, the owner will still be the presumed offender.\n\nHowever, the owner or tenant can rebut this by proving that they were not present in the flat at the time of the offence or that they could not have been the offender, or by providing the identity of the person who could be the offender to NEA within 14 days of being required to do so.\n\nDepending on the information provided, NEA will conduct further investigations to determine the identity of the offender.\n\n5. Who will NEA act against if litter is linked to a flat with multiple owners?\n\nEvery registered residential flat owner will share equal responsibility when a littering act is proven to have been committed from his flat. The same applies to tenants in the event that the whole residential flat is leased.\n\nThey will be given the opportunity and time in the investigation to prove that they did not commit the offence.\n\n6. Will the new legislation, including the presumption clause, apply to private apartments such as condominiums?\n\nThe presumption applies if litter is thrown from a private apartment that is used for residential purposes and if the litter lands in a public place.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFlat owners to be presumed guilty of high-rise littering unless proven otherwise under proposed law\n\nMP Joan Pereira calls for limited access to HDB rooftop gardens to prevent nuisance, littering\n\nAng Qing\n\nlittering\n\nNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 6, 2024, 12:00am\n\nPeddlers hawk duty-unpaid cigarettes, chewing tobacco in Mandai\n\nSep 18, 2024, 05:54am\n\nMan returns trash to car passenger who tossed it out\n\nJul 27, 2024, 01:27pm\n\nTwo fined for high-rise littering under presumption of guilt clause\n\nOct 6, 2023, 11:35am\n\nMan, 29, arrested for allegedly throwing bicycle, microwave and TV from HDB flat in Punggol\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ee1238c9d68d2f5db95fb82d8abd5c1016961051c22852561f77ea85b7b60026/LEO3974_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Home owners and tenants will need to show proof they did not commit high-rise littering offences with 14 days of being notified, under a new Bill.", "caption": "Home owners and tenants will need to show proof they did not commit high-rise littering offences with 14 days of being notified, under a new Bill.

In Parliament on Jan 9, Minister Ong Ye Kung shed light on Singapore's plans for such tests.\n\nQ: Why is Singapore not requiring on-arrival PCR tests for travellers from China?\n\nA:\n\nA shortcoming of any on-arrival tests is that they are too late because the travellers are already within Singapore's borders, said Mr Ong.\n\nFurther, PCR tests are sensitive and are bound to yield many positive cases from countries that are experiencing a big wave, he said.\n\nEven recovered travellers will shed dead viral fragments for quite a while. Singapore, therefore, did not consider doing this, as it would merely confirm what is already known and expected, Mr Ong added.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 3, 2025, 10:38pm\n\nGE2025: WP to get two NCMP seats in the next Parliament, on top of 10 elected MPs\n\nMore related stories\n\nQ: Why isn't Singapore monitoring the waste water from flights arriving from China for Covid?\n\nA:\n\nWaste-water tests are best done on residential premises such as dorms and housing estates, because viral fragments can only be detected from solid wastes, said Mr Ong.\n\nTherefore, the sample capture from plane toilets for a relatively short-duration flight from China is likely to be very small and of limited use, he said.\n\nQ: Why are we not imposing a pre-departure test (PDT) for Covid-19 for travellers from China?\n\nA:\n\nTravellers have to be either fully vaccinated, based on the World Health Organisation's definition, or produce a negative pre-departure test (PDT) result before heading to Singapore.\n\nPre-departure tests for Covid-19 can be useful because it will sieve out Covid-positive passengers, prevent them from boarding the plane, reduce the number of imported infections and hence, severe cases, and a lower burden on the hospitals, Mr Ong said.\n\nHowever, travel volume between Singapore and China is already low - currently less than 10 per cent of pre-Covid-19 norms - he said.\n\nThis already limits the number of imported infections more so than imposing a blanket PDT requirement on all travellers from China, he added.\n\nMr Ong also said that if Singapore imposes PDT on all travellers from China, it raises the question about how travellers from other regions that are responsible for more infections and severe cases should be regulated.\n\n\"Further, by triggering PDT on travellers from one part of the world experiencing high infection numbers, are we contributing to an international precedent of imposing tests on travellers from countries experiencing an infection wave?\"\n\nConversely, it will raise the issue of how other countries will treat travellers from Singapore when it encounters another infection wave, he added.\n\nInstead of imposing blanket PDT specifically on travellers from one region, Singapore decided that it should encourage adequate vaccination for all the travellers coming to Singapore from all parts of the world, said Mr Ong.\n\nThis directly reduces the risk of importing severe cases and protects our hospital system, he added.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nS'pore doesn’t expect surge in Covid-19 cases from travellers from China\n\nTourists from China not a Covid-19 threat to S’pore’s population: Expert\n\nJoyce Teo\n\nSenior Health Correspondent\n\nSINGAPORE PARLIAMENT\n\nCOVID-19 - SINGAPORE\n\nASKST\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 28, 2025, 10:51pm\n\nGE2025: Is my vote really secret?\n\nApr 28, 2025, 10:46pm\n\n'Mission Possible': Voting for WP in Punggol GRC will benefit all S'poreans, says Pritam Singh\n\nApr 22, 2025, 03:31am\n\nTearful Louis Ng announces exit from politics, says he wants more time with family\n\nApr 14, 2025, 07:16am\n\nGE2025: Key days and announcements to look out for in the lead-up to the election\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Business Accounts in Singapore: Make Your Company’s Idle Cash Work Harder\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f260140ee43bc94d2c7f0ea320393fe341ffe37b4ad156009b396d78e6bed4dc/aicovidtest0901_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "PCR tests are sensitive and are bound to yield many positive cases from countries that are experiencing a big wave.", "caption": "PCR tests are sensitive and are bound to yield many positive cases from countries that are experiencing a big wave.

So now he makes it a point to check with the driver whether the ride has been started once he gets into the car.\n\nGojek charges a\n\n$3 waiting fee\n\nfor every 5 minutes of waiting by the driver after a four-minute grace period.\n\nThe Stomper had booked the ride from Ubi to Marine Parade, but was forced out of the car in a public car park at Merpati Road, where the driver cancelled the trip.\n\nChristopher then booked another private-hire vehicle - ironically from Gojek again.\n\nTo prove that he is not a troublesome passenger, the Stomper shared a screenshot of a comment by the second Gojek driver who picked him up, who said Christopher seemed \"quite polite\".\n\nThe Stomper said that after reporting the incident to Gojek, he was offered a 10 per cent off voucher capped at $3, which he said was not enough.\n\n\"I'm in sales,\" Christopher told Stomp. \"So I know.\"\n\nHe pointed out that Gojek is currently running a simple contest where you can win $6 off all rides from Mondays to Thursdays between 9am and 4pm.\n\nThe Stomper said he has also made a police report.\n\nIn response to a Stomp query, the police confirmed that a report was lodged and they are looking into the matter.\n\nWhen contacted by Stomp, a Gojek spokesman said: \"We do not tolerate negative outbursts or impolite behaviour of any kind towards passengers or driver-partners.\n\n\"We are currently investigating this matter and have reached out to both the parties involved to verify the details of the incident.\"\n\nOng Su Mann\n\nGOJEK\n\ndispute\n\nPRIVATE-HIRE VEHICLES\n\nTIKTOK\n\nsocial media\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 29, 2024, 01:49am\n\nReports filed against private-hire driver for $160k unpaid loans\n\nDec 14, 2023, 08:33am\n\nGojek driver reportedly suspended for keeping pet parrot in car\n\nNov 22, 2023, 08:30pm\n\nBacklash after private-hire driver spends 22 hours on road to win Facebook contest\n\nJun 20, 2023, 12:31am\n\nComfortDelGro to charge 70-cent platform fee from July 1 for rides booked via its app\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cc4823b436b9ec697a37c3a2ff9d1cf2f284d0bda317550bf308ef37c61cc81b/gojek3_4.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTOS: STOMP"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/57dd76a11b367d4f7e88e003c50c2dc81021c6dad750784d2d7467de108de6ad/HES6145.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "Ride-hailing prices may rise due to platform workers law", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fade9220191d55e37612b8853e2691cf70f9009b98fcd00eec230601b8e7def8/gojek3_3.jpg?w=784", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/155139418b0cdfdcbb3c70460249479b6c4e88b061daa392cab7ee486f09ce86/YINH4800.JPG?w=318", "alt_text": "Reports filed against private-hire driver for $160k unpaid loans", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Any increase in flights will be carefully calibrated, he added.\n\nIn the last four weeks of 2022, about 200 travellers from China were detected to have Covid-19 - or less than 5 per cent of all imported cases in that period. In contrast, Asean countries accounted for half of imported cases here, 15 per cent were from the rest of Asia, 11 per cent from Europe and 9 per cent from the Middle East, said Mr Ong.\n\nOf the seven imported cases - mostly returning Singaporeans - that led to severe illness, only one was from China.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nno new variants have emerged in China\n\n, although given China's population of 1.4 billion, the majority of whom have not been infected by Covid-19, there remains risks and uncertainties.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 15, 2025, 12:05am\n\nSingapore's Covid-19 wave eases as weekly cases and hospitalisation numbers dip\n\nMore related stories\n\nNew variants can emerge from anywhere in the world, not just China, said Mr Ong.\n\n\"But we cannot be complacent. The measures may work now, but not permanently,\" he said. \"We will continually assess the situation and, if need be, make adjustments or implement new measures at all times. Our decisions must be based on science on evidence and on data.\"\n\nSingapore had never totally dismantled its pandemic measures, said Mr Ong. Incoming travellers need to be fully vaccinated based on World Health Organisation standards or produce a negative pre-departure test.\n\nThis is neither the tightest or the most liberal border measures among countries, but somewhere in between, he said.\n\nThe great majority of people in Singapore have also been vaccinated or have recovered from mild infections, so the population has developed strong hybrid immunity, said Mr Ong.\n\nHe said: \"Today, the probability of Covid-19 infections leading to severe illnesses or deaths for our population has become very low - comparable to influenza or pneumococcal infections.\"\n\nFor instance, the number of Covid-19 patients in ICU was in the single digit over the past 30 days, although there were a few deaths, he noted.\n\n\"Based on the severity rate today, annual deaths caused by Covid-19 infections is similar to that caused by influenza infections,\" he said.\n\n\"Hence, with extensive vaccination coverage, we can treat Covid-19 as an endemic disease. Like Influenza, top line infection numbers should no longer be our pre-occupation.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nS’pore ready to step up border measures if needed, MOH monitoring situation as China reopens\n\nWill a China Covid-19 wave set back endemic living in Singapore?\n\nNevertheless, he warned that things could change, since the pandemic is not over.\n\n\"What worries us most now, is the emergence of a new, unknown and more dangerous variant of concern,\" he said.\n\n\"It may possess worrying characteristics - escape vaccine protection, be more infectious and lead to more severe cases, which would be very bad news. A nightmare variant can knock us back to almost square one.\"\n\nShould that happen, Singapore may need to reinstate measures such as strict border controls, quarantine for travellers, social restrictions like as limits on group sizes, until a new and effective vaccine is developed.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nTourists from China not a Covid-19 threat to S’pore’s population: Expert\n\nWith few Covid-19 entry tests, South-east Asia may gain most from China's travel revival\n\nSalma Khalik\n\nSenior Health Correspondent\n\nCOVID-19 - SINGAPORE\n\nSINGAPORE PARLIAMENT\n\nONG YE KUNG\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nFeb 14, 2025, 01:01am\n\nCommunicable Diseases Agency to be set up to enhance agility in responding to outbreaks\n\nDec 3, 2024, 11:21pm\n\nPM Wong has Covid-19 for the first time 'after all these years'\n\nSep 2, 2024, 12:57am\n\n2,102 people in S'pore have died from Covid-19 up to June\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/63536347aba5dbd4ec4aa2adab430bba4f1c922d907482262017780d110e26c9/TOPSHOTS-TOPSHOT-CHINA-HEALTH-VIRUS-100226_5.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "In the last four weeks of 2022, about 200 travellers from China were detected to have Covid-19 - or less than 5 per cent of all imported cases in that period.", "caption": "In the last four weeks of 2022, about 200 travellers from China were detected to have Covid-19 - or less than 5 per cent of all imported cases in that period.

Go attained a gold standard for his Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) and an A-grade for this Breathing Apparatus Proficiency Test - both of which are mandatory tests that all NSFs must go through before they are deployed as firefighters.\n\nSgt (1) Go, who is the first person from the SCDF to have died during an operation, also fared well in other mandatory course requirements and attended to nearly 60 fire and rescue calls when he was posted to the Central Fire Station in May 2022, Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said on Monday in response to questions filed by Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok) and Workers' Party MP Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC).\n\nAssociate Professor Faishal also revealed that 40 per cent of the responders who were deployed to the fire at Block 91 Henderson Road on Dec 8, 2022 were national servicemen, with regular officers making up the remaining 60 per cent.\n\nIn all, 22 emergency vehicles and 61 responders from six fire stations were sent to fight the blaze that was raging inside a two-room unit on the fourth storey of the block in Bukit Merah, after the SCDF was alerted at about 11.10am that day.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 3, 2025, 10:38pm\n\nGE2025: WP to get two NCMP seats in the next Parliament, on top of 10 elected MPs\n\nMore related stories\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nThe arrival of SCDF officers to the scene was delayed by 18 minutes, said Prof Faishal, as the fire engine access way leading to the block was obstructed by a tent where a funeral wake was being held.\n\nThe officers had to remove bollards that were padlocked to the ground near the tent to create an access path, he added.\n\nHowever, Prof Faishal said it was still premature to determine the factors which contributed to SGT (1) Go's death, and he was unable to share further details due to ongoing investigations.\n\nHe said the police is currently\n\nconducting an independent probe\n\ninto the circumstances of Sgt (1) Go's death, and will apprise the coroner of its findings.\n\n\"SCDF will seek to understand what had happened, including if standard operating procedures and protocols had been followed, and how these may need to be tightened to keep the officers as safe as possible when they serve our nation,\" Prof Faishal added.\n\nIt was previously reported that Sgt (1) Go had fallen unconscious in the kitchen area of the Henderson Road flat while fighting the fire there, and he was taken out of the unit by his crew members, who tried to resuscitate him.\n\nHe was later taken to Singapore General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nThe NSF had enlisted in the SCDF on Jan 5, 2022, and had aspirations to enrol in medical school upon completion of his national service.\n\nIt was previously reported that he was certified medically fit before his enlistment, and categorised as PES A under the physical employment standard (PES).\n\nServicemen under this category are considered suitable for frontline operational vocations.\n\nAfter enlisting, he trained as a firefighter for 12 weeks, from Feb 3 until April 28. He was then posted to the Central Fire Station on May 4, and responded to more than 20 fire and rescue incidents before his death.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nOn Monday, Prof Faishal said all SCDF NSFs need to be certified medically fit and be categorised as PES A, B1, or B2, to be deployed as firefighters.\n\nThey will also need to complete a four-week Basic Rescue Training, as well as a 12-week Firefighter Course (FFC), held at the Civil Defence Academy (CDA).\n\nThe FFC includes both theoretical and practical components, and a series of proficiency and certification tests, including the IPPT, Breathing Apparatus Proficiency Test, Hazmat Responder Certification Test and Firemanship Skills Assessment.\n\nProf Faishal said firefighting training at the CDA is conducted with live fire simulators to provide realism, so that trainees gain experience operating in conditions similar to real-life firefighting. Meanwhile, SCDF has protocols to ensure that the training curriculum is reviewed regularly to ensure currency.\n\nAll firefighting personal protective equipment used by SCDF is also certified according to relevant international standards, such as the American National Fire Protection Association standards and European standards, he added.\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nTransport Correspondent\n\nSINGAPORE PARLIAMENT\n\nSCDF\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs\n\nFire\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 28, 2025, 10:51pm\n\nGE2025: Is my vote really secret?\n\nApr 28, 2025, 10:46pm\n\n'Mission Possible': Voting for WP in Punggol GRC will benefit all S'poreans, says Pritam Singh\n\nApr 22, 2025, 03:31am\n\nTearful Louis Ng announces exit from politics, says he wants more time with family\n\nApr 14, 2025, 07:16am\n\nGE2025: Key days and announcements to look out for in the lead-up to the election\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nHome & Decor Singapore\n\n5 Living Room Wellness Hacks You’ll Wish You Knew Sooner!\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8642840e32128f12eb055f94928dcf304444f300c1c3402a18f677ec3e02f5cd/rrscdffuneral0901_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel saluting the hearse of Sergeant (1) Edward H.

The palace has not issued any official reaction.\n\nThe ITV programme, Harry: The Interview, featured the prince reading extracts from the audiobook of his memoirs, which he narrates himself.\n\nIn one, he tells movingly of how his father broke the news of the 1997 death of his mother princess Diana in a car crash to his \"darling boy\".\n\n'Cried once'\n\nHarry revealed he only \"cried once\" after Diana was killed and said he felt guilty at being unable to express grief while greeting crowds of mourners whose hands were wet with tears.\n\nHe also talked about later going to see the route Diana's car took before the crash, asking a driver to take him through the road tunnel in Paris at the same speed.\n\n\"I've been asked if I want to open up another inquiry,\" Harry said of Diana's death. \"I don't really see the point at this stage.\"\n\nBut he admitted he still had lingering questions.\n\nThe book focuses on his combative relationship with William, saying his elder brother physically attacked him as they argued over Meghan.\n\n\"I saw this red mist in him\", Harry told ITV. \"I want reconciliation, but first there has to be accountability.\"\n\nThe prince dismissed media reports he and Meghan had at first got on well with William and his wife Kate.\n\nTabloid description of the couples as the \"Fab Four\", he said, \"was something that the British press created\".\n\nWilliam \"never tried to dissuade me from marrying Meghan, but he aired some concerns\", Harry added.\n\nCriticism of Camilla\n\nThe prince also criticised Charles's second wife and now Queen Consort.\n\nIn the book, he wrote that after Diana's death, Camilla \"began playing the long game: a campaign aimed at marriage and eventually the crown\".\n\nDetails appeared in media of private conversations that \"could only have been leaked\" by Camilla, Harry alleged.\n\n\"I love my father, I love my brother, I love my family. I will always do,\" Harry stressed in the interview, saying he hoped a reconciliation would \"100 per cent\" happen in the future.\n\n\"I don't think my father or brother will read the book. I really hope they do,\" he added.\n\nThe Sunday Times earlier quoted an unnamed friend of the brothers as saying William \"won't retaliate\" over the book, but \"he's anxious and he's sad\".\n\nAnother unnamed friend told the newspaper that William \"is staunchly protective of his own family, and he's not just going to roll over\".\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph broadsheet quoted sources close to Charles as saying the king saw a reconciliation with Harry as the \"only way out of this mess\", however.\n\nHarry will not have a formal role in Charles' coronation in 2023 which he is expected to attend, The Sunday Times reported. - AFP\n\nBritain\n\nROYAL FAMILIES\n\nMEMOIRS\n\nbooks\n\ntelevision\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 15, 2024, 10:49pm\n\nS'pore govt officer in London warned for leaving kids home alone\n\nAug 31, 2024, 04:39am\n\nOasis concert tickets relisted for more than $10k minutes after pre-sale\n\nAug 28, 2024, 12:16am\n\nAdele invites Singapore fan onstage at her concert in Germany\n\nAug 14, 2024, 03:33pm\n\nTaylor Swift set for emotional London return after terror threat\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ae43fc68e0797365abaecce10dadad008b019e809f749e08388d94d7bb7d5ea5/BRITAIN-ROYALS-SPARE-212251_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Prince Harry discusses his memoirs in a television interview on Sunday.", "caption": "Prince Harry discusses his memoirs in a television interview on Sunday.

Naraynasamy, 64, who was present in court, had no reaction and looked down at the ground when the judge meted out her sentence.\n\nPrincipal District Judge Toh Han Li said Prema's abuse of Ms Piang Ngaih Don, 24, took place over 15 distinct days. She used either her bare hands or various items to assault the maid during that time.\n\n\"The deceased is no longer with us to speak of her suffering but footages from the CCTV showed the shocking picture of the abuse and how emancipated and weak she was before her passing,\" said the judge.\n\nIn his submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutor Senthilkumaran Sabapathy noted the shocking and heinous nature of the crime and said that this was one of Singapore's worst abuse cases.\n\nHe said there was exceptionally high level of culpability on Prema's part and that the abuse involved a high degree of physical and psychological harm.\n\n\"The deceased was dragged and thrown around the house like a rag doll... Many of us would not even treat inanimate objects in such a manner. Her life was nothing short of a living nightmare and this was in no small due to Prema's actions,\" said the DPP.\n\nBetween October 2015 and her death in July 2016, Ms Piang was physically assaulted almost daily by Prema and her daughter Gaiyathiri Murugayan, 41. She was deprived of food and rest, and made to shower and relieve herself with the toilet door open.\n\nPrema had earlier pleaded guilty to 47 charges of voluntarily causing hurt to the maid and one charge of attempting to voluntarily cause hurt.\n\nShe is claiming trial to one charge of causing evidence to disappear.\n\nPrema had originally faced a murder charge but was later given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal.\n\nOn numerous occasions, Prema assaulted the victim herself, or with her daughter, housewife Gaiyathiri.\n\nGaiyathiri, the ex-wife of a police officer, was sentenced on June 22, 2021, to 30 years in prison -\n\nthe longest jail term meted out here in a maid abuse case.\n\nBetween June and July 2016, footage from cameras installed in their three-bedroom flat in Bishan showed Prema kicking and punching the victim and pulling her up from the ground by her hair and shaking her head violently.\n\nGaiyathiri Murugayan being taken back by police to her home in Bishan for investigations on Aug 3, 2016.

You learn to be cleverer after a while and have prevention strategies. At this stage, we would be in a better starting point if another pandemic happens,\" said Ms Yong, 58, who oversees several hundred ICU nurses and other areas at Singapore General Hospital (SGH).\n\nThe SGH ICU nursing team learnt to perfect three Cs - clarity, communication and collaboration - across departments to ensure that the hospital's most sick are well taken care of despite many uncertainties.\n\nOver the months, they have had more clarity about how the virus behaves and they grew used to fast-changing health protocols.\n\nMs Yong is one of many senior nurses who on Dec 29 were named recipients of\n\nspecial national awards for outstanding contributions to Singapore's fight against Covid-19.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 15, 2025, 12:05am\n\nSingapore's Covid-19 wave eases as weekly cases and hospitalisation numbers dip\n\nMore related stories\n\nSpanning nine award categories, the names of about 9,500 recipients - including pilots, scientists, general practitioners and school principals - were released at the end of December.\n\nMs Yong will receive the Covid-19\n\nPublic Administration Medal (Bronze).\n\nTwo new awards, the Covid-19 Resilience Medal and the Covid-19 Resilience Certificate, will be given to about 800 teams and 99,000 people who were directly involved in the fight against the virus. Their names will be announced later.\n\nThe most stressful and trying period at the ICUs was during the peak of the\n\ndeadly Delta wave in late 2021,\n\nwhen the infected patients were more ill and stayed longer in intensive care, said Ms Yong.\n\nSGH deputy director of nursing Patricia Yong oversees several hundred ICU nurses. ST PHOTO: JASON QUAH\n\nNurses had to deliver a higher level of care and keep a closer eye on critically ill patients who were hooked up to mechanical ventilators. Some of them were on the life-supporting extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo) machine, a resource-intensive treatment that takes over the function of the lungs.\n\nBut during\n\nthe Omicron waves,\n\nmost of the seriously ill patients did not need ventilators as the variant and its strains were less severe. Patients responded well to non-invasive oxygen therapy using high-flow nasal cannulas and by lying on their bellies so they could breathe better.\n\nNow, the ICUs are almost back to a comfortable level, with fewer Covid-19-related hospitalisations and ICU cases. The number of Covid-19-related hospitalisations remains below 100, and the number of infected patients in intensive care is in the single digits as at Jan 4.\n\nBut at the National University Hospital's Emergency Medicine Department, Ms Uma Chandra Segara, 46, assistant director of nursing, and her nurses are gearing up for busy days ahead.\n\nWhile a packed emergency department (ED) is not surprising to healthcare staff, the virus has exacerbated the problem. Every infection wave has led to a flood of patients in the EDs and longer waiting times for admission.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFirst look at medal for those who helped Singapore’s fight against Covid-19\n\nMore than 100,000 to receive special state awards for helping S'pore fight Covid-19\n\nDuring the recent wave caused by the\n\nXBB sub-variant of Omicron in late 2022,\n\nsome patients had to wait for up to 30 hours to get a bed, said Ms Uma.\n\n\"Every time when Covid-19 restrictions are lifted, I would say that the emergency department's work has not changed since the Covid-19 (pandemic) began.\n\n\"Schools have just reopened and Chinese New Year is coming. We are bracing ourselves for any surge. But we are quite prepared to manage a next wave,\" she said.\n\nMs Uma Chandra Segara debriefing staff at a Covid-19 vaccination clinic at NUH after running through the vaccination process.

They tend to have more complications and will have to be hospitalised for a longer time, making it tricky to free up more beds in the wards.\n\nWhen patients with non-urgent conditions come to a packed ED, nurses have to sometimes spend more than 10 minutes persuading them to go to a nearby clinic instead, Ms Uma added.\n\nWith\n\nthe bed crunch,\n\ninpatient care now begins in the EDs. Ms Uma is no longer surprised when she sees the same patient from her previous shift. Inpatient doctors would visit the emergency medicine department to start patients on treatment.\n\nMs Uma, who has been in the nursing profession for more than 26 years, is one of more than 7,200 who will receive the Commendation Medal (Covid-19).\n\nShe oversees about 180 nurses in the Emergency Medicine Department and leads the Covid-19 vaccination efforts for staff and patients, among other duties.\n\nNational University Hospital’s assistant director of nursing Uma Chandra Segara will receive the Commendation Medal (Covid-19). PHOTO: NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM\n\nThe pandemic has worsened the\n\nshortage of nurses here and in the rest of the world.\n\nIn 2021, the number of nurses in Singapore's public hospitals who resigned reached a five-year high,\n\nwith 7.4 per cent of local nurses and 14.8 per cent of foreign nurses leaving their jobs.\n\nTravel restrictions during the pandemic also meant that foreign nurses were separated, often for years, from their loved ones.\n\nVideo calls were the only way for Malaysian Ng Sook Ting, 37, to check in on her mother, who lives in Kuala Lumpur and suffers from ailments such as diabetes and hypertension.\n\n\"My family was worried about me as a front-liner, and at the same time, I was worried about them,\" said the senior staff nurse at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's acute and emergency care department.\n\nMalaysian Ng Sook Ting, a senior staff nurse at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital’s acute and emergency care department.

Some foreign nurses returned to their home towns or sought employment elsewhere, said Ms Uma and Ms Yong.\n\nThe manpower strain was felt the most when nurses also came down with Covid-19 during the infection waves.\n\nForeign nurses make up almost 30 per cent of Singapore's registered nurses, and about 40 per cent of enrolled nurses.\n\nTypically, each nurse at the NUH emergency medicine department would care for six to eight patients. There are between 30 and 35 nurses during every shift. But there were times when each nurse had to attend to 15 to 20 patients when the ED was overwhelmed, said Ms Uma.\n\nSupport care staff were recently hired to help with duties such as monitoring the vital signs of patients so that nurses can focus on new patients or tend to the severely ill ones.\n\nSingapore expects to employ about 4,000 more nurses by the end of 2023 to boost the nursing workforce.\n\nMs Chen Jing, a senior nurse manager at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, said that for nurses, dealing with the pandemic felt like a \"never-ending battle\".\n\nNational Centre for Infectious Diseases senior nurse manager Chen Jing holding a briefing for other nurses. PHOTO: NATIONAL CENTRE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES\n\nKeeping nurses in their jobs will require, among other things, redesigning their roles to allow them to focus on delivering care, said the 40-year-old, who has 18 years of nursing experience and will receive the Public Administration Medal (Bronze).\n\nOn top of that, the pressures of being in healthcare require one to develop strategies to build mental resilience, she added.\n\nFor Ms Chen, this includes taking on community work whenever she can, such as by distributing necessities to the needy during the Chinese New Year period.\n\n\"It makes me feel like I'm contributing to society (in other ways), not only by caring for the sick.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nTop Covid-19 National Awards to be given to 3 who played key roles in fight against pandemic\n\nScoot crew and medical personnel to receive Medal of Valour for rescuing S'poreans in Wuhan\n\nShabana Begum\n\nand\n\nZhaki Abdullah\n\nCOVID-19 - SINGAPORE\n\nHEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS\n\nSINGAPORE HOSPITALS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nFeb 14, 2025, 01:01am\n\nCommunicable Diseases Agency to be set up to enhance agility in responding to outbreaks\n\nDec 3, 2024, 11:21pm\n\nPM Wong has Covid-19 for the first time 'after all these years'\n\nSep 2, 2024, 12:57am\n\n2,102 people in S'pore have died from Covid-19 up to June\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b73b08516f2dd8b0f815473aa147d1b49db6e26fe90f4cd8d44897333d38004f/20230104252429917c16a5bd-f47a-44de-ad20-f1ed1967b7b1_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "SGH deputy director of nursing Patricia Yong, 58, will receive the Covid-19 Public Administration Medal (Bronze).", "caption": "SGH deputy director of nursing Patricia Yong, 58, will receive the Covid-19 Public Administration Medal (Bronze).

It has changed tack of late, despite reports of a spike in cases.\n\nOn Sunday, it did away with its \"5+3\" quarantine policy, under which travellers had to stay at a hotel for five days upon arrival, before serving a three-day stay-home notice.\n\nThe curbs were even tougher in the early days of the pandemic, when travellers from outside the country needed to be quarantined between two and three weeks when they entered China.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:31am\n\nS'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat\n\nMore related stories\n\nInbound travellers now need produce only a negative Covid-19 test taken 48 hours before their flight. Previously, they had to apply for a health code before they could fly and be tested upon arrival before being quarantined.\n\nThousands of people from Hong Kong,\n\nfor example, are expected to fly into China in the coming weeks.\n\nAt Beijing Capital International Airport, businessman Alan Zhang told The Straits Times: \"I've not visited my friends and family in Beijing since the pandemic started, so I am excited to catch up with them. I also have work to attend to here.\"\n\nThe Canadian citizen, 42, had flown from Singapore to Beijing by transiting in Hong Kong. He said he used to visit Beijing at least once a year but had been put off by the previous quarantine requirement.\n\n\"It did not help that China had continued with its zero-Covid policy, despite the rest of the world opening up, so I thought I would wait for the policy to change... I just didn't expect it to be so soon,\" he added.\n\nThe removal of quarantine for inbound travellers\n\nwas announced on Dec 26\n\nas part of China's gradual easing up on its exacting Covid-19 policy.\n\nChina had, until late November when infections hit a peak of 40,000 new cases a day, insisted on mass testing, strict quarantines and flash lockdowns.\n\nGuangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong in southern China, and south-western Chongqing city were two of the earliest cities to ease pandemic restrictions on Nov 30, before other cities, including Beijing, loosened their tight measures as well.\n\nThe Chinese government on Dec 7 then allowed residents who had Covid-19 to\n\nisolate at home instead of being taken to hospital,\n\nin a change that caught many by surprise.\n\nA family greeting a woman who arrived on an international flight at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai on Jan 8, 2023.

That's why I delayed my flight to Beijing. I didn't want to spend my days cooped up in a hotel or go through Covid-19 tests,\" she said.\n\nMs Sun plans to spend Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan 22 in 2023, in Beijing with relatives before returning to the US in February. \"I have cousins in Beijing whom I'm close to, and I have not seen them since the pandemic started,\" she said.\n\nWorkers at Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport, where just a handful of international flights were scheduled to land, told ST on Sunday that they are looking forward to welcoming overseas tourists once more flights resumed.\n\n\"It has been so quiet over the past three years,\" said a salesman at the airport's souvenir shop. \"Things were better in 2021, when China had a better control over Covid-19, but sales have really dwindled last year because of the outbreaks and the subsequent lockdowns.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nChina reopens borders in final farewell to zero-Covid\n\nExcitement at Hong Kong's China border as quarantine lifted\n\nAw Cheng Wei\n\nChina Correspondent\n\nChina\n\ncovid-19\n\nECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 30, 2025, 03:04am\n\nSelf-driving public shuttles in Punggol by fourth quarter\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:52pm\n\nSingapore's first private assisted-living pilot ready by 2026\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nMay 16, 2025, 01:14am\n\nSingapore actress Eleanor Lee accused online of insulting China, allegedly dropped from Chinese show\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9c4702e22f7366e2752b08e5cad99f3515d871b3dfe09ece78324de0c92406a1/dw-china-airport-aw1-230108_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A passenger receiving a hug at the arrival hall for international flights at the Capital International Airport in Beijing on Jan 8, 2023.

Manchester City powered to a second victory against troubled Chelsea in the space of four days as Riyad Mahrez inspired a 4-0 rout in the FA Cup third round, while Aston Villa crashed to a 2-1 defeat against fourth tier Stevenage on Sunday.\n\nAfter Premier League sides Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth were humiliated by lower-league opposition on Saturday, Unai Emery's Villa were rocked by Stevenage's two-goal blast in the final minutes.\n\nPremier League champions City rarely suffer such humiliation and they made the strongest possible start by dismissing Chelsea with contemptuous ease at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nPep Guardiola made seven changes from the City side that won 1-0 at Chelsea in the Premier League on Thursday.\n\nBut City were still far too dynamic for struggling Chelsea as Mahrez struck with a brilliant free-kick and a late penalty, with Julian Alvarez and Phil Foden also scoring.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 26, 2024, 02:25pm\n\n'I'll win trophies elsewhere,' says Erik ten Hag as Manchester United sack talk lingers\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn the fourth round, City will host Premier League leaders Arsenal or third- tier Oxford, who meet on Monday.\n\nCity had already eliminated Chelsea from the League Cup this season and the west London club's first FA Cup third-round exit since 1998 was another blow to a season in danger of spiralling out of control.\n\nWhile it is probably too early for Chelsea boss Graham Potter to be fearing the sack, just four months after he arrived from Brighton to replace the axed Thomas Tuchel, the 47-year-old might be having a few sleepless nights as he wrestles with his team's woeful form.\n\nChelsea have won just three of their last 12 games in all competitions and sit 10th in the Premier League, 10 points adrift of the top four place the club's American owners would surely have expected Potter to deliver.\n\nPotter will hardly have been comforted by the sound of Chelsea fans chanting Tuchel's name as they pine for the German who led them to Champions league glory in 2021.\n\nGiven Chelsea's predicament it was curious that Potter elected to make six changes, with Bashir Humphreys given his debut and fellow teenager Lewis Hall also starting.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: Man City beat Chelsea to close gap at top of Premier League\n\nFootball: Embattled Lampard insists he doesn’t ‘need reassurances’ over his Everton future\n\nMahrez took advantage of Potter's selection gamble when he drew a rash foul from Hall in the 23rd minute.\n\nThe Algeria winger had scored the winner against Chelsea on Thursday and this time he bent a superb free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards.\n\nWoeful Chelsea\n\nCity's second goal was a gift from Chelsea forward Kai Havertz, who punched the ball as he challenged Aymeric Laporte at a corner.\n\nAlvarez slotted the 30th minute penalty past Kepa Arrizabalaga despite the Chelsea keeper's attempt to distract the Argentine World Cup winner by talking to him before the kick.\n\nChelsea were being torn apart and Foden hit the third goal in the 38th minute, the England forward finishing off Kyle Walker's cross after Mahrez's pass unhinged the ragged visitors.\n\nBeaten in the last three FA Cup finals, Chelsea's misery was compounded in the 85th minute as Mahrez scored from the spot after Kalidou Koulibaly fouled Foden.\n\nVilla boss Unai Emery made eight changes against Stevenage and the team currently second in League Two made the Spaniard pay for his decision.\n\nMorgan Sanson put Villa ahead in the 33rd minute but Jamie Reid equalised with an 88th minute penalty after Leander Dendoncker was sent off for fouling Dean Campbell.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: Ings equaliser gives Villa share of spoils against Wolves\n\nFootball: Tottenham slump to Villa defeat as top four hopes suffer blow\n\nAnd Campbell sparked wild Stevenage celebrations in the 90th minute when he smashed home from a short corner.\n\nLeeds were fortunate to avoid embarrassment after escaping with a dramatic 2-2 draw at second tier Cardiff.\n\nJesse Marsch's side were shocked by first-half goals from Jayden Philogene-Bidace and Sheyi Ojo.\n\nRodrigo got one back in the 65th minute, then missed a penalty after Cardiff's Joel Bagan was sent off for handling on the line.\n\nWith just seconds left, Sonny Perkins spared Rodrigo's blushes as the 18-year-old substitute netted from close-range to force a replay. -

Many of them did not consider it an issue when we informed them about what the change means.\"\n\nMr Ong said EU Holidays has seen neither a spike nor a drop in bookings since the announcement was made.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 10, 2025, 12:30am\n\nSingaporean fugitive arrested in Thailand for alleged drug trafficking\n\nMore related stories\n\nThailand is a very popular destination for Singaporeans as it is nearby and does not require a big budget, so there is unlikely to be any major impact on his business, he added.\n\nThailand, like many other countries, is preparing for a fresh wave of tourists from China, which on Sunday\n\nopened its borders after three long years\n\nas it nixed its zero-Covid policy.\n\nOn Saturday, Thai Transport Minister Saksayam Chidchob said\n\nforeigners flying into the kingdom will have to satisfy new entry requirements\n\nfrom Monday.\n\nFor instance, all foreign travellers entering Thailand will have to show proof of vaccination.\n\nAdults must show proof of at least two vaccinations or recovery from the virus since July.\n\nThose who are unvaccinated will be required to produce a medical report stating their reasons for not being vaccinated, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand in a statement.\n\nThe rules apply until Jan 31.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nThailand brings back Covid-19 entry rules for all international travellers\n\nA cold welcome for Chinese tourists\n\nBoth EU Holidays and Chan Brothers Travel said the new rules are not cause for concern as the majority of Singaporeans have received both vaccination doses, as well as booster shots.\n\nMr Jeremiah Wong, who is a senior marketing communications manager at Chan Brothers Travel, said all customers are required to be fully vaccinated when making a booking.\n\n\"Thus, we are not observing any knee-jerk reaction as Singapore has a high fully vaccinated population and we expect demand for our Thailand tours to remain unaffected,\" he said.\n\nRetail worker Jasmine Lim, 24, said the rules will not deter her from going to Thailand.\n\nShe said: \"My friends and I were thinking of taking a short trip to Phuket before Chinese New Year.\n\n\"I don't think the rules change anything. It just means we have to now show our vaccination cards.\"\n\nAnother holidaymaker, fully vaccinated 28-year-old nurse Sophie D'cruz, said she was relieved entry rules into Thailand got tightened.\n\nShe said: \"I understand everyone wants to return to normalcy and not have such regulations in place, especially when it has been three years.\n\n\"But I tested positive for Covid-19 three times in the past 1½ years, even after taking precautions, like always wearing a mask outside, and carrying hand sanitiser around.

He declined to give further details.\n\nHe said: \"I hope the rules do not remain longer than Jan 31. I am really looking forward to spending time on holiday with my grandpa.\"\n\nMs D'cruz, however, said she hopes more countries near Singapore will adopt tighter travel restrictions again, if that will help prevent the Covid-19 spikes that occur every few months in Singapore.\n\nShe said: \"I wouldn't mind if the restrictions were in place for at least two more years, even though the situation is not as bad as it was a few years ago.\n\n\"With China is opening up its borders, it would not be the worst decision.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n'More the merrier': Asia tourist hubs ready for China influx\n\nWith few Covid-19 entry tests, South-east Asia may gain most from China's travel revival\n\nFatimah Mujibah\n\nthailand\n\ncovid-19\n\nTRAVEL ADVISORIES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:20am\n\n2 Singaporeans among 3 arrested in Thailand in joint anti-vice sweep\n\nJun 4, 2025, 11:28pm\n\nS'pore businessman nabbed before flight at Bangkok airport over suspected tax evasion\n\nMay 21, 2025, 12:24am\n\nActor Mark Lee urges hairstylist Addy Lee not to be too harsh on host Quan Yifeng\n\nMay 6, 2025, 02:06am\n\nSingaporean man in Thailand nabbed for being part of illegal vape network\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8256e9b446284f27b81787794b06dad138bdf22b9e41ebe6dcc9d5fdc7934596/dw-thailand-tourist-230108_1.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "All foreign travellers entering Thailand will have to show proof of vaccination, as part of stricter measures beginning on Jan 9, 2023.", "caption": "All foreign travellers entering Thailand will have to show proof of vaccination, as part of stricter measures beginning on Jan 9, 2023.

It is different from the more common Type 2 diabetes, which is linked to diet and lifestyle factors.\n\nJoshua and his parents still get affected whenever he is misunderstood by others.\n\nOnce, the boy was taking a flu vaccination when a nurse remarked that \"he must have eaten a lot of sweets, and that's why he has diabetes at this young age\", his father Wong Soon Yeow recalls.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 6, 2025, 01:24am\n\nDiabetes supplement CuraLin recalled after HSA finds risks of seizures, coma if taken incorrectly\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We were very disappointed and disturbed by her comment. We felt that she has no compassion for children with Type 1 diabetes who need to be injected (with insulin) five times a day.\"\n\nMr Wong and his wife Hun Shiew Young, both 41 and educators, found out about their son's condition when they had observed that he kept losing weight despite eating and drinking a lot more. He also complained of pain in the mouth.\n\nThey also have a nine-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son. Both children do not have the condition.\n\nThey took Joshua to see a dentist and a doctor, but his condition continued to worsen.\n\nOne day, he became very sleepy and slipped into unconsciousness. He was admitted to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis, common among people with Type 1 diabetes. It can be dangerous, even life-threatening, if untreated.\n\nAt KKH, about 1,400 children and adolescents have been diagnosed with diabetes since 1997. The majority of them have Type 1 diabetes, according to Professor Fabian Yap, head and senior consultant at its Department of Paediatrics' Endocrinology Service.\n\nThe overall prevalence of Type 1 diabetes is low and estimated at less than 5 per cent of all those with diabetes in Singapore, says Dr Daphne Gardner, senior consultant in endocrinology at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nBut it remains important to address the specific needs for managing this condition well and also raise public awareness.\n\nIn Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops producing insulin and lifelong insulin replacement - via injections or an insulin pump - is needed for survival. Without insulin, one can quickly feel very unwell and end up in hospital, so the condition has to be taken seriously, Dr Gardner adds.\n\nJoshua has been carrying a pump to deliver the insulin that he lacks and wears a glucose-monitoring sensor on the back of his upper arm.\n\nMr Wong Soon Yeow and his wife Hun Shiew Young, with their children (from left) Gladys, Justin and Joshua. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\n\"Sometimes, he would ask when he can stop using these devices, and imagines that he can be free from them one day,\" Mr Wong says.\n\nIt did not help that a classmate saw the devices on Joshua and teased him: \"Are you a robot?\"\n\nHe is sharing his family's experiences so that people will be more compassionate to those with the condition.\n\nHe is also thankful for efforts such as the picture book, My Name Is Adam. I Have Type 1 Diabetes. The story follows a 10-year-old boy who attempts to adjust to life following his diagnosis.\n\nWhile the character is fictional, the content is drawn from real-life experiences shared by Singapore families who have loved ones with Type 1 diabetes.\n\nIts authors Candy Gan, 25, and Yeo Cheng Yong, 33, have also been living with the condition since they were aged two and 20 respectively.\n\nGan says some 3,000 copies have been distributed to schools, public libraries, hospitals, clinics and non-profit organisations.\n\nThe story makes a good conversation starter for parents and educators to talk about Type 1 diabetes with kids. Joshua's Primary 1 teacher, for instance, read the book to his classmates.\n\nAuthors Candy Gan (left) and Yeo Cheng Yong and seven-year-old Joshua Wong. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nMr Wong says it is also a misconception that those with Type 1 diabetes cannot consume sugary food.\n\nJoshua, in fact, gets to eat sweets, biscuits and ice cream more often than before the diagnosis. These help adjust his glucose level when it is too low.\n\nThe challenge for his parents is to figure out how much insulin to give to cover for the amount of carbohydrates in his food. To better manage the glucose level, the timing of food intake can also be important.\n\n\"Many times, Joshua had to wait before he could eat. We had to rationalise with him or distract his attention, such as by allowing him more screen time.\"\n\nDr Gardner says those with Type 1 diabetes and their caregivers are among the most resilient individuals.\n\nThey have to apply that discipline and knowledge - before eating, drinking and even exercising - 24/7 for the rest of their lives.\n\n\"This is why their mental burden can sometimes become very overwhelming,\" she says.\n\nMr Wong and his wife can relate to it. Their relationship broke down at least twice during the journey of caring for Joshua.\n\nDespite their best efforts, they had made some wrong judgments, causing their son to be unwell.\n\nWhen too much insulin is given, the glucose level may fall too low and there is immediate danger of becoming unconscious. Meanwhile, too little insulin leads to a high glucose level and may affect the body over time.\n\nThere are more than 40 factors affecting the glucose level, such as types of food and physical activity, stress, temperature and biological changes.\n\n\"The more we wanted to control it, the more frustrated and disappointed we got,\" says Mr Wong.\n\nBut their marriage has come out stronger after a heart-to-heart talk with each other.\n\n\"Both husband and wife must have the courage to seek support from others, especially the emotional aspect,\" he says. \"If we cannot take good care of ourselves, how do we take good care of our children?\"\n\nHe is heartened that Joshua is self-disciplined and proactive in managing his condition. For instance, whenever he feels dizzy - a sign of low glucose level - he will approach his teachers to let him take sweets.\n\nMr Wong reassures Joshua that he is as normal as other children.\n\nHe says: \"It is just that he needs external devices to support him for food intake. It is similar to those who wear spectacles to support their eyesight.\"\n\nElisa Chia\n\ndiabetes\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 23, 2025, 11:35pm\n\nNUS researchers develop use of microneedles to treat diabetic wounds\n\nMar 22, 2024, 06:47am\n\nNTU scientists find quicker, more accurate cancer detection\n\nFeb 16, 2024, 07:02am\n\nActor Duan Weiming grateful for post-amputation TV comeback\n\nApr 2, 2023, 03:01pm\n\nThe controversial 'Skinny Pen' helping celebrities shed weight\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nTransform your home affordably with IKEA Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f47b0614847ee56dec51b1575c4dace3d260ee7004bda20c34864014472aadae/hztype271122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Seven-year-old Joshua Wong, seen here with his father Wong Soon Yeow, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2019. \n", "caption": "Seven-year-old Joshua Wong, seen here with his father Wong Soon Yeow, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2019.

While the postmen found some anomalies, these turned out to be false alarms.\n\nPostmen, shopkeepers or others can alert Cheng San Community Club to any anomalies or irregularities. Grassroots volunteers will then be activated to visit the residents and check on them.\n\nMr Lee Sian Hock, 56, owner of Guan Hock Coffee Stall at Chong Boon Market & Food Centre, is among the hawkers and shop owners who have volunteered to receive training in the pilot programme.\n\n\"(The initiative) is good - I'll know how to identify seniors who need help because, for now, I only know my regulars,\" said Mr Lee, who has worked in the area for 30 years. \"I will try to help however I can.\"\n\nMs Nadia Ahmad Samdin, the MP for Cheng San-Seletar ward, who launched the Care Network-Living Well initiative in December 2021 to equip the community with awareness about mental health issues, said such initiatives are about having more eyes and ears on the ground.\n\nShe noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on seniors, causing some of them to feel more withdrawn and afraid to step out of their homes, with some not knowing who to reach out to for help.\n\n\"A lot of the organisations like the ageing centres are in physical spaces, but we want to try to draw as many seniors out as possible and go down to the nodes where they are... like with the TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) mobile van,\" Ms Nadia said.\n\nShe was referring to a plan by Cheng San Community Club and TCM clinic Thong Chai Medical Institution to roll out a minibus clinic in March to visit residents in public and private estates once every two weeks.\n\nMinister for Health Ong Ye Kung (right) and Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Nadia Ahmad Samdin (centre) with SingPost inspector of post Mohammad Sophian Kadir.

Consultations are free, but residents can offer a donation if they wish.\n\nMr Ong said: \"We don't want to only see (seniors) when they're sick... With an active ageing lifestyle where you eat the right things; sleep the right way; have friends, care and love, you can stay healthy for as long as possible.\"\n\nAnjali Raguraman\n\nConsumer Correspondent\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nONG YE KUNG\n\nsenior citizens\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 5, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nWheelchair user lives in cluttered flat; mattress covered in faeces and maggots\n\nJun 28, 2024, 02:07am\n\nTeatime: Have we lost our kampung spirit?\n\nMay 22, 2024, 09:26am\n\nBriton who died on SQ321 was looking forward to 'last big holiday' with wife\n\nApr 18, 2024, 09:07am\n\nSRC members protest fund-raising for $16.6m upgrading plan\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nHardwareZone Singapore\n\nM1 starts SG60 celebration with perks for Apple, Honor, OPPO, Samsung, Vivo devices\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5a31af4adf58b896afa448163ebceffe078e604c209866cf4797c93c86a37d2a/2023010886003338d9cd361d-426a-4b1a-be48-936b4866a309_3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung (centre) and Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Nadia Ahmad Samdin (background) speaking to stallholders at Chong Boon Market & Food Centre on Sunday. \n", "caption": "Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung (centre) and Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Nadia Ahmad Samdin (background) speaking to stallholders at Chong Boon Market & Food Centre on Sunday.

The Singapore Management University law don is vice-president of the foundation, which was set up in 1982 to foster the spirit of entrepreneurship and dedication to education displayed by the late philanthropist it is named after.\n\n\"This is not meant to be a one-off (scholarship), or a short-term one of five years; the intention is to make it long-running,\" added Prof Tan, who also oversees selection of postgraduate scholarship awardees under an existing programme of the foundation.\n\nProceeds of over $1.3 million raised from a gala dinner held at the Shangri-La Singapore on Sunday to celebrate the foundation's 40th anniversary will help to initially fund the scholarship for ITE graduates.\n\nThe funds raised will also be used to grow the foundation's flagship activities, including the postgraduate scholarship and Young Inventors' Awards, which are organised yearly.\n\nThe funds will also help to further improve the Pioneers' Memorial Hall at 43 Bukit Pasoh Road, to better educate the public about pioneers in the Singapore community, such as Tan Kah Kee and Lee Kong Chian.\n\nProf Tan said the foundation welcomes all donations, especially from small and medium enterprises, to help expand the number of scholarships awarded each year.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the field of study for scholarship holders.\n\nThis distinguishes the foundation's scholarship from scholarships offered by other organisations to ITE graduates, which are often targeted at specific fields, noted ITE chief executive Low Khah Gek, who attended the dinner.\n\n\"This scholarship is a more generalised one, and the message (it sends) is 'I support your effort to upgrade, and I'm prepared to give you a scholarship',\" said Ms Low.\n\nMinister for Education Chan Chun Sing, who was guest of honour at the dinner, said in a speech in Mandarin that the scholarship would greatly benefit ITE students, who are a group in need of support within Singapore's education landscape.\n\nMr Chan also said that Chinese society bore a virtuous, time-honoured tradition of education, and there are three essential lessons that Singapore could draw from the life of Tan Kah Kee.\n\nThe first, he said, is a belief in education underpinned by defining success based on how much better off the next generation is.\n\nThe second lesson is to understand personal achievement as merely a means to an end.\n\n\"Personal achievements are stepping stones to one's broader contribution to society,\" said Mr Chan.\n\nThe third lesson is to foster a spirit of giving and gratitude, as exemplified by the foundation's scholarships.\n\n\"When we award such scholarships, we are reminded that our successes are not purely of our own making but of the community around us.\"\n\nTay Hong Yi\n\nInstitute of Technical Education (ITE)\n\nscholarships\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e35edc1f5610fadab50a1ab1473cb9488af094710f50ccba870cdb2439531a41/dw-ccs-takk-230108.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing said the scholarship by the Tan Kah Kee Foundation would greatly benefit ITE students. \n", "caption": "Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing said the scholarship by the Tan Kah Kee Foundation would greatly benefit ITE students.

They were born in North America but fight under the Singapore flag\n\nAngela and Christian were born in Vancouver Canada, and younger sister Victoria was born in Waipahu, a town in Hawaii, to Singaporean father Ken Lee and South Korean mother, Jewelz Lee. The family currently lives in Hawaii.\n\nAngela Lee said in a facebook post in 2016: \"Though I may not have a Singaporean passport, or a PR status here, my Singaporean roots reside deep within me and make up who I am. I am so proud to be able to represent my culture and my family. I am proud to represent Singapore!\"\n\n2. Their parents introduced them to martial arts\n\nThe couple are decorated martial artists. Ken Lee holds black belts in three different martial arts, including a first degree black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, while Jewelz holds a 5th Degree Hapdosool master black belt.\n\nKen is currently the owner and head coach of United MMA gym in Hawaii and often trains with his children.\n\nThe Lee family of (from left) dad Ken, Adrian, Christian, Angela, Victoria and mum Jewelz, in a photo taken on Aug 21, 2015. PHOTO: ST FILE\n\n3. Angela was the youngest MMA champion at 19\n\nIn 2016, Angela Lee's win over Japan's Mei Yamaguchi for the One women's atomweight belt made her the youngest fighter at the time to win a world title at 19 years of age. She has since retained her title five times, against rivals such as China's Xiong Jingnan and Thailand's Stamp Fairtex.\n\n4. Christian is the One athlete who has recorded the most wins and knockouts\n\nWith a win-loss record of 17-4, Christian has recorded more wins than any other One athlete, and bagged his 12 wins through knockout.\n\n5. Angela is One Championship's first \"mum-champ\"\n\nAngela Lee at the Open workout ahead of mixed martial arts event One Championship in Singapore, in March last year. ST PHOTO: DESMOND WEE\n\nAngela made a triumphant return to the ring after a two-year hiatus and the birth of her first child, Ava Marie, in March 2022 as she successfully defended her atomweight title against challenger Fairtex.\n\nShe celebrated with her daughter in the ring after a fight which ended in the second round as Fairtex submitted after Angela locked her in a rear-naked choke.\n\n6. Christian holds One championship titles in two weight divisions\n\nChristian, nicknamed \"The Warrior\", recovered his One Championship lightweight world title from South Korea's Ok Rae Yoon in August 2022 via a technical knockout in the second round.\n\nIn November 2022, Christian dethroned Kiamrian Abbasov to add the welterweight world title to his collection, becoming a two-division One world champion in the process.\n\n7. Victoria had a perfect record of 3-0\n\n2021 was a monumental year for the fighter, nicknamed \"The Prodigy\", as all three of her fights ended in finishes - two submissions against Thailand's Sunisa Srisen and China's Wang Luping and her first technical knockout in her last rodeo against Brazil's Victoria Souza.\n\n8. Victoria was set to return to the ring after her 2022 hiatus on Jan 13\n\nVictoria, who graduated high school in 2022, had her next match set for Friday against India's Zeba Bano at the Impact Arena in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nHer last match was in September 2021, before she took a hiatus of over 15 months.\n\nKolette Lim\n\nMMA (MIXED MARTIAL ARTS)\n\nSINGAPORE ATHLETES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBest USD Fixed Deposit Rates in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a180770cddab6e1db2b179b8aaa0bd28a7166a2441a951e0ac41a5650b0b9687/dw-lee-siblings-230108_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Lee siblings (from left) Adrian, Angela, Christian and Victoria. \n", "caption": "The Lee siblings (from left) Adrian, Angela, Christian and Victoria.

Her death on Boxing Day in Hawaii was announced by Angela on Saturday - the cause was not stated.\n\n\"She has gone too soon and our family has been completely devastated since then,\" said Angela in a post on Instagram. \"We miss her. More than anything in this world. Our family will never be the same. Life will never be the same.\"\n\nA celebration of her life has been scheduled for Jan 22 before her burial.\n\nAngela requested \"grace and respect\" for her family and urged everyone to \"check on your loved ones\".\n\n\"Keep checking on them. Give them hugs and tell them how much they mean to you. You just never know,\" she said.\n\nAngela and Christian were born in Vancouver, Canada, and Victoria was born in Waipahu, a town in Hawaii, to Singaporean father Ken Lee and South Korean-Canadian mother Jewelz Lee.\n\nAlthough they reside in the United States, the Lees, who are coached by their parents, fight under the Singapore flag.\n\nTheir youngest brother, Adrian Lee, 17, is also set to follow in his siblings' footsteps, as he came out victorious in his first amateur MMA title fight held in Hawaii in December 2022.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, One expressed shock at the news and said: \"The One Championship team is devastated over the tragic passing of Victoria Lee... our most heartfelt condolences to her family and friends at this difficult time.\"\n\nOne chief executive officer Chatri Sityodtong said he was \"heartbroken\" by the news.\n\n\"Victoria had the purest heart of gold and a brilliant mind. She looked after others before herself. She wanted to use her life to help the world. I will always remember Victoria for the beautiful and precious soul that she was,\" he said.\n\nOther MMA fighters have also paid tribute to the teenager on social media.\n\nOn Facebook, Myanmar fighter Aung La Nsang, another One champion, wrote: \"My heart breaks for the Lee family. I have so much respect and admiration for them. The news of Victoria broke my heart.\"\n\nIndian fighter Ritu Phogat commented on Angela's Instagram post, saying: \"We are so sorry to hear this. Our deepest condolences... she was so young.\"\n\nTouted as one of the most promising MMA athletes in the world, Victoria made her debut at One's Fists of Fury event at the Singapore Indoor Stadium in February 2021, three months shy of her 17th birthday, beating Thai fighter Sunisa Srisen via a rear-naked choke before winning her next two fights, also through finishes.\n\nIn an interview before her debut, Victoria told The Straits Times that she would never face her elder sister in an MMA contest and was \"not trying to chase her or break any records\".\n\n\"I'm just focusing on my own journey,\" said the soft-spoken teenager, who graduated from Mililani High School in Hawaii last May.\n\nShe had not fought since Sept 21, 2021, when she defeated Brazilian Victoria Souza by technical knockout in Singapore. Her next bout was to be on Saturday against India's Zeba Bano, 24, in Bangkok.\n\nPrior to her professional MMA debut with One, Victoria had claimed the 2019 International Mixed Martial Arts Federation Junior World Championship, two Pankration Junior World Championships, and a 2019 Hawaii State Wrestling Championship. She was also a 15-time North American Grappling Association expert champion.\n\nThe Lee family of (from left) dad Ken, Adrian, Christian, Angela, Victoria and mum Jewelz, in a photo taken on Aug 21, 2015.

More than you could ever realise. We're all broken. Because a piece of you was in each of us and, when you left, those pieces were ripped out of us.\n\n\"We will never be the same... You were our bright light. Our sunshine. And that will never change. We love you Victoria. I love you Sprout.

The winning time was 1min 5.33sec for the 1,100m on the all-weather track.\n\n\"It was great to be back home even if it was cold. I enjoyed my time with the family there,\" said Lerner, who finished sixth on the Singapore log with 23 winners in 2022.\n\n\"I enjoyed riding there and I also had my wedding. It was a dream.\"\n\nLerner said he was a little bemused by Mykyta having few admirers, going on his encouraging debut.\n\n\"I was scratching my head. Last start, he drew 11, we had to come back but he finished the fastest and it was also a bit sharp,\" he said.\n\n\"Today, he had a good run. He was closer to the speed because of the better draw (barrier No. 1).\n\n\"He won on raw ability. He's looking for a longer trip.\"\n\nWinning trainer Michael Clements was delighted the son of Fortify was the first to emerge victorious from an Argentinian market he had been retesting for a short while.\n\n\"I've been buying yearlings in Argentina here and there for a couple of years. We didn't have much luck with the first lot,\" said the Zimbabwe-born conditioner, who trained Argentinian-breds like Ode To Joy and Pachelbel's Canon with moderate success in 2015.\n\n\"This one is the most promising to have come through. We all love a bit of value and it's great to have a first Argentinian-bred to win.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bcdc9463bae3b44ee26987cee935531142932801ed46acd29302c729b39a5814/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Marc Lerner-ridden $43 chance Mykyta (No. 7) producing a strong run to beat the even-money favourite Italian Revolution (obscured) in Saturday's $75,000 Restricted Maiden event over the Polytrack 1,100m.", "caption": "The Marc Lerner-ridden $43 chance Mykyta (No. 7) producing a strong run to beat the even-money favourite Italian Revolution (obscured) in Saturday's $75,000 Restricted Maiden event over the Polytrack 1,100m.

She did not really live up to expectations in her second start but she could still be the one to beat. (4) MINSTREL GALLERY was not disgraced on her local debut. She was outrun late by an improving filly. With blinkers added, she could go one better. Stable companion (1) LILY OF ORANGE is often slowly away but could earn some minor money. (5) RAY FLAMBE showed improvement last time. That form has not really worked out but the filly still deserves some respect.\n\nRace 2 (1,600m)\n\n(6) VUVUZELA UMLILO has been consistent and clearly likes the Polytrack. He could prove the right one over a suitable course and distance. (5) FEDERAL RESERVE was a bitter disappointment last time. Clearly, he is better than that run suggests. The blinkers go up. (4) FOOT SOLDIER is holding form and should contest the finish. (7) THE LAST BELLE is improving and could earn some more money.\n\nRace 3 (1,000m)\n\n(1) MODERN MAGICIAN was a bit unlucky in both his local starts. The drop in distance should suit and he is the one to beat. Stablemate (3) STAY THE COURSE is not an easy ride but is in good heart. The main danger. (4) COASTAL PATH did not run too badly in a better race than this. He deserves some respect. (6) DROP OF TIME, who is making his local debut on the Polytrack, could improve under his new trainer.\n\nRace 4 (1,000m)\n\nTrainer Alan Greeff has three strong runners among his quartet. (3) QUICK COUNT is in good form and is course-and-distance suited. But it could be worth noting stable jockey Richard Fourie is aboard (10) BOUQUET, who ran a much-improved race last time. (1) EMILY'S SPIRIT has proven costly to follow but broke the duck last time. It would not surprise were she to follow up. (2) BABYITSCOLDOUTSIDE returned to form with a solid victory over a subsequent winner. The Gavin Smith-trained filly is course-and-distance suited. (9) MISS ROSE is speedy and is another who could get involved at the finish.\n\nRace 5 (1,200m)\n\n(1) NAVAL SECRET, who has a win and a third in his last two starts, remains in good form. The one to beat. (3) LIFE ON MARS keeps improving and is course-and-distance suited. Stable companion (2) SAND BANK is unbeaten in two starts on the Polytrack and must be included in all bets. (7) PATH OF CHOICE has joined Greeff and that could spark a return to his best form.\n\nRace 6 (1,600m)\n\n(5) SAINT ANASTASIA is threatening to win. The last-start runner-up looks course-and-distance suited. (1) DEMIGOD ran on well to score last time and could follow up. (3) ALASKAN FATE has been unreliable but is also coming off a solid victory. (9) MRS HOTLINE is well drawn and has Fourie in the irons, so clearly deserves consideration.\n\nRace 7 (1,300m)\n\n(1) CHERE FOR ME has yet to show her good form this season. Her last run can be ignored. She is probably at her very best on turf and could still beat these rivals if showing her best side. (2) DOUBLE DESTINY did not show her best form last time. Perhaps she is better on turf and still deserves the utmost respect. (3) RAINBOW THIEF is yet another who has shown her best on turf but can still be considered a possible winner. There is nothing much among (5) PINNACLE, (6) CARBONADO and (4) EASY LIVING. Of the three, Carbonado is coming off an impressive win and could prove best of them.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nHardwareZone Singapore\n\nEnjoy fuss-free ordering, sign-up perks and some of the best freebies in town!\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9ca8551ed865e47a825b6334cf14ab48e71d62ca3266eedf8f83d44dd54c12a6/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The official opening hours are 6pm to 10pm, but most stalls open earlier.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 02:26am\n\n'Freeloader' women target elderly in Chinatown\n\nMore related stories\n\nWhen The Sunday Times visited at 3pm on Saturday, shoppers were seen along Pagoda, Temple and Smith streets, snapping up Chinese New Year decorations and snacks.\n\nDespite the goods and services tax hike, inflation and rising cost of goods, some stall owners kept the prices of previous years.\n\nA stall owner selling dried persimmons, who wanted to be known only as Ah Hui, said he did not increase the price of his goods despite rising costs.\n\n\"I have a lot of regular customers... Not increasing the price is my way of giving back to them,\" said Ah Hui, who sells 1kg of dried persimmons for about $12.\n\nOther stall owners ST spoke to said they did not pass rising shipping costs to their customers.\n\nBut not all stall owners kept their old prices.\n\nAt Chinatown Ah Keong Guangzhou Sausages in Smith Street, the price of Chinese sausages has risen by $3 to $5 per kg - they now cost about $40 per kg.\n\nStall owner Yip Wai Keong attributed the increase to rising manpower and ingredient costs.\n\nHe said he has seen his sales increase by about 20 per cent to 25 per cent compared with a year ago, when he rented a shop in Chinatown to sell the sausages since the bazaar was cancelled. The festive season is the only time of the year he sells lap cheong - Chinese sausages.\n\nAt Chinatown Ah Keong Guangzhou Sausages, the price of Chinese sausages has increased by $3 to $5 per kg. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\n\nBut the rise in prices has not deterred shoppers like retiree Tan Tak Hwee, who was excited to enjoy the festivities after the two-year hiatus.\n\n\"I've been here for about six hours and I still can't bear to go home,\" said the 76-year-old, who bought Chinese New Year snacks there.\n\nWhile he has noticed a slight increase in prices, Mr Tan, who visited the bazaar every year before Covid-19, said: \"Chinese New Year happens only once a year. Regardless of the economy, I will still do some Chinese New Year shopping to celebrate the festival.\"\n\nShoppers at the Festive Fair on Saturday.

She said she is grateful for the hongbao as it will help with her daily expenses and enable her to buy some Chinese New Year goodies.\n\nSBL will be giving out hongbao to 2,500 more beneficiaries from Sunday until mid-January. It will also give out $10 hongbao to more than 8,000 residents of local homes for the elderly before Chinese New Year.\n\nHealth Minister Ong Ye Kung, who was guest of honour at the SBL event, said he visited the lodge almost weekly with his grandmother when he was very young. His grandmother was healthy for most of her life, before falling ill and succumbing to lung cancer within a few months.\n\nHealth Minister Ong Ye Kung giving out hongbao at the Singapore Buddhist Lodge’s 75th Batch Hong Bao Distribution Ceremony on Saturday. PHOTO: SINGAPORE BUDDHIST LODGE\n\nHe said the experience highlighted the importance of having a long, healthy lifespan.\n\n\"What we want to make sure is that, like my grandmother, you will have a healthy life... When you live for 10 years in ill health, there is no quality of life. So when we wish people long life, we are talking about your healthy life, not just your biological life,\" he said.\n\nThe most important thing is \"how we eat, sleep, exercise and lead our lives\", said Mr Ong, and whether every senior feels loved, receives care and has relationships. \"That is the best medicine for all of us,\" he added.\n\nHe said events like the one on Saturday are a good reminder that there are organisations that care for all, no matter what the difficulties one faces.\n\nIn Queenstown, 250 underprivileged residents were taken on a grocery shopping trip on Saturday to mark the festive season. The elderly beneficiaries were paired up with volunteers from Alexandra Fire Station and the volunteering arm of ActiveSG Team Nila, as well as grassroots leaders, to help them choose healthier grocery items and manage their budget.\n\nA total of $12,500 in Sheng Siong vouchers was given to the beneficiaries to spend, with each receiving $50.\n\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth Eric Chua was guest of honour at the event.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the Queenstown Constituency Office said the project allows residents to buy what they need, instead of giving them items that they might not find useful. This reduces wastage and meets the needs of the beneficiaries at the same time, it said.\n\nSyarafana Shafeeq\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nhongbao\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 26, 2023, 10:29am\n\nCustomers frustrated after non-delivery of CNY gift hampers\n\nJan 25, 2023, 01:29pm\n\nNursing home residents whip up special home-cooked CNY dinner\n\nJan 25, 2023, 04:36am\n\nWet weather expected for remainder of CNY festive period\n\nJan 24, 2023, 12:07pm\n\nHow local celebrities celebrated Chinese New Year\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/21e09560d8231d1abbf66cc8e4ccf7e83f5a287f7ba993ff5dc0c05fd793735b/alfchern-2122_5.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Volunteers, including Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling, visited homes around the island to give out gift packs. \n", "caption": "Volunteers, including Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling, visited homes around the island to give out gift packs.

The winning time was 1min 4.12sec for the 1,100m on the Polytrack.\n\nEven trainer Michael Clements, who saddled the better-fancied Celavi ($46, sixth) in the event, was stumped by the boilover win, though the script was not all that outlandish to him.\n\n\"He's done it before under similar circumstances, but in a lower grade... and he's done it again today, in a Kranji Stakes A, which is very pleasing,\" said Clements.\n\n\"Today, the way the race went suited him. He's the sort who can come back from behind when there is more speed than usual.\n\n\"Often, he has two to three to beat, but today was his day.\"\n\nOcean Crossing may not have greeted the judge since May 2022, but his last-start closing second in a Class 2 mile race did suggest he had caught a good wave again.\n\n\"He had come to form at the end of last year and he appreciated the freshen-up,\" said Clements.\n\n\"The owner has been very patient. He was sidelined after he sprained a suspensory ligament to his front foot.\"\n\nClements has always spoken in glowing terms of Ocean Crossing as Group race material, but after five unsuccessful bids at Group 1 level, he has lowered his aim.\n\n\"He has always been a borderline Group horse. We always tend to put him in these feature races,\" he said.\n\n\"Like last year, we thought of running him in the Gold Cup, but ran him in a lesser race over 1,400m and he finished second.\n\n\"We'll just enjoy today's win and take one race at a time with him.\"\n\nWithout setting Kranji alight, Ocean Crossing has managed to haul in seven wins, six seconds and one third from 29 starts for prize money in excess of $330,000 for his Hong Kong connections.\n\nAmirul, who recorded only one win with Metal World in 2022, was delighted he had begun the new season on a more positive note.\n\n\"It's always pleasing to ride a winner especially as it's the first Singapore meeting. I couldn't be happier to start with a bang,\" said the Malaysian hoop.\n\n\"He's very nice when fresh. I had a look at the handicaps (51.5kg) and he's a backmarker. As there were some very fast runners, I knew he would finish strongly.\"\n\nThe day's unluckiest person had to be Kok. Other than Ocean Crossing, Red Dragon ($9), Darc Bounty ($82) and Faithful Leader ($14) also got up, with Wong, Zyryul Nor Azman and apprentice jockey Akmazani Mazuki the respective lucky recipients of those last-minute rides.\n\nSaturday's Singapore Results:\n\nres08_1.pd\n\nf\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\n0\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\n0\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\n0\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/43eb3d625a32700b33c48665446c606d3b867739b2d2864feced154271983202/unnamed.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Long shot Ocean Crossing (No. 10, Amirul Ismadi) springing a $106 upset in the Kranji Stakes A race over 1,100m on Saturday.

All that was left to do was maintain the same tempo for another four months.\n\nUnfortunately, her season hit a snag there and then. She rode only three more winners, sliding to third place on the final log, seven winners behind the eventual champion, Yusoff.\n\nThe second half of the season saw fewer visits to the winner's circle, but a lot more in the stewards' room.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nSeow knows she could have made the premiership more interesting, even win it, had she been guilty of fewer indiscretions.\n\n\"I was out for three months all-up, but won one on appeal (Zestful) and got two weeks off,\" she said.\n\n\"I was fighting for the champion title, but all those careless riding suspensions didn't help. Still, even without them, I'm not really satisfied with my season, I was expecting much better results.\n\n\"But I have already accepted what has already happened and it's time to focus on the new season.\"\n\nDuring the break, Seow took stock of the ups and downs at her sophomore year, and pressed the reboot button.\n\nShe also felt she had grown in experience and confidence as she has another crack at the premiership.\n\n\"I just got my mind off racing during the break. I came back in December and rode a lot in trials,\" she said.\n\n\"My fitness is good and I should be able to hit my riding weight of 50kg with more race-riding.\n\n\"After two years of riding, I feel more confident and there is much more improvement, for example, in my use of the whip and my pushing. I'm fit and ready to go, and I'm aiming for the apprentice title again.\n\n\"Even if Yusoff, Iskandar and Krisna (Thangamani) are not apprentices any more, it's still very competitive. There are a lot of new apprentices coming through.\n\n\"But I think Ibrahim (Mamat) will be a big danger. He's a good rider and he's got good support from Michael Clements.\"\n\nFrom the eight other apprentices who will muscle it out, the Kelantan-born rider boasted the highest strike rate in his rookie season in 2022 - 15 per cent for nine winners in 60 rides.\n\nSeow's may be inferior - improved marginally from 6 to 7 per cent in her second season - but without finding excuses, she could not have picked a worse year to launch her career.\n\n\"During Covid-19, it's been a bit tough to not have classes from a riding master,\" said Seow.\n\n\"(Rider-turned-steward) Noh (Senari) does his best. But, because he oversees other stuff, he doesn't really have the time for apprentices. He's given us four lessons altogether.\n\n\"Luckily, I had Saimee Jumaat and Danny Beasley to give me guidance and advice. I saw Danny win at his first day back in Australia yesterday, well done, Dan, and I wish him all the best and plenty of winners.\"\n\nAfter calling time on a successful 15-year-long Singapore stint, the Australian rode a winner (Participator) at his first day back at the races in Wagga on Thursday.\n\nSeow has a near-full book of 11 rides from the 12 races at Saturday's curtain raiser, including one standby starter. None of them hail from her master Donna Logan, though, but eight other trainers.\n\nSeow will always be grateful to two of them, David Kok and Stephen Crutchley, for taking a leap of faith on her.\n\n\"I'm so thankful to Stephen Crutchley (Fame Star) and Michael Clements (Tangible) for giving me opportunities in my first few Group races, and David Kok for giving me that Japan Racing Association Trophy-winning ride on Lord Justice,\" she said.\n\n\"But it may get a bit tougher this year when my claim drops to 2kg with another 10 winners (to hit 40 winners).\"\n\nOne horse who may take her closer to the mark is Surpass Natural in Saturday's $100,000 Kranji Stakes A race (1,100m).\n\nSeow was aboard when the Mahadi Taib-trained Elvstroem seven-year-old ran on for second to Lucky Jinsha in a similar Polytrack speed dash, but in Class 2 company, on Nov 5. She is, however, wary of the sticky barrier this time.\n\n\"I rode Surpass Natural in a trial. He's still in good form after the spell, I'm happy with him,\" she said.\n\n\"The only query is barrier No. 12.

She gets blinkers for the first time and this could make all the difference. (10) APPROACHABLE LASS was ignored in the market on debut but finished strongly for second. That experience should hold her in good stead. She can go one better. (8) VIVIR MI VIDA also started at long odds when third in that race. She has been making steady improvement. (1) DAPPERFONTEIN can be a handful but she is back on her favourite course.\n\nRace 2 (1,200m)\n\n(3) CAPTAIN ROCKET has put in two smart efforts around the turn. The switch to the straight course could see him home. (7) SUPER FAST improved second-up. He has had a bit of a break and the wet weather over the past couple of months did not help in his preparation. (12) LAZY GUY has come good but always seems to find one or two better. Rachel Venniker's 1.5kg claim could come in handy. (10) MASERATI ROAR has been in the market in all three starts. The blinkers go on and he must rate a winning chance.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\n(8) ASARULUDU has run two smart races on the Poly. The switch to turf in a modest field should not hold any fears. (11) HARLEY STREET has also put in two smart efforts and the pair could well have the race to themselves. (4) OSHAKATI has improved on the Poly but his turf form is suspect. (9) CAPTAIN CORRUPT comes with modest Cape form but could improve in this field.\n\nRace 4 (1,600m)\n\n(4) CHELSEA BLUE has had three starts for a third and two seconds. She was unlucky last time. Improved, she looks set to score. (9) KITTYBOYS GIRL has run well on this course but her best form has been on the Poly. She has also improved with blinkers and should feature prominently. (1) VENETIAN LINK raced greenly in her sprint debut. This trip should suit and she is one to watch in the market. (2) SAYULITA was much improved last run and can finish in the money again.\n\nRace 5 (1,600m)\n\n(7) NEWS STREAM was second behind (8) JUAN CARLOS last time but is now 4kg better off with Venniker's 1.5kg allowance taken into consideration. Mark Dixon's runner goes well over this course and distance and the blinkers are back on. (3) BOTZ has threatened and but will get it right some day. He did not appear to see out the trip last run. He could score again back in a handicap with a light weight. (2) IRON WILL has been holding form and has dropped two points in the ratings despite finishing runner-up last time. Keagan de Melo stays aboard which is a good indication of his chances. (4) MANHATTEN CAFE has been consistent and his last two wins have been over the distance. He should be a big runner.\n\nRace 6 (1,000m)\n\n(5) FAUSTINO is a course-and-distance specialist who goes well for this apprentice. Rates the one to beat. (3) PRAY FOR RAIN is overdue and goes well over this course and distance. He can build on his last effort. (4) SABATINI is a smart filly but has not been out since last June. The stable reports that she is a \"top filly and working well\". Thus, she cannot be ruled out of any calculations. (2) FRANZ LEHAR is lightly raced and also looks to have a touch of class. Watch the market.\n\nRace 7 (1,000m)\n\n(3) CATCH THAT MELODY probably needed her last run after a lengthy break. She has shown some ability in good company and should go well. (10) MAQUETTE has consistent form against slightly stronger rivals. This is her best trip and she gets a slight drop in the handicap. (1) CALULO goes well over this course and distance and should be a big runner. (4) LADY HEIST has some useful form on the Poly in strong company. She is back on turf.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9ca8551ed865e47a825b6334cf14ab48e71d62ca3266eedf8f83d44dd54c12a6/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He has drawn well to be the horse to beat in Sunday's Race 9 at Sha Tin.\n\nPHOTO: HKJC\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 6, 2023, 04:00pm\n\nAnother Success in plain sight\n\nShare this article\n\nRace 1 (1,650M)\n\n7 Steel Win looks ready to score again. He is racing well and should improve stepping up to this distance. 9 Daily Beauty did well two runs back on dirt. Expect him to return to this level under the in-form Vincent Ho. 14 Speed Force has drawn wide but is favoured under 115lb (52.2kg) with the in-form Karis Teetan astride. 2 Run Des Run is a massive threat. He is a strapping horse who weighed over 1,503lb (681kg) at his last start.\n\nRace 2 (1,800M)\n\n5 President's Choice is a winner over the course and distance. He has remained in sound form. 11 Over The Moon is tracking towards a first win. With even luck, he gets every chance to nail it. 12 Reach Goal is also closing in on his first hurrah. He is taking a step forward with each outing. 6 Happy Angel is doing similar. The strong booking of Zac Purton catches the eye.\n\nRace 3 (1,650M)\n\n9 Handsome Twelve is in unstoppable form. Rising to Class 2 makes things tricky, but he gets another chance to score again with Gate 2 and a light weight. 5 Apache Pass will be hard to catch with a return to his previous best on the surface. He is also favoured with no weight 1 Kings Shield knows what it is all about. Expect him to roll forward. 7 Chancheng Prince has class on dirt. Keep safe.\n\nRace 4 (1,200M)\n\n5 United We Stand has been racing well. He should bounce to the lead from the inner-most barrier and prove hard to get past. 6 A Americ Te Specso turned his form around last start. With Purton hopping up, he looks ready to test this group. 8 Smart Leader is in sound form. He can still be a factor in Class 4. 9 Mighty Valor is racing well and can take another step forward. He will likely try to make all the running.\n\nRace 5 (1,400M)\n\n1 Tamra Blitz steps down in grade. He has a slick personal best over this course and distance. His latest effort in Class 3 was impressive. A top chance. 4 Ching is so close to a first win. If he is at a price, he is worth backing. It would not surprise to see him receive a stack of support. 10 Perfetto caught the eye last start with a luckless run from the rear. 3 Golden Bull is consistent and has ability.\n\nRace 6 (1,650m)\n\n14 Green Laser is tracking nicely towards a first success. He is showing steady improvement with each outing. He pairs favourably with Vincent Ho off 118lb from Gate 1. 8 Nice Birdie looks well suited to the rise in distance. Take an each-way ticket on him, as he is likely to be over the odds. 1 Amazing Teens gets back to Class 4. He is racing well and could take some beating. 3 Skyey Supreme will lead and take catching. He will look the winner at some stage.\n\nRace 7 (1,800M)\n\n13 Samarkand looks to have his fair share of ability. He should find the front or get an economical run close to the speed to ensure his opportunity. 9 Tourbillon Prince will improve getting up to this trip. This is much more suitable and chances are he will find a prominent position. 12 Running Ahead is better than his form suggests. He should have improved after two solid runs. 11 Hit The Shot is in superb form. He is a contender.\n\nRace 8 (1,600M)\n\n2 Viva Chaleur impressed last start. He looks well-placed to get on the board for the first time in Hong Kong. The distance is untried, but he has the class. 1 Sweet Encounter is a winning machine with four triumphs from five starts. Drawn well, he is going to fight for the top honours once more. 7 Majestic Colour did well on debut. He can advance further. 9 Gallant Waking is capable and is worth including in the multiples.\n\nRace 9 (1,000M)\n\n3 Sight Success is in his career-best form. He has drawn well, looks open to further improvement and is doing everything right this campaign. The one to beat. 4 Courier Wonder is returning to his best. He can take another step forward, after his slashing fourth in the Longines Hong Kong Sprint. 6 Cordyceps Six owns a slick personal best over this course and distance. He will put himself into contention. 5 Stronger has claims over this course and distance. Keep safe.\n\nRace 10 (1,400M)\n\n5 Nordic Dragon looks well-placed to remain unbeaten with a third success. The rise in distance should not be a concern, though Gate 12 of 14 is not ideal. 2 Amazing Victory is a three-time winner from his last four starts. He is in his career-best form and he pairs favourably with Purton. 8 Sinba can improve from Gate 1. Expect good odds. 9 Stunning Impact has class and a sharp turn of foot. Keep safe.\n\nRace 11 (1,200M)\n\n6 Mighty Stride can remain unbeaten. A few of these should roll forward and set the race up nicely for him. He has an ideal draw. 4 Sakewin is better than his record this term suggests. He has had excuses but looks suited with rookie Angus Chung's 10lb claim. 8 Superb Capitalist might find the speed unsuitable but he has the class to deliver. 5 Dragon's Luck falls into a similar category. This will be difficult, but he cannot be ignored.\n\n*Comments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/621ca75611f97cfd2570d968cae6dbfb264ce3e6ad0b48e2cf6ebd6c51765d00/unnamed_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Seven-time winner Sight Success is in his career-best form.

He is obviously full of joy, enjoying each second at the moment.\n\n\"He's a good footballer, good in small spaces, likes to shoot from distance, good finisher and dribbler. He looks really promising and fit. The sessions are intense for him because they're different.\n\n\"But I'm very positive about him. Coming from a new league is always difficult, but we expect a positive impact.\"\n\nKlopp also said that he is not looking to rotate his squad and will field a strong line-up.\n\n\"If you play Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday then you have to think about it. But we played Monday, then Saturday and Saturday. It's clear we will line up as good and strong and experienced as we can,\" he explained.\n\n\"There will not be rotation because of the competition, no.\"\n\nLiverpool are seeking to win two FA Cups in a row, having beaten Chelsea in the 2022 final after getting as far as only the fifth round since 2015.\n\nThe eight-time winners, however, are without a clean sheet in five matches, and have been eliminated in four of their last seven third-round encounters while they were the defending champions.\n\nCoincidentally, the last time the Reds lost in the third round was against Wolves in the 2018-19 campaign.\n\nWhen it was suggested to Klopp that teams are cutting through his side's midfield too easily this season - critics have said Liverpool lack control in the middle of the park and are leaving their defence exposed - the German brushed it off, saying that it is a team game.\n\n\"If things like this happen, it is a general problem - not a midfield problem,\" he insisted.\n\n\"Defending starts up front. The pitch is too big and the other teams too good. But we've known that a long time. The way we want to defend is clear. Am I completely happy with the way we play? No. But it's not a midfield problem.\"\n\nKlopp will be without the injured Virgil van Dijk, Arthur Melo, Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota, while James Milner, Roberto Firmino and Jordan Henderson are doubts.\n\nWolves, meanwhile, have defeated the holders of the FA Cup only once, beating Manchester United way back in the 1949 semi-finals en route to clinching the trophy.\n\nAnfield is an intimidating place for opponents, but Saturday's visitors are unbeaten in three consecutive away games and manager Julen Lopetegui should be encouraged by that run.\n\nWolves, however, have a poor record against Liverpool. Since beating Klopp's men in the 2018-19 third round, they have lost seven successive Premier League fixtures to the Reds.\n\nLopetegui, appointed in November and has since had two wins, a draw and a defeat, has complained that his side are at a disadvantage with Liverpool having two extra days' of rest.\n\n\"I don't understand how we play in one competition with two days' less (preparation) than the opponent,\" the Spaniard said.\n\n\"Maybe one day (less preparation), it can happen.

Warning letters were issued by CAAS to offenders identified by MPA, they said.\n\nThe practice of mariners setting off flares to mark the new year in Singapore's waters had been reported in newspapers as early as 1960.\n\nIt was also acknowledged by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a Facebook post on Dec 30, 2015, where he posted a photograph of breakwaters in East Coast and wrote that they \"will be a good place to catch ships firing off their flares at midnight tomorrow to mark the new year\".\n\nBy\n\nNg Keng Gene\n\nRead articles by Ng Keng Gene\n\nNew Year's Eve\n\nheritage\n\nMARITIME AND SHIPPING\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nTransform your home affordably with IKEA Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bfb3516ae958ea90e0b80638ee5c2d31812902e5abd3777a6f26d5ba18d7efff/limyaohuiflare_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Flares fired from ships off East Coast Park at the stroke of midnight on Jan 1. \n", "caption": "Flares fired from ships off East Coast Park at the stroke of midnight on Jan 1.

The customary foot procession was scrapped, and the use of kavadis - wooden or metal structures carrying milk offerings - and ceremonial piercings was disallowed.\n\nAbout 30,000 people are expected to be part of this year's procession, with a third carrying milk pot offerings called paal kudam. Meanwhile, some 200 devotees will be carrying kavadis.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday, Mr T Raja Segar from the Hindu Endowments Board said the lifting of restrictions on Thaipusam was a welcome move, citing how devotees had been waiting to celebrate the festival as they had always done.\n\n\"You can say that we're starting with a big bang after Covid-19, and that's great,\" he said, noting, however, that the festival organisers had also drawn lessons from the pandemic in planning for this year.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 13, 2025, 01:03am\n\nHe's not heavy, he's my brother\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe cited the offering of paal kudam, which devotees can now choose to prepare themselves or else pick up from the Tank Road temple, instead of being required to use those prepared by the temple.\n\nMr Raja said that during the pandemic, the festival centred around Sri Thendayuthapani Temple, with devotees needing to book slots for the time they could enter the temple, thus preventing overcrowding.\n\n\"Looking at the benefits of the system, we are continuing with it. Whatever we learn from this year, we will then make use of it to make next year's Thaipusam even better.\"\n\nBesides the number of devotees at the temple being regulated during the past two years, the Covid-19 pandemic also curtailed other Thaipusam practice.\n\nAside from the foot procession from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple to Tank Road being scrapped, groups carrying musical instruments or any form of amplification device were not allowed to enter the temple.\n\nThe elderly, the young and those who were physically challenged were also encouraged to pray at home and join the live stream of the Thaipusam prayer session.\n\nThe live stream will continue this year, but centred around key moments, said Mr Ramasamy Meiyappan, the deputy president of Sri Thendayuthapani Temple.\n\nMr Edwin Tong, who is Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, will be joining in the festivities on Feb 5.

That is how Yee Teck Peng, St Andrew's Secondary School's rugby master for close to three decades, is being remembered by those who played under him.\n\nYee died on Thursday at the age of 90. He was the school's rugby master from 1955 to 1990, apart from a period when he became the secretary and manager of Sentosa Golf Club from 1973 to 1979.\n\nFormer Singapore international Leow Kim Swun, who played under Yee at St Andrew's, recalled how he introduced a strength and conditioning regimen to help the players beef up their physique at a time when few schools were doing so. It is now part of elite sports teams' training programmes.\n\nThe 69-year-old added: \"He gave us a lot of self-confidence. He was someone who would encourage you to play your game as long as it was within the game plan. He wouldn't try to stop you from trying to do something.\"\n\nKim Swun's older brother Kim Liat, who captained Singapore in the 1970s, also recalled how Yee was a meticulous coach who would review video footage with the team to highlight their good and bad points.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 17, 2024, 02:32am\n\nSpore Rugby Union parts ways with head coach Suhaimi Amran\n\nMore related stories\n\nYee is also remembered by players for his gentlemanliness. Kim Liat, 72, said: \"One of the key things I learnt from him was in the game that if the opposition is a dirty player, so be it. You just carry on and play your best and to be able to control our temper was one of the key things I learnt from him as well.\"\n\nThis was a sentiment that was echoed by former Singapore Rugby Union (SRU) president Low Teo Ping, who had come up against Yee's teams in the 1960s when he was a rugby player with Raffles Institution.\n\nEven though both schools were rivals, Low noted how Yee would still be gracious in defeat.\n\nThe veteran sports administrator, who was SRU chief from 2006 to 2017, said: \"When we won, he would congratulate us. You're talking about the highest of rivalries but there was never an unkind word so I thought this was really a man that one should respect.\"\n\nEven after he left his coaching job, Yee, who was also a teacher with St Andrew's, remained a familiar presence at matches, often attending, inter-school, club and national team games.\n\nYee would also continue to attend training sessions and his words left a lasting impression on many St Andrew's players over the years. He was one of the reasons why SRU's head of commercial, public relations and communications Douglas Danapal decided to pursue a career in rugby.\n\nDanapal, who studied at St Andrew's from 1996 to 1999, said: \"One thing (he said) that stuck with me was it doesn't matter what size you are, rugby is for everyone and you shouldn't be afraid to tackle the largest guy.\n\n\"He also mentioned one more thing, which is why I stayed in rugby and that was, 'Contribute what you can, even if you're not the best player, you can do other things in the future and give back'.\"\n\nBy\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nRead articles by Kimberly Kwek\n\nRugby\n\nobituary\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 14, 2023, 06:24am\n\nAll Blacks great Sonny Bill Williams calls Eddie Jones a 'disgrace'\n\nNov 28, 2023, 08:50am\n\nSingapore rugby player Liyana Ong set for Irish adventure\n\nSep 8, 2023, 01:54pm\n\nWorld Cup awaits New Zealand haka and French response\n\nAug 22, 2023, 02:55pm\n\n'Heart-stopping' win as ACS (I) beat St Andrew's 36-34 in C Division rugby final\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nYour dream home, now more affordable with IKEA home design ​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/246e0f429a48d6a446f7aebb5ca0ee0f3865c1071420464a901f0cfed6e55902/svyeeteckpeng060123_2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Yee Teck Peng was St Andrew’s Secondary School’s rugby master from 1955 to 1990. \n", "caption": "Yee Teck Peng was St Andrew’s Secondary School’s rugby master from 1955 to 1990.

Stuart Wilkin, who bagged a brace and Darren Lok, were both born in England and qualified for Malaysian citizenship through their parents.\n\nFellow goal-scorer Argentina-born Sergio Aguero became a citizen in 2022 after fulfilling Fifa's five-year residency rule to play for an adopted country at senior level.\n\nMalaysia, who face Thailand in the semi-final, first leg on Saturday, have eight foreign-born players in their 23-man squad, with 11 more who withdrew or were not called up.\n\nIn a trend that has gained popularity in recent years, other teams such as fellow semi-finalists Indonesia (three foreign-born players in this tournament) and the eliminated Philippines (13) have also boosted their ranks with overseas-born talent.\n\nSingapore has just one - South Korea-born midfielder Song Ui-young, who was granted citizenship in 2021 after meeting Fifa's five-year residency requirement.\n\nPrevious success with foreign talent\n\nThe inclusion of naturalised players had helped the Lions previously. Itimi Dickson, Precious Emuejeraye, Agu Casmir, Shi Jiayi and Mustafic Fahrudin became citizens through the FTS and played key roles alongside local players in Singapore's AFF Championship triumphs in 2004, 2007, and 2012.\n\nThe last player who was granted Singapore citizenship through this scheme was Qiu Li in 2010.\n\nIn response to ST's queries, Sport Singapore also said that while developing local players remains the key under the Unleash the Roar! project, national sports agencies (NSAs) can also nominate talented non-citizens who wish to represent Singapore under the FTS.\n\n\"However, the criteria go beyond assessing the athletes' sporting abilities, but also considers the athletes' long-term commitment to Singapore and not only to the sport,\" it added.\n\nEx-national defender R. Sasikumar and former Hougang United coach Clement Teo believe that having foreign-born players is something that needs to be considered.\n\nSasikumar said: \"With the way the football world is going, we would be very naive and close minded to say it should be all Singaporean-born boys who should play for the national team.\n\n\"We need quality players in the national squad and if there is a way to make that happen, we should pursue it.\n\n\"The reality is that we need foreign-born players. The teams in the semi-finals like Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have done it, so what is stopping us?\"\n\nBut Sasikumar warned that there must still be a robust youth development system to ensure local players are the core of the national team.\n\nTeo agreed, saying: \"We need to be open to any reasonable options. We were the pioneers of foreign-born talent in this region, so why not?\n\n\"The good thing is there is a national project going on now, and Unleash the Roar is at an early stage and it is working on youth development now with more younger players coming through. As with most things, once a good foundation is built, the future will be more secure.\"\n\nThe next foreign-born player could be Tampines Rovers' 26-year-old Japanese midfielder Kyoga Nakamura, who had expressed his desire to play for the Lions, but will fulfil Fifa's five-year residency rule only in 2024.\n\nTampines Rovers’ 26-year-old Japanese midfielder Kyoga Nakamura had expressed his desire to play for the Lions. PHOTO: TAMPINES ROVERS FOOTBALL CLUB\n\nA route for players with Singaporean heritage?\n\nThere are also a host of players who qualify to play for the Lions via their Singaporean heritage. Sunderland right-back Luke O'Nien, 28, and Cardiff City centre-back Perry Ng, 26, had both expressed interest in turning out for the Lions in previous interviews.\n\nAccording to global football governing body Fifa, players must have \"a genuine link\" with national teams they intend to play for. The basic criteria are: Place of birth, naturalisation by residence or place of one grandparent's birth.\n\nO'Nien and Ng, both England-born, have a grandparent who was born in Singapore.\n\nWhile Fifa rules deem these players as eligible to play for the Lions, qualifying for a Singaporean passport by descent is applicable to only individuals with at least one parent who is born in Singapore or is a citizen by registration, according to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).\n\nThis means that in order for O'Nien or Ng to represent the Lions, they will need to give up their current passport, follow the FTS path and gain Singapore citizenship by meeting the ICA's residency requirements.\n\nIn a previous interview with The New Paper, O'Nien had said that while he is willing to take up Singapore citizenship, doing so would mean that he would need a work permit to play in England, which would make things complicated.\n\nHowever, there is a workaround with the UK ancestry visa which is open to all Commonwealth nationals who can demonstrate lineage from a British-born grandparent.\n\nFormer Thailand and Laos coach Steve Darby, who led Home United to the S-League and Singapore Cup double in 2003, said he favours heritage players over naturalising foreigners.\n\nThe 67-year-old Englishman said: \"I am totally in favour of players with a heritage playing for a country. They can be just as patriotic, such as Brendan Gan for Malaysia...\n\n\"But I am against the short-term fix of naturalised foreign players playing for the country because it can attract or breed mercenaries who don't care about the country. I know of agents who are encouraging this just to boost the CVs of their players.\n\n\"There are always exceptions such as Daniel Bennett and Aleksandar Duric, who both were genuinely committed to the country.\"\n\nBy\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nRead articles by Deepanraj Ganesan\n\nlions\n\nFAS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 29, 2024, 11:25pm\n\nLions exit Asean Championship amid more VAR drama\n\nDec 26, 2024, 10:37pm\n\nSingapore lose 2-0 to Vietnam after VAR mayhem\n\nDec 22, 2024, 11:10pm\n\nAsean Cup semi-final tickets for Singapore-Vietnam game sell out\n\nDec 18, 2024, 10:38pm\n\nHigh chance of beating Singapore: Malaysia's Sergio Aguero\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0355f988085e70b78d342f735eaaaec9c9e6a689c8fc6c2a8aa814dc051d3af2/2022123170840137bum9326-01_7.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Song Ui-young (left) is the only foreign-born player in the Lions' squad at the 2022 AFF Championship. \n", "caption": "Song Ui-young (left) is the only foreign-born player in the Lions' squad at the 2022 AFF Championship.

But considering the generation gap, I don't think it came as a surprise.\"\n\nTo avoid souring his relationship with Chia, 47, and Lee, 51, he said he decided to leave as they had differences, \"especially when it came to corporate governance\".\n\nOn Thursday, Mdada issued a statement, which was carried on its social media accounts as well as Lee's, addressing Pornsak's comments.\n\nThe company said it was \"deeply disappointed\" about Pornsak speaking to the media about his decision to leave \"without first giving them a proper chance to address his alleged concerns\".\n\nIt claimed that Pornsak did not mention his concerns when he resigned as director and chief executive of Mdada in October.\n\nIn the statement, the company also pointed out that the age gap between the three founders, which it said was \"minor\", was known to Pornsak from the start of their collaboration.\n\nIt was also \"deeply concerned by any suggestion or innuendo that Mdada or its key shareholders are in any way untrustworthy with customers' purchases or orders, or that Mdada is lacking in corporate governance\".\n\nThe statement refuted such suggestions as wholly untrue and baseless. It also touched on issues the company had faced in the delivery of goods sold on its platform, saying that delays and cancellations happened from time to time due to \"extrinsic factors outside of Mdada's control\".\n\nThese included logistic problems due to weather and Covid-19 restrictions imposed by other countries.\n\nThe statement added: \"This episode has not only affected Mdada's reputation and value, but has also hurt Michelle, Addy and all employees of Mdada who work tirelessly to serve our loyal customers and fans.

It's not going to affect me as a player or as a person. I'll keep working hard to improve,\" he told the Evening Standard.\n\n\"After it happened, I just wanted to play again as quick as possible and get it out of my head. It's something you have to deal with. It was a tough moment for me. It's never an easy thing to go through, but it's part of the highs and lows of our sport.\"\n\nSince returning to Tottenham Hotspur, Kane has found the net three times in as many games and scored a brace in Wednesday's 4-0 Premier League win at Crystal Palace.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 27, 2024, 01:17pm\n\nStarHub adds FA Cup to its football offerings for the new season\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I had a bit of time away after, just to reflect, and it's made me even more hungry to come back and be successful.

We exploited the period of the World Cup to work with these young players to improve themselves,\" Conte said.\n\n\"Now they stay with us in the squad.

The accused was unable to do so.\"\n\nThe older woman then alerted the police, and Siti has since given her $1,900 as restitution.\n\nCourt documents did not state what happened next, but Siti struck again around November 2021 when she lied to the second victim - her husband's 28-year-old friend - that she was a lawyer at Dentons Rodyk law firm.\n\nShe also told the man that she could help him get a job there.\n\nThe DPP told the court: \"At all material times, the accused was not an employee of the law firm. The accused was also not a qualified lawyer.\n\n\"The accused told (the second victim) that to be considered for the job at the law firm, he would first have to complete certain legal and management courses with (private education institutions) Kaplan Singapore and Exena Learning Hub.\"\n\nSiti claimed that she could help the second victim to enrol in such courses.\n\nShe also said that he would have to transfer cash to her for purported course enrolment fees.\n\nBelieving the scammer, he transferred a total of $32,460 to her bank account over at least 36 occasions between December 2021 and March 2022.\n\nThe man later sensed that something was amiss when he did not receive any invoices or receipts for the payments.\n\nHe contacted the law firm around April 2022 and found out that Siti was not working there.\n\nHe made a police report after he contacted Kaplan and was told that they had no record of his enrolment.\n\nSiti gave him $1,600 as restitution in June 2022.\n\nThe prosecutor said that she duped her third victim - a 28-year-old acquaintance - by using the same method she used to cheat her husband's friend.\n\nThe third victim then transferred $1,680 to her bank account on at least two occasions in April 2022.\n\nHe later made a police report, and she has not made any restitution to him.\n\nFor each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nFraud\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/15ceabeec8483a1f69aabfa9c3a6386ddfa4f763825a4b5a162416573b6f2149/jail.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) on Tuesday.\n\nBut the report also noted that the authorities should stay vigilant, as the easing of Covid-19-related movement restrictions could lead to a resurgence of terrorist activity in the region.\n\nAlthough just one person was detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in 2022, the Singapore authorities continued to uncover cases of self-radicalisation that year, according to Counter Terrorist Trends and Analyses (CTTA), an annual report assessing the global terror threat.\n\nThe Republic also continues to feature as a high-value target in the propaganda of Islamist terror groups - such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) - even if there are currently no specific or credible terrorist threats to Singapore.\n\n\"The Internet continues to play a pivotal role in sustaining the momentum of the global jihadist movement. This 'cyber jihad', waged on a borderless virtual battlefield, is a potential security minefield in a highly digitally connected society like Singapore,\" said CTTA.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 2, 2025, 09:39am\n\nTeen ISIS bride wannabe issued restriction order; first female teen dealt with under ISA\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"In Singapore, the primary threat still emanates from individuals self-radicalised through online means. While figures (for those dealt with under the Internal Security Act) have declined slightly in recent years - from a high of 17 cases in 2016 to a single case each in 2021 and 2022 - cases of self-radicalisation persist.\"\n\nSince 2015, 45 self-radicalised individuals have been dealt with under the ISA, comprising 33 locals and 12 foreigners.\n\nLast year, the sole person detained under the ISA was\n\n29-year-old Singaporean Radjev Lal Madan Lal in April,\n\nwho had made preparations to travel to overseas conflict zones to take up arms.\n\nHe had been convinced by the online sermons of foreign preachers such as Imran Hosein, Anwar Al-Awlaki and Musa Cerantonio that it was his religious obligation to fight against the enemies of Islam.\n\nHe had expressed that, if instructed, he was willing to conduct an attack in Singapore, or against Singaporean interests overseas, although he did not have specific plans to do so at the time of his arrest.\n\nThe 120-page report is compiled by RSIS, with sections written by various country and regional experts.\n\nThe section on Singapore is put together by senior analyst Kalicharan Veera Singam and research analyst Abigail Leong at the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research, a constituent unit of RSIS.\n\nNoting that Singapore's Internal Security Department had\n\nassessed the terror threat to be \"high\" in 2022,\n\nas it did in the past few years, the two said that the ability of terrorist groups to operate and recruit in Singapore or plot attacks in the country has nevertheless been limited.\n\nThe return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan has not resulted in more collaborations with regional networks such as the Jemaah Islamiyah, the two analysts said.\n\nThe report also said that Covid-19 movement restrictions have dampened the recruitment and activities of regional terrorist groups and their funding, leading to a significant number of terrorists surrendering in the Philippines' Mindanao region in the past three years due to fatigue, hunger and declining financial support.\n\nThe two analysts added that in 2022, there were no new cases of terrorism financing reported.\n\nIn May, the Government\n\nbarred Indonesian preacher Abdul Somad Batubara from entering the country,\n\nprompting a backlash from his followers, including those who protested outside Singapore's embassy in Jakarta and consulate-general in Medan as well as online.\n\nBoth authors said the easing of pandemic-related restrictions means the authorities will have to keep being proactive against terrorist recruiters.\n\nThey cited audio files released online in September by the ISIS' Al-Furqan media, in which group spokesman Abu Umar al-Muhajir called on Muslims in Singapore and other Asian states to join the organisation.\n\nRSIS dean Kumar Ramakrishna said in the report that such calls must be taken seriously, especially as cross-border movements increase in frequency and considering recent regional developments.\n\nIn December, a suicide bomber reportedly linked to the pro-ISIS militant group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah\n\nattacked a police station in the Indonesian city of Bandung,\n\nkilling a police officer.\n\nThe authors added that a close eye must be kept on fault lines surrounding race and religion, referencing Australian national\n\nAndrew Gosling who flung a bottle from his condominium in\n\nSpottiswoode Park Road\n\ntowards a group of Malay Muslims\n\nand a\n\nsenior polytechnic lecturer who made racist remarks in Orchard Road to a mixed-race couple.\n\n\"While these are isolated and one-off incidents that are not part of a wider domestic trend, they highlight the importance of maintaining tolerance and harmony in Singapore's society, given a global climate currently challenged by religious extremism and violence,\" they said.\n\nClement Yong\n\nterrorism\n\nntu\n\nSingapore\n\nTALIBAN\n\nShare this

Mainland visitors will also be tested on arrival.\n\nJapan has announced similar rules for China, although Hong Kong and Macau travellers are exempt.\n\n'Full house'\n\nOther Asian tourist hubs such as Indonesia have decided not to impose any restrictions.\n\nTwo million Chinese tourists visited annually before the pandemic, and restaurant owners on the resort island of Bali are hoping for a rebound.\n\n\"Before the pandemic, we had a lot of Chinese customers... At least 100 to 200 customers came daily,\" Mr Kadek Sucana, who runs a seafood restaurant in the Jimbaran area, told AFP.\n\nHe is hoping for a \"full house again... because Chinese tourists come in large groups\".\n\nWhile Beijing has loosened many of its Covid-19 restrictions, overseas travel by tour groups remains banned.\n\nAnd there is little sign that the availability of flights will quickly catch up to renewed demand.\n\nAs a result, travel destinations throughout Asia are expecting any rebound in Chinese tourists to be slow.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nSouth Korea to require Covid-19 tests for HK, Macau travellers; new Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 detected\n\nWill a China Covid-19 wave set back endemic living in Singapore?\n\nIndonesia is aiming for just over 250,000 Chinese tourists in 2023, a fraction of pre-pandemic figures.\n\nThailand, which is also not imposing new rules, is hoping for around five million Chinese tourists this year, less than half the number who came in 2019.\n\nTourism accounted for nearly 20 per cent of Thailand's national income before the pandemic, with China its largest source of foreign tourists.\n\n\"This is an opportunity to restore our economic situation and recover from losses we suffered for nearly three years,\" Thai Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul Anutin said on Thursday. - AFP\n\nChina\n\nJapan\n\nSouth Korea\n\ncovid-19\n\nTourism\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 30, 2025, 03:04am\n\nSelf-driving public shuttles in Punggol by fourth quarter\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:52pm\n\nSingapore's first private assisted-living pilot ready by 2026\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nMay 16, 2025, 01:14am\n\nSingapore actress Eleanor Lee accused online of insulting China, allegedly dropped from Chinese show\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d4e4392b19933cebac0962edc4b21ead1da8cdb6701f3e50e3d5788eccec9a5a/FILES-JAPAN-CHINA-HEALTH-VIRUS-TOURISM-TRAVEL-020357.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Nearly 9.6 million Chinese visited Japan in 2019, the biggest group of foreign tourists by far.", "caption": "Nearly 9.6 million Chinese visited Japan in 2019, the biggest group of foreign tourists by far.

But the small portion appears closer to medium size - the claypot brims over with viscous soup an\n\nd can easily serve four.\n\nThe soup is chockful of meaty slivers of crab and\n\nlarge pieces of fish maw with a lovely gummy texture.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:26am\n\n'I consider Chow Yun Fat more a friend than an idol': Li Nanxing\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe restaurant prepares its superior broth from scratch, using pork bones and old hens. The stock gives the fish maw soup a strong and sturdy base of flavour.\n\nCrab meat with fish maw soup at Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant Bedok.

The thickly sliced gourd is cooked to tenderness and the pork is fully infused with the savoury flavour of black fermented bean sauce.\n\nPork ribs with bittergourd in bean sauce.

But you can request for the dark soya sauce version.\n\nSeafood hor fun with egg. ST PHOTO: HEDY KHOO\n\nFresh toman, which is found in the dish, is delivered daily. The fish is clean-tasting with no\n\nfishy or muddy odours.\n\nThe salad yu tiao ($12++ for small) comprises 10 large pieces of golden fried dough fritters generously stuffed with tasty sotong paste. The fried fritters are crispy on the outside but fluffy inside.\n\nSalad yu tiao.

Here are 10 facts about Mr Sim,\n\nwho died on Wednesday\n\nat the age of 67.\n\n1. He and his siblings were raised by his enterprising mother\n\nMr Sim was the 10th child out of five boys and seven girls in his Zhao'an Hokkien family, and was raised in a kampung in Bukit Panjang. His father died in 1969, when Mr Sim was 12 years old.\n\nHe inherited his entrepreneurial spirit and grit from his mother, Mrs Sim-Tan Siok Kee, who raised the family single-handedly by rearing animals, farming produce and going door to door to sell eggs.\n\n2. He graduated with a diploma in electrical and electronics engineering\n\nMr Sim completed secondary school at Bukit Panjang Government High, and studied electrical and electronics engineering at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 18, 2025, 12:31am\n\nCreative Technology retrenches 40 workers\n\nMore related stories\n\n3.

The Nomad MP3 player was the iPod before Apple's iPod\n\nBefore Apple's iPod, Creative rolled out the world's first digital audio players. The Nomad MP3 player, which was released in 1999, revolutionised the multimedia industry by offering consumers a new way to download, transport and play back digital audio.\n\nIts technology paved the way for the iPod and a generation of multimedia players.

He won several patent disputes against Apple and Samsung\n\nCreative Technology sued tech giant Apple in 2006 for patent infringement with its iPods, which used the technology in Creative's Nomad players. Mr Sim walked away with US$100 million in compensation.\n\nIn 2014, he sued Samsung and Apple again, alleging that several of their devices, such as iPhones and tablets, infringed 10 of his patents. Mr Sim won both lawsuits.\n\n9. He coined NUTS, the 'No U-Turn Syndrome'\n\nThe phrase, which describes the social behaviour of Singaporeans, comes from his book, Chaotic Thoughts From the Old Millennium, which was published in December 1999. Mr Sim observed that unlike overseas car drivers, those in Singapore U-turned only where there is a U-turn sign.\n\nHe explained that this was symptomatic of the \"no-rule, no-do\" mindset of Singaporeans, which inhibited their creativity and initiative. The book features a collection of personal short stories, whose timeless lessons on street smarts, resilience and entrepreneurship are still relevant today.\n\n10. He was charitable\n\nMr Sim set up the Sim Foundation in 2006, which focuses on charitable work in education and the arts, and to help the poor and the elderly. It was later renamed the Sim-Tan Siok Kee Foundation in memory of his late mother, who died in 2006 at the age of 94.\n\nHe also set up the Kuo Pao Kun Foundation to support the arts in Singapore, dedicating it to his late mentor, theatre doyen Kuo Pao Kun.\n\nMr Sim was an active donor, donating a total of more than $49 million to funds and charities in his lifetime.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nLunch With Sumiko: Creative Technology’s Sim Wong Hoo is back, with Super X-Fi getting rave reviews\n\nSingapore Budget 2019: Creative Technology CEO Sim Wong Hoo lauded for spirit of entrepreneurship\n\nLucas Tan\n\nCreative Technology\n\nTECHNOLOGY SECTOR\n\nENTREPRENEURS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 5, 2023, 10:41pm\n\nCreative founder Sim Wong Hoo's unexpected death leaves friends, colleagues shocked\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

There is a new horror-movie doll in town and her name is M3GAN.\n\nAnd because she represents cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI), this deadly children's toy would \"make quick work of\" killing the demon-possessed dolls from the Child's Play (1988 to 2019) and Annabelle (2014 to 2019) horror franchises.\n\nThat is the confident prediction of American actress Allison Williams, who stars in and co-produces the science-fiction horror flick M3GAN, which opens in cinemas on Thursday.\n\nThe titular killer robotic doll has already gone viral. A trailer showing her busting out some disconcertingly adult dance moves - in a scene with Malaysian comedian-actor Ronny Chieng, who also appears in the film - got millions of views on TikTok in December, inspiring copycat dance videos and memes across social media.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\n3\n\nMore related stories\n\nWilliams plays Gemma, a toy company roboticist who uses advanced AI to create M3GAN, which is short for Model 3 Generative Android, and is programmed to be a child's greatest companion and protector.\n\nWhen Gemma gets custody of her unexpectedly orphaned niece Cady (Violet McGraw), she decides to enlist M3GAN's (Amie Donald) help in taking care of her charge. But this has dire consequences when the doll becomes overprotective of the girl.\n\nAt the Los Angeles premiere of the movie, Williams and co-producers James Wan and Jason Blum say the story is a precisely calibrated mix of horror and humour.\n\nWan, the Malaysian-born director behind the Saw (2004 to 2021) and The Conjuring (2013 to 2021) horror films, describes the plot - which he developed with screenwriter Akela Cooper - as \"fun, scary and darkly humorous\".\n\n\"I cannot wait for the audience to experience it. It's such a perfect movie to see with a crowd in a theatre,\" says the 45-year-old film-maker.\n\nAnd he believes the virality of the trailer is because the M3GAN doll is \"so sassy and full of personality - I feel that's what people are really latching on to\".\n\nBlum, who turned up to the premiere dressed in drag as M3GAN, notes that the movie is also arriving at a time when AI is in the news more than ever, like with the\n\nrecent launch of the chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nAmerican actress Allison Williams (in silver) and producer Jason Blum (third from left, in drag) at the premiere of M3GAN in Hollywood, California, on Dec 7, 2022. PHOTO: AFP\n\n\"I think AI is being talked about more and more even in the last few weeks, and it's very much on people's minds, so that's one reason I think the trailer has connected in the way that it has,\" says the 53-year-old American producer behind the Paranormal Activity (2007 to 2021) and Insidious (2010 to 2018) horror films.\n\nWilliams, who starred in the acclaimed comedy drama series Girls (2012 to 2017) but gained wider recognition for Jordan Peele's horror film Get Out (2017) , says the movie is \"a very unique experience tonally\".\n\nAnd that is one reason the viral success of the trailer was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe 34-year-old actress says: \"People are having so much fun with her. They seem to understand what her energy was, and she has a very specific vibe. And we knew that as long as people understood her, we were going to be okay.\"\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nWhile Wan and Blum say they would put M3GAN dolls to work doing chores around the house, Williams thinks the robot's best quality is her fierce, albeit deadly, loyalty. \"She's like a fiercely protective best friend. You know those people who are, like, 'If he does something to you, I will kill him?' She means it. It's not an empty threat with her.\"\n\nHorror fans have already been furiously debating online about who would be the deadliest in a showdown: M3GAN, Chucky or Annabelle.\n\nWilliams says: \"Listen, there's no contest. My girl has got it. She has the World Wide Web in her brain and she's got it all. She has a leg up on everyone. I think she'd kill both of them and she'd make quick work of it.\"\n\nM3GAN is now showing in cinemas.\n\nAlison de Souza\n\nMovies\n\nHORROR\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\n2\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\n4\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nYour dream home, now more affordable with IKEA home design ​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f71eeddc2c5a58c70d2a1114023c859e978f6cb6d48740ea1c13be5d15dd47cc/2545_fp_00342a.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Amie Donald as the title character in M3GAN.

They didn't have many entries,\" said Kok.\n\n\"Francis had only four to five entries for the whole month of December, which was very low for such a big stable.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"And, when they had runners, they already had their own jockeys. It was still an amazing experience riding trackwork for them.\"\n\nNo adrenaline rush there, but the winner of 132 races, including five in Australia, still felt he had packed some new tricks in his bag for the return to Singapore on Jan 2.\n\n\"Just the first time riding trackwork in Europe was unbelievable. It's very different how they train over longer runs,\" he said.\n\n\"It's hard to explain the extra skill sets I've picked up there; it's a rider's feeling.\n\n\"I got to ride different types of horses at different tracks, especially at Chantilly over its long tracks that go uphill.\n\n\"Both the Lerners and Francis put me on two-year-olds. It was a new experience for me.\n\n\"Surprisingly, they are very calm when they work in lots of 20-plus in a single file. Maybe they're used to this type of training.\n\n\"The horses are so relaxed. Whether they trot or canter, you can hear their breathing with every stride.\n\n\"I know our (Kranji) babies are not as calm, but I'm sure I can apply some of the techniques I learnt with the young horses.\"\n\nThe freezing temperatures could have driven the Ipoh-born rider back to the airport earlier, but the later morning starts made the French winter more bearable.\n\nBesides, the trip had not been all work and no play. With his last day of work on Dec 23, Kok would not have left France without some jolly celebrations.\n\n\"At the Lerners, I worked from 8am to noon, and rode around two to three horses,\" said Kok, whose wife Lola is French, hence the choice of her native country as his working holiday.\n\n\"I started later at 9am at Francis' Chantilly stables, but rode more horses, around three to four, until 1pm.\n\n\"I spent Christmas and the New Year at Lola's parents' place in Vedene in Avignon in the south-east of France.\n\n\"I never had the chance to celebrate like that, that's why I wanted to stay there into the New Year. I had a great time.\"\n\nFrom zero race-ride, Kok will no doubt be whipped back into form with a book of 10 mounts at Singapore's first race meeting on Saturday.\n\n\"I rang the trainers a few days before I came back. They knew I would be available,\" said Kok.\n\n\"To be honest, I haven't really had the time to go through the form as I'm still jetlagged.\n\n\"There are some even chances here and there.\n\n\"I only hope I can crack it for a win on the opening day.\"\n\nOcean Crossing is his mount in the day's highlight, the $100,000 Kranji Stakes A race over 1,100m.\n\nBut, even though he rode the All Too Hard seven-year-old to second place at his last start, he is not holding his breath.\n\n\"Ocean Crossing ran on for second to Minister, but it was over 1,600m. This will be too sharp,\" he said.\n\n\"With good 1,100m horses like Lucky Jinsha, Celavi and Rocket Star, he will struggle, but you never know.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7169bd43cbd30984435eff2d76b28b1fe2da57f1ddde54e29db3c3ab68638836/unnamed_1_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Simon Kok driving Ocean Crossing to a 1/2-length second to Minister (Matthew Kellady) at the All Too Hard seven-year-old's last outing in a Class 2 race over 1,600m on Nov 5.

He has won three times over the distance.\n\nWith Saifudin serving a careless riding suspension, Moongate Star's connections have engaged Vlad Duric and that is a strong pointer to his chances.\n\nBarrier-wise, he gets the middle lane - if the two horses drawn inside of him do not secure their places - in the 12-horse field. He won from Gate 8 last time.\n\nBack to his last-start success, he was ignored in the betting, which was understandable.\n\nMost would have have struck his name off, after his previous two disappointing runs and his bleeding episode.\n\nBut those who had faith in his comeback on Dec 26 were rewarded with a juicy $200 win payout.\n\nSaifudin parked him a handy third early and, when asked, his mount produced plenty to beat Silent Is Gold by a ½-length. He clocked a smart 1min 04.49sec.\n\nHe seemed to have carried a bit of excess baggage then but now looks picture-perfect after the comeback outing. He is the horse to beat.\n\nThe fact that his winning form has been franked is another plus point.\n\nOn Tuesday, Silent Is Gold won his 1,000m trial impressively in 1:00.41, the second-fastest of the five heats.\n\nDebut winner Sabah Ace is another sound proposition.\n\nThe David Kok-trained three-year-old mesmerised with his big-bounding strides when asked to quicken in the Restricted Maiden event over the Polytrack 1,100m on Nov 5.\n\nHe cleared away to beat Saturday's Race 2 top hope Italian Revolution by 1¼ lengths in 1:05.28.\n\nThe extra 100m in Race 10, the $50,000 Class 4 Div 2 event over the Poly 1,200m, will be even better for Sabah Ace.\n\nHis trial on Dec 29 was good. He finished a soft third behind the promising newcomer Xiao Bao Bei.\n\nItalian Revolution was also second in his debut. He should be third-time lucky.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9b7a0dd6a535d65be2d682262783239f43d2bc322d2583633e1e93d90fb30b15/unnamed_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Last-start winner Moongate Star is a lot fitter and looks the one to beat in Saturday's Race 8, the $70,000 Class 3 event over the Polytrack 1,100m. \n", "caption": "Last-start winner Moongate Star is a lot fitter and looks the one to beat in Saturday's Race 8, the $70,000 Class 3 event over the Polytrack 1,100m.

By the time they found out about his injury, it was already too late.\n\nAs for the compensation, the centre said they would refund the remaining $539 class fees, as well as pay Wu $500 for the incident.\n\n\"We are very sorry and have responded actively [to the accident],\" said Little Earth Education Centre when interviewed by Shin Min.\n\ndispute\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nPRE-SCHOOLS\n\nACCIDENTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:15am\n\nFrom noise complaints to posting photos: The five-year dispute between Woodlands neighbours\n\n45\n\nApr 30, 2025, 03:20am\n\nRenovator-matching platform shields homeowners from irreputable contractors\n\nApr 22, 2025, 03:35am\n\nHDB flat seller accuses buyer of U-turn after agreeing to delay handover\n\nJan 8, 2025, 11:51pm\n\nBukit Gombak residents call PAP-PSP spat childish, 'boh liao'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/77d38a53581ef03992782ebc4da6052b76bda248c6d82ff2269c95a743156151/20230104_broken_front_teeth_zaobao_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Wu had to fork out around $1,000 in medical fees, and her son must now avoid certain foods so as to not put pressure on the broken teeth.", "caption": "Wu had to fork out around $1,000 in medical fees, and her son must now avoid certain foods so as to not put pressure on the broken teeth.

She also pressed on the elderly woman's chin, attempting to calm her.\n\nThe maid said she was unable to control her emotions at the time and attributed this to a headache.\n\nSaid DPP Santhra: \"She stated that she may have used her fingers to 'press too hard' against the chin of the victim.\"\n\nYati then rubbed Madam Leong's face a few times, but she lost control of her emotions again and used her right hand to \"tap\" the victim's face a few times.\n\nThe maid then left Madam Leong in the master bedroom after switching off the lights and closing the door.\n\nThe next morning, whenYati saw bruises on her charge's face, she tried to treat them with warm water.\n\nBut the bruises were still visible the following day. So Yati called Madam Leong's son and lied to him that the elderly woman had had a fall.\n\nMadam Leong was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where a doctor noticed extensive bruising on her, among other injuries.\n\nOn reviewing closed-circuit television footage from cameras installed at the home, the son saw Yati stopping Madam Leong from leaving the master bedroom.\n\nThe pair could be heard arguing before Madam Leong screamed a few times.\n\nInterviewed by the police, Yati admitted to what she did.\n\nThe police could not interview or record a statement from Madam Leong due to her medical condition, said DPP Santhra.\n\nThe prosecutor asked for Yati to be jailed for at least 14 weeks, noting Madam Leong's injuries and adding that the elderly woman was vulnerable due to her physical and mental conditions, and that there was a blatant abuse of trust and authority.\n\nSaid the DPP: \"The victim, together with her family members, were squarely dependent on the accused to look after the victim and assist her to carry out her daily activities. The victim thus squarely fell within the class of victims who are considered more vulnerable and susceptible to abuse and violence.\"\n\nYati, who was not represented, told the court that she was remorseful and hoped for a light sentence so that she could return home as soon as possible.\n\nFor each count of voluntarily causing hurt, offenders can be jailed for three years, fined $5,000, or both. The maximum sentence can be doubled for crimes against vulnerable victims.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nMAID/DOMESTIC WORKER\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nYour dream home, now more affordable with IKEA home design ​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6abf2d979208c6f0a61863f4bc68d6cb4a5de263a75e78620df427c52da0ad88/gavel.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

They met in a stairwell, and as they were talking, the offender suddenly leaned forward and kissed the girl on the lips.\n\nThe girl was shocked and tried in vain to push him away. She then felt him insert his tongue into her mouth.\n\nHe then made her perform a sex act on him before he raped her. The girl managed to kick the offender and fled home.\n\nThe offender texted her the same day and told her not to tell anyone about what had occurred.\n\nSaid the prosecution: \"As a result of the accused's sexual assault, (the second victim) felt afraid about the consequences she would suffer if others discovered what had happened, including the risk of her being unable to socialise with her friends and the fear that she would be a disgrace to society.\"\n\nIn their sentencing submissions, the prosecution noted that the offender was not recommended for probation and that a clinical psychologist assessed him as having a moderate-to-high risk of sexual re-offending.\n\nThey also noted how the offences caused actual psychological and physical harm, as well as potential harm, to both his victims.\n\nThe DPPs added: \"The nature of the accused's offences, his inclination towards sexual violence, and socially unconventional sexual attitudes reveal him to be a recalcitrant sexual offender whose deviant behaviour must be nipped in the bud.\"\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nRead articles by Samuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nDiscover the new Home design service by IKEA​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6abf2d979208c6f0a61863f4bc68d6cb4a5de263a75e78620df427c52da0ad88/gavel.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The couple have reportedly denied making threats against Berhalter.\n\nReyna's father, Claudio, is a former captain of the US men's team and the current sporting director of Austin FC.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Danielle Reyna said she was the one who initially contacted Stewart about the bar incident. She said she was \"outraged and devastated\" after Berhalter was quoted speaking about a problematic player on the team who was nearly sent home during the World Cup.\n\nBerhalter told a conference after returning from Qatar that a player on the team was \"clearly not meeting expectations on and off the field\". Gio Reyna later confirmed in an Instagram post that Berhalter was talking about him.\n\nDanielle, who has known Gregg and Rosalind Berhalter for years, reportedly made the federation aware of the fight between the pair outside a bar 31 years ago after Berhalter criticised her son after the World Cup.\n\n\"I thought it was especially unfair that Gio, who had apologised for acting immaturely about his playing time, was still being dragged through the mud when Gregg had asked for and received forgiveness for doing something so much worse at the same age,\" Danielle Reyna said in a statement, according to ESPN.

I feel more motivated now because I know that feeling and I wouldn't want to feel like that again.\"\n\nStanford was Tan's first choice as he felt that it would allow him to concentrate on swimming and academics.\n\nThe four-gold SEA Games swimmer was also in contact with Stanford coach Dan Schemmel, who followed his results from the end of 2021 through to 2022.\n\n\"I really wanted to have a balance between swimming and academics,\" said the freestyle specialist, who will enrol at Stanford in September after he completes his national service in July.\n\n\"I also wanted to have that overseas experience, the independence, taking care of myself, maybe just see the world in that sense.\"\n\nHaving the opportunity to compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 - the highest level of college competition in the United States - was also a key reason for Tan choosing Stanford.\n\nStanford are eight-time National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 men's champions, with their last title coming in 1998, while their women's team have won the championship 12 times.\n\nAmerican Katie Ledecky, who has won seven Olympic golds and 19 world titles, is among Stanford's alumnae.\n\nTan said: \"It's a different world. They have a bigger depth of swimmers and there are definitely more swimmers who've made the Olympics in the US.\n\n\"I will be racing against faster swimmers as well and on a bigger scale. That should motivate me more to train harder.\"\n\nStanford's strong business programme was also an important factor for Tan, who intends to pursue a career in finance.\n\nHearing how fellow national swimmers enjoyed their time while studying in the United States also validated his decision.\n\nAmong those who have done so are Singapore's Olympic gold medallist Joseph Schooling (University of Texas), while Christie Chue and Gan Ching Hwee are enrolled at Florida International University and Indiana University respectively.\n\nIt will be a busy year for Tan as he works on qualifying for the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe qualification window for the Paris Games opens on March 1.

Finally, we also notified fans via our official social media channels.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 29, 2024, 11:25pm\n\nLions exit Asean Championship amid more VAR drama\n\nMore related stories\n\nA number of Vietnamese fans said they were denied entry despite having tickets, although the tickets they had were for home zones, which were reserved for Singapore fans. Away supporters are allocated eight per cent of total sellable tickets, as determined by the Asean Football Federation.\n\nA notice on the ticketmaster website states that home and away fans must purchase the correct tickets for their respective sections and promoters reserve the right to reject patrons without refunds. These conditions are repeated in the physical or digital tickets issued.\n\nSingapore's home games against Myanmar on Dec 24 and Vietnam six days later drew crowds of 5,370 and 5,434 respectively.\n\nSingaporean Simon Owen Khoo, who wore a Vietnam jersey, attended the game with his spouse from Vietnam and their 10-year-old son. They sat in the grandstand - reserved for home fans and the only sheltered area.\n\nHe said while some Vietnam supporters were denied entry after being unable to produce a Singapore identity card, he was not asked to show his NRIC by the staff.\n\nThe private tutor, 57, felt the authorities could be more flexible for away fans even if they had bought the wrong tickets. He said he was aware of Vietnam fans who ended up paying marked-up prices for second-hand home tickets.\n\nUndergraduate Zachary Wu, 23, was at both the Myanmar and Vietnam games and noted there were far fewer Myanmar fans at the Christmas Eve match. He said: \"Even though the home support was about the same (for both games), there were significantly more Vietnam fans.\n\n\"I believe when Vietnam played Malaysia earlier there were some fan clashes so it is not surprising that security was stricter in Singapore for the Vietnam match.\"\n\nAccording to the Vietnam Posts website, an away fan Doan Quang Linh lamented how it was difficult for them to purchase tickets due to the limited supply. Away tickets were released only on Dec 8, three days after the home tickets went on sale.\n\nThe FAS had officially communicated its ticketing protocols to the Vietnam FA weeks before the match to ensure they were aware of the arrangements, noted its spokesman.\n\nHe added: \"Majority of both home and away supporters at the match were found to be in compliant with the requirement, and the matchday experience in-stadia was concluded without any incidents.\"\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nand\n\nErvin Ang\n\nAFF Championship\n\nSingapore Football\n\nVietnam\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 27, 2024, 11:58pm\n\nLions believe in bid to accomplish Asean Cup mission in Vietnam\n\nDec 26, 2024, 10:37pm\n\nSingapore lose 2-0 to Vietnam after VAR mayhem\n\nDec 25, 2024, 12:12am\n\nSingapore-Vietnam matches to be screened at CCs\n\nDec 22, 2024, 11:10pm\n\nAsean Cup semi-final tickets for Singapore-Vietnam game sell out\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9c78d93e4fc26727ad9d5124860aab0d9f2870262f0c152147917986edc27db8/2022123079602568bum9360-01.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Police were called in during the AFF Championship group game between Singapore and Vietnam at Jalan Besar on Dec 30.", "caption": "Police were called in during the AFF Championship group game between Singapore and Vietnam at Jalan Besar on Dec 30.

If the hoarder wants to hoard, they should confine that habit to the interior of their flat. Other residents shouldn't have to tiptoe around the mess when we want to use basic amenities like staircases.\"\n\nIn response to a Stomp query, Sembawang Town Council said it has been in contact with the owner of the clutter.\n\nThe town council told Stomp on Wednesday: \"We have previously cleared the items along the corridor and taken enforcement action when this problem arose in previous years, but the problem resurfaced again.\n\n\"We had approached her most recently since around August 2022 and while she was not cooperative initially, she had since requested for more time to clear her items during our last visit to her on December 14, 2022.\n\n\"We will be serving her another warning letter on January 5 to remove her items by January 10.

The pair had known each other since 2014 when they played the video game Counter-Strike together.\n\nChung kept asking for his money back, but Tan was unable to repay him.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 1, 2024, 03:18am\n\nSingapore to host Evo 2026\n\nMore related stories\n\nAfter Chung asked for $400 from him on Sept 21, 2020, Tan came up with a plan the next day for Chung to throw an e-sports match in the EPULZE Royal South-east Asia Cup Tournament that he was playing in.\n\nThe tournament was part of the Valorant Ignition Series that involved the online first-person shooter game Valorant in which two opposing teams of five players each take turns to attack and defend.\n\nAt around 6pm on Sept 22, 2020, Tan suggested that Chung, who was representing RSG Resurgence Esports, throw his team's match against Team Blackbird Ignis from Japan after betting on his team to lose.\n\nTan also said he could obtain money from his older brother to place the bets. Chung agreed to the plan as he believed it was the only way to recoup his money, DPP Ting said.\n\nA sum of $3,000 was transferred to Chung's account after Tan pleaded with his brother for a loan.

Just as importantly, big luxury brands are now investing more in the shopping experience in China.\n\nOne Shanghai shopper, surnamed Mao, said that she had visited boutiques around the world for years, but now believes she gets the best service in China.\n\n\"When I would go to Paris, I couldn't ask the Paris sales people to keep a bag for me, but now here we can,\" she said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 11, 2024, 09:26am\n\nMichelle Yeoh brings glamour to Olympic medal presentation\n\nMore related stories\n\nBefore the pandemic closed borders early in 2020, Chinese shoppers bought 70 per cent of their luxury goods abroad.\n\nUnder pandemic travel curbs, China's domestic luxury sales boomed, doubling to 471 billion yuan (S$91.9 billion) from 2019 to 2021, according to Bain & Co. Even so, Chinese consumers' share of the global market fell to 21 per cent in 2021 from 25 per cent in 2019.\n\n\"It won't go back to 70 per cent,\" said Mr Jonathan Yan, a principal at consultancy Roland Berger in Shanghai. \"I'm sure there will still be a portion of luxury spending happening in other countries, because it's natural people like to shop when we travel, but it will be more like 50-50.\"\n\nMany luxury companies such as LVMH's Louis Vuitton and Coach-parent Tapestry doubled down in China over the past three years, opening new flagship stores and hosting large fashion shows to reach consumers unable to go abroad.\n\nThis helped local staff cultivate relationships with China's VIP customers, who previously preferred to shop overseas.\n\nResearch conducted by Hong Kong-based consultancy Oliver Wyman showed 70 per cent of China's luxury consumers used sales assistants to facilitate purchases while 40 per cent communicate with sales staff at least once per week.\n\nOliver Wyman's Kenneth Chow says that half of Chinese consumers who bought luxury in 2021 were doing so for the first time.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see how new luxury consumers will perceive the difference between domestic and overseas luxury shopping,\" he said.\n\nInternational travel restrictions and local policies to spur spending also drove many consumers to China's tax-free island of Hainan as a luxury shopping destination.\n\nIn 2021, Hainan accounted for 13 per cent of China's domestic luxury spend, versus 6 per cent pre-pandemic, and tax regulations are set to continue to loosen. By 2025, luxury brands will be able to operate their own duty-free stores, rather than rely on partnerships with local players such as China Duty Free Group.\n\nHainan's popularity is expected to continue, Roland Berger's Mr Yan says, as only 13 per cent of Chinese citizens have a passport, making a tax-free domestic destination enormously attractive.\n\nHainan, as well as Beijing's moves to lower import tariffs on luxury goods in 2018 and 2019, have consequently dulled some of the appeal to shop abroad for some more price-conscious shoppers, with handbags now about 10-20 per cent more expensive in China, from 50-60 per cent previously.\n\nAt 14,400 yuan, Louis Vuitton's medium-sized Neverfull bag is only 18 per cent more expensive in Shanghai than in Paris, if travellers claim their 12 per cent VAT refund.\n\nMr Luca Solca, senior research analyst at Bernstein, said brands will continue working to narrow cross-border price differences, though efforts are further complicated by currency depreciation against the dollar.\n\n\"The return of the Chinese to Europe, where prices are lower, will take some time,\" he said, predicting a widespread return to long-haul travel in 2024.\n\nSearches and bookings for international travel since the announcement that quarantine would be lifted have favoured short-haul international destinations, with Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan topping travel agency searches.\n\nFor many, however, the broader offerings of luxury goods overseas combined with the savings means shopping holidays are definitely back on the agenda - good news for Paris retailers.\n\nMs Lucy Lu, 31-year-old who works in fashion in Shanghai, has already made her travel plans.\n\n\"The Bulgari ring my friend wants is 20 per cent cheaper in Dubai and my other friend has given me a list of make-up, some products are often out of stock in China, so it's easier to get them abroad.\" - REUTERS\n\nFrance\n\nChina\n\nLUXURY BRANDS\n\nShopping\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 21, 2024, 08:23am\n\nTeam Singapore's monumental effort for Olympic glory\n\nJul 15, 2024, 01:47pm\n\nBTS singer Jin takes part in Paris Olympics torch relay\n\nJun 19, 2024, 04:13pm\n\nTeammates hopeful Mbappe can make Friday's match against Dutch\n\nJun 17, 2024, 01:37pm\n\nMichelle Yeoh and Jean Todt celebrate 20 years as a couple\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

UOB has 17 ATMs dispensing new and fit-for-gifting notes, up from 10 ATMs in 2022.\n\nDBS and UOB will also provide $2 and $10 in larger quantities, as well as $50 notes, for withdrawal from selected pop-up and branch ATMs.\n\nWalk-in exchanges at DBS, OCBC and UOB branches are available for those aged 60 and above and people with disabilities.\n\nHousewife Jenny Tan was among those who queued for new notes at the community club.\n\n\"It has always been a tradition to give new notes to people during Chinese New Year. It will be strange to give people old or used notes,\" said the 57-year-old.\n\nBut Ms Yvonne Leong, 44, who is self-employed, decided to try the new option.\n\nShe said: \"There is no harm trying fit-for-gifting notes, because they seem quite new. I feel these notes are acceptable to give during Chinese New Year.\"\n\nPeople lining up outside the DBS branch at HDB hub, ahead of the outlet's opening, on Jan 5, 2023. ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG\n\nLikewise, sales merchandiser Winna Ho said she finds the note acceptable for the festive season.\n\n\"It doesn't matter because the value of the money is the same regardless of whether they are new or used notes,\" said the 48-year-old.\n\nFit-for-gifting notes are notes that are generally clean and of suitable quality for recirculation, including for festive gifting.\n\nThe condition of these notes has been verified by banknote processing machines. The notes are similar in quality to those dispensed by ATMs.\n\nFrom Thursday, the public can make appointments to exchange their cash for fit-for-gifting or new notes for Chinese New Year.\n\nThose who wish to do so must pre-book through the online reservation systems of DBS, OCBC and UOB to minimise the likelihood of overcrowding at bank branches.\n\nUOB's first reservation window period opened on Thursday, with collection from Jan 10 to Jan 14.\n\nPeople queueing outside the UOB outlet at HDB hub on Jan 5, 2023. ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG\n\nUOB managing director of group channels and digitalisation Benny Chan said booking slots for new notes and fit-for-gifting notes exchange at the bank's branches were fully booked by about 8.30am and 12.40pm, respectively, on Thursday.\n\nOCBC Bank's head of branch service and risk management, Ms Jean Oh, said the bank's booking window from Jan 10 to Jan 13 opened at 8am on Thursday.\n\nAs at 11am, 25 per cent of the available slots have been taken up. Most of the slots that have been booked are for new notes.\n\nThe booking window for this first tranche will close on Saturday or when all slots have been taken up, said Ms Oh.\n\n\"For walk-in for elderly and those with disabilities, our branches have met their quota of available new and fit-for-gifting notes today. A quota will be set aside each day,\" said Ms Oh, adding that the quota will depend on each branch.\n\nQueues forming up at 9.45am outside the OCBC branch at HDB hub, ahead of the outlet’s opening at 11am, on Jan 5, 2023. ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore had previously encouraged people to adopt more environmentally friendly options, as issuing new notes to meet the demand for festive gifting generates unnecessary carbon emissions and is a waste of resources.\n\nApart from fit-for-gifting notes, people are also\n\nurged to use digital red packets, or e-hongbao.\n\nThe central bank will also cease the issuance of good-as-new $2 notes from the upcoming Chinese New Year. These notes were issued during Chinese New Year and deposited back to MAS shortly thereafter by the banks.\n\nAmanda Lee\n\nConsumer Correspondent\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR 2023\n\nSingapore\n\nBANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 26, 2023, 10:29am\n\nCustomers frustrated after non-delivery of CNY gift hampers\n\nJan 25, 2023, 01:29pm\n\nNursing home residents whip up special home-cooked CNY dinner\n\nJan 25, 2023, 04:36am\n\nWet weather expected for remainder of CNY festive period\n\nJan 24, 2023, 12:07pm\n\nHow local celebrities celebrated Chinese New Year\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He added, \"However, I'm sorry for the misunderstandings.\"\n\nBaihakki has won three AFF Championship titles with the national team, and the Malaysia Super League title with the LionsXII in 2013. He has also played overseas in Indonesia, Thailand and for Johor Darul Ta'zim in Malaysia.\n\nBaihakki later posted a second apology, this time a one-minute video on Instagram.\n\n\"I apologise to those who misinterpreted (it). It was not meant to (be) laughing at anybody,\" he said. \"I wanna be the bigger person here, to actually apologise to all of you and hopefully we are all on the same page.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think you are just unlucky, being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he added. \"But that's alright, it's okay, as long as we know, that these are mistakes that hopefully we can avoid next time.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nAFF Championship: Lions crash out after losing 4-1 to Malaysia\n\nFootball: Time to revamp entire squad after Lions’ meek AFF Championship exit, urge coaches\n\nSu Thet Hnin San\n\nSPORTS AND RECREATION\n\nSingapore Football\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 15, 2025, 12:12am\n\nMore than 3,500 participate in inclusive dragon boat race at Bedok Reservoir\n\nJun 9, 2025, 10:21pm\n\nSingapore women's football team withdraw from Asean Women's Championship\n\nJun 7, 2025, 11:33pm\n\nFrom TikTok to trendy sports, Queensway shops find ways to thrive amid retail disruption\n\nJun 7, 2025, 11:31pm\n\nSingaporean athletes at World Masters Games prove age is no barrier to fitness\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Friends with benefits\n\nThe basic template here is from sitcoms such as Friends or How I Met Your Mother: a group of young adults trying to establish themselves, with the delicious wrinkle of romantic tension between some of them.\n\nThe friends here are marketing executive Ji-eun (Chae Soo-bin), photographer Woo-min (Choi), supermodel Seon-ho (Park Hee-jung) and rising fashion designer Joseph (Lee Sang-woon).\n\nJi-eun and Woo-min used to date, and the first episode reveals that there are still unresolved feelings. It ends with them getting drunk and spending the night together.\n\n2. Risque by K-drama standards\n\nA scene with a shirtless Choi lustfully ripping a string of pearls from Chae's neck is risque by K-drama standards, but viewers hoping that the rest of the series is just as edgy will be disappointed.\n\nStill, the \"will they or won't they\" game that follows creates plenty of forward momentum.\n\nAnd the depiction of the bond among all four friends is heartwarming, if a little childish for their age.\n\nJoseph is also often reduced to various \"gays in fashion\" stereotypes, while Seon-ho's smouldering screen presence could have been put to better use.\n\nLee Sang-woon, Park Hee-jung, Chae Soo-bin and Choi Min-ho play a group of friends in The Fabulous. PHOTO: NETFLIX\n\n3. Emily In Paris, but in Seoul\n\nA chunk of the show's DNA seems shamelessly copied from the Netflix comedy series Emily In Paris (2020 to present), which is also set in fashion and luxury marketing, but in France.\n\nIt veers between mocking those industries - the inflated egos, mercurial personalities and influencer creep - and taking them too seriously.\n\nBut The Fabulous has fun along the way. And what it lacks in sophistication, it makes up for with the winsome charm and dewy-eyed chemistry of its romantic leads.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nActors Min-ho, Chae Soo-bin want family and friends to skip their Fabulous steamy scenes\n\nBinge-worthy: First Love is a cliched romance saved by beautiful cinematography and strong actors\n\nAlison de Souza\n\nSTREAMING - MUSIC/VIDEO/CONTENT\n\nk-drama\n\ntelevision\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

China has reported five or fewer deaths a day since the policy U-turn.\n\n\"That is totally ridiculous,\" 66-year-old Zhang, a Beijing resident who only gave his last name, said of the official toll. \"Four of my close relatives died. That's only from one family. I hope the government will be honest with the people and the rest of the world about what's really happened here.\"\n\nChina's Cabinet said on Wednesday it would step up medicine distribution and meet demand from medical institutions, nursing homes and rural areas, state media reported.\n\nBeijing has hit back against some countries demanding visitors from China show pre-departure COVID tests, saying the rules were unreasonable and lacked a scientific basis. Japan, the United States, Australia and several European states are among countries requiring such tests.\n\nMr Willie Walsh, head of the world's biggest airline association IATA, criticised such \"knee-jerk\" measures that he said had not previously stopped the spread of a virus that had hammered airlines which are recovering from the pandemic.\n\nChina will stop requiring inbound travellers to quarantine from Jan 8, but they must be tested before arrival.\n\nChina reported five new Covid-19 deaths for Tuesday, bringing the official death toll to 5,258, very low by global standards.\n\nBritish-based health data firm Airfinity has estimated about 9,000 people in China are probably dying each day from Covid-19.\n\nPatients at Shanghai's Zhongshan hospital, many of them elderly, were crammed in halls on Tuesday between makeshift beds with people on oxygen ventilators and intravenous drips.\n\nA Reuters witness counted seven hearses in the parking lot of Shanghai's Tongji hospital on Wednesday. Workers were seen carrying at least 18 yellow bags used to move bodies.\n\nChina's US$17 trillion economy has grown at its slowest in nearly half a century due to Covid-19 disruptions.\n\nBut the yuan was at a four-month high against the dollar on Wednesday after Finance Minister Liu Kun promised to step up fiscal expansion.

He was 67.\n\nMr Sim founded the home-grown business in 1981, and had led the company since its inception. In a bourse filing on Thursday, Creative said Mr Sim \"passed away peacefully\", without giving further details.\n\nUnder his leadership, Creative became famous for its Sound Blaster sound cards and digital entertainment products. It became the first Singaporean company to list shares on the Nasdaq in 1992.\n\nMr Sim, who was single, grew up on a kampung in Bukit Panjang, the youngest of 12 children in his family.\n\nHe studied electrical and electronic engineering at Ngee Ann Polytechnic after leaving Bukit Panjang Government High School. Upon graduating in 1981, he set up Creative as a computer shop in Chinatown in 1981 with his schoolmate, Mr Ng Kai Wa, who is now a board member.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 2, 2025, 02:31am\n\nJem landlord seeks $3.4m in arrears from Cathay Cineplexes after outlet closure\n\nMore related stories\n\nCreative's Sound Blaster card, launched in 1989, was a game changer in allowing PCs to generate quality sound. It had sold 400 million units as at 2019.\n\nBy 2000, Mr Sim, then aged 45, had become the youngest billionaire in Singapore. He was the first person to receive the Singapore Business Awards' Businessman of the Year accolade twice.\n\nMr Sim Wong Hoo playing music on the computer keyboard at the launch of its latest Sound Blaster card in 1998. PHOTO: BT FILE\n\nMr Sim had also gone to war with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs over their companies' portable music players. He sued the iPod maker in 2006 for patent infringements and walked away with a US$100 million (S$134 million) settlement.\n\nCreative had launched its Nomad MP3 player in 1999, two years before Apple unveiled the iPod. It later also rolled out other music players like the Nomad Jukebox Zen, which doubled up as a portable storage device for other media like photos and videos.\n\nHowever, its products ultimately lost out as Apple's music player gained popularity.\n\nWith competition and industry changes, Creative's fortunes took a dive and Mr Sim's name also dropped off the headlines.\n\nCreative shares traded on the Singapore Exchange, where it has been listed since 1994, dropped from a high of $64 in March 2000 to around $1 in 2017. The company voluntarily delisted its shares from the Nasdaq stock exchange in 2007.\n\nIt made a comeback in 2019 with Super X-Fi, an audio technology that it spent 20 years developing to the tune of US$100 million. The tech allows headphone users to experience sound in expansive, three-dimensional detail, like in real life.\n\nCreative's board has appointed lead independent non-executive director Lee Kheng Nam as the company's acting chairman and Mr Ng, an independent non-executive director, as acting vice-chairman.\n\nIt also appointed Mr Song Siow Hui, president of the company's Creative Labs business unit, as interim chief executive officer.\n\nMr Song, who had worked with Mr Sim for more than 30 years, said his death was a sad and sudden development.\n\n\"We feel a great loss especially since Mr Sim and I recently had extensive discussions on the direction of the company. During those discussions, Mr Sim was full of fresh vision. Even on the night before, he had a long discussion with the engineering team and was scheduled to meet the online sales team the next day.\n\n\"The best thing to do now is to ensure the continued smooth running of the company, and also to execute and realise the vision and strategy that Mr Sim had for the company,\" he said.\n\nWhen The Straits Times visited Creative's office on Thursday, staff said Mr Sim's death came as a shock. One person said the CEO was seen at work just this week.\n\nEntrepreneur Michael Ang, 68, who worked with Mr Sim in 1996 and 1997, said the Creative boss was enthusiastic about all things technology and charting the way forward for his company.\n\n\"We often talked about semiconductor technology... he was very advanced and knew the technology so well and was able to (help the company) leapfrog in terms of putting the underlying tech into his products, making them better and cheaper,\" said Mr Ang, who was the managing director of Fujitsu Microelectronics Asia when Creative became its first big client for its application-specific integrated circuits.\n\nFormer foreign minister George Yeo, a non-executive director on Creative's board, said he was deeply saddened to lose an old friend.\n\n\"Still remember the evening he presented me and (then) President Ong Teng Cheong with a Nomad MP3 player storing 12 songs. He was always bubbling with ideas. Never left a meeting with him without new inspirations,\" Mr Yeo wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nHome-grown gaming hardware company Razer's chief executive, Mr Tan Min-Liang, said on Facebook that he often met Mr Sim to discuss things like audio technology and design.\n\n\"Will miss him - the technology world and Singapore has lost a legend,\" he wrote.\n\nAdditional reporting by Sherlyn Sim\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nLunch With Sumiko: Creative Technology’s Sim Wong Hoo is back, with Super X-Fi getting rave reviews\n\nGeorge Yeo appointed independent non-executive director of Creative Technology\n\nPrisca Ang\n\nSINGAPORE COMPANIES\n\nTECHNOLOGY SECTOR\n\nobituary\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 12:57am\n\nWork-life balance most valued for Gen Z, millennials and Gen X: Poll\n\nJun 3, 2025, 06:21am\n\nNew resort chalet coming up in Pasir Ris\n\nMay 31, 2025, 01:40am\n\nCai fan merch label PointyRice calls out Uniqlo keychain's 'uncanny' likeness\n\nMay 16, 2025, 01:27am\n\nSIA staff to get 7.45 months' bonus after airline posts record $2.8 billion profit\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The dog spent more than a week in the ICU of a vet hospital after it was attacked.\n\nPHOTO: JENNIFER FAN\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 4, 2023, 11:34pm\n\nOwner of big dog that mauled smaller dog fined\n\nShare this article\n\nThe owner of a big dog that mauled a smaller dog was fined by the Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) in December 2022.\n\nAVS declined to give the fine amount, but under the Animals and Birds Act, an errant dog owner can receive a maximum composition fine of $1,000.\n\nOn Sept 19 last year, the 3kg maltipoo - a cross between a maltese and a toy poodle - named\n\nMilo was attacked by the Alaskan malamute\n\nmore than 10 times its weight along Namly Avenue between 7pm and 7.30pm. The dogs were being walked at the time - Milo by a helper, and the malamute by its owner.\n\nMs Jennifer Fan, Milo's owner, said the malamute's owner had signalled for her helper to walk past them. Her helper hesitated at first, given the size of the malamute, but then decided to continue walking. The malamute lunged towards Milo and mauled the small dog as they got closer.\n\nThe helper, traumatised by the attack, collapsed on the ground, and neighbours called an ambulance for her. They also alerted Ms Fan, who lives nearby.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 4, 2025, 08:45am\n\nCyclists banned from footpaths: Rule change sparks debate over safety, design and enforcement\n\nMore related stories\n\nMilo was taken to a vet hospital, where it spent more than a week in the intensive care unit. It had a severed kidney and needed two operations, said Ms Fan.\n\nThe composition fine was issued to the malamute owner following the AVS' probe into the incident. Such a fine means that the owner may not face prosecution in court, which may result in a more severe punishment if convicted.\n\nAVS group director Jessica Kwok said last week: \"The AVS takes all feedback received from the public on animal health and welfare seriously. Investigations into the case have concluded, and we have taken enforcement action against the owner of the Alaskan malamute.\"\n\nShe pointed out that the Animals and Birds (Dog Licensing and Control) Rules require a dog to be leashed and kept under proper control when in public places. \"This is to ensure a safe environment for members of the public, their pet animals, and one's own pet when in public places,\" she said. A dog owner can be prosecuted in court when the rules are breached.\n\nMs Kwok added that while pet dogs may be trained and are well-behaved and obedient, they are still susceptible to mood changes and external stimuli. They may also be triggered by unforeseen circumstances.\n\nShe said: \"There have been many incidents of pet dogs running off unexpectedly. Some of these incidents resulted in the dogs being hit by passing vehicles, or causing injury to people and other animals. Keeping pet dogs leashed and under proper control will help to prevent such incidents.\"\n\nIt will also reduce unintended disturbances and prevent harm to other people or pets, she added.\n\nMilo's medical bill has exceeded $21,000, and Ms Fan has engaged law firm BR Law Corporation to seek compensation from the malamute owner through a possible civil lawsuit. \"Milo has made a full recovery physically, but is very scared to get close to any other dog or unfamiliar people. It still needs more time for the emotional trauma to heal,\" she said.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCourt rules handler liable for dogs' attack on smaller dog\n\nWorker, doctor seek damages over alleged dog attacks in first such civil suits to land in court\n\nK.C.

Dan was my right-hand man pretty much from Day One. He was with me every step of the way,\" said Meagher, who saddled 29 winners in 2022 to finish seventh in the premiership.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"He's very loyal and hardworking, and a very intelligent bloke. He was a huge asset to the stable.\n\n\"I'll also miss him on race day, it'll be a lot different without him around.\n\n\"But it's not just about work. He's not just a jockey, he's also my best mate, our friendship goes back a long way.\n\n\"He's only a phone call away, though; we talk to each other very often. He and his family have settled in Australia and he'll have his first day back at the races at Wagga tomorrow (Thursday).\"\n\nIt goes without saying Meagher will be rooting for his buddy, except that the shouts will not come from the Kranji grandstand this time, but via the \"live\" Australian racing action on a smartphone.\n\nThe real game changer will, however, be on Saturday when Meagher will be giving a leg-up to different hoops, four altogether, with Frenchman Marc Lerner the surprising choice in the box-seat to take over Beasley's job.\n\nThey have combined for only three wins previously - Letitgo and Invincible Ryker in 2019 and Lim's Wish in 2022.\n\n\"Marc is a good guy, he rode work for us this morning. He's willing to work as much as he can with the stable,\" said Meagher, who has booked the sixth-season jockey on three of his 10 runners - Watch Out Boss, First Bowl and Lim's Passion.\n\n\"We definitely had to restructure on the jockey side.\n\n\"I also have my apprentice Fahmi (Rosman), Zyrul (Nor Azman), Harry (A'Isisuhairi) Kasim and Jerlyn (Seow), not forgetting Benny Woodworth, who has been a very successful jockey for the stable.\"\n\nThe Malaysian jockey, who is coming off a quiet 2022 season, will be partnering Lim's Dream for Meagher in the day's highlight, the $100,000 Kranji Stakes A race over 1,100m. But the Duporth seven-year-old has not found the line in nearly three years.\n\nHe is not the soundest of horses but Meagher will not write off the lightly raced five-time winner just yet.\n\n\"Lim's Dream has been struggling quite a bit, he had a few little issues. I'm not convinced he's come back 100 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\"Hopefully, he runs well this Saturday. I think he'll come out of it good. I don't think it's a race where he'll be competitive.\n\n\"He's an old boy and we'll see how he improves from there.\"\n\nWith none of his other nine starters exactly standouts in their respective events, Meagher will be hard-pushed to emulate his flying start to the 2022 campaign, when he put January astern as the log leader on seven winners.\n\nThe 39-year-old will be hoping for a better start than the way it ended, though.\n\nLim's Kosciuszko, his first overseas raider, ran last in the Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Sprint (1,200m) at Sha Tin on Dec 11.\n\nEven the homecoming has not been without hiccups.\n\n\"Lim's Kosciuszko was supposed to stay in quarantine for two weeks but he has done three weeks instead,\" he said.\n\n\"To cut a long story short, it was a nightmare but we have dogged through it.\n\n\"He comes out this afternoon. We have to get him ready for the (Group 1) Raffles Cup, which is not far away (March 25).\n\n\"The quarantine has put us back a little, but he's a tough little horse.\"\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

As did Silent Is Gold's stablemate Our Pinnacle (Shafrizal Saleh).\n\nBut Silent Is Gold was not to be overtaken.\n\nRunning as if in contempt of his rivals, he went to the line a neck in front of Our Pinnacle. A further head away, in third spot, came Cash Cove.\n\nStill a four-year-old, Gray's runner will open his season on the back of a last-start second behind Moongate Star.\n\nThat day, the margin was a ½-length and Silent Is Gold had to do it the hard way, racing wide for most of the journey.\n\nBe in his corner when he next goes to the races. Another win could be in the offing.\n\nGray also produced another willing worker at the trials.\n\nHis name is Ksatria and, although he did not break any land speed record, he did turn in a last-to-first showing when winning in 1min 2.5sec.\n\nRidden by apprentice Jamil Sarwi, Ksatria ambled out of the gates and settled in last spot.\n\nWhen the five-horse field made that first left-handed turn, he was about seven lengths from the leaders, Master Of Coin (Matthew Kellady) and Invincible Tycoon (Wong).\n\nHe finally got into his rhythm at the 600m and quickly latched onto the leading duo and third-placed Missile Rain, the mount of Koh Teck Huat.\n\nShowing great foresight, Jamil peeled Ksatria from his spot near the rails and went wide. It was a winning move as Ksatria, relishing the wind in his face, opened up to take the trial by ½-length.\n\nGray would have been pleased. His two-time winner seemed in the groove and could be a factor in Saturday's Class 4 race (1,700m).\n\nAnother one worth saving in your memory bank is Petrograd.\n\nRidden by Nunes, he finished second to Hurricane Mars (Saifudin Ismail) but it was only over the final furlong that he came under notice.\n\nThen again, until he threw down the gauntlet, Petrograd and Nunes had stalked the frontrunners like a hungry hyena.\n\nA furlong out and Nunes clicked him into action. He responded, pounced and almost caught Hurricane Mars.\n\nHe missed out by a shorthead but it would have sent signals through the Michael Clements' camp that their boy was ready, willing and, most importantly, able.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It is a Class 5 Division 2 sprint over 1,200m on the Polytrack.\n\nIt is a puzzling sort of race, with many chances, and the two \"workers\" are right in the mix.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nKoh sticks with Atlantean, while apprentice Akmazani Mazuki will take 3kg off the back of Gold Zest.\n\nFrom Stephen Crutchley's yard, Gold Zest is already a seven-year-old but he does not seem ready to be put out to pasture.\n\nOn Dec 20, he went really well in a trial, losing by only ½-length to Mercury Storm.\n\nBut the son of Highly Recommended is an enigma. He has been sparingly raced.\n\nHe had one start in 2019, two in 2020 and three in 2021. Last season saw him race seven times.\n\nWe have yet to see him greet the judge but who knows what this new season will bring.\n\nAs for that other seven-year-old, Atlantean, he is already a seven-time winner and growing long in the tooth does not seem to be a problem for the son of Dick Turpin.\n\nIt was in July that the Alwin Tan-trained runner fashioned his seventh victory and Saturday's track and trip should not pose a problem.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Fitter, she looks the one to beat. (1) BURNT SUGAR is a Global View newcomer who could be ready to win. Trainer Gavin Smith won the opening juvenile event and, from three runners carded, it is challenging to work out which one of them is the right one. (2) FIRE GLOW is a daughter of Fire Away, (3) HILDELITA is a Vercingetorix filly. (5) PARIS LASS is by Visionaire.\n\nRace 2 (1,200m)\n\n(4) FOREST SPY is a classy sprinter and, if fit and well, should be very difficult to beat. It is hard to know yet what will be the best distance for (6) ZATARA MAGIC, but one thing for sure is he is talented and will run well. (7) JET MIRAGE ran a cracker in a decent field last week and should be a danger if repeating that level of form. It does look a tough task for the balance of the runners and, although (1) RUSSIAN EMPIRE surprised last time, this is a tougher task.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\nAfter a good debut, (11) LADY CHARTOUCHE was expected to win her second start but may not have liked the Polytrack. Back on turf, she gets the chance to recoup those losses.  (1) CHELSEA GARDEN and (2) HONEY LAND make their local debut and could improve on their form. (3) TIDE IS HIGH is clearly better than her two local runs suggest. Watch the betting on newcomers (9) COLD TRUTH and (13) QUEEN'S GAMBIT.\n\nRace 4 (1,200m\n\n) (3) ROSE OF BAYEUX has been a revelation since joining the yard of Duncan McKenzie, but it will get tougher for her now. (6) HOLLY'S VIEW did not show her best on the Polytrack last time and will do better back on turf. (9) GLASS SHOES won nicely on debut and was not disgraced on the Polytrack last time. She could also do a lot better back on turf. (12) HILARITY has yet to win in this country but has run some fair races and must be considered.\n\nRace 5 (1,000m\n\n) (1) GLOBETONIC has looked good in his two recent wins and could complete a hat-trick, but it is a large-field handicap.  (10) KLASERIE was not disgraced when raiding the Western Cape last time and has been in good form at this track. A danger. (14) PICTURE THE MOMENT is course-and-distance suited and is not out of it. (2) PERSICA has some fair recent form in better races than this and must be considered\n\n. Race 6 (1,400\n\nm) (5) GLOBAL GODDESS looked a bit unlucky last time and could go one better. (2) MISS MILLSTREAM is clearly a lot better than her most recent run would suggest. (1) DIVINE DYNASTY was not disgraced on local debut and should have more to come. (4) ROSA DOURADA showed improvement last time\n\n. Race 7 (1,600\n\nm) (1) WAITING FOR SUMMER has been a disappointment but, if he shows his best form, he should have the measure of these rivals. (2) ASSURED is unreliable but could earn some money. (5) ATKINSON GRIMSHAW is consistent but does battle to win. (7) SECRET IS OURS needed his local debut. Should do a lot better\n\n. Race 8 (1,900\n\nm) (9) GUY ALEXANDER has fair Western Cape form and holds a winning chance. (1) JACK AND GINGER battles to finish off his races but has a winning chance over a course and distance that suits. (3) AMERICAN LANDING has not won for some time but should be competitive again. He looks to be back in form on his last-start fourth. (2) YOUNG NELSON does not always show his best form but is not out of it.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\n0\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\n0\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\n0\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

(4) DUELLONA and (1) ARCTIC FLAG ought to have come on with the benefit of a first-up run. With natural improvement, they could get into the picture. (2) COURAGEOUS and (3) DIVINE MOONLIGHT are nicely bred. Keep an eye on them.\n\nRace 2 (800m)\n\n(7) ZINOVI and (8) EXCHANGE STUDENT ran well on debut. With the former conceding 2.5kg to the latter, it could prove the telling factor. (1) BROTHERHOODOFMAGIC, (5) POMO CLAPPER and (6) QHAWE LAMI are newcomers to take note of.\n\nRace 3 (1,600m)\n\n(4) BOWL FIRST is placed in two starts. Further improvement over this trip should see him open his account. (1) BROADWAY has shown enough in three starts since returning to the Highveld to warrant respect while (9) KIT KAT KATIE is another to consider after an improved effort. (8) BRAZILIAN STORM is capable of better than her disappointing last start suggests.\n\nRace 4 (1.800m)\n\n(3) ELUSIVE SWANN bounced back to form in the 1,475m Heritage consolation. Can make it over this extended trip even if the opposition is tougher. (5) CLARKSON is closely matched on that form but can turn the tables over this distance and on ½-kg better terms. (1) KAPTEIN is overdue for a third career win. He finished second in his last three starts. (7) RULE BOOK would have tightened up after finishing alongside that rival over 1,600m recently. Value bet.\n\nRace 5 (1,800m)\n\n(3) CELESTIAL CITY got going late when second over a shorter trip last time. Major threat. (6) AFRICAN TORRENT has already won over this trip at a higher level. That ought to stand him in good stead. (4) SEQUOIA was touched off in his last two starts over 1,500m. Extra distance suits. (5) DUKE OF RAIN should get closer to that rival on 1.5kg better terms.\n\nRace 6 (1,800m)\n\n(7) STUNNING KITTEN was an authoritative winner over track and trip last time. She should go close despite a six-point penalty. (6) SUMMERLAND is 3kg better off after finishing around four lengths adrift. On these terms, she is a big threat. (3) TRUMP MY QUEEN and (5) BURMESE TIARA have been holding their form. Preference is for the former, who has been racing in stronger company.\n\nRace 7 (1,800m)\n\n(5) NONE OTHER will be suited by the step-up in trip. (7) KIND JUDY boasts solid form and ought to give her younger rival most to fear. (9) GIMMEALIGHT ran third on Jan 2. Bears watching if she takes her place in this line-up. (10) QUIET REBELLION is not without a chance on these terms either.\n\nRace 8 (1,200m)\n\n(2) FOG BANK opened his account over 1,450m at this track. Shorter trip is no issue.

Covid-19 vaccinations at polyclinics and Public Health Preparedness Clinics will continue to require an appointment, except for seniors aged 80 and above for polyclinics.\n\nWhen The Straits Times visited three JTVCs on Wednesday afternoon, groups of between 20 and 50 individuals were seen at each location.\n\nMost of the 21 individuals ST spoke to said the waiting time to receive their jab at the centres was between five and 10 minutes.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nShipping manager Henry Lee had to wait only two minutes to get his fourth jab at JTVC Ang Mo Kio to prepare for his upcoming overseas trip in February.\n\n\"The people here have done a really good job at simplifying the process. They asked me if I was here for vaccination, what type of vaccine I was taking, then channelled me to the right place. The queues moved very quickly,\" said the 60-year-old.\n\nOver at JTVC Yishun, supervisor Jack Tan, who took his fourth jab with his wife, said they decided to walk in after reading the news about the walk-in option on Tuesday night.\n\nThe 32-year-old said the walk-in option was convenient and the vaccination process seemed to be faster than the previous times when he took his jabs.\n\nAt JVTC Kaki Bukit, Mr Fathul Rahman, who is in national service, took the opportunity to get his fourth jab as he was not working on Wednesday.\n\nThe 23-year-old said he decided to take the jab after his superior advised him to do so. \"But at the same time, I also wanted to take the jab for my health and safety,\" he added.\n\nSimilarly, hairstylist Dianne He took her second booster jab at the same centre as a precautionary measure against the virus.\n\n\"It's very hard to know what this virus can do to our health in future. So the best thing to do now is to get jabbed to protect myself and my customers,\" said the 48-year-old.\n\nThough crowd levels were manageable on Wednesday, staff members at the JTVCs said they expect the crowd to pick up in the coming days.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Ministry of Health said that a longer waiting period should be expected on days when there is high demand for vaccinations, particularly on Saturdays.\n\nExpecting bigger crowds soon, a staff member at JTVC Ang Mo Kio, who declined to be named, said: \"We are preparing additional manpower, so we can cater to more people.\"\n\nLucas Tan\n\nand\n\nAmanda Lee\n\ncovid-19\n\nVACCINES\n\nSINGAPORE HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She was also laid off from her job around that time, which apparently cut her off from her social circles.\n\nTo get herself \"back in the game\", Baozhuzi set up more than 100 dates via an online dating app and would meet up to three people in a day.\n\nOf course, with those odds, there was always a chance she'd meet Mr Right. And she did - her new boyfriend is a year younger than her and is planning to start a business.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:31am\n\nS'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat\n\nMore related stories\n\nLooking back on her journey, Baozhuzi said she believes that age is not a constraint, and that everyone should set their own timelines, especially when it comes to love and marriage.\n\nPHOTO: WEIBO\n\n\"You might believe that you ought to give birth by the age of 35 or start planning for your retirement when you reach 45. But all of these [expectations] are imposed by society. Everyone's timelines are different.\"\n\n\"If you simply follow what others tell you to do with your life, you are living yours the wrong way. My story shows that you are your own ultimate source of confidence. There are no fixed rules that say you must do something when you reach 30. Don't live a life of regrets.\"\n\nReflecting on the difficult phase she went through in 2021, Baozhuzi said that people must learn to accept that bad things may happen when we least expect it.\n\n\"The earlier we realise this, the better we will be able to live our lives.
