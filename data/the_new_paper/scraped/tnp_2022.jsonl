He is good enough to score again in Race 8 at Kranji tomorrow.\n\nST PHOTO: SALWA SUANDI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 31, 2022, 05:50pm\n\nRide the Amazing Breeze\n\nThe Jerome Tan-trained Kiwi-bred will be suited by the 1,400m on the Long Course B\n\nShare this article\n\nIgnore Amazing Breeze's last run a fortnight ago.\n\nThe come-from-behind galloper was caught up on one of those rare days when the track bias was so pronounced. Both the Poly and turf tracks suited the front-running horses. Ten of the 12 winners led or raced in a forward position.\n\nAmazing Breeze, who was also my best bet then, finished strongly from way back as expected. But he could finish only fifth to Sabah Star, just 21/2 lengths behind in that Class 4 event over 1,400m on the Short Course C.\n\nBy all accounts, that was a good run. Give the Jerome Tan-trained four-year-old New Zealand-bred another chance tomorrow.\n\nIt will be another $50,000 Class 4 event over 1,400m, but this time there will be a big difference.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe race will be on the Long Course B. Not only will the track will be four metres wider and, thus not so confined, but the straight will also be about 100 metres longer to the winning post.\n\nThis will give Amazing Breeze more time to unwind.\n\nAmazing Breeze scored two starts back on Nov 27, the final day of the 2021 Singapore racing season. It was also on the Long Course B, but over 1,600m.\n\nHis win that afternoon was awesome. He competed against higher-class horses and he left them as if they were standing still. He won by seven lengths in a smart 1min 35.57sec.\n\nThat certainly left a big impression on me.\n\nThe horses he beat included Pennywise, an eight-time winner, including the 2019 Group 3 Colonial Chief Stakes, Special Ops, the Group 1 Singapore Gold Cup reserve who won his consolation race in Class 3, Group 3 Jumbo Jet Trophy winner Preditor and Gold Cup runner Strong N Powerful.\n\nPennywise franked the form in his next start by finishing a close second to stablemate Leatherhead in Class 3 over the Poly 1,600m.\n\nThat put Amazing Breeze in good stead.\n\nAlthough the bay gelding finished fifth last time, it was not a disgrace. The losing margin was not huge in a race that was not run to suit.\n\nAmazing Breeze will again be helped by apprentice jockey Akmazani Mazuki's 4kg claim. This will bring his handicapped weight down from 59kg to 55kg.\n\nOn top of that, Amazing is drawn better this time, in Gate 3, compared to No. 13 then. He need not have to cross in to the rails for the shortest route home.\n\nHe just has to jump on level terms. Akmazani then just has to relax his mount and keep himself balanced. With the wider track, he can roll out easier to get clear running for his mount to thunder home.\n\nTomorrow's field looks not as strong as in his last start. I just hope there will be no track bias for the forward horses.\n\nIf you are looking for value, I think Top Knight is it.\n\nThe Michael Clements-trained nine-time winner, including three Group 1s, appears to be coming back to hand.\n\nHis fluid closing-in third in last week's trial behind Nowyousee, who is contesting the same race tomorrow, and Makkem Lad was pleasing.\n\nHe will be racing fresh from his ninth in last November's Group 1 Singapore Gold Cup over 2,000m and the 1,400m should be just right for his comeback.\n\nLike Amazing Breeze, I am pledging my allegiance to him, instead of the top-form last-start winner Kharisma and the five-time unbeaten Lim's Kosciuszko.\n\nAlthough jockey Marc Lerner reckons Kharisma is developing into a 1,400m horse, the fact remains all his 10 successes were over 1,200m.\n\nFurthermore, the Stephen Gray-trained five-year-old will be humping the 59kg top weight, giving 4kg to Top Knight.\n\nThe Daniel Meagher-trained Lim's Kosciuszko looks a treat with only 50kg on his back, but this will be his litmus test. Not only is he rising two classes but he will also be attempting 1,400m for the first time.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/44a471a283f9d53c83992012336a1639f2c2dfd69954e4101b0c0df3c29e23c2/race_8a.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Amazing Breeze thrashing his rivals by seven lengths over 1,600m two starts back on Nov 27, the final day of the 2021 Singapore racing season.

He can go one better if ready after a rest. On pedigree, he can enjoy the sprint.\n\n(1) THE BRIEF is also overdue, has finished close to some decent types and is drawn ideally.\n\n(3) SPECIALLY SELECTED, who is also drawn well, is rated to finish ahead of him. He is a lot better than his local debut but has been off for quite a while. Watch the betting.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n(5) PASSAGE OF POWER was all at sea on debut but ran on well. He can only improve.\n\nRACE 2 (1,750M)\n\n(15) TEMPELHOFF has run three fair consecutive races and is getting there. She has a wide draw but Muzi Yeni is one of the most capable riders. She could have her time in the sun.\n\n(5) SPARKLING FLAME has been costly to follow. But she has run well and can finally break through.\n\n(7) AJRAAS may not have shown much but she is well bred and may just be looking for the longer trip.\n\n(9) WINTER MELODY and (1) SEXY SHIRAZ have shown enough to go close.\n\nRACE 3 (1,600M)\n\n(4) RUNAWAY SONG and (11) MANHATTEN CAFE have been given time to mature. Both have shown potential on debut. Runaway Song caught the eye with a strong finish over a shorter trip and should relish the step-up in trip on pedigree. Manhatten Cafe has drawn wide and will need luck in his first run back from a layoff.\n\n(2) MIGHTY MASHONA came on in his second start after being gelded. He has drawn well, so could be the biggest threat.\n\n(8) METALLIC GOLD cannot be faulted and could be looking for this longer distance.\n\n(3) QUIZ MASTER, (5) OH MY WORD ITS ROY and (6) ONE SHOT WONDER can earn.\n\nRACE 4 (1,600M)\n\n(10) SHAPE OF YOU ran two good seconds with excuses. She just needs to break well.\n\n(8 ) CONCHITA finished about 11/2 lengths behind Shape Of You and is 1/2kg better off. But, more importantly, she enjoys this longer trip and must be taken seriously.\n\n(9) HOT STRIKE is another serious contender. She looked dangerous in her last two starts and may enjoy this longer straight.\n\n(7) KAVIAN'S CARA hinted at a return to form last time. The value bet with improvement.\n\nRACE 5 (1,600M)\n\n(2) RALPH THE RASCAL could make a winning track debut, if he takes to Scottsville. He is capable of a strong finish but has to give 6.5kg to (11) KAPEN PRIDE, who is ready to win again.\n\n(10) PAPA C is an interesting runner. He had everything go wrong last time and yet did not disgrace himself. He is worth another chance with further improvement.\n\n(1) NAVAL SECRET cannot be faulted. This ultra-consistent sort has the best gate and a drop in ratings to boost his chances.\n\n(9) FARLAND is capable of fending them all off.\n\nRACE 6 (1,950M)\n\nA different tactic was tried with (1) MINGSHI last time, coming from off the pace, and it worked over the longer distance. Assuming he gets a good tempo in this big field, he could follow up from Gate 1.\n\n(8) CHEWBACA also needs to wait and come at them. Holding form, he rates a big threat.\n\n(13) A WHOLE NEW WORLD should also run a big race if the pace is good. He was not disgraced last time behind Chewbaca.\n\n(10) FINAL OCCASION has run well and could be the one that gets away from them.\n\nRACE 7 (1,200M)\n\n(8) COIN SPINNER won a decent handicap straight out of the maidens and is heading for better things. Can complete a hat-trick.\n\n(4) GO MAN GO has always looked good and earlier beat Captain Tatters at this venue. He looks to have a solid chance on his form.\n\n(6) TONIGHTSFIGHTNIGHT is deserving as he is also holding form but is dropping in distance. He may just get into it late.\n\n(1) MASHARI had a valid excuse last time. Do not take lightly.\n\n(3) CRESTED EAGLE has dropped in ratings and must be competitive at his best track.\n\nRACE 8 (1,200M)\n\n(9) MVULAZANA was just run out of it late by a more experienced sort last time. It was her first run out the maidens and she has made further progress. However, she is trying Scottsville for the first time.\n\n(13) STING RAY won better than the margin suggests when reverting to the track on which she won her maiden. Expect another strong performance.\n\n(7) FAMILY FAVOURITE has been a bit tough to follow out of the maidens but may not have enjoyed Greyville. Her rating has been dropping.

Makan community kitchen in Marine Terrace.\n\n\"I welcome today's event and am very happy. The festive spirit behind this lunch feels very real,\" said Madam Chen, who has been living in the estate for 30 years.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Tay Kia How, 65, is happy to be visiting the Marine Terrace kitchen again.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 17, 2025, 02:16am\n\nM'sia cookie supplier files report after S'pore customer allegedly ghosts her over unpaid bill\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I first participated in events organised by GoodLife! two years ago but the pandemic happened shortly after so I have not come down for almost two years,\" he said.\n\nThe lunch at the kitchen started with the tossing of yusheng, followed by a bento box meal of prawns, fish and egg noodles with vegetables.\n\nSeniors were entertained by a variety of activities, including a charades guessing game and a visit by a God of Fortune distributing red packets.\n\nThe lunch was sponsored by the philanthropic arm of CapitaLand Group, CapitaLand Hope Foundation. The foundation is also one of the sponsors of the GoodLife! Makan community kitchen.\n\nCapitaLand Hope Foundation's executive director Tan Seng Chai said: \"One of the pillars of our foundation is to help the needy elderly, so it's aligned with our purpose; building community is what we want to achieve as a foundation.\"\n\nAlso in attendance was Marine Parade GRC MP Tan See Leng, who later visited Madam Chen's home. He expressed gratitude to Montfort Care for organising the event.\n\n\"Being able to encourage and share a meal together was something we looked forward to and the enthusiasm by the elderly at the event today is a poignant reminder of the preciousness of human connection,\" he said.\n\nMontfort Care is run by social service professionals who provide community-based services with the aim of strengthening communities.\n\nThe agency launched GoodLife Makan! in January 2016. The communal kitchen allows seniors who stay alone in Marine Terrace to prepare, cook and share meals with one another. By providing them with the opportunity to socialise, it aims to improve their physical and mental wellness. The reunion lunch is one of several activities held throughout the year to engage seniors.\n\nThe founder and chief executive of Montfort Care Samuel Ng said he got the idea of holding a reunion lunch after engaging with a lonely senior more than 10 years ago. She told him that she did not have anyone to enjoy the reunion dinner with.\n\n\"New Year's Eve reunion dinner is a very important tradition (for Chinese families). I hope that we will be a pseudo-family to these stay alone seniors, and that the seniors will bring home a warmness in their hearts,\" he said.\n\nThe community kitchen was renovated and remodelled into a cafe in November 2020, with the seniors trained as baristas. The cafe works on a pay-as-you-wish basis, with customers encouraged to interact with the seniors.\n\nRyan Goh\n\nchinese new year\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 20, 2025, 02:52am\n\nStranger allegedly assaults couple near Esplanade after accusing them of filming her\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 03:45am\n\nTemple plans to hire 'burly' security guards following attack on volunteer\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 12:59am\n\nDevotee allegedly starts fight with temple volunteer after misunderstanding\n\nFeb 12, 2025, 09:40am\n\nFive vehicles destroyed after fireworks stall in Selangor catches fire\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSteady Returns Amid Volatility?

But after Singapore started relaxing its Covid-19 measures, his volume of delivery orders also started to wane.\n\n\"There is a drop of about 75 per cent compared with two years ago,\" said Mr Tan.\n\n\"I'm worried, to be honest, because we don't know whether delivery platforms can be sustained over the next five to 10 years.\"\n\nAsked about the advisory committee that has been set up to explore ways to better protect platform workers, Mr Tan said some of the measures mooted, such as work injury compensation insurance, should have been implemented sooner.\n\nMr Lee was on Monday accompanied by Mrs Lee, Transport Minister S. Iswaran and Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor, as well as National Trades Union Congress president Mary Liew and secretary-general Ng Chee Meng.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Mr Ng said he is relieved that the economy is recovering and livelihoods are improving. \"In the way ahead, we hope to be able to assist our drivers, our delivery riders... especially where there are areas where we can improve on.\"\n\nKok Yufeng\n\n, Transport Correspondent\n\nGIG ECONOMY\n\nLABOUR ISSUES\n\nLee Hsien Loong\n\nchinese new year\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:22am\n\n'It's a personal mission': Side hustles become way of life for more full-time workers\n\nMay 8, 2025, 07:05am\n\nMandatory delivery waiting bays at new private developments under study: LTA, URA\n\nDec 23, 2024, 11:59pm\n\nGojek and Tada to raise platform fees by up to 50c per trip\n\nDec 17, 2024, 08:44am\n\nOver 8,000 platform workers opt in for higher CPF contributions\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bc403f569e12aaa66bb6ac741f78d6476368e6510cc4609769d03aef4ea8a247/mi_cabby_310122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Transcab driver Steven Chua (left) receives a gift bag from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong outside Jurong Point on Jan 31, 2022.", "caption": "Transcab driver Steven Chua (left) receives a gift bag from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong outside Jurong Point on Jan 31, 2022.

She did not tell them that she was on MC.\n\nThe Malaysian woman, who is a Singapore permanent resident, also left her home the next day, the court heard.\n\nFoo, now 25, pleaded guilty in a district court on Monday (Jan 31) to two charges under the Infectious Diseases Act.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Jonathan Lee said that Foo had earlier gone to a clinic on July 14, 2020 after she complained of a sore throat and cough.\n\nA doctor then diagnosed her with an upper respiratory tract infection and issued her an MC, stressing that she was \"required by law to stay home for five days\".\n\nThe doctor also told Foo that she was not supposed to leave her home for any purpose except to seen urgent medical attention. Foo accepted the MC and understood the terms.\n\nDespite these, she left her Bedok North flat at around 9.15am on July 17, 2020 and walked her son to a nearby PAP Community Foundation Sparkletots pre-school.\n\nAfter that, Foo walked home before she took a private hire car to a block of flats in MacPherson Lane at around 3.30pm that day.\n\nAbout two hours later, she took another private-hire car to Great World City where she met her friends for a movie.\n\nShe took a taxi back to her Bedok North home when the movie ended, only to reoffend at around 3.30am next day.\n\nThis time, she took a private-hire car to the MacPherson Lane flat and returned to her Bedok North home about seven hours later.\n\nCourt documents do not disclose how her offences came to light but when caught, she initially denied leaving her home during the duration of her MC.\n\nThe DPP said: \"She only admitted after (she) was confronted with the evidence. The accused admitted that she knew that it was an offence to leave her (home) during the duration of the MC but she 'did not think too much about it' when she did so.\"\n\nOn Monday, defence lawyer Mohamed Arshad told the court that according to a psychiatrist, Foo was likely to be suffering from an adjustment disorder at the time of the offences.\n\nDistrict Judge Marvin Bay then called for a report to assess her suitability for a mandatory treatment order (MTO).\n\nOffenders given an MTO will undergo treatment for their mental conditions in lieu of jail time.\n\nThe judge said: \"I should make it clear that the offences involving breaches of quarantine orders...are extremely serious...and deterrent sentences are generally meted out to discourage others from committing similar offences.\n\n\"Nevertheless, it may be expedient to investigate further where an expert has expressed a view of the accused suffering from a mental or psychological condition that he believes to have likely contributed to her offending.\"\n\nFoo is expected to be sentenced on March 9.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\n, Court Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/95750b98d8c0f622b72dd558004e69810763578c84329ee559adddc07355fc1a/af_michelle_310122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Michelle Foo Shi Ching on June 10, 2021.

They are now based in five locations - Stockholm, Munich, Toronto, Silicon Valley and New York.\n\nAn NUS spokesman said its student exchanges also resumed in January this year, with some 1,000 students travelling this semester.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 19, 2025, 12:46am\n\nNUS retains 8th spot, NTU climbs to 12th in latest global university rankings\n\nMore related stories\n\nSimilarly, about 450 students from Singapore Management University (SMU) are going on exchange, with some flying out as early as last December. It has resumed exchange programmes with about 95 per cent of its 220 partner universities across 45 countries and regions, said a spokesman.\n\nSMU has seen more interest from students - 700 have applied from last December - 30 per cent higher than pre-Covid-19 numbers.\n\nNine students from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) began their eight-month immersion programme at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States in January this year, as part of SUTD's technology entrepreneurship programme.\n\nAn SUTD spokesman said it has partnerships with 21 countries, and that before Covid-19, it would have sent about 73 per cent of its students in a cohort for programmes abroad. The institution has a cohort size of about 500 students.\n\nProfessor Tan Ooi Kiang, deputy provost for education at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), said 1,800 students have applied for exchange in the upcoming academic year, which starts in August.\n\nThis is about 60 per cent of the number of applications the university would receive before the pandemic, he noted. NTU has overseas tie-ups with more than 330 partner universities in over 40 countries.\n\nThe Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) has, since last December, opened applications for overseas programmes such as work-study stints, immersion and student exchanges, which are expected to resume from the first quarter of this year.\n\nA handful of Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) students left in January for overseas work attachments or semester exchange programmes. Most of its overseas programmes are still being held virtually, through workshops or group discussions, a spokesman said.\n\n\"Partnership discussions on overseas academic exchanges are still ongoing, with many partner universities in Asia-Pacific remaining cautious on student mobility programmes,\" he added.\n\nIn the months ahead, SMU aims to match 50 students to companies as part of a global innovation immersion programme, a three-month internship with high-growth start-ups in hot spots like China, South-east Asia, the US and Europe.\n\nThe format could be a mix of physical overseas internships or remote attachments for cities with travel restrictions.\n\nLast year, 45 students took part in the programme, conducted virtually by the SMU Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship.\n\nSMU third-year student Clarissa Neo, 22, started her exchange at Oregon State University in the US in January.\n\n\"From the process of application to the flight, there was always this uncertainty about whether the exchange would be confirmed or cancelled,\" said the double major in politics, law and economics, and finance.\n\n\"I was a bit hesitant because of the Covid-19 situation in the US and the Omicron variant, but I still wanted the experience because I think it's a valuable opportunity.\"\n\nShe chose her current exchange university as she has family and friends in California, which is near Oregon state. \"If anything happens, like border controls, I won't be stranded.\"\n\n\"I wanted to experience student life overseas, meet students from other countries and backgrounds, and learn to live independently,\" said Ms Neo, who is exploring a three-month global internship that SMU offers, in China or Hong Kong.\n\nThis internship will be after her exchange stint, if she applies for it and is successful.\n\n\"It depends on the travel rules and my personal timeline, but for now I'm very grateful to be on exchange,\" she added.\n\nAmelia Teng\n\n, Education Correspondent\n\nUNIVERSITIES - OVERSEAS\n\nUNIVERSITIES - SINGAPORE\n\nSTUDENTS\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:39pm\n\nAnxious Harvard-bound Singaporeans press ahead with plans, even as some still do not have visas\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nS'poreans looking to pursue studies in US can still submit visa applications: US Embassy\n\nNov 24, 2024, 10:55pm\n\nTony Leung Chiu Wai gets honorary doctorate from HK university\n\nDec 21, 2023, 12:51am\n\nS'pore boy, 13, graduates from top Australian university with perfect GPA\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cc2ff38e5b2b442b441cdb6ec8cd05b223a88db1041f83f4fb1cc3116ebc3bf4/fhclarissa310122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "SMU third-year student Clarissa Neo started her exchange at Oregon State University in the US in January.", "caption": "SMU third-year student Clarissa Neo started her exchange at Oregon State University in the US in January.

In the meantime, students will continue to support overseas beneficiaries virtually, such as through academic and enrichment programmes and skills training.\n\nAmelia Teng\n\n, Education Correspondent\n\nUNIVERSITIES - OVERSEAS\n\nUNIVERSITIES - SINGAPORE\n\ncovid-19\n\nTRAVEL AND LEISURE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:39pm\n\nAnxious Harvard-bound Singaporeans press ahead with plans, even as some still do not have visas\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nS'poreans looking to pursue studies in US can still submit visa applications: US Embassy\n\nNov 24, 2024, 10:55pm\n\nTony Leung Chiu Wai gets honorary doctorate from HK university\n\nDec 21, 2023, 12:51am\n\nS'pore boy, 13, graduates from top Australian university with perfect GPA\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1d94cb5fc384a3ce50e208dd4ce0b7ea007ed5c0beb0202a2d6f8263fd6e4bac/fhstudents310122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The overseas programmes of all universities in Singapore were suspended from March 2020 because of Covid-19.

All height-based OAL activities\n\nremain suspended following the incident.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 30, 2025, 11:36pm\n\nACS (I) cement status as squash kings with fifth straight B Div title\n\nMore related stories\n\nMOE will also work with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth to study ways to raise the quality and safety standards of programmes offered by providers of OAL activities. More details will be announced when ready, added MOE.\n\nThe incident at Safra Yishun occurred a year after\n\na Primary 4 pupil from Concord Primary School fell while doing a zip line activity\n\nin the school as part of her co-curricular activity.\n\nFollowing the 2020 incident, all height-based activities in schools were suspended. The suspension was extended until January 2021 owing to the Covid-19 situation.\n\nMOE also put in place additional protocols to make zip line activities safer at all schools, like having an additional instructor check that everything is in accordance with the safety checklist before a participant is allowed to get on the zip line.\n\nSchools must ensure that vendors' instructors have the relevant certifications before they are hired for such activities. At least one certified person with the required qualifications must be on site to handle rescue situations.\n\nMultiple advancements in the sector have also been made in the last month, such as a national training syllabus for instructors of rope confidence courses launched by the Singapore Sport Climbing and Mountaineering Federation on Jan 18.\n\nThe move will provide a common syllabus for training and certification for practitioners and train instructors to assist rescue from a height, as well as safely dispatch participants.\n\nCourses to train participants for the roles of supervisors, instructors and specialists range in duration from one to three days. The certification will remain optional for practitioners, depending on the facilities they operate in.\n\nThe Outdoor Learning and Adventure Education Association (OLAE) also announced on Jan 18 that it is reviewing its standard of practices and accreditation frameworks. It is the largest provider of outdoor education activities in Singapore and represents 24 organisation members.\n\nThe association is in discussions with public and private stakeholders such as the National Youth Council-Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) and local and international experts.\n\nThis comes three years after it launched its first industry-standard set of protocols in 2018 to provide operational and competency guidelines as well as technical references for OAE activities.\n\nOLAE honorary secretary Delane Lim said it was an opportune time for a review of industry standards and protocols as the sector is expected to see a rebound from its current lull in the next two years.\n\nOBS executive director Nicholas Conceicao added: \"Together with the wider outdoor adventure education community, stakeholders and partners, we can nurture a community of practitioners to ensure quality consistency for programmes, improved operating procedures as well as robust infrastructure and governance systems.\"\n\nSchool Sports\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 10, 2025, 11:32pm\n\nMarsiling Secondary School clinch B Div sepak takraw title\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 11:47pm\n\nS'pore Sports School clinch back-to-back titles in B Div water polo\n\nAug 21, 2024, 12:53am\n\nNanyang Girls' High retain C Div basketball title\n\nAug 16, 2024, 12:19am\n\nMethodist Girls' School claim first C Div netball title since 1998\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nFree WiFi 7 router, installation & more with 3Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5bc64f7955a14884a6047311d07f5c324d03c2ef28a4d95b1674ab1c2cd94196/fhoal310122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "All height-based OAL activities remain suspended following an incident at Safra Yishun.", "caption": "All height-based OAL activities remain suspended following an incident at Safra Yishun.

the Divide, will spend the Chinese New Year holiday in remand after the High Court on Monday (Jan 31) denied her bid to be released on bail.\n\nKoh, 46, was charged last Friday with conspiring with general practitioner Jipson Quah to make false representations to the Ministry of Health (MOH) that people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine, when they were not.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors, in arguing against Koh's bid to be granted bail, revealed that at least 20 patients were involved in the alleged conspiracy, and that ongoing investigations have revealed offences relating to remote pre-event testing and false vaccine exemption letters.\n\nJustice Vincent Hoong agreed with the prosecutors that Koh's lack of cooperation with police investigators contributed to the need to remand her for investigations.\n\n\"I agree with the prosecution that it is precisely due to the applicant's efforts to frustrate and impede the investigations, which have significantly contributed to the need for this further period of remand,\" he said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe judge noted that her \"belligerence, obstructive behaviour and lack of cooperation with investigations\" during the initial period of remand, which started on Jan 23, was \"appalling\".\n\nKoh tore up a police statement on her fifth day in remand, tore up the charge that was read to her last Friday, in what the judge said was a \"blatant disrespect for the investigative and court processes\".\n\nShe also repeatedly complained of anxiety and panic attacks but refused medical attention.\n\nJustice Hoong said: \"The consequent delays to investigations are no doubt caused by her active and deliberate attempts to frustrate those very investigations.\"\n\nThe judge said Koh's application for bail was \"wholly devoid of merit\".\n\nHe noted that she has been charged with a non-bailable offence, and the onus was on her to provide evidence to satisfy the court that bail should be granted.\n\nKoh's lawyer, Mr Clarence Lun, had raised Koh's medical condition, of hyperthyroidism, as a ground to support her application.\n\nBut Justice Hoong said this was an insufficient reason for bail to be granted.\n\nHe noted that Koh has been assessed to be fit for discharge on Monday, and is scheduled for a biopsy procedure in two to three weeks.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nHealing the Divide founder Iris Koh hospitalised, faces more serious charge\n\n2

investigations.\"\n\nDuring the hearing that was held via video conference, Koh, who was muted, could be seen raising her hand and appeared to be speaking but was ignored by the judge, who noted that she has legal representation.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-yue told the court that the police have been accommodating to Koh and offered medical attention where necessary, but the evidence showed that she was not cooperating.\n\nGiving a day by day account of her behaviour during her remand, the DPP said: \"She has demonstrated a pattern of behaviour that shows her determination not to cooperate.\"\n\nOn Day 1, Koh complained of anxiety and panic attacks but refused to be admitted to the Institute of Mental Health.\n\nOn Day 4, she spent two hours making a police report against the investigation officer.\n\nOn Day 5, she refused medical attention despite complaining of discomfort, and also tore up the statement taken from her.\n\nOn Day 6, she was warded for observation at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).\n\nOn Day 7, she refused to be discharged despite being assessed fit to do so, and shewas charged in hospital.\n\nThe DPP said that when the charge was read to Koh at the SGH last Friday, she shouted her refusal to accept it, hurled a vulgarity at the investigation officer and tore up the charge.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nHealing the Divide founder Iris Koh, doc

DPP noted that the other two accused persons charged in relation to the conspiracy - Quah and his assistant Thomas Chua Cheng Soon, 40 - have been cooperative and have been granted bail.\n\n\"As we speak... arrangements are being made for their release,\" he said.\n\nSelina Lum\n\n, Senior Law Correspondent\n\ncovid-19\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncoronavirus\n\nvaccination\n\nFraud\n\nShare this

The public should also avoid making any fund transfer if the caller is of dubious identity.\n\nThey are also advised to call a trusted friend or talk to a relative before they act, as they may be overwhelmed by emotion and make wrong judgments.\n\nThose with information on such scams can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000 or dial 999.\n\nFor scam-related advice, the public can call the anti-scam helpline on 1800-722-6688 or visit this website.\n\nBy\n\nAng Qing\n\nRead articles by Ang Qing\n\nSCAMS\n\npolice\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:21am\n\nPolice probe 536 over scams, unlicensed moneylending\n\nJul 12, 2025, 04:11am\n\nMore NSFs may be deployed to fight scams online, say police\n\nJul 10, 2025, 07:48am\n\nMan charged over $80,000 money mule activities\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nEnjoy all-inclusive 5Gbps Broadband with WiFi 7 router & more\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0645807b552f811f5d778bd91d58a4dbcc2b1a43cb153f2fc4dd03d145de2912/af_screenshotscoll_310122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A screenshot of the scammer demanding for money from the victim's family (left) and false credentials of China officials sent by the scammers.", "caption": "A screenshot of the scammer demanding for money from the victim's family (left) and false credentials of China officials sent by the scammers.

We cannot let our guard down but we don't need to be too pessimistic.\"\n\nMr Lee was at Jurong Point to thank food delivery riders, taxi drivers, and mall workers for providing essential services during the Chinese New Year period.\n\nVisiting workers during the festive season is an annual tradition for the labour movement, and is usually held on the first day of Chinese New Year.\n\nThis year, the visit was held on the eve so that Mr Lee could speak with food delivery riders while most eateries were still open.\n\nMr Lee's visit was held on the eve so he could speak with food delivery riders while most eateries were still open.

They are considered self-employed, and do not receive employee benefits from the companies they work for.\n\nYet, these workers are for all intents and purposes \"just like employees\", Mr Lee had said in his speech last year.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nReopening plans ahead of CNY thwarted by Covid-19 Omicron variant: President Halimah\n\nCovid-19 pandemic, border restrictions may hinder Singapore's economic recovery: Experts\n\nThe committee is looking into concerns over workplace injury insurance, housing and retirement support, legal rights as well as union representation.\n\nIn November last year, it issued a public consultation paper to seek feedback and received over 1,300 submissions within a month, including from platform companies and workers.\n\nThe committee seeks to complete its work by the second half of this year and present its recommendations to the authorities.\n\nKok Yufeng\n\n, Transport Correspondent\n\nLee Hsien Loong\n\nchinese new year\n\nGIG ECONOMY\n\nLABOUR ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 23, 2025, 06:18am\n\nGE2025: Ang Mo Kio GRC to see three-cornered fight for the first time\n\nApr 22, 2025, 07:50am\n\nPuan Noor Aishah, S'pore's first first lady, remembered for grace and service\n\nApr 14, 2025, 11:52pm\n\nSM Lee: S'pore no longer operating in stable external environment\n\nMar 23, 2025, 03:50am\n\nHonour Lee Kuan Yew's legacy not just in remembrance, but in action: PM Wong\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nExperience ultra smooth 10Gbps Broadband + WiFi 7 connectivity\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/35eefa771ad6b2d391b9dcb23f402d8edeb5da0e9ed488089f4b867e188c8b67/aapmlee.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Lee was at Jurong Point to thank food delivery riders, taxi drivers, and mall workers for providing essential services during the Chinese New Year period.", "caption": "Mr Lee was at Jurong Point to thank food delivery riders, taxi drivers, and mall workers for providing essential services during the Chinese New Year period.

We want to make Chinese New Year as memorable as we can for the residents despite the situation,\" he said.\n\nThe nursing home, which has more than 270 residents, has put in place strict measures to safeguard the seniors. Staff members are assigned to separate wings with no intermingling between groups.\n\nWhite fungus soup, chicken cutlet and shiitake mushrooms are some of the items on the menu for residents, who will also be able to take part in the virtual tossing of yusheng using a lohei app.\n\n\"Our biggest concern is that cases may climb during the festive period and our staff will be affected. In the meantime, we have to carry on,\" Mr Ardi added.\n\nAt All Saints Home, which houses about 700 residents across four centres in Tampines, Yishun, Jurong East and Hougang, staff members have been helping seniors keep in touch with their families through video calls since the suspension was announced.\n\nStaff and residents will be treated to food items like crab meatballs, Japanese style cod fish and herbal chicken for Chinese New Year.\n\nAs a personal tribute to residents, the home's chief executive, Mr Samuel Tan, plans to serenade them with classic Chinese New Year songs on the piano next week.\n\nMr Tan, who thanked donors, volunteers and staff for their efforts to support the seniors, said: \"The suspension of visitation to nursing homes during the Chinese New Year period will undoubtedly dampen the spirits of our residents. However, this is necessary for their protection.\n\n\"I hope my performances, with the proper safety measures, will contribute in a small way in lifting up their spirits and bringing them cheer.\"\n\nIn previous years, 62-year-old resident Pang Chye Heng used to enjoy dragon dances, karaoke sessions and movie screenings during Chinese New Year. Mr Pang, a resident at All Saints Home (Hougang), was also able to leave the home to join the rest of his family for a steamboat feast and collect red packets.\n\nHe said: \"This year's celebrations may not be as festive due to the visitation restrictions, but I support the new suspension during this period so we can curb the spread of this virus and keep nursing home residents safe.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCelebrating Chinese New Year: From tiger-painting contests to sewing new clothes\n\nOrganisations lend a hand to spring-clean homes this Chinese New Year\n\nMalavika Menon\n\nNURSING HOMES\n\ncoronavirus\n\nchinese new year\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 24, 2024, 06:23am\n\nMiniature horses bring joy to nursing home residents\n\nOct 31, 2024, 10:23am\n\nSeniors with swallowing difficulties try special dim sum\n\nAug 1, 2023, 01:09am\n\nNurse stays by side of the dying, which she could not do for her dad\n\nJul 11, 2023, 12:47am\n\nPractice makes purrfect: Cats help nursing home residents improve their mobility\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

By July 2022, its entire fleet of cars must be below 10 years old.\n\nNew drivers signing up to the platform can register only newer cars.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 18, 2025, 11:33pm\n\nGrabCab to launch in July with 40 new Toyota Prius taxis for a start\n\nMore related stories\n\nGrab's existing drivers were informed of the deadline extension last October. Those who continue driving a vehicle aged 12 years or above after the deadline will have their accounts temporarily deactivated, which will prevent them from accepting or receiving jobs on the platform.\n\nGrab driver Chua Eng Teck, 66, said he is unable to switch his 12-year-old Toyota Corolla Altis - which he bought over a year ago on hire purchase - without incurring a loss, so he will likely move on to another ride hailing company by May 1.\n\nMr Chua had joined Grab's platform in 2018 after a stint with Uber, which shuttered its Singapore operation that same year.\n\nMs Yuki Leow, 42, sold her nine-year old Honda Fit last year to rent a new Toyota Prius Plus after Grab announced the deadline to phase out older cars in its fleet.\n\nWhile she said it is definitely more expensive to rent than to use her old car, using a younger car has its upsides.\n\n\"The passengers definitely prefer travelling in a newer car and the new car doesn't give me any problems,\" she added.\n\nGrab is the only ride-hailing platform to stipulate the maximum age of cars that its drivers can use to provide their service.\n\nThe Land Transport Authority does not mandate a maximum age for such vehicles.\n\nIt does, however, require the cars on the platforms to achieve a 90 per cent first inspection passing rate (FIPR). Failure to comply will mean losing the Ride-Hail Service Operator Licence.\n\nIn 2021, the FIPR for taxis at year seven (they have a legal lifespan of eight) was 99.4 per cent.\n\nWithout giving the exact passing rate, Grab said its FIPR is \"maintained above the standard set by the LTA\", adding that the requirement is important to ensure safety and overall service quality.\n\nLee Nian Tjoe\n\n, Senior Transport Correspondent\n\ngrab\n\nCOE\n\nTAXIS\n\nLTA\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 3, 2025, 08:16am\n\nGrab driver's $60-a-week gesture is winning hearts in Singapore\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nVisually impaired users in Singapore may soon use voice commands to book a Grab ride\n\nApr 2, 2025, 06:31am\n\nGrab set to become Singapore's sixth taxi operator\n\nMar 10, 2025, 06:51am\n\nGrab signs new MOUs in ongoing exploration of self-driving technology\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d8e2e799e62b4a0823279a7ecffff4fcb5b330a8ac9d0a7da461a81586df318c/ac_grabcar_310122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The six-month extension will give Grab drivers more time to switch to cars that are below 10 years old, the spokesman said.", "caption": "The six-month extension will give Grab drivers more time to switch to cars that are below 10 years old, the spokesman said.

Shanmugam revealed last year in a written response to a parliamentary question on scams.\n\nIt was nearly triple the $89.7 million stolen in 2016.\n\nThe authorities have acknowledged the difficulties in tackling the problem - many of the perpetrators are based overseas and when the monies have been transferred, recovery has been hard.\n\nHowever, the police have scored some success.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 06:24am\n\nMan charged for collecting $150k in cash, jewellery for scammers\n\nMore related stories\n\nTheir Anti-Scam Centre said that of the 7,400 scam reports it received in the first half of last year involving losses of more than $201.7 million, the authorities were able to recover $66 million.\n\nInternet love scams have remained one of the most lucrative scams in Singapore since 2011.\n\nThe amount that victims were cheated of grew from $2.3 million in 2011 to $8.8 million in 2014 and $33.1 million in 2020.\n\nThe police said 90 per cent of the scams in Singapore originated from overseas.\n\nThey added that they have worked closely with foreign law enforcement agencies to monitor and share information on emerging scams and conduct joint operations to cripple syndicates.\n\n\"Last year, the Anti-Scam Division (ASD) of the Commercial Affairs Department worked with the Royal Malaysia Police, Hong Kong Police Force and China Taiwan police administration. Sixteen transnational syndicates perpetrating job scams, Internet love scams and impersonation scams were busted,\" the police said. ASD oversees the Anti-Scam Centre.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Deputy Assistant Commissioner (DAC) Aileen Yap said the joint operations led to the arrest of 230 suspected syndicate members. DAC Yap is the assistant director of the Commercial Affairs Department's ASD.\n\nIn Singapore, the police also arrested and investigated more than 7,000 scammers and money mules last year.\n\nSome are believed to have rented out their bank accounts to scammers or assisted them by carrying out bank transfers and withdrawals.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has not slowed down the syndicates, with more victims falling for job scams, the Anti-Scam Centre said.\n\nIn the first six months of last year, there were 658 cases of job scams - a 16-fold increase from just 40 in the same period in 2020.\n\n\"Scammers are quick to adapt their tactics and scripts to keep up with the current climate.\n\n\"During the pandemic, scammers have impersonated government officials to phish for personal particulars from victims,\" the police said.\n\nCriminologist Olivia Choy of Nanyang Technological University's psychology department, said that financial and emotional stress triggered by the pandemic could have made people more vulnerable to scams.\n\n\"Such stressors can lead to poorer decision-making, and with more people going online for work and leisure, there is an influx of potential victims for opportunistic scammers,\" she added.\n\n• Additional reporting by David Sun\n\nWong Shiying\n\nSCAMS\n\ncrime\n\npolice\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:21am\n\nPolice probe 536 over scams, unlicensed moneylending\n\nJul 12, 2025, 04:11am\n\nMore NSFs may be deployed to fight scams online, say police\n\nJul 10, 2025, 07:48am\n\nMan charged over $80,000 money mule activities\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nExperience ultra smooth 10Gbps Broadband + WiFi 7 connectivity\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bc235e1dead7c9a415dd244103d92ec9fb3e198c49df4e1c2753506a1e620d80/mi_scam_270122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Victims in Singapore have lost at least $1 billion to various scams between 2016 and mid-2021.

I just followed instructions because I thought that was my only hope,\" she said.\n\nEven as Iris did their bidding and transferred different sums, including $6,700 at one go, the scammers told her she had done the job wrongly or was too slow.\n\nIn a few hours, she had spent more than $17,000 \"buying\" desktops, watches, gym equipment, video games and jewellery from six merchants.\n\nIris pleaded to the WhatsApp group administrator directly but was ignored.\n\nShe finally lodged a police report on Sept 17 last year and told her fiance about the incident.\n\nThey decided to postpone the wedding indefinitely.\n\n\"I lost almost everything I'd been saving up for my wedding. I was naive and too eager to make money that it didn't even cross my mind that it could be a scam,\" said Iris.\n\n\"The toughest part has been keeping this a secret from my family. I'm too ashamed to tell them and I don't want them to worry.\n\n\"I can only tell them I'm putting off the wedding due to Covid-19.\"\n\nThe Singapore-headquartered Qoo10 said in its website that it is aware of job scams where fraudsters pretend to be its business partners.\n\nIt clarified that it is not associated with any recruitment agency on SMS, Facebook or Instagram and has urged customers to report these advertisements to the police.\n\nSix anti-scam principles to follow\n\nThe Home Team Behavioural Sciences Centre developed a 6S Anti-Scam Self-Protection Principles to help Singaporeans defend themselves against scams. They are:\n\n1. Spot the signs - Recognise the tactics that scammers use.\n\n2. Stop and think - Ask yourself or others if a statement, message or job offer could be true.\n\n3. Slow down, don't rush - Do not rush into providing your personal or banking details.\n\n4. Speak to others - Check with others to verify the authenticity of a claim before doing anything.\n\n5. Safeguard personal details and passwords - Never disclose personal information, even if the request appears to be legitimate.\n\n6. Seek help - Talk to friends or family members for advice or support if you have been impacted by a scam.\n\nHelplines\n\nAnti-Scam Hotline: 1800-722-6688 (9am - 5pm)\n\nNational Care Hotline: 1800-202-6868 (8am - 12am)\n\nMental well-being\n\nInstitute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222 (24 hours)\n\nSamaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444 (24 hours) /1-767 (24 hours)\n\nSingapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-283-7019\n\nSilver Ribbon Singapore: 6386-1928\n\nTinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788\n\nCommunity Health Assessment Team 6493-6500/1\n\nCounselling\n\nTOUCHline (Counselling): 1800-377-2252\n\nTOUCH Care Line (for seniors, caregivers): 6804-6555\n\nCare Corner Counselling Centre: 1800-353-5800\n\nOnline resources\n\nscamalert.sg\n\nscamshield.org.sg\n\nncpc.org.sg\n\nmindline.sg\n\nstayprepared.sg/mymentalhealth\n\neC2.sg\n\ntinklefriend.sg\n\nchat.mentalhealth.sg\n\nWong Shiying\n\nand\n\nDavid Sun\n\nSCAMS\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\n191\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:21am\n\nPolice probe 536 over scams, unlicensed moneylending\n\n3\n\nJul 12, 2025, 04:11am\n\nMore NSFs may be deployed to fight scams online, say police\n\n1\n\nJul 10, 2025, 07:48am\n\nMan charged over $80,000 money mule activities\n\n1\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c76cadb9fbea930d336048bb240b59752210a57e4142193f317988180505992d/ak_scam_280122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/156b2b63ab699e0da0faf5b6b6e750c0420271a7058c6c3fea38fc7f066c1ec0/st-statecourts-placeholder2.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man charged for collecting $150k in cash, jewellery for scammers", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The chunks of meat and fat also brown up nicely, but are a bit salty.\n\n\"We have a reduced salt version as well,\" said Mr Vincent Poulichet, 32, the company's scientific expert and other cofounder.\n\nThe lardons received a C rating on France's \"Nutri-Score\" food health rating scale - a middle score on the A to E ranking.\n\n\"Worse than broccoli, but better than pork lardons,\" the company notes wryly on its website.\n\nStartups and established food manufacturers alike have been rolling out a variety of products that aim to replace beef, chicken and pork with plant-based ingredients.\n\nBut making faux bacon taste like the real thing is another challenge.\n\nMr Ethan Brown, the head of industry leader Beyond Meat, told the Wall Street Journal last year that making bacon, steak and raw chicken were all the \"holy grail\".\n\nA growing number of consumers are seeking to reduce or eliminate meat from their diets over concerns including animal rights and the industry's impact on the environment.\n\nAccording to a 2021 report by market research firm Euromonitor International, more than one in four consumers globally say they are trying to limit their meat intake, in addition to the 10 per cent of people who are vegetarian or vegan.\n\nLondon-based market research firm Fairfield expects the market for plant-based meat to grow by nearly 19 per cent annually between 2021 and 2026, to hit US$13 billion (S$17.7 billion).\n\n5,000 trials\n\nLa Vie's founders, who created their company in 2019, believe conquering consumers on taste is the real key to success.\n\n\"After three years of research and 5,000 trials we succeeded in the somewhat crazy challenge of reproducing the taste of pork,\" said Mr Schweitzer, 34.\n\nLa Vie co-founders, CTO Vincent Poulichet (left) and CEO Nicolas Schweitzer. PHOTO: AFP\n\nThe fat in La Vie's imitation bacon and lardons is made mostly from sunflower oil and specially-treated water.\n\nThe meat part contains soy protein, salt, natural colourants derived from radish skins and tomatoes, and natural flavours.\n\nIt was after testing La Vie's products at home in the United States that Portman, who won the Best Actress Oscar for the psychological drama Black Swan (2010), joined the company's financial backers.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nScience Talk: Bold and brilliant bet on making meat from plants\n\nNew plant-based meat brands hit the market, some developed in Singapore\n\n\"It was by giving people a taste of our products that we managed to put together this extraordinary round of financing,\" said Mr Schweitzer. \"Right away, investors said, 'Oh, yeah!'\"\n\nVenture capitalists like Oyster Bay, Seventure and Partech joined the funding round, as did the owners of several successful European startups such as Oatly, Vinted, Back Market and BlaBlaCar.\n\nBritish and US markets\n\nIn addition to taste, La Vie believes its bacon is healthier for people, the planet, and of course pigs.\n\nThe company says its products contain less than a tenth the saturated fat of real bacon, and their production has fewer carbon emissions and uses less water.\n\nIn addition to taste, La Vie believes its bacon is healthier for people, the planet, and pigs. PHOTO: AFP\n\nLa Vie's imitation lardons are already on sale at Carrefour shops, and it aims to get them on the shelves of all major supermarkets in France in 2022.\n\nIt also sees vegan and vegetarian restaurants as key to getting more potential clients to taste its products.\n\nLa Vie aims to get its products on British shelves by April and then rapidly enter the key US market as well.\n\nLa Vie, which has partnered with an established cold cuts and prepared foods manufacturer, plans to quickly double its staff to 60 employees.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nTrends to watch in 2022: Plant-based options grow\n\nHow S'pore is serving up sustainable future-ready foods\n\nFrance\n\nFOOD AND BEVERAGE SECTOR\n\nORGANIC FOOD\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 21, 2024, 08:23am\n\nTeam Singapore's monumental effort for Olympic glory\n\nJul 15, 2024, 01:47pm\n\nBTS singer Jin takes part in Paris Olympics torch relay\n\nJun 19, 2024, 04:13pm\n\nTeammates hopeful Mbappe can make Friday's match against Dutch\n\nJun 17, 2024, 01:37pm\n\nMichelle Yeoh and Jean Todt celebrate 20 years as a couple\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with StarHub all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9bed715f9d9efe387c70d2b95786e1d3113a3a78e1929e68216e2e5b1308d93f/nf-fauxrk-280122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Paris-based company La Vie recently raised 25 million euros (S$37.8 million) from investment funds and climate-conscious celebrities.", "caption": "Paris-based company La Vie recently raised 25 million euros (S$37.8 million) from investment funds and climate-conscious celebrities.

They slow down or become immobile when temps drop into the 40s (4 deg C to 9 deg C). They may fall from trees, but they are not dead,\" the service said on Twitter.\n\nTemperatures in South Florida reached a low of 25 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 3.8 deg C) on Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service, and high temperatures on Sunday were expected to remain in the upper 50s to low 60s.\n\nThe nation's North-east was walloped on Saturday by a deadly winter storm that prompted several states to declare emergencies and forced the cancellation of more than 1,400 flights.\n\nZoologist Stacey Cohen, a reptile expert at Palm Beach Zoo in Florida, explained the iguana phenomenon to television station WPBF.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 23, 2024, 11:43pm\n\nSean Combs' ex-wife: Domestic violence broke me\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Their bodies basically start to shut down where they lose their functions and so they are up in the trees on the branches sleeping and then because it gets so cold, they lose that ability to hang on and then they do fall out of trees a lot,\" Ms Cohen said.\n\nAlthough most of the reptiles will likely survive this period of immobilisation, Ms Cohen said freezing temperatures were a threat to their survival and pointed to a cold snap in 2010 that wiped out a large number of the population.\n\n\"Cold is a very, very life-threatening thing for them because they are from parts of Central and South America close to the equator where it always stays very warm,\" she said.\n\nGreen iguanas are not native to Florida, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. They were accidentally introduced as stowaways in cargo ships and are considered an invasive species.\n\nThey can weigh up to 17 pounds (7.5kg) and measure over five feet (1.5m) in length.\n\nThese iguanas are not the first animals to suffer the cold this winter.

About one quarter of complaints against spas and beauty salons were related to pressure sales tactics and misleading claims.\n\nComplaints about pressure sales tactics include beauty salons not allowing consumers to leave the premises unless they purchased beauty packages and performing treatments on consumers without their consent and charging them afterwards.\n\nMisleading claims include beauty salons deceiving consumers on the number of sessions in the packages and how certain treatments can cure or alleviate per-existing health ailments.\n\nCase also saw 2,206 complaints relating to online purchases in 2021, accounting for approximately 14 per cent of total complaints received.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCase issues alert against renovation contractor after getting 30 complaints\n\nMore should be done to safeguard consumers when they make prepayments: Case\n\nThis is a 49 per cent decrease from the 4,366 complaints received in 2020, largely due to a drop in complaints related to face masks, hand sanitisers, airline tickets, and tour packages.\n\nThe two most common types of e-commerce complaints in 2021 pertained to defective or non-conforming goods and delivery issues such as delayed deliveries, incomplete deliveries and wrong deliveries.\n\nConsumers also suffered more than $520,000 in prepayment losses in 2021, a sharp increase from $190,000 reported by consumers in 2020.\n\nThe beauty and bridal industries saw the greatest amount of prepayment losses in 2021.

Afterwards, they kept in touch and he continued to mentor her.\n\nHowever, more than a decade later, in the course of divorce proceedings, Mr Ramasamy's wife staked a claim on the Jalan Rengkam terraced house, which she alleged he had bought with the sales proceeds of their matrimonial Housing Board flat.\n\nAlthough Mr Ramasamy was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, he agreed with Ms Yeow that he was holding her share in the house on trust for her.\n\nLast April, the High Court ruled in favour of Ms Yeow after studying the evidence, and found that she held a 73 per cent share of the house, while Mr Ramasamy had a 27 per cent stake.\n\nMr Ramasamy's wife, Madam Vishnumangalam Renuka, represented by lawyers Seenivasan Lalita and Lim Ying Ying, then appealed to the Appellate Division of the High Court, which made clear that \"an appellate court should be slow to disturb findings of fact by the court of first instance\".\n\nBut the appellate court found the judge had placed too much weight on certain evidence, without considering or giving due weight to other relevant evidence in concluding that an oral agreement existed between the pair.\n\nWriting on the court's behalf, Judge of the Appellate Division Woo Bih Li said undue emphasis had been placed on Ms Yeow's monthly money transfers to Mr Ramasamy as evidence of an agreement between them.\n\nIt said such transfers were not necessarily part of their alleged oral agreement and could be for some other purpose, noting Ms Yeow had been lending significant sums of money to Mr Ramasamy, for instance.\n\nAmong other things, the court noted they had agreed the purchase was a joint investment but Mr Ramasamy's affidavits in his divorce proceedings with Madam Renuka contradicted this central feature. \"Ultimately, there are too many inconsistencies in the evidence of Ms Yeow and Mr Ramasamy to support her claim to any share in the property,\" said the court.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nAmicable divorce could lead to cooperation on finances, parenting: Legal experts\n\nCourts & Crime: Read more stories\n\nThe court ordered that she pay $35,000 in costs to the Legal Aid Bureau, which assisted Madam Renuka.\n\nThe court added that Ms Yeow may still bring a personal claim against Mr Ramasamy if the sums were loans made to him.\n\n\"Mr Ramasamy is not without substantial assets since he remains the owner of the entire property (subject to any claim of (his wife) in the divorce proceedings).\"\n\nIt is understood the house is now worth about $3 million.\n\nK.C.

This gives a total figure of $74,123.92,\" he said.\n\nThe remaining four stages covering 2022 to 2053 were computed along the same principle, taking into account her progress to senior educarer and her son not being a dependant on reaching age 25.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n'There is a loophole in the system': Car accident victim finds himself unable to claim insurance\n\nHow to make sure you can make an insurance claim after a traffic accident\n\nIn relation to the loss of inheritance claim, the judge awarded $103,953 after deducting $213,000 for the monies Ms Serina would have placed in the Basic Retirement Sum and the housing loan she would have paid from her CPF.\n\nMr Sumidja had sought $316,953 for loss of inheritance before the $213,000 deductions were made.\n\nThe judge awarded about $24,000 for the remaining miscellaneous expenses such as costs for letters of administration.\n\nHe called for both parties to make submissions on costs payable.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nSingaporean man dies from injuries in Genting tour bus crash\n\n23 injured in bus crash near Genting Highlands\n\nK.C.

His best from four earlier mounts was a fourth on Lim's Spin.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn the three other race days, he had an exasperating five seconds and a third from 18 rides.\n\n\"It was getting a little frustrating with so many seconds. I had so many good rides, but I just could not get my first winner after a few weeks,\" said A'Isisuhairi, who is affectionately known as Harry at Kranji.\n\n\"You kind of feel a little bit down. But, when I won on Circuit Mission, it just brought back the confidence. I was happy, it was a good day at the office.\"\n\nCircuit Mission, who had not won since his hat-trick in May 2019, signalled his intentions in the $70,000 Class 3 event over 1,400m on the Long Course A with an impressive trial victory the previous week.\n\nBut the Ngo Tai Tak-owned seven-year-old was meeting a strong field, headed by last-start winner Red Ocean.\n\nAfter a good jump, A'Isisuhairi secured the box seat behind the $22 second favourite Ironchamp and Red Ocean, the $11 favourite.\n\nOnce Circuit Mission hit the front with 300m to go, A'Isisuhairi kept him going to win by half a length from the fast-closing Tangible in a quick 1min 21.44sec.\n\n\"The horse has been well prepared by James, so we knew he was going to run a good race,\" said A'Isisuhairi.\n\n\"Of course, it was a strong field. But, in saying that, the horse had a nice trial and galloped well.\n\n\"He was fully ready for the race, so to get the result, I was just happy for James, and myself to get my first winner of the year.\n\n\"We knew there was going to be a hot tempo. I was just happy to get my horse travelling nice and steady. Top of the straight, I knew those two leaders would stop and my horse was still on the bridle.\n\n\"As soon as I improved him and went past Red Ocean, the horse just gave me a good turn of foot and won a nice race.\" Circuit Mission paid $63.\n\nSayonara's triumph might just be in a $30,000 Class 5 event over 1,800m, but A'Isisuhairi said the Shirtliff Stable-owned galloper was something special to him. After all, he had done the hard yards and it has paid off.\n\n\"There's a story behind this,\" said the Kelantan-born rider. \"I told Ricardo the horse is pretty sound, but he's a bit into himself. He can pull during trackwork and just doesn't do things right. He's not an easy horse to get the best out of... I told Ricardo I didn't mind coming to work on him.\n\n\"So, for me to win three times on him now is a great reward, even though he's a Class 5 horse.\n\n\"He means a lot to me, especially as I have been working on him, and to win for the owner and Ricardo, who has been supporting me, is quite special.\"\n\nSayonara was in the rear early after jumping from the second-widest barrier (Gate 10).\n\nBut A'Isisuhairi managed to secure the inside run and gradually made his way up to midfield.\n\nLemon Squash set a big lead, but Sayonara kept progressing and hit the front 400m out. From there, he kicked away to win by 21/4 lengths from last-start winner Super Atas in 1min 50.00sec. He paid $26.\n\nWith his confidence growing after winning two races in succession, A'Isisuhairi was in his element on Entertainer in the day's main event - the $85,000 Class 2 race over the Polytrack 1,100m.\n\nHe jumped well and hounded stablemate Makkem Lad. The $10 favourite Celavi was expected to vie for the lead but was in fourth spot.\n\nWith the fast pace set - the first 400m in 23.87sec - many expected the Logan duo to tire. Makkem Lad did run out of steam, but not Entertainer.\n\nWith only 50kg on his back, he kept going and staved off the fast-finishing Ararat Lady by 3/4 lengths in 1min 04.39sec.\n\nIt was his seventh success in 15 starts for Fortuna NZ Racing Stable. He also paid a juicy $66.\n\n\"My horse jumped very well and I never wasted my time to get across and sit next to the stablemate, Makkem Lad,\" said A'Isisuhairi.\n\n\"My horse, with no weight, was on the bridle. I had a lot of horse underneath. When I let him down, he really gave me a good turn of foot.\n\n\"I think, from the last 300m, I was quite positive I was going to win another race.\"\n\nA'Isisuhairi will miss Wednesday's meeting because of a careless riding suspension.\n\nCheck here for Saturday's Singapore results:\n\nresults31.pd\n\nf\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nRecession-Proof Investments to Know in 2025\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f686c79e7a43aa61d20af5aa14395a48c2607d3fed614e21931dc65ec732f50e/race_10c.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jockey A’Isisuhairi Kasim completing his hat-trick of wins on Entertainer, who beat Ararat Lady in the penultimate race on Saturday.", "caption": "Jockey A’Isisuhairi Kasim completing his hat-trick of wins on Entertainer, who beat Ararat Lady in the penultimate race on Saturday.

Turin Redsun swept home late in eye-catching fashion for fourth.\n\n\"This horse is very easy to control and he's got a big heart. When he hits the front, he likes to win. He's not a big horse but he's good enough. He's happy and he's healthy, so he performs very well,\" said Shum.\n\nSubject to discussions with Lau, he will target the second leg of the Four-Year-Old Classic Series - the HK$12 million Hong Kong Classic Cup over 1,800m on Feb 27.\n\nTeetan had inherited the ride from Joao Moreira, who opted for Master Delight, who finished 11th.\n\n\"He's a lovely horse. He's actually a really nice horse. He had the draw and I think it helped him,\" said the Mauritian.\n\n\"I just wanted to follow California Spangle and I knew he would take me into the race. But, when this horse got the clear run, he really let down and I think he's got a very bright future.\n\n\"Man, the last 100 metres, when he got a clear run, he gave me a really good feel.\"\n\nRomantic Warrior has progressed through the rankings with stunning efficiency since debuting on Oct 20, winning twice at Happy Valley before adding three successive victories at Sha Tin.\n\nTwo races earlier, trainer Caspar Fownes was contemplating a tilt at the Group 1 Citi Hong Kong Gold Cup over 2,000m with Zebrowski next month, after his five-year-old toughed it out to claim the Group 3 Centenary Vase Handicap over 1,800m with Matthew Poon astride.\n\n\"He's stepping up to every task and sometimes you have to throw them in the deep end a little bit, out of their comfort zone rating-wise,\" said Fownes.\n\n\"If he ran in a Gold Cup, he certainly wouldn't be disgraced. He'd still be a first-four chance in my opinion, because he's such a good stayer. Most importantly, we will see how he pulls up because he's a 'jointy' horse; he has his issues.\"\n\nPlaced in the 2020 Group 1 Australian Derby over 2,400m at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney, Zebrowski has made a swift acclimatisation to Hong Kong.\n\nHe is now a two-time Group 3 winner from only eight starts, after claiming the January Cup Handicap over 1,800m at Happy Valley earlier this month.\n\nThe Citi Hong Kong Gold Cup forms a Group 1 double-header on Feb 20, along with the Queen's Silver Jubilee Cup over 1,400m. - HKJC\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSteady Returns Amid Volatility?

Kennedy Jr,\n\nwho compared vaccine mandates in the US to the Holocaust.\n\nLilly's compatriot Simu Liu, who starred in last year's Shang-Chi, later tweeted on Jan 28 that \"the media needs to stop spotlighting opinions that are not rooted in facts or science.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\nLiu, 32, did not directly address Lilly in his post, but he did add, \"I lost my grandparents to COVID last year.

The number of calls made to the bank's contact centre surged by more than 40 per cent during this period.\n\nThe police said last month that at least 469 people had fallen prey to phishing scams involving the bank, with reported losses totalling at least $8.5 million.\n\nOCBC said on Sunday that those figures were based on police reports made by victims at the time, and more such reports were filed and submitted to the bank this month.\n\n\"In addition to those who had made police reports, we also reached out to victims who were not aware they had been scammed,\" said OCBC, noting that more than 200 customers were prevented from falling prey to scams due to its enhanced measures after the initial wave of scams.\n\nThe bank this month\n\nintroduced a slew of new security measures,\n\nincluding sending instant fund transfer alerts to customers even when one cent is transacted.\n\nIt also removed clickable links in marketing e-mails and SMS messages, and reduced the default daily limit for PayNow transactions from $5,000 to $1,000.\n\nOn Dec 31 last year, the bank implemented a 24-hour cooling-off period for digital token provisioning. It added that it will implement the same 24-hour cooling-off period for key account changes by Jan 31.\n\nThese measures are in line with\n\nnew requirements announced by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and The Association of Banks in Singapore\n\non Jan 19.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n'It was like fighting a war': OCBC group CEO on dealing with recent phishing scams\n\nStop scams: Counting the cost of love, sex and money scams\n\nBanks in Singapore\n\nare now required to put in place more stringent measures\n\nto bolster the security of digital banking, in view of the recent spate of SMS phishing scams.\n\nUnder the new rules, banks are also required to have dedicated customer assistance teams to deal with feedback on potential fraud cases, and send notifications to a customer's existing mobile number or e-mail address for requests to change these details.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nIMDA studying compulsory sign-up with anti-SMS spoofing registry for all organisations\n\nHow SMS phishing scams have affected OCBC customers and put text messaging security in focus\n\nPrisca Ang\n\nocbc\n\nSCAMS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 17, 2025, 02:41am\n\nWin a Brompton G Line bicycle worth $4,000 in ST-OCBC Cycle 2025 contest\n\nDec 23, 2024, 03:22am\n\n4,000 junior OCBC employees to receive $1,000 one-time payouts\n\nNov 7, 2024, 10:57pm\n\nOCBC to offer cross-border payments in over 50 digital wallets\n\nOct 12, 2024, 11:07pm\n\nPhish head curry: Woman loses $33k to malware scam\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\n5 Practical Habits To Help You Build Career Success\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/af23c895d98482f11cdb6aa12975131c55889b45cad9421274fb4aac865a0d58/mi_ocbc_300122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "There have been no further fraudulent transactions in relation to the scam over the past few weeks.", "caption": "There have been no further fraudulent transactions in relation to the scam over the past few weeks.

K-pop media outlets said that the band's agency announced the news on Friday (Jan 28).\n\n\"After a long period of discussion and debate, our agency and the April members decided to have the group disband and go their separate ways. We ask that you give lots of support and interest to the six members, who will be walking a new path that is not part of April,\" the agency said in a statement translated by website Soompi.\n\nAfter the announcement, members of the group sent messages to their fans. Chaekyung, 25, thanked them for their support and love over the years, while Rachel, 21, added, \"I want to say I'm sorry and I love you. It's a pity that we each have to go our separate ways from now on, but please support all our members for a new start.\"\n\nThe six-member group, which made its debut in August 2015, last released music in 2020 with the single album Hello Summer.\n\nIt was embroiled in a bullying scandal last year.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 9, 2025, 07:15am\n\nTwice to perform in Singapore twice, on Oct 11 and 12\n\nMore related stories\n\nFormer member Hyunjoo, 23, said\n\nshe had been bullied by the band from 2014,\n\nwhen she was preparing for her debut, until 2017, when she left the group.\n\n\"During those three years, I was forced to suffer because of violent actions and behaviour, ridicule, swearing and attacks on my character. And it was especially painful to bear groundless insults and attacks on the character of my precious grandmother, mum, dad and younger brother,\" she wrote in an Instagram post in April.\n\nMembers of April had denied the allegations at the time. Yena, 21, said, \"I always felt that one member was constantly pushing us away. When something happened to all of us, she thought of herself as the only victim. And even in a situation that arose by coincidence, she acted like we were the perpetrators.\"\n\nNow, in the wake of the group's breakup, Hyunjoo has come under fire on social media.\n\nOne netizen asked, \"hyunjoo ruined them… was it worth it?\" while another noted that \"April was really rising last year… they also got awards until Hyunjoo [made her allegations]\".\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nK-pop's Soojin denies being a school bully; accusers promise more details\n\nK-pop girl group GFriend announces sudden split after six years\n\nYamini Chinnuswamy\n\nk-pop\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nCelebrities\n\nSouth Korea\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 16, 2025, 11:55pm\n\nBTS' Jin partnered Singapore Tourism Board for music video shot in Singapore\n\nMay 1, 2025, 11:38pm\n\nK-pop boy band Riize heading to Singapore for Jan 2026 show\n\nApr 27, 2025, 08:25am\n\nBTS' J-Hope is a rock star at first solo show in Singapore\n\nMar 10, 2025, 12:12am\n\nNo O levels for teen as she moves to Korea to chase K-pop dream\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThe Underrated Strategy That Keeps Your Investments on Track\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a7914d4a25a31c548dee9373fc63c0c74a08553377cdaa36c5a0ea4f6a9eaedc/mi_hellosummer_300122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "This comes after the group was embroiled in a bullying scandal last year.", "caption": "This comes after the group was embroiled in a bullying scandal last year.

More than 95,000 homes in Massachusetts reported being without power.\n\nSnowfall in Boston equalled the one-day record of 59.9cm set in 2003, the NWS said, while the town of Sharon, 29km to the south, had recorded the highest snowfall by 8.30pm on Saturday with more than 76cm.\n\nThe towns of Islip, New York, and Warren, Rhode Island, were similarly blanketed.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:39pm\n\nAnxious Harvard-bound Singaporeans press ahead with plans, even as some still do not have visas\n\n1\n\nMore related stories\n\nCold weather stretched as far south as Florida, where the NWS warned of \"scattered to isolated falling iguanas from trees\" as plunging temperatures temporarily paralysed the large lizards.\n\nResidents in towns and cities across the eastern seaboard were urged to avoid all unnecessary travel for a second night of whiteout conditions, with additional snowfall expected to be heaviest across New England.\n\nIn Long Island, officials said a woman had been found dead in her car by a snowplow operator.\n\nSalt machines and snowploughs crawled along the streets of New York City, where Central Park was covered in 19cm of snow and regional train lines were partially shut down.\n\nIn Times Square, the famous neon billboards formed glowing halos in the snowy air.\n\nBut the frigid temperatures did not stop Mr Robert Burck, a Times Square fixture known as the \"Naked Cowboy\". Wearing only his underwear, a cowboy hat and cowboy boots, he strolled through the nearly empty tourist hot spot, strumming his guitar.\n\n\"It's fantastic,\" one undaunted tourist, Mr Gonzalo Vazquez of Spain, told AFP in Times Square. \"It's like skiing, surrounded by lights and awesome LED screens.\"\n\nIn the trendy Cobble Hill neighbourhood in Brooklyn, the pavements were almost deserted and many businesses were closed. But the few who did brave the elements smiled as they wished each other \"Happy snow day!\"\n\nNew York and the neighbouring state of New Jersey plus Virginia, Maryland and Delaware declared emergencies for all or part of the states.\n\nMr Eric Calessandro, a homeowner in the town of Marshfield near Boston said he had just lost power, but was optimistic his 8,000W generator would pull him through.\n\nHe said he \"should be able to bear it out for a couple days without power\", adding that he had stocked up on food and water in advance.\n\nBoston Public Works said 900 snowploughs were hard at work on the city streets.\n\nMore than 3,500 flights were cancelled for Saturday travelling within, into or out of the United States, according to flight tracker FlightAware. Just over 1,200 flights had already been cancelled for Sunday.\n\nThe blizzard comes on the heels of a similar winter storm that blanketed a swathe of eastern North America - from Georgia to Canada - just two weeks ago, cutting power to thousands of homes and also disrupting thousands of flights.\n\nunited states\n\nWeather\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 30, 2025, 07:03am\n\nSingaporeans travelling to US advised to check latest entry requirements and comply: MFA\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nS'poreans looking to pursue studies in US can still submit visa applications: US Embassy\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:02am\n\nConfused, nervous, told to 'wait for updates': Singapore students at Harvard react to US ban\n\n2\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6d2970f2568f4c7574f0be7730a25648ce8147e6c6d493dac84384d2cf15650c/snow30.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The frigid temperatures and heavy snow in New York didn't stop Robert Burck, a Times Square fixture known as the \"Naked Cowboy\", from strutting around with his guitar.", "caption": "The frigid temperatures and heavy snow in New York didn't stop Robert Burck, a Times Square fixture known as the \"Naked Cowboy\", from strutting around with his guitar.

The findings will help government agencies review existing building standards which, a BCA spokesman said, are currently not meant to address disease prevention and control.\n\nThey will also lead to recommendations on best practices for wider adoption in the construction and ventilation industry - impacting not just offices and malls, old and new, but also places such as schools, according to tender documents seen on government e-procurement portal GeBiz.\n\nThe 34-week study, which will scrutinise areas such as meeting rooms, auditoriums and shops, comes as more people move back into offices in line with the easing of Covid-19 measures.\n\nSince the start of the year, 50 per cent of staff who can work from home have been allowed to return to office.\n\nAssociate Professor Tham Kwok Wai of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Department of the Built Environment said the study is timely and much needed, as the pandemic has forced a rethink of building design and operations.\n\nIt is a natural development given Singapore's move towards living with endemic Covid-19, with Prof Tham stressing a need to prepare Singapore's infrastructure for other disruptive diseases to come.\n\nProf Tham said airborne diseases can be stopped on three fronts - virus, host, and transmission method. By improving natural ventilation, viral concentration in the air can be diluted, reducing the chances of transmission.\n\nTender documents indicate that the appointed consultants will review local and overseas building codes as part of the study, and will carry out modelling and simulations to identify potential ventilation requirements, or revisions to existing ones.\n\nInput from industry members and experts will also be sought.\n\nThe issue of building ventilation has come under the spotlight around the world because of the pandemic.\n\nProfessor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said Covid-19 data collated locally and worldwide has shown that the coronavirus spreads easily in indoor, poorly ventilated environments.\n\nThe BCA has issued advisories on improving ventilation and indoor air quality in buildings since May 2020, together with the Health Ministry and National Environment Agency.\n\nThe latest advisory, issued on Sept 26, 2021, called for building owners and facility managers to increase ventilation in air-conditioned premises, such as by opening windows and doors as frequently as possible, and operating exhaust fans at full capacity to expel air from indoor spaces.\n\nBut doing so has adverse implications as more energy will be required to cool air, said Prof Tham. The BCA added in its study requirements that this compromises efforts to mitigate climate change.\n\nThe BCA spokesman said that in Singapore's tropical climate, natural ventilation or mixing it with other ventilation forms is a promising alternative to air-conditioning, due to its potential to deliver higher ventilation rates in an energy-efficient and sustainable manner.\n\nProf Teo cautioned that while infrastructure design can help reduce the spread of airborne diseases, occupancy density can also heavily affect the rate of disease spread.\n\n\"Having many people crowd in a confined space will certainly accelerate transmission regardless of whether the building was designed to be more resilient to outbreaks,\" said Prof Teo.\n\n\"So while the infrastructure can mitigate the spread of infections, human behaviour and social factors are as important.\"\n\nNg Keng Gene\n\nBCA/BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY\n\nBUILDINGS\n\ncovid-19\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nRiding the Market Waves - Why REITs Still Deliver\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ad00d553227dc09d434282c445d4eff5fd1eaf6df53e325eb6e090e49c227c7e/study30.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The National University of Singapore's SDE4 by Serie + Multiply Consultants and Surbana Jurong Consultants features a hybrid cooling system that allows fresh air to enter rooms for natural ventilation.", "caption": "The National University of Singapore's SDE4 by Serie + Multiply Consultants and Surbana Jurong Consultants features a hybrid cooling system that allows fresh air to enter rooms for natural ventilation.

At least two people were injured as a result of the blaze.\n\nIt was the third blaze that firefighters had to battle in one night, following separate incidents hours earlier in Bedok and Tampines.\n\nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a Facebook post that officers performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a woman who was found unconscious in the unit directly above the fire.\n\nFirefighters had conducted a forced entry into her home during an evacuation of residents from neighbouring units while firefighting operations were being carried out. She was taken to Singapore General Hospital, together with another person who had smoke inhalation injuries, said SCDF.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:25am\n\nMedics treat 7 after Chai Chee block lift lobby blaze\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe force was alerted to the fire at about 4.40am.\n\n\"Upon SCDF's arrival, the fire was raging and had totally engulfed a unit on the 10th floor,\" it said. \"Firefighters donned breathing apparatus sets and proceeded cautiously into the smoke-logged unit. The fire, which involved contents of the entire unit, was extinguished with two water jets.\"\n\nAbout 280 people were evacuated as a precaution, said SCDF.\n\nThe blaze in Telok Blangah happened after fires broke out in two locations in eastern Singapore late on Friday.\n\nAt about 10.30pm on Friday, the SCDF was alerted to a raging fire at a two-storey flat at Block 941 Tampines Avenue 5.\n\nSCDF officers had to break down a bedroom door in the 10th-storey unit to rescue an unconscious man trapped inside. The man was taken to Changi General Hospital.\n\nAt midnight, a fire at a coffee shop at Block 204 Bedok North Street 1 prompted firefighters to evacuate 55 people living in flats above the eatery.\n\nFirefighters deployed water jets around the premises to contain the fire. There were no reported injuries in the Bedok fire.\n\nThe causes of the three fires are being investigated.\n\nFires of electrical origins such as faulty wiring are the leading cause of all blazes here, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of all blazes in 2020, SCDF said in its latest full-year fire-incident statistics.\n\nThe next most common cause are fires involving cooking activities, such as overheating of food.\n\nSCDF has cautioned against overloading electrical outlets with appliances, and to ensure that appliances are switched off when not in use. Appliances should be checked for frayed wires and cracked cords, and should be repaired or replaced if these are observed.\n\nClara Chong\n\nFIRES\n\nSCDF\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:06am\n\n'I didn't know it was so bad': Neighbours rally to help after fire broke out in Holland Close\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:01am\n\nFire breaks out in empty bunk at Pulau Tekong's Basic Military Training Centre, no injuries\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:22am\n\n4 people, including 2 firefighters, taken to hospital after fire in Holland Close flat\n\nJun 7, 2025, 03:35am\n\n20 people evacuated after fire at Home Team Career Centre\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b7404d877bfff44787e32c628dc7d92ad8ff734b3a7c13feaa4144261daefacb/fire30.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "SINGAPORE CIVIL DEFENCE FORCE / FACEBOOK"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3ba7d1dc502990352f7949f17c1ff27297d354fb6569537d357a47e872eb9f67/20250713762183882m4a1900.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Medics treat 7 after Chai Chee block lift lobby blaze", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6573692496510d9e2e7348252e8fe508ef104a19ad61f02ad8c79a9b77ba65d9/GIN2289.JPG?w=318", "alt_text": "'I didn't know it was so bad': Neighbours rally to help after fire broke out in Holland Close", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Iswaran, who visited the lighthouse on Saturday (Jan 29) for the launch of the tours, said they are meant to introduce more Singaporeans to the maritime sector and Singapore's maritime heritage.\n\nHe was joined on the inaugural tour by 14 students enrolled in maritime-related courses in institutes of higher learning.\n\nIn particular, Mr Iswaran said he hoped the tours would reach out to a younger generation of Singaporeans so they could learn about employment opportunities in the maritime sector.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 15, 2025, 12:12am\n\n'I lived on Pulau Samulun, now Jurong Shipyard': Musician remembers life before reclamation\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe five-hour tours set off from Marina South Pier, where visitors will be taken through MPA's Singapore Maritime Gallery.\n\nThey will then take a 75-minute ferry ride to Pulau Satumu, where Raffles Lighthouse is located. An audio tour during the ferry ride introduces visitors to ports located along the route, such as those at Tanjong Pagar and Pulau Brani.\n\nParticipants are also taught aids to navigation and various vessel types during the ride.\n\nAt Pulau Satumu, visitors can climb a flight of 88 steps leading to the top of the lighthouse, where they can enjoy a panoramic view.\n\nAmong the students on Saturday's tour was Singapore Management University undergraduate Samuel Poh, 24.\n\nMr Poh, who majors in international trading and maritime business operations, said he could better appreciate Singapore's strategic position as a maritime hub through the tour.\n\n\"It's interesting to see how Singapore has always had a long-term plan for its ports, and that its position as one of the world's leading ports was meticulously planned for,\" he said.\n\nBuilt using granite from Pulau Ubin's quarries, Raffles Lighthouse has been in operation since November 1855.\n\nLocated on Singapore's southernmost island, the 29m-tall structure marks the spot when ships leaving the Singapore Strait should turn right into the Strait of Malacca, and is among five lighthouses managed by MPA today.\n\nThe other four are Horsburgh Lighthouse - Singapore's oldest, operational since 1851 - on Pedra Branca, Sultan Shoal Lighthouse, Pulau Pisang Lighthouse and Bedok Lighthouse.

Ang Mo Kio, the first, has 4km of cycling paths.\n\nLTA had earlier announced plans to triple the length of Tampines' cycling path network, which connects three MRT stations - Tampines, Tampines East and Tampines West.\n\nSaturday's launch marks the completion of the first phase of cycling path works.\n\n\"Many residents have already started using the new paths over the past few weeks to travel from their homes to the Tampines Downtown Line MRT stations, bus interchange and various amenities in Tampines Central, including here at Our Tampines Hub,\" Mr Masagos added.\n\nAlong the new cycling paths, safety markings and speed-regulating strips have been installed.\n\nMr Masagos said: \"Having ridden on the cycling paths earlier, I am pleased with how smooth and pleasant the ride was.\"\n\nFive pedestrian crossings along the cycling routes have been widened to ensure safety for cyclists and pedestrians. \"Coupled with the existing 19 bicycle crossings, cyclists can now enjoy a safer and more seamless cycling experience in Tampines,\" said LTA.\n\nImprovement works were also carried out to create space for cycling paths behind 13 bus stops.\n\nTo help people find their way around the estate, mapboards highlighting key amenities and transport nodes have been placed at the junctions of Tampines Avenues 5 and 8 as well as Tampines Avenues 8 and 1.\n\nThe authority said it will continue to work with other agencies to further expand the cycling path network. It had announced in 2017 that the network in Tampines would be extended to about 21km by 2022.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFirst half of Round Island Route opens from Seletar to Labrador\n\nThe Great Singapore Cycle: Pedal from Changi to Jurong and enjoy an island tour\n\nThere are now 14km of cycling paths completed by the LTA in Tampines.\n\nIn response to queries, an LTA spokesman said: \"We are assessing the feasibility and timeline of the Tampines Town Phase 2 Cycling Path Network in view of the impact of Covid-19 on the construction sector.

Vaccination of children will help to protect more members of our society from the risk of developing severe illness from Covid-19 infections, and further minimise the risk of community spread.\"\n\nHe added that as more young children step forward to take their jabs, and more parents can see the proven track record of how safe these vaccines are, it will help to instil more confidence in parents, especially those with younger children.\n\nNo serious suspected adverse events\n\nassociated with the Covid-19 vaccine have been reported for children between five and 11 years old as at Dec 31, said the Health Sciences Authority.\n\n\"We have to respect parents, their choices, and we understand their anxiety and concerns. It is not just about protecting the children, but about protecting everyone, especially seniors. These children may interact with their grandparents or older relatives who are vulnerable to Covid-19,\" Mr Masagos said.\n\nMinister of State for Social and Family Development and Education Sun Xueling, who was also at the event, said: \"(Vaccination centres) for children have been designed to reduce the anxiety of children. Our community partner, Families for Life, is giving out goodies such as colouring kits and bookmarks featuring their mascot Becky Bunny at Yusof Ishak Secondary School and Our Tampines Hub paediatric vaccination centres, and this will progressively expand to other vaccination centres.\"\n\nSoftware engineer Trinath Vajinepalli, 32, who took his six-year-old daughter for her jab on Saturday, said: \"I've been preparing her... by telling her that the vaccine is for her own good. I took the vaccine and I am fine, I am not worried.\n\n\"My daughter was initially scared when she saw the long needle but she's fine, there was only mild pain.\"\n\nVaccination centres are currently unable to accommodate the general walk-in arrangement on Fridays to Sundays because of high demand for bookings on these days.\n\nParents who wish to make a booking on Fridays to Sundays can register their interest on the\n\nMinistry of Health National Appointment System\n\n.\n\nAfter registration, parents or guardians will receive a unique link via SMS within three to five working days to book a vaccination appointment.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMore than 175,000 kids aged between 5 and 11 have got at least one Covid-19 jab\n\nNumber of children admitted for Covid-19 at KKH doubles since December 2021\n\nRelated Stories\n\nOmicron variant can survive up to 21 hours on skin: Study\n\nChina's mRNA vaccine triggers immune response in 95% of recipients in first stage of trial\n\nHong Kong researchers discover oral drug combination that could treat Covid-19\n\nOmicron 'sub-variant' throws up new virus questions\n\nPfizer CEO sees annual Covid-19 vaccine rather than frequent boosters\n\nHow did S'pore leaders handle Covid-19?

The update of your status is automatic, and no action is required on your part,\" it added.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\nThose who were found to have been Covid-19 positive, but had done only an ART self-test, or had undergone rostered routine testing or pre-event testing will not have their infection status noted in their medical records.\n\n\"These individuals will typically undergo self-isolation, recover and then resume normal activities. There is therefore no record of their infection in our medical records,\" said MOH.\n\n\"If so, you will need to receive your booster dose, recommended from about five months after the last dose of your primary series, in order to extend the validity period of your full vaccination status beyond the initial 270 days.\"\n\nFrom Feb 14, those who are 18 years and older and have had two doses of the mRNA vaccine or three doses of the Sinovac/Sinopharm vaccine will lose their \"fully vaccinated\" status after 270 days.\n\n\"As the deadline draws near, MOH would like to remind the public to get their booster doses on time, that is, recommended from about five months after the last dose of your primary vaccination series,\" it added.\n\n\"Upon receiving your booster dose, you will continue to be considered fully vaccinated beyond the initial 270 days. There is no expiry for the period of validity following the booster at this point.\"\n\nIn response to questions on the need for boosters after various permutations of mRNA vaccine doses, Sinovac/Sinopharm doses and infections, MOH said it is working on a calculator to help individuals determine if they need to take boosters to extend the validity period of their \"fully vaccinated\" status.\n\nThe calculator will be available on its official website.\n\n\"But a simple rule of thumb is: Two doses of an mRNA vaccine or three doses of Sinovac/Sinopharm confer full vaccination status for 270 days. A booster or an infection recorded in our medical records after that will extend the validity,\" it added.\n\nThe ministry also advised individuals against taking serology tests \"to try to exempt themselves\" from a booster dose.\n\n\"A serology test is not a strong indication of resilience against severe illness caused by the Covid-19 virus. Further, positive serology can be generated due to vaccinations or infections, without clear indication of timing, and does not provide a good basis to decide if the individual can be exempted from boosters,\" it said.\n\n\"When in doubt, please come forward to receive a booster dose and get yourself properly protected.\"\n\nCheryl Tan\n\ncoronavirus\n\ncovid-19\n\nvaccination\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/46064e8093cc6c67e390f6da6fc4bfac6f9ad617d7c6d41a8f79341374ebad1e/yq-sgart-29012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "MOH clarified that those who were infected with Covid-19 should also receive a booster dose.", "caption": "MOH clarified that those who were infected with Covid-19 should also receive a booster dose.

This includes completing their vaccination status, which involves taking multiple doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, and registering for a slot for each week's Friday prayers.\n\nThe Muis fatwa committee - a group of senior Muslim scholars who decide on religious rulings here - had in June 2020 issued a ruling spelling out how those who are vulnerable and at a higher risk of contracting the virus, as well as those who are unable to secure a prayer slot at the mosques, could similarly replace Friday prayers at the mosque with their daily prayers.\n\nBoth Muis and mosques here will continue to monitor the Covid-19 situation and make further adjustments where needed, said the council.\n\n\"We seek the support and understanding of the Muslim community to safeguard public health as we perform our religious obligations in our mosques.\"\n\nHariz Baharudin\n\nMuis\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 4, 2025, 11:43pm\n\nTengah to get new mosque, Tampines North mosque to resume construction in 2027\n\nMar 3, 2025, 07:08am\n\nMuis warns against fake online ad offering $1,000 zakat assistance\n\nFeb 28, 2025, 11:57pm\n\nFasting month of Ramadan to start on March 2, zakat fitrah rates adjusted\n\nDec 31, 2024, 06:03am\n\n3 men allegedly rig bid for Sultan Mosque project\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cb93eb5741da3a918b89df06345f1fc7d65bf22cc2444a951b28c8c831945d0c/yq-fridayprayers-29012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Muis and the mosques will continue to monitor the Covid-19 situation and make further adjustments where needed.", "caption": "Muis and the mosques will continue to monitor the Covid-19 situation and make further adjustments where needed.

One photo also shows a hole dug in the sand at the end of a slide.\n\nIt is unclear when the playground was built, or indeed if Mr Amer had ever visited or played at a playground similar to this one in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nIn Singapore, playgrounds with plastic fixtures weren't a common sight until the turn of the century.\n\nAll the same, many who commented on Mr Amer's post agreed that the playground was not suitable for children, and that it was built with concrete probably to save on costs.\n\n\"I just brought my kids there, and my kids' shirts are now torn and dirty,\" read one comment.\n\n\"This playground is for adults, not for kids,\" read another remark in jest (we hope).\n\nIn response to the complaints, Mayor of Kuala Terengganu Rozali Salleh visited the playground on Jan 24, and said it would be upgraded soon, local news agency TRDI reported.\n\nMr Rozali said the slide was made from concrete because of environmental factors, such as hot weather and saltwater. Terengganu is by the eastern coast of peninsula Malaysia.\n\nHe added that the previous version of the playground - made from plastic fixtures - had often been vandalised.\n\n\"We (once) found a folding knife that was used to damage the playground,\" he said.\n\nOld school \"sand-and-concrete\" playgrounds have mostly been demolished in Singapore, although at least one of them is preserved in Toa Payoh.\n\nST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG\n\nMan, those were the days.\n\nmalaysia\n\nTerengganu\n\nplayground\n\ncomplaint\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But now, I hardly see anyone using it when I do my weekly grocery shopping.\"\n\nInfectious disease expert Leong Hoe Nam, from Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, is not overly concerned about infections being caught from surface areas, noting that the virus was less likely to survive on inanimate objects in Singapore's hot and humid weather.\n\nHowever, Dr Ling Li Min, an infectious disease specialist, said the risk remained, so it was crucial to practise strict hand hygiene.\n\n\"It's not possible to keep cleaning every single doorknob or piece of furniture after each person stands up or sits down,\" she added.\n\n\"If we have touched an external surface and are going to use our bare hands to put anything in our mouths, we should really wash our hands with soap and water or clean them with wipes.\"\n\nDr Leong said that wearing a good quality surgical mask, except when eating or drinking, was another valuable precaution to follow during Chinese New Year.\n\nHe added: \"Even when you're playing mahjong, wear a mask.

coffee shop in Bedok going up in smoke.\n\nIn Tampines, firefighters had to break down a bedroom door in the flat to rescue an unconscious man trapped in the burning unit.\n\nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a Facebook post that the fire was raging at a two-storey flat on the 10th storey of Block 941 Tampines Avenue 5 when their officers arrived at the scene after being alerted at 10.30pm.\n\nThe flames had totally engulfed the unit and firefighters from Tampines Fire Station and Changi Fire Station had to force their way into the flat.\n\nThey also had to force their way into a bedroom on the first storey of the flat, where they found a man lying unconscious on the floor.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:25am\n\nMedics treat 7 after Chai Chee block

heard in one three-second clip that showed debris falling from the unit.\n\nThe fire in Bedok occurred around midnight, according to eyewitnesses.\n\nIn videos posted online, large plumes of dark smoke could be seen rising out of a coffee shop at Block 204 Bedok North Street 1.\n\nAn eyewitness, who lives opposite the site of the fire, said he heard loud popping noises around midnight.\n\n\"It sounded like many skateboards popping off the ground, but 30 seconds later there was a loud explosion,\" he told The Straits Times.\n\nWithin moments, he saw smoke rising from the four-storey building and residents evacuating.\n\nFrom his flat on the 22nd storey, he heard residents shouting as they hurried out of the building.\n\nHe said SCDF officers arrived in about five minutes and put out the fire by 12.30am.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nWhen ST arrived at the scene at about 1am, residents who had evacuated from their homes were seen gathering at an open area near Djitsun Mall Bedok.\n\nMany

The combination can score today.\n\nST PHOTO: SALWA SUANDI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 28, 2022, 03:39pm\n\nPoly is Makkem Lad's worry\n\nTrainer Logan feels her eight-time winner is much fitter but his turn of foot better on turf\n\nShare this article\n\nHonest as the day is long, there are still some concerns for Makkem Lad, the top weight in today's $85,000 Class 2 race over the Polytrack 1,100m (4.30pm).\n\nThe six-year-old is fighting fit, as shown in his narrow second to Nowyousee in his barrier test on Tuesday morning.\n\nBut trainer Donna Logan feels that her charge is a better horse on the turf than on the alternate track.\n\nThis is despite the fact that Makkem Lad has won three times on the Poly. His five other successes were on the turf.\n\n\"I don't like him on Polytrack as much as on turf, even if he won on it early in his career,\" said Logan.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I feel his turn of foot is reduced on the Poly. He can't kick off the turn as well as he does on turf.\n\n\"I've avoided Poly for him for a long time. But, as there weren't a lot of racing opportunities for him, that has forced my hand, and we've decided to give him a run on the Poly this Saturday.\n\n\"If not for that, I'd be a lot more confident as he has drawn well in one - and he's a lot fitter this time.\"\n\nThe New Zealander, who has saddled four winners this season, felt that Makkem Lad was \"too fat\" in his last start on Jan 15, when he finished an unlucky fourth behind Kharisma over 1,200m on turf. He was only 31/2 lengths adrift.\n\n\"Then he missed the start, and overraced when he kicked up on the inside. He missed the kick because the young man who works him and knows him the best wasn't the one holding him in the gates that day.\n\n\"It wasn't his regular barrier attendant, and he had a new person on hand. I'm not sure what it is, but that was why he reared.\n\n\"The usual attendant was in the gates at his test (on Tuesday), and there was no problem at all. He ran a nice trial.\n\n\"So, there are three reasons he got beat first-up: he missed the start, he overraced and he was not 100 per cent ready.\"\n\nLogan believes Makkem Lad should have more things going his way second-up today, but the Poly worry is still weighing in on her.\n\nShe has again nominated her 3kg-claiming apprentice jockey Yusoff Fadzli on Makkem Lad to bring the handicapped weight down to 56kg.\n\nYusoff has won twice on the bay Australian-bred gelding. He was also the pilot in Tuesday's trial. He knows the horse well.\n\nMakkem Lad has a top chance. It is now just a question of how well he can adapt to the Poly against some nice sprinters like Celavi and last-start runner-up Lim's Dream.\n\nLogan saddles two other runners in the same race -Zac Kasa and Entertainer, both among the big team of horses to move to her yard from fellow Kiwi Mark Walker, who has returned to New Zealand.\n\nThe duo have already raced under Logan's name. But both did not quite run up to expectations in their respective races.\n\nZac Kasa was trapped deep punching the breeze and ran seventh in the same contest captured by Kharisma.\n\nEntertainer looked to be in the zone in a Class 3 1,100m dash, but failed to produce when it mattered. He finished seventh, over six lengths off the winner Be Bee.\n\nMakkem Lad will be Logan's No. 1 hope. But she is not encouraging punters to give the other two a wide berth either.\n\nOf the two, Entertainer's recent formline reads better with six wins - all over 1,100m - scooped up last year for the Fortuna NZ Racing Stable.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been a long time between drinks for the seven-year-old Zac Kasa. It has been three years since the last of his four wins in a Class 1 event over 1,200m.\n\n\"Zac Kasa is 100 per cent sound and is such a lovely horse to work with,\" said Logan.\n\n\"But as he's quite an old horse now, I've been trying to change his work quite a bit. Just try new things to spice things up, mix things up for him and change his outlook.\n\n\"It's like for us, we go on holidays just to freshen up, and we come back recharged.\n\n\"Entertainer is a nice horse, and I think he needed the run first-up. With a first run under his belt, I expect him to improve this Saturday.\"\n\nMohd Zaki will ride Zac Kasa and A'Isisuhairi Kasim gets his maiden ride aboard Entertainer.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He looks well placed to make an impact on debut. Expect a big run under the top-form Karis Teetan.  2 King Of The Court is a talent. He has had issues but looks ready to return after a two-run first season, narrowly missing once when on debut. With Zac Purton up, he is the main danger.  8 Super Highway was unlucky first-up when awkwardly placed behind another runner. He can make a charge over this bunch with the right run.  3 Brilliant Way debuts for trainer John Size. Keep him safe.\n\nRACE 2 ( 1,200M ) 1 Star Of Yuen Long is stepping down to Class 4. He is receiving a welcome drop in grade. The inside gate should also afford him all the favours. He is the one to beat. Chances are he will roll forward to try and make it pillar to post. 5 Sky Show has form on the dirt. He has got a bit of class on his day and should not be discounted.  4 Super Axiom is a speedster. Expect he rolls forward and tries to pinch this one.  3 Flying Dragon is after back-to-back wins. He is not without a chance, with Derek Leung sticking aboard.\n\nRACE 3 (1,400M ) 12 Red Brick Fighter is getting the conditions to suit. He is a winner in this grade and off this mark. The draw suits and this shapes as an excellent chance for Australian jockey Luke Currie to kick off his career in Hong Kong with a win.  2 Super Mission is racing well. He deserves a win. From Gate 4, he is an excellent chance to get it.  4 Fun N Glory showed some ability early on. Expect another sharp performance. 1 Stormtrouper is stepping out for trainer Dennis Yip and Purton. Keep safe. He was a winner two starts back.\n\nRACE 4 (1,400M ) 5 Brilliant China is closing in on his first win. He looks capable of scoring. Gate 5 gives him every opportunity to do exactly that.  4 Zacian is racing well. But he is struggling to piece it all together. Perhaps the booking of Purton can set things right.  8 Sunny Baby turned in a career-best second in his last start. Expect more improvement, although the wide gate makes it a little hard.  1 Fortune Master is stepping down in grade. He should sharpen up in Class 5 with Teetan engaged.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nRACE 5 (1,600M) 10 Right As Rain looks like a work in progress. He is showing enough to suggest that he is capable of winning very soon. The strong booking of Teetan signals intent, so he is worth supporting.  4 Nimble Nimbus is after back-to-back wins. Gate 14 makes things tricky, but he is in form and seemingly still on the rise.  9 Leading Fortune is consistent. He is getting close to pinching another win and his reliability holds him in good stead.  1 Solar Power should roll forward. He will look the winner at some stage.\n\nRACE 6 (1,200M ) 10 Everyone's Victory is in a rich vein of form. He has won two out of his last three starts and gets another excellent chance to add another.  4 Amazing Chocolate is a real talent on the dirt on his day. He pairs with Purton now and, from Gate 5, he should get his chance. Class 3 suits, as his last victory was in Class 2.  6 Harmony Spirit has claims. His consistency holds him in good stead.  11 Mega Heart, a nine-year-old veteran with four wins and 11 placings from 48 starts, is favoured with the light weight.\n\nRACE 7 (1,800M) Group 3 Centenary Vase 3 Reliable Team should roll forward and try to make all the running. He can pinch this from the front like he did in the Group 2 Jockey Club Cup last November. He is fit and a return to the winning list would not shock.  2 Panfield has the class edge as a Group 1 winner last May and a Group 2 winner the start after. He has drawn well and should be primed for this.  7 Butterfield is not without a chance. He looks fit and is favoured with only 115lb (52.2kg) on hi s back.  8 Excellent Proposal, a four-time winner from 12 starts, is next best. He is racing well.\n\nRACE 8 (1,600M ) 9 Infinite Power is capable of bouncing back. Expect he surges forward to make all the running. He is capable and Gate 2 should him see hit the front with little to no energy used.  1 Captain Win is rising sharply. He is a talent and he has taken to racing in Hong Kong with ease. Purton hops up again and he is the main danger.  5 Super Dynamite is closing in on his first win. Expect more improvement.  10 Perfect To Great has claims. Do not discount.\n\nRACE 9 (1,600M) The Hong Kong Classic Mile 8 Lucky With You is a rising talent. He is stepping up in trip which is the unknown. But he looks worthy of a chance, especially as he has finished no worse than second in five runs in Hong Kong. He won three times.  5 Fa Fa is heading to Sha Tin after dominating Happy Valley. He has the form, having defeated several seasoned gallopers, although he just needs to handle Sha Tin, a vastly contrasting racecourse.  4 Packing Victory has looked imperious at times. He comes into this ready to peak with Purton booked.  1 California Spangle is the wild card. He has been dominant over 1,200m but does step up sharply to the mile. Keep safe.\n\nRACE 10 (1200M) 10 Congratulation is returning from a lengthy layoff. He is American-bred, so the dirt should suit him. His latest trial was sound. He has class. He was trained by Aidan O'Brien before arriving. With luck, he just might be able to spring an almighty surprise.  7 Man Star is consistent, especially on the dirt. His three wins were all on the all-weather track. Expect another big run.  2 Kurpany rarely runs a bad race. He is in form. He notched his fourth win last time.  4 Red Desert is a dirt specialist. Three of his four wins were on the all-weather track, so the switch from turf is a big help.\n\n• Comments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Clu\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She was not arrested or prosecuted.\n\nAn NCA spokesman told The Straits Times that the gold was seized under Britain's Proceeds of Crime Act, which allows the bars to be detained while the NCA looked into their origins. The matter then goes before the courts, where there is an opportunity to contest the seizure.\n\nAs further investigations needed to be done, there were no reasonable grounds for pursuing criminal proceedings.\n\nThe woman had initially told NCA investigators that she was taking the gold bars from a jeweller in Singapore to another jeweller in Chennai.\n\nShe had no explanation for her strange routing via London, NCA noted.\n\nFurther enquiries revealed that invoices the woman was carrying for the gold bars were fake, and the Chennai jeweller did not exist.\n\nInvestigations point to the gold bars belonging to a criminal money laundering network that is active in Europe and Asia.\n\nNCA Branch Commander Andy Noyes said in a statement: \"Gold is an attractive commodity for criminals to use to move money because relatively small amounts can have a high value... We think they were attempting to move them through London to try and disguise their routing, and avoid the attentions of Indian law enforcement upon arrival there.\"\n\nBy\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nRead articles by Kok Yufeng\n\nmoney laundering\n\nAIRPORTS\n\nBritain\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 1, 2025, 12:33am\n\n$3b money laundering case: Singaporean jailed for lying to police\n\nJun 26, 2025, 08:21am\n\nSheng Siong suspended PayNow withdrawals over money laundering fears\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:20am\n\nJail for woman who helped sister to obtain bank accounts, ATM cards for use in scams\n\nMay 16, 2025, 11:54pm\n\nFacebook user apologises, deletes defamatory posts on Ong Ye Kung, Chee Hong Tat and Ng Chee Meng\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8fa1050e613e5d493ab2e3cc85ebc8cdfc281bf4cdb1c45a6581bb470f70682a/yq-goldbar-28012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The woman was allowed to continue on her journey after the gold was initially seized.", "caption": "The woman was allowed to continue on her journey after the gold was initially seized.

The surveys were conducted in December 2020, July 2021 and December 2021.\n\nOn why some people share fake news without realising it, Prof Lee said that it could be due to how fake news tends to stir people's feelings.\n\nFor instance, scientific evidence is often conveyed in a very factual, even boring way, such as showing that vaccines work. This does not usually trigger emotions in people.\n\nBut people who are not on their guard may get emotional over fake news on how vaccines could cause side effects, making them want to share it.\n\nAnother reason why some people share news, even if they are unsure of its veracity, is that they have a \"better safe than sorry\" attitude, said Prof Tandoc, which has been found among older people.\n\nThey forward the news to others to warn them or because they believe the news will interest their family and friends.\n\nBetween 51 and 60 per cent of the people surveyed also knowingly share fake news, the study found.\n\nProf Tandoc explained that this could be because people think the bogus information is funny and believe their friends will find it entertaining. This was found to be the case among many young people in focus group studies.\n\nThe pandemic could have also affected how people consume news.\n\nThe study found that people did not use social media as much as the local news sites of newspapers and television to get news.\n\nFor instance, Facebook was used by between 32 and 37 per cent of those polled to read news, and WhatsApp by between 26 and 30 per cent, lower than the 38 to 46 per cent for newspaper sites and 39 to 45 per cent for TV sites.\n\n\"What we're seeing is something we've known all along - that during times of crises and difficult times, people turn to news. And what's encouraging with the results is that they turn to legitimate news sources for information,\" said Prof Tandoc.\n\nBefore the pandemic, studies done by NTU had shown that the trend was the other way around.\n\nA poll of 1,000 people in December 2019 found that the No. 1 source was Facebook, with 55.9 per cent of people saying that was where they read news. This was followed by WhatsApp at 52.7 per cent.\n\nFor local TV news sites the figure then stood at 47.2 per cent, while for local newspaper sites it was 44.9 per cent.\n\nKenny Chee\n\nFAKE NEWS\n\ncovid-19\n\nMEDIA LITERACY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMay 6, 2025, 08:33am\n\nReports of ERP hikes from June fake: LTA\n\nMar 22, 2025, 12:15am\n\nKenneth Jeyaretnam issued Pofma order over false claims on hiring of foreign auxiliary police officers\n\nJun 27, 2024, 03:00am\n\nFake: Reports of man who died after winning at MBS casino\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Two other similar charges were taken into account for his sentencing.\n\nThe court heard that Toh and his wife had no formal employment and gave Mandarin tuition occasionally.\n\nIn 2008, Tan wanted Toh to be eligible for government grants for Singaporean employees and began submitting to CPF Board the Ordinary Wages portions of payment advices from International Times, falsely indicating that Toh was an employee receiving a monthly salary of $1,000.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 11, 2025, 12:01am\n\nDBS, OCBC and UOB to recognise CPF Life payouts as proof of income in credit card applications\n\nMore related stories\n\nInternational Times used to publish newspapers, magazines and books but has been dormant since 2000, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Jean Ting.\n\nThe Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) was introduced by the Ministry of Manpower in 2007 to support Singaporean employees whose earnings are in the bottom 20 per cent of the population. It is administered by the CPF Board.\n\nUnder the WIS, Singaporean employees will receive CPF top-ups for their retirement savings and a cash supplement if they have an income of less than $2,000, are Singaporean, and are more than 35 years old on Dec 31 of the work year, among other requirements.\n\nBetween September 2008 and October 2009, Toh received payouts from CPF Board totalling $2,101.\n\nTan was notified about these payouts through letters sent by CPF Board to their home.\n\nIn 2010, Tan began submitting his own name and listed his monthly salary as $1,000 too.\n\nHe made CPF contributions to his account through International Times as employer CPF contributions, even though he knew that he was not a salaried employee.\n\nThis went on till 2019 and CPF disbursed a total of $35,259 in cash to the couple. A total of $32,596 was disbursed in CPF contributions.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2019, CPF Board paid out $18,150 to International Times under the Special Employment Credit scheme which was meant to support employers and raise the employability of Singaporeans above 50 years of age.\n\nCPF Board also paid out $300 to the company under the Temporary Employment Credit scheme which was introduced in 2014 to help with the rise in business costs to employers.\n\nDPP Ng told the court that Tan made full restitution of all the payouts received by him, Toh and International Times.\n\nShe urged the court to sentence Tan to 18 to 22 weeks imprisonment, noting that deterrence is the dominant sentencing consideration for cases involving Government fraud.\n\n\"The need for deterrence is to safeguard national resources,\" she said.\n\nThe Straits Times has contacted CPF for comment.\n\nTan will begin serving his sentence on Feb 16.\n\nBy\n\nJean Iau\n\nRead articles by Jean Iau\n\nCPF\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:57am\n\nInterest rate on CPF Special, MediSave and Retirement accounts remains at 4% for Q3 2025\n\nMar 26, 2025, 05:43am\n\nNew online tool helps Singaporeans calculate health insurance premiums, compare plans\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:07am\n\nCPF system geared to meet retirement needs as people live longer\n\nJan 19, 2025, 07:34am\n\nCPF Board closes 1.4m Special Accounts of members aged 55 and above\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Bento's men could have joined Iran in punching their ticket to Qatar but the United Arab Emirates, in third, beat Syria 2-0 in Dubai to move to nine points from seven games.\n\nCho scored the game's only goal when he latched on to Hwang Ui-jo's low curling cross from the left, with the forward steering the ball home from close range.\n\nLebanon were far from outplayed, however, with brothers Alexander and Felix Melki both striking the woodwork for Ivan Hasek's side.\n\nIn Group B, Australia thrashed bottom side Vietnam 4-0 in Melbourne but remain in third place (14 points) after second-placed Japan (15) downed a poor China side 2-0 at Saitama Stadium.\n\nThe Socceroos cruised past the Vietnamese, on zero points and out of the running, via goals by Jamie Maclaren, Tom Rogic, Craig Goodwin and Riley McGree, even though coach Graham Arnold was absent after going into isolation following his positive Covid-19 test.\n\n\"I can't be more pleased with the energy,\" said assistant coach Rene Meulensteen. \"We knew it was going to be a challenge because that's what international football is about.\"\n\nThe Samurai Blue held on to second spot with victory over a Chinese side, on five points with three games left, that saw their hopes of a play-off place all but extinguished.\n\nYuya Osako, who also scored the winner in the \"away\" fixture back in September, which was held in Doha because of China's travel restrictions, gave the Japanese the lead in the 13th minute from the penalty spot.\n\nHis well-placed effort gave goalkeeper Yan Junling no chance after Junya Ito's cross had been handled by Wang Shenchao.\n\nThe hosts were rarely troubled by a Chinese side being led by new coach Li Xiaopeng for the first time after the departure of predecessor Li Tie last month.\n\nWith the visitors struggling to gain possession outside their own half, Ito added a deserved second goal in the 61st minute when he met substitute Yuta Nakayama's pinpoint cross from the left with a header that flew into the bottom corner.\n\nHaving completed the double over their rivals, Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu turned his attention to leaders Saudi Arabia, with the sides meeting in a top-of-the-table clash in Saitama on Tuesday.\n\n\"Looking ahead to the Saudi game, tonight's match has helped strengthen our understanding as a team and that's a big plus for us,\" he said.\n\n\"But the Saudi game will have a different intensity and tension from tonight, and we have to be ready to play at a high level.\"\n\nOnly the top two nations in each of Asia's two groups are guaranteed to advance to the World Cup, with the third-placed finishers facing off in a play-off for the right to meet a South American side for a possible fifth Asian berth in Qatar.\n\nIRAN\n\nSouth Korea\n\nWorld Cup 2022\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nFeb 10, 2025, 11:59pm\n\nS'pore to deport Iranian woman, Malaysian husband deemed to be threat to national security\n\nAug 2, 2024, 09:34am\n\nSIA, Scoot flights avoid Iranian airspace again\n\nFeb 13, 2024, 08:17am\n\nCentenarian to compete in World Aquatics Masters C'ships\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The accused apologised and ran across the road, nearly getting hit by a white car. The victim then took a photograph of the accused, and called the police.\"\n\nThe court heard that this incident made the woman \"paranoid of people following her\" whenever she took the same route home.\n\nShe also feared that Sim would be around and became wary of others who look like him.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nJail, caning for dance instructor who molested two boys at their primary schools\n\nMan who molested stepdaughter, 12, and stepson, 9, jailed and caned\n\nHe struck again on Aug 25, 2020, and molested a 15-year-old girl just before she got off a public bus in Hougang.\n\nThe teenager made a police report the next day after telling a teacher about what had happened.\n\nSim molested his third victim - a 17-year-old girl - on a bus on Aug 28 that year.\n\nThe teenager alerted the police later that day.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMan molested intoxicated woman in car; his colleague later raped her in a chalet\n\nCourts & Crime: Read more stories\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\n, Court Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2ce47e79b217b7ee4d4fd4b7fdec71c16d85dc11438c8d6739c18b8a0292290e/gavel-1238036-1278x855_revjun212022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

I'm just a middleman.\"\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Samuel Yap asked for Chua to be further remanded for a week till Feb 4.\n\nWhen asked by the judge why Chua's remand needed to be extended, DPP Yap said: \"The extent of the fraud perpetrated is quite significant and the accused's attendance is therefore necessary for the investigations to be complete.\"\n\nThe court heard that on or around Jan 14, Chua is said to have conspired with Quah to falsely represent to MOH that Mehrajunnisha was vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine, although she was not, in order for Mehrajunnisha to obtain a certificate of vaccination against Covid-19.\n\nOn Tuesday, Quah's charge was similarly amended to\n\ndishonestly making a false representation to MOH,\n\ninstead of one of cheating the ministry.\n\nThe police on Jan 25 released a statement saying that Quah and his clinic assistant Chua had been arrested, along with Iris Koh, the founder of anti-vaccine group Healing the Divide.\n\nPreliminary investigations found that Quah and Chua purportedly worked together to submit false vaccination data, while Koh, 46, was believed to have referred clients to them.\n\nChua and Koh are scheduled to be in court next on Feb 4, while Quah's next court date is slated for Jan 31.\n\nJean Iau\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncoronavirus\n\nanti-vaccination\n\nvaccination\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

And now, taxi fares are poised to rise - as early as March.\n\nThe Straits Times understands market leader ComfortDelGro, which controls 60 per cent of the total taxi fleet of around 15,000 cabs in the Republic, has signalled to the authorities its intention to adjust flagdown and distance rates.\n\nThe Public Transport Council, which has to be informed of fare changes, has yet to respond to queries from ST filed early Thursday (Jan 27).\n\nCurrently, taxi flagdown fares are mostly $3.70 for diesel taxis and $3.90 for petrol-electric hybrids. And for every 400m thereafter up to 10km, the metre goes up by 22 cents. Beyond 10km, the distance fare rises by 22 cents every 350m.\n\nAt its last fare adjustment in 2011, ComfortDelGro raised the flagdown fare of most cabs by 20 cents and distance fares by two cents per fare band. The planned adjustment is expected to be similar.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 18, 2025, 11:33pm\n\nGrabCab to launch in July with 40 new Toyota Prius taxis for a start\n\nMore related stories\n\nAs has been the practice, other taxi companies - Trans-Cab, SMRT, Premier and Prime - will adjust fares after the market leader.\n\nThe manager of a smaller player said: \"We are waiting to see what Comfort does. Costs are still going up. And the $5 rental rebate from the government will end soon. Drivers will have a harder time.\"\n\nHe was referring to the Covid-19 Driver Relief Fund, which was extended recently. In December, cabbies and private-hire drivers received a $10 payout per vehicle per day, and a $5 payout per vehicle per day in January.\n\nSources reckon the Government could extend the relief further, as economic and social activities have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nBut independent of this, the planned fare adjustment is also said to be in response to rising fuel prices. Fuel pump prices have been rising steadily since mid-2020 as demand for oil products rises in tandem with world economies emerging from the pandemic. Since then, the most popular 95-octane petrol has risen by 50 cents a litre.\n\nComfortDelGro was not available for comment.\n\nCommuters are divided about the prospect of having to pay more.\n\nRetiree Lawrence Seow, 61, said: \"To be fair, an increase is justified. Because of inflation, everything has gone up. If I find that taxis are too expensive, I'll take Grab, or the bus. Or I cycle.\"\n\nBut lawyer Bryan Tan, 50, said even though posted fares have not risen for some time, the final fare he pays has increased.\n\n\"There's surge pricing, for instance, while before there was none,\" Mr Tan said. \"Since the arrival of private-hire, taxi companies have followed some of their pricing. Now that taxi fares are going up, I expect private-hire companies to make some adjustments too.\"\n\nCabbies, of course, welcomed the anticipated fare increase.\n\nVeteran cabby Tony Pang, 73, who is now a relief driver three times a week, said: \"It's a good move. More people are taking cabs now. And come Feb 1, when unvaccinated drivers cannot drive anymore, there will be fewer cabs and more business for us.\"\n\nPublic transport fares rose by up to four cents per trip on Dec 26.\n\nChristopher Tan\n\n, Senior Transport Correspondent\n\nTAXIS\n\nComfortDelgro\n\nPUBLIC TRANSPORT\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 10, 2025, 02:29am\n\n$5 surcharge for taxi pick-up at Mandai Banyan Tree Resort, from June 16\n\nApr 29, 2025, 11:10pm\n\nMotorcyclist, 71, dies in collision with taxi on CTE\n\nApr 2, 2025, 06:31am\n\nGrab set to become Singapore's sixth taxi operator\n\nMar 12, 2025, 12:27am\n\nCabby arrested for drink driving after vehicle ends up at foot of Teck Whye block\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The figures are unchanged from URA's flash estimates released on Jan 3.\n\nBefore accelerating in the fourth quarter, private home prices grew 1.1 per cent in the third quarter, a 0.8 per cent rise in the second quarter and 3.3 per cent in the first.\n\nHowever, the latest round of property cooling measures and more people taking year-end breaks overseas because of the addition of more vaccinated travel lanes took their toll on transaction volumes in the final quarter of the year.\n\nSales of new non-landed homes, excluding executive condominiums (ECs), dropped nearly 15 per cent in the fourth quarter to 3,018 units, from 3,550 units in the third quarter.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 12:34pm\n\nAnti-smoking message added to samsui woman mural after public controversy\n\nMore related stories\n\nHowever, for 2021 overall, developers sold 13,027 homes, 30.5 per cent more than the 9,982 homes in 2020. This is the highest number of new home transactions since the previous record in 2013, when 14,948 units were transacted, Mr Mohan Sandrasegeran, research & content analyst, Ohmyhome noted.\n\nPandemic-fuelled demand coupled with a depleting housing supply drove property prices to new records last year, OrangeTee & Tie senior vice-president of research and analytics Christine Sun said.\n\nLanded home prices climbed 3.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 2.6 per cent gain in the second, buoyed by wealth from new-economy sectors.\n\nPrices jumped 5.3 per cent for non-landed condominiums and apartments, compared with a mere 0.7 per cent in the third quarter.\n\nFor 2021, landed property prices surged 13.3 per cent, while those for non-landed homes jumped 9.8 per cent.\n\nIn terms of location, prime district prices rose 2.7 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with a 0.5 per cent drop in the previous quarter. Suburban prices jumped 5.7 per cent reversing a 0.1 per cent fall in the third quarter.\n\nPrices in the city fringe or the rest of central region saw the strongest growth, gaining 6.7 per cent, compared with a 2.6 per cent rise in the previous quarter.\n\nFor 2021, prices in this market segment surged 16.3 per cent, outpacing a 3.8 per cent rise in the prime districts and a 8.8 per cent gain in the suburbs.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMarket stand-off: Buyers, sellers keep watch on impact of property curbs\n\nNew private home sales catch chill from cooling measures with 58% drop in December\n\nAs for the rental market, the rise in private housing rents accelerated in the fourth quarter, as border controls eased and international air travel increased while the supply of completed homes remained tight.\n\nPrivate home rents climbed 2.6 per cent, compared with a 1.8 per cent increase in the third quarter. For the whole of 2021, private home rents jumped 9.9 per cent, more than reversing the 0.6 per cent drop in 2020.\n\nRents of non-landed properties rose 2.7 per cent, compared with a 1.4 per cent increase in the previous quarter. Rents in the prime and city fringe areas grew 2.9 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively, while those in the suburbs rose 2.4 per cent.\n\nMs Sun believes rental demand is likely to pick up further this year.\n\n\"In light of the new cooling measures, HDB flat owners who do not wish to pay the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) may opt to sell their flats first before buying a new home and rent in the interim.

Both the local actress and Matthew Webster, her English-Chinese Singaporean fiance, are also born in the Year of the Tiger - double happiness anyone?\n\nApart from having acting chops, Rebecca is also an advertiser's darling, having endorsed everything from cars to jewellery, supplements and skincare. She has even appeared on the covers of numerous fashion magazines and flew around the world to attend fashion shows and events before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHere are some facts to know about the down-to-earth star and her dream man.\n\nTheir first date lasted for six hours\n\nIn the\n\nJanuary issue of Her World magazine\n\n, Rebecca shared how she was first met Matthew, an assistant vice-president of corporate branding at PSA Singapore,\n\nSet-up by her makeup artist friend, Rebecca met him at a group dinner where she claimed they barely spoke the first time they met. But he got her number that night and they met a week later for dinner in Dempsey.\n\n\"This time, he sat opposite me, and I remember thinking to myself, 'Wow, he's actually really good-looking.'\"\n\nShe told Her World they had dinner for three hours, followed by \"a long drive for another three\".\n\n\"Basically from the east to the west and back again with the windows down, sometimes conversing, sometimes in silence. It just felt so comfortable.\"\n\nHow she knows he's The One\n\n\"When I realised that I just want to spend every possible moment with him. Whether I have a really good or bad day, I just want him to be the person by me. When I think of my future, I see him in it.\"\n\nShe added: \"I feel so right in his company. Whether we're talking, doing something together or just doing nothing in silence, it's so easy. It feels like we've known each other for a long time.\"\n\nShe wants a simple wedding\n\nRebecca already had an idea of what her ideal wedding would be. During an\n\ninterview\n\nwith AsiaOne at a jewellery brand event, she revealed that she isn't keen on the idea of a destination wedding as it involves too much planning, and rules out a beach wedding as she hates the sun. Instead, she prefers having a simple solemnisation ceremony followed by a buffet spread.\n\nSimplicity is also key when it comes to her\n\nengagement ring\n\n. She described her dream ring as a simple ring with a small but shiny and good-quality diamond. Based on the\n\ndiamond ring we saw from her pix\n\n, she got her wish after all.\n\nShe can get ready in two minutes\n\nShe proclaimed that the shortest time she has taken to get ready is two minutes, as it involves \"just brushing my teeth and splashing my face with water.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the longest time she has taken to get ready is when she's at shoots, and could take up to three hours.\n\nThe Pupil ignited her passion for acting\n\nMatthew, who didn't know his wife-to-be is a TV sweetheart, could start by watching The Pupil.\n\nRebecca got the leading role in the critically acclaimed 2010 Channel 5 legal drama. It was her first full-time contract role, and she went on set the next day after sitting for her final exam paper at SMU.\n\nPlaying an apprentice lawyer called Wendy Lim, she held her own among veteran actors like Adrian Pang and Janice Koh. She eventually won the Best Actress in a Leading Role award at the 2010 Asian Television Awards for her performance and credited the show for making her fall in love with acting.\n\nShe struggled with Mandarin\n\nRebecca, who is now effectively bilingual, can double up as Matthew's interpreter.\n\nSurrounded by English-speaking friends and family, she got an A2 for her O-level Chinese but was unable to speak it well. In interviews with the media, she has talked about how she had to repeat a simple line, \"Mr Chen, you have a meeting at 3.30\" over 20 times when she acted for the first time in the 2006 drama Family Matters\n\nbecause she couldn't get it right.\n\nShe was also heavily criticised for her poor command of Mandarin in 2008's The Truth where she co-starred with\n\nJoanne Peh\n\nand Tay Ping Hui. Undeterred, she took Mandarin lessons, listened to\n\nChinese music\n\nand read magazines like i-Weekly. All the hard work paid off. She is now one of the most prolific Channel 8 actresses. She even landed her first Hokkien-speaking role in the 2018 dialect drama Eat Already? 4.\n\nHer American dream isn't over\n\nSo Rebecca lost the role of Astrid Leong-Teo to British actress Gemma Chan in the Hollywood blockbuster\n\nCrazy Rich Asians\n\n.\n\nBut her road to Hollywood stardom hasn't ended. In February 2021, The Celebrity Agency, which manages Rebecca,\n\nsigned\n\na partnership with Bohemia Group. Alongside other local celebs, Bohemia will help them seek out international acting opportunities.\n\nShe is passionate about charity work\n\nJust as the\n\ncircuit breaker\n\nmeasures kicked in in 2020, Rebecca and her assistant\n\npacked and delivered 400 care packs\n\nto the elderly and less privileged staying in one-room flats and frontline heroes in essential services such as taxi drivers and cleaners.\n\nThe actress has been quietly doing philanthropic work for the past few years, organising Chinese New Year lunch and lo hei sessions with old folks who live alone and delivering care packages with her fan club members. She is also a\n\nGoodwill Ambassador\n\nof the Singapore Cancer Society where she helps raise awareness of the fight against cancer.\n\nThis article was first published in Her World.

The reef draws about 5 million visitors a year.\n\nThe north-eastern state will be a major battleground when Mr Morrison returns to the polls before May, seeking a fourth consecutive term for his party, with his conservative coalition winning the majority of seats there in the last election.\n\nAustralia\n\nOCEANS\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\nTOURISM & TRAVEL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 22, 2025, 06:11am\n\nAustralian-American woman to become first Singapore-born to travel into space\n\nFeb 22, 2025, 12:14am\n\nAustralian caught with banned items tries to flee S'pore with someone else's passport\n\nDec 11, 2024, 04:04am\n\nS'pore man, 27, remains in custody in Australia for alleged murder\n\nNov 14, 2024, 10:48pm\n\nNew camp for SAF soldiers on Exercise Wallaby in Australia now operational\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19723f5a99c7cc53e94d9d197aa0aed16532f1dba781ae373c93a695ac1fd355/md_barrierreef_28012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Great Barrier Reef came close to being listed as an endangered World Heritage Site by the UN in 2021.", "caption": "The Great Barrier Reef came close to being listed as an endangered World Heritage Site by the UN in 2021.

Chaos at the startline, 2017\n\nIn what was a disastrous start to the 2017 race, three top drivers - Red Bull's Max Verstappen, as well as Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen - collided barely 10 seconds after powering off.\n\nVettel had swerved aggressively towards his left, sandwiching Verstappen between him and teammate Raikkonen, resulting in a wipeout of the front row.\n\nThe incident dented the German's title hopes as rival Lewis Hamilton took full advantage and went on to win the race, extending his lead in the overall table, one that he held onto till the end of the season.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen, as well as Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen - collided barely 10 seconds after powering off.

Mercedes' Hamilton and Nico Rosberg both had to slow down and swerve to avoid Alonso's stationary Ferrari.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nWebber's taxi ride on the sidepod of Alonso's Ferrari was a gesture that many fans enjoyed but the stewards took a dimmer view of the Spaniard's generosity, meting out penalties to both drivers.\n\n3. Mariah Carey slips in front of crowd, 2010\n\nThe Singapore Grand Prix was graced by American pop diva Mariah Carey in the 2010 edition. PHOTO: SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX\n\nFamous for its off-track concerts, the Singapore Grand Prix was graced by American pop diva Mariah Carey in the 2010 edition. She was belting out her signature tunes when gravity got the better of her and she took a tumble on stage.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nHer back-up dancer helped her get back on her feet as she continued singing the 1991 hit Make It Happen. She completed the remainder of her 90-minute set in front of a 35,000-strong crowd all while barefooted.\n\n4. Alonso and 'crashgate', 2008\n\nAlonso's win was shrouded in controversy as he was found to have received a sporting advantage when his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr crashed deliberately. PHOTO: ST FILE\n\nAlonso's win in the inaugural 2008 race was shrouded in controversy as the Renault driver was found to have received a sporting advantage when his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr crashed deliberately on the 14th lap.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nPiquet crashed into the circuit wall at Turn 17, resulting in the deployment of the safety car while the debris was cleared. Alonso had made an early pit stop in the 12th lap after starting with a light fuel load to seize an early lead. This allowed the Spaniard to outpace the other cars while they were pitted under safety car conditions. Alonso subsequently won the race despite being 15th on the starting grid.\n\n5. Felipe Massa's fiery pit stop, 2008\n\nA dreadful mistake during the pit stop saw Ferrari's Felipe Massa exit the garage with a fuel hose dangling from his car. PHOTO: SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX\n\nAfter starting the 2008 race in pole position, Ferrari's Felipe Massa's hopes of winning the race were dashed when a dreadful mistake during the pit stop saw him exit the garage with a fuel hose dangling from his car. The Brazilian went the full length of the pit lane before the team's mechanics removed the hose from his car. He rejoined the race at the back of the pack and finished the race in 13th.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nThe Singapore result put Massa seven points behind Lewis Hamilton at the top of the Drivers' Championship and to add salt to the wound, the Brazilian eventually finished the season one point off Hamilton's title-winning tally of 98 points.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nLong-term F1 deal could enhance S'pore race experience, legacy: Analysts\n\nNew set of challenges awaits Singapore when night race returns\n\nJeremiah Ong\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nGRAND PRIX\n\nformula one\n\nFormula 1\n\nSINGAPORE GRAND PRIX\n\nSingapore GP\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 10:35pm\n\nJuliet Heng surprises herself with historic silver medal at Asian Fencing C'ships\n\n1\n\nJun 7, 2025, 11:33pm\n\nFrom TikTok to trendy sports, Queensway shops find ways to thrive amid retail disruption\n\nJun 7, 2025, 11:31pm\n\nSingaporean athletes at World Masters Games prove age is no barrier to fitness\n\nJun 2, 2025, 11:29pm\n\nS'pore triathlete Ben Khoo smashes his own national Ironman record in Hamburg\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nChina Market Revival - Here’s Why It Matters\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3550286571a9cc81314216a728bd0b5769afbf810536843ad4b6d2d00630e33e/hzlist270122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Singapore Tourism Board and promoters have announced a new seven-year deal to continue hosting a Formula One race here.", "caption": "The Singapore Tourism Board and promoters have announced a new seven-year deal to continue hosting a Formula One race here.

I know I can do it.\"\n\nThe 2m Berrettini, who possesses a top-spin forehand nearly as heavy as Nadal's, lost their only meeting in a semi-final at the 2019 US Open in straight sets.\n\nMedvedev, the tournament favourite, needs to find his reserves of energy after two long, torrid examinations just to get to the semi-final.\n\nHaving already spoiled Djokovic's quest for a 21st Slam in last year's US Open final, the world number two Medvedev could this time stand in Nadal's way - if he can again get past Tsitsipas.\n\nMedvedev was kept on court for more than eight gruelling hours in beating American serve-volleyer Maxime Cressy then Canadian ninth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime just to reach the semi-finals.\n\n\"I never had this experience. I'm going to try to recover as well as possible, to be ready to play against Stefanos, because he's a great player.

He pulled up well. He'll be running on Feb 13 in Class 3 over 1,200m Poly,\" he said.\n\nNot many trial or race winners dipped below the 59sec mark.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe course record for the track and distance is 57.70sec set by Poly kingpin Nova Swiss in 2017.\n\nThe thing is Sacred Gift won without his rider working overtime. This suggests the horse is on the way back to the winner's circle.\n\nThe six-year-old Australian-bred had 21 starts under Walker for four wins, three seconds and four thirds. He has earned $165,878 in prize money.\n\nMost of Walker's horses were transferred to fellow Kiwi Donna Logan, who has been successful with Brutus and King Arthur.\n\nRidden by French jockey Marc Lerner yesterday, Sacred Gift jumped well and tracked the grey My Man and Ablest Ascend.\n\nBehind him were Gold Star, Starharmony and the five-time unbeaten Lim's Kosciuszko, who was just out to stretch his legs.\n\nMy Man straightened up first via the shortest route home under jockey Oscar Chavez.\n\nAblest Ascend, who had leading rider Manoel Nunes aboard, went wide. Sacred Gift moved up in tandem, even wider.\n\nPushed by Chavez, My Man kicked nicely clear. But Sacred Gift narrowed the gap slowly but surely under his own steam.\n\nHe went past the leader within the shadows of the winning post to win by 3/4 lengths. Ablest Ascend, a four-time winner, finished third, 11/2 lengths away.\n\nSacred Gift rarely runs a bad race. He never finished further than fourth in his last eight starts.\n\nHis last win was on June 19 last year, when he scored in Class 4 over the Poly 1,100m in a smart 1min 04.60sec.\n\nIn his last start on Nov 27, the final day of the Singapore racing season, he finished fourth to Heartening Flyer. That was in Class 3 over the Poly 1,200m.\n\nHe lost by only about three lengths.\n\nOn yesterday's trial victory, Sacred Gift is certainly on the comeback trail. Watch him in his next assignment.\n\nThe Daniel Meagher-trained newcomer It's Complex won his second trial yesterday morning to rate as a horse to follow.\n\nRidden by Danny Beasley, the Lucky Stable-owned five-year-old, who arrived with a rating of 61, was the meat in the sandwich between the leader War\n\nWarrior and The Bullet. Grand Fighter was last. The field was depleted after three horses were scratched.\n\nIt's Complex straightened wide, taking The Bullet along. The trio got back together and It's Complex went on to beat War Warrior by half a length under a good hold. He clocked 1min 00.71sec.\n\nThe South African-bred was also successful in his first trial. That was on Dec 30. He clocked 1min 01.31sec then, also unextended.\n\nHe looks a nice type, certainly one for the notebook.\n\nYesterday's Kranji barrier trial results:\n\nTRIAL 1 1 Winning Hammer H 2 Anara (S Shafrizal) 3 Knight Command (L Beuzelin) 4 Captain Legacy (M Nunes)  5 Lim's Moreready (D Beasley) Margins and time: 1, 5, 2 1/2, 1 1/4 (59.65sec)\n\nTRIAL 2 1 It's Complex H (Beasley)  2 War Warrior (S John) 3 The Bullet (Nunes) 4 Grand Fighter (N Zyrul) Margins and time: 1/2, 1 1/2, 6 1/4 (1:00.71)\n\nTRIAL 3 1 Boy Next Door (Shafrizal) 2 Konan (Beuzelin) 3 Mo Almighty (Nunes)  4 Sun Fortress (K Faiz) 5 Lim's Force (Beasley) Margins and time: 3/4, 5 3/4, nk, 2 (1:02.44)\n\nTRIAL 4 1 Sacred Gift H (M Lerner) 2 My Man (O Chavez)  3 Ablest Ascend (Nunes) 4 Gold Star (R Shafiq)  5 Lim's Kosciuszko (Beasley)  6 Starharmony (Beuzelin) Margins and time: 3/4, 1 1/2, 3 1/4, 1 1/2, 1 (58.81sec)\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f3674d80442ee10f15b783981a01a075dabbd4c647570afb0a60ecffdca28cc1/raccccc.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "(Above) Sacred Gift racing past the grey My Man in the final of four trials at Kranji yesterday morning.

The combination was successful on May 29 last year.\n\nST PHOTO: SALWA SUANDI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 27, 2022, 03:56pm\n\nProdigal is worth the wait\n\nClements-trained 4YO is back to his preferred 1,400m event on turf in tomorrow's last race\n\nShare this article\n\nProdigal is looking great in his work, in preparation for tomorrow's last race at Kranji.\n\nThe Michael Clements-trained four-year-old's final gallop on Tuesday in 38.1sec for 600m was superb. It was with gusto.\n\nHe should now be spot-on for the $50,000 Class 4 event over 1,400m on turf.\n\nIt is precisely the course and distance that I have made him my top bet of the 11 races.\n\nHe won his only race from six starts over the 1,400m on turf. From that Restricted Maiden race on May 29 last year, we saw what an engine the chestnut gelding has.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nHis win was very impressive. Few would have expected him to extricate himself from a hopelessly boxed-up position to score with his blistering finish.\n\nLet us retrace his run.\n\nHe was one of the last to leave the starting stalls. But he moved up swiftly to a beautiful fifth spot on the inside - albeit travelling very keenly.\n\nHe still looked a bit green, that being only his second start. But you know he would progress to deliver the winning blow, as jockey Shafrizal Saleh had plenty in the tank.\n\nBut his chances suddenly vanished shortly after straightening. He started to play with his head, giving his rider a hard time. He had to stop riding and straighten him.\n\nTwo horses came up on his outside. With a wall of horses in front, he was shut out.\n\nAt that moment, those who had their money on the $51 shot would have lost hope. He had dropped to about eighth position and the winning post was looming.\n\nBut Shafrizal persevered. He rode as if his life depended on it. He angled out when the dream opening appeared.\n\nOnce he saw daylight, Prodigal lengthened his strides. Hopes came alive again but he needed luck. The winning post was approaching.\n\nThe rest was history. Prodigal made it. He got up to beat Golden Sprint by half a length in 1min 23.75sec.\n\nThat mesmerising victory was imbued in many, yours truly included. This horse certainly has an engine.\n\nAfter his fourth behind stablemate Sahabat over 1,200m, which was a tad short, Prodigal nearly scored again over 1,400m on turf.\n\nAgain he showed greenness by throwing his head up several times in the early stages.\n\nBut he came home well to beat all but the promising Red Ocean, who has since won twice, including his last start, and is the favourite in tomorrow's Race 8.\n\nClements then gave Prodigal a near four-month break. His charge resumed on Nov 6 and ran third to First Bowl over the Polytrack 1,200m.\n\nHe followed up two months later with a fourth to First Chief, also over the Poly 1,200m.\n\nSo, from his all-on-board showings after his unplaced debut, it is evident that Prodigal is one who always gives his best.\n\nIt is also clear that he is better on turf and 1,400m is his preferred distance, for now. He gets it tomorrow.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nChina Market Revival - Here’s Why It Matters\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0d65c9253232baf8d5ceb74cd9bc373c41da3208394b2319b16a16a6af6caca6/race_2c.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jockey Shafrizal Saleh will be looking to repeat his victory on Prodigal (No. 15) in the last race at Kranji tomorrow.

They have the benefit of experience over likely improver (8) GENTLEMAN JOE, who caught the eye on debut over this track and trip. Navy Strength was drawn wide on that occasion, so it could pay to follow his progress from an inside gate.\n\n(3) AL BUGATTI and (11) PETROSSIAN showed improvement in their last start and should have their say.\n\nWatch the betting on (7) FUTURISMO. The newcomer could take home a cheque.\n\nRACE 3 (1,000M)\n\n(3) DOUBLE CHARGE and (6) TRANSACT are unexposed over this trip but could enjoy it.

On the evidence of his creditable sixth in the Queen's Plate, he should appreciate the step-up to this trip.\n\n(1) ZAPATILLAS was also drawn wide when finishing ahead of Pacaya in the Guineas, so will likely pose a threat if he can overcome Gate 10.\n\n(2) NEVER ENDING RAIN and (3) UNIVERSAL are closely matched on that form and could make their presence felt with improvement likely over this trip.\n\n(5) WAITING FOR SUMMER, (7) SENSO UNICO and (10) MASTER REDOUTE are also capable of staking their claims over this distance.\n\nRACE 7 (1,000M)\n\nThe exciting (4) REAL GONE KID was receiving 3kg and benefited from superior fitness when getting the better of Equus Champion (1) RIO QUERARI. He then warmed up for this with another all-the-way success. He will, however, find this a tougher assignment with Rio Querari expected to strip fitter and well in at level weights.\n\n(2) BOHICA and (3) KASIMIR are tough sorts who should acquit themselves competitively.\n\n(6) BEREAVE and (7) CAPTAIN FONTANE are relatively unexposed and may improve to make their presence felt.\n\nA big threat could also come from stablemates (11) TRUE TO LIFE and (12) HELLO WINTER HELLO, who arrive in peak fitness.\n\nRACE 8 (1,600M)\n\n(1) CAPTAIN'S RANSOM made light work of her rivals when winning this Group 1 race as a three-year-old. She should relish a return to this distance after winning a 1,800m Grade 1 last time.\n\nFillies Guineas winner (8) CHANSONETTE was beaten in that race and is 0.5kg worse off, but should pose a threat again.\n\n(3) PRINCESS CALLA and (4) SHE'S A KEEPER have a bit to find on that form but could pick up the pieces if those rivals fluff their lines.\n\nRACE 9 (2,000M)\n\n(4) JET DARK won a 1,800m Grade 1 as a three-year-old and defended his Queen's Plate title last time. However, there are stamina doubts in his pedigree, so it could pay to follow the progress of Durban July hero (5) KOMMETDIEDING, who chased that rival home in the Queen's Plate.\n\n(6) LINEBACKER was disappointing in that 1,600m Grade 1 but is unbeaten over this trip (both also Grade 1). He is worth another chance.\n\nGuineas winner (11) DOUBLE SUPERLATIVE is open to any amount of improvement going this distance for the first time.\n\n(10) MARINA, a winner of two of her last three starts, and (1) DO IT AGAIN have their say, too\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/faaa8fb4e1fcdd1e0521923e1d47d9f9659769ffa144dd97721ade86d37b530e/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1e42f2ebaf825e27fbdd96b8eb09029f407904f0079182b89b5cf6da850cce04/IMG_0407.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "Group 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The premises remain vacant to date.\n\nJustice Choo said that in the present case, the primary obligation to lease has not been rendered impossible by Covid-19 nor Covid-19 measures.\n\nHowever, a contract may also be frustrated when the effect of an unforeseen event thwarts the common purpose of the parties when they entered into the contract, said the judge.\n\nHe said the fact that the landlord applied for temporary permission to use the premises as a restaurant reinforced his view that the landlord had intended the premises to be used as a music lounge.\n\n\"With the imposition of Covid-19 measures and the closure of night-time entertainment venues, it was obvious that this purpose cannot be achieved,\" he said.\n\nSelina Lum\n\n, Senior Law Correspondent\n\ncourts\n\nBARS & CLUBS\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 24, 2022, 11:14am\n\nTwitter wins S'pore court fight to stop start-up from registering similar bird logo\n\nFeb 22, 2022, 12:11pm\n\n8 weeks' jail for man who used NRIC details he mistakenly received to redeem face masks\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4d53abfc7c9bbda38d8c853807f04315c983b18b8b5b4519493bb0b912c8e6d7/yq-lknc-27012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Lookers Music Cafe did not pay more than $360,000 in rent for 10 months.\n", "caption": "Lookers Music Cafe did not pay more than $360,000 in rent for 10 months.

She said the dog was a 12-year-old miniature schnauzer who suffered from an eye disease and kidney failure.\n\n\"The whole thing was very regretful,\" Dr Chow, 41, told The Straits Times on Jan 18. \"We were grieved beyond words about the medical negligence that has occurred and at the same time, guilty that we were part of it.\"\n\nDr Chow and her husband, Mr Shaun Koh, 44, lodged a complaint to the Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) and Mount Pleasant Veterinary Group (MPVG), which treated Ah Bee in its hospital at Jalan Gelenggang.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:24am\n\n'We cannot halt time': Vet advice on caring for a senior pet\n\nMore related stories\n\nBoth organisations said in separate statements that investigations into the incident are underway and that they were in contact with the dog's owners.\n\nAVS group director Jessica Kwok said in a statement: \"AVS will investigate allegations of professional misconduct, negligence, and contravention of the Code of Ethics for Veterinarians. Enforcement action will be taken where appropriate.\"\n\nWhen contacted, MPVG field director Bessy Chua said: \"We are taking steps to ensure our existing rigorous protocols for prescribing and dispensing medications are upheld to prevent errors.\"\n\nShe added: \"What we can confirm is that we have no reason to believe pimobendan had an adverse impact on his (the dog's) health or outcome.\"\n\nPimobendan is a medication used to treat dogs with heart failure, according to vet publication VCA Animal Hospitals. It stated that common side effects include decreased appetite or diarrhoea, and these can last longer in pets with kidney disease.\n\nDr Chow said that Ah Bee's health worsened after a surgery last May to treat his poor vision in his old age. He later developed kidney failure and internal bleeding and in December, the couple were told Ah Bee had only months left to live.\n\nFollowing a discussion with the vet, Mr Koh made the call to euthanise Ah Bee to end his suffering as the dog became lethargic, refused to eat, kept vomiting and had bloody diarrhoea.\n\nBut as Dr Chow cleared Ah Bee's medications the next morning, she noticed pimobendan tablets labelled for another dog. A photo of the delivery instructions showed the dog - Romeo - was to be fed half a tablet twice daily - a total of 5mg.\n\nPimobendan tablets wrongly issued to Dr Donna Chow's dog. He had taken these pills for two days.PHOTO: DRDONNACHOW.COM\n\nDr Chow said her family did not check the label at first as there were many tablets issued to Ah Bee. Having fed Ah Bee three doses of the pimobendan pills over two days, she feared it may have worsened his health in his final days due to an overdose.\n\nShe said the hospital later acknowledged to her that the wrong medication was issued and told her that the vet who operated on Ah Bee was not a specialist.\n\nThe hospital declined to comment on the specifics of Ah Bee's case, saying it had to adhere to the code of ethics for vets and out of respect for the family's privacy.\n\nIt later said there were no board-certified eye specialists locally at the time of Ah Bee's surgery.\n\nThere was no evidence that the surgeon ever claimed to be an eye specialist, but she was experienced and had successfully carried out this surgery many times over the past seven years, the hospital said.\n\nThe ordeal prompted Ah Bee's owners to lodge an online petition to urge for a review of the governance of pet healthcare here and has garnered more than 10,400 signatures as at Thursday (Jan 27).\n\nAll vets and clinics in Singapore are licensed and regulated by AVS under the Animals and Birds Act, said AVS group director Jessica Kwok, who added that it inspects clinics to ensure they comply with licensing conditions.\n\nShe said AVS has been studying the need for a professional entity to improve professional standards for the sector and had engaged those in the industry since early-2021.\n\nWhen asked, professionals refrained from commenting on Ah Bee's case on the urging of AVS as investigations are ongoing.\n\nBut speaking generally, animal welfare advocate and former executive director of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) Jaipal Singh said that the effects of pimobendan can depend on the animal's health, dosage given and possible interaction with other drugs.\n\nDr Jaipal urged the public not to make generalisations about vets, which can be a disservice for many professions who work hard for animal health and welfare.\n\nDr Haoting Chow, honorary editor of the Singapore Veterinary Association, said that it was normal for surgeries to be done by general practitioners, who have played a key role in animal healthcare long before specialists worked here.\n\nAction For Dogs president Ricky Yeo urged owners to read the labels on all medication issued.\n\nBy\n\nOsmond Chia\n\nRead articles by Osmond Chia\n\nanimals\n\neuthanasia\n\nDoctors\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 11, 2025, 04:22am\n\nYouth who performed lewd act on cat given probation, must attend intervention\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:52am\n\nWill you give Frodo the Singapore Special a fur-ever home?\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJun 27, 2025, 07:49am\n\nKitten allegedly rolled in container at Tuas adopted, NParks investigating\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a1e66b7fb4ea3f8b2132ff099f988a60598b166129e78de4ff939204fe31a129/yq-ocpet-27012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Shaun Koh (left) and Dr Donna Chow share a final moment with their deceased miniature schnauzer, Ah Bee.", "caption": "Mr Shaun Koh (left) and Dr Donna Chow share a final moment with their deceased miniature schnauzer, Ah Bee.

The video was accessible by anyone who had the link to the video.\n\n\"The accused claimed that she took down the video from TikTok within an hour because she received several negative comments online criticising her behaviour. However, the accused retained the video recording on her handphone.\"\n\nAn unknown person later got hold of the clip and uploaded it onto Facebook with the victim's image blurred out.\n\nOn Jan 3 last year, the victim's son came across the Facebook post. He recognised his father and the maid, and alerted police later that day.\n\nThe video remained on the Facebook page as at June 15 last year. By then, there were more than 14,000 views, 90 comments and 157 reactions.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19220bd70d512678f5ea4401483e7b5f4095bb475ef0645e4df3c339a1ebb707/yq-mdtktok-27012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "She was sentenced to 17 months' jail after she pleaded guilty to two counts of recording the victim in the nude without his consent.\n", "caption": "She was sentenced to 17 months' jail after she pleaded guilty to two counts of recording the victim in the nude without his consent.

Victory in Saturday's final would make her the first local to win the Australian Open since Chris O'Neil in 1978.\n\nBarty said she could not wait to play on Saturday.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 23, 2022, 02:33am\n\nTennis: World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty announces shock retirement at just 25\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Absolutely. Let's do it,\" the beaming Australian said on court. \"It is unreal. Honestly, it is just incredible.\n\n\"I love coming out here and playing in Australia and, as an Aussie, we are exceptionally spoilt that we are a Grand Slam nation (and) we get to play in our backyard and I am just happy that I get to play my best tennis here.\n\n\"I've done well before and now we have a chance to play for a title. It is unreal.\"\n\nShe paid tribute to her American opponent, who endured a difficult 2021 following some health issues but has started the season brightly.\n\n\"It is just so nice to see her back where she belongs. She is an amazing human being,\" Barty said of Keys.\n\n\"You see the way she carries herself on the court. She smiles and she gives it her best. But I love most that she is a great person. We really respect her and we love her.\"\n\nWhile the women's semi-final was a tame affair, things were far more fiery in the men's doubles semi-finals, with tennis' bad boy Nick Kyrgios smashing a racket and flipping a finger at the crowd as he and partner Thanasi Kokkinakis ensured an all-Australian Melbourne Park men's doubles final for the first time in 42 years.\n\nKyrgios and Kokkinakis defeated third seeds Horacio Zeballos and Marcel Granollers 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 to set up a final on Saturday against fellow Australians Matt Ebden and Max Purcell.\n\nThe combustible Kyrgios hit boiling point as he complained about the net cord machine, then pulled out of a service motion at 4-2 in the first set.\n\nHe also complained that the Rod Laver Arena crowd were yelling in between first and second serves, despite the fact that he and Kokkinakis had been whipping up the fans into a boorish frenzy.\n\nHe flipped a finger at one section of the crowd, petulantly threw a ball against a wall and smashed his racket after he dropped his serve.\n\n\"When are you going to control the crowd, bro?\" he pleaded with the chair umpire, James Keothavong. \"You're gonna keep letting them scream before I serve? It happened four times that game.\"\n\nThe Kyrgios complaints about the crowd echo those of some of his opponents earlier in the tournament, and seem surprising given his partner Kokkinakis had said \"the rowdier the better from everyone\".\n\nDaniil Medvedev took aim at sections of the crowd following his singles victory over Kyrgios a week ago, saying: \"They probably have a low IQ.\"\n\nQuarter-final doubles opponent Michael Venus then labelled Kyrgios an \"absolute knob\" for his antics on court.\n\nBut Kyrgios said he would not rise to the jibe after his semi-final win with Kokkinakis.\n\n\"I'm not going to destroy (Venus) in this media conference room right now,\" he said.\n\n\"But Zeballos and Granollers are singles players. They've had great careers. I respect them a lot more than I respect Michael Venus.\"\n\nThe controversy has not only been to do with the yobbish behaviour of spectators.\n\nKyrgios accused a coach and trainer associated with Croatian doubles pair Mate Pavic and Nikola Mektic of threatening to fight him after the top seeds were bundled out.\n\n\"Just letting you know after yesterday's chop fest in doubles my opponents coach and trainer proceeded to threaten to fight in the players gym,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nKokkinakis responded: \"That was crazy!!

It's extremely difficult because you have to do work which I think a lot of people would rather not do because they're concerned with their own safety, their health, their family, but you are doing your very best,\" she added.\n\n\"I hope on a daily basis, people will remember that and will continue to show their support and appreciate the work that you do.\"\n\nIn her speech, Madam Halimah also noted that The Straits Times last week published a book, In This Together: Singapore's Covid-19 Story, chronicling the nation's fight against the pandemic.\n\nAfter her speech, she interacted with the MOH staff before presenting them with a token of appreciation.\n\nSaid Ms Josephine: \"I felt very honoured and very touched that the President shared how much our efforts meant to her. It makes all the long hours (that I have contributed) worth it.\"\n\nAnother person who received a token of appreciation was Mr Samuel Goh, an executive officer at the epidemiology team at the MOH. The 28-year-old, who worked as a pharmacist previously, said he decided to join MOH in September 2021.\n\nMr Goh said: \"The reason why I decided to switch to a career in public health is to be able to achieve a greater impact in terms of positive health outcomes.\"\n\nSince then, he has been involved in investigating Covid-19 clusters across Singapore and variants of notable concern, such as the Omicron, and surveilling potential clusters across Singapore.\n\nAs contact tracing sessions take place on a daily basis, Mr Goh, who lives with his grandmother, parents and younger sister, said he often has to sacrifice family time.\n\n\"My family has shown a lot of understanding in terms of the change in work hours and the additional risk that they are facing. They have been checking on me regularly, so I am really grateful for their support,\" he added.\n\nMr Goh described his first visit to the Istana as an eye-opening experience, and added: \"I think this event is a nice gesture and a good opportunity to show recognition to not just the people in my team, but also other task groups that have been an integral part to MOH's operation.\"\n\nYeo Shu Hui\n\nHalimah Yacob\n\nistana\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 15, 2025, 06:54am\n\nEx-president Halimah Yacob calls out deepfake video of her, says it's 'completely false'\n\nSep 13, 2024, 09:53am\n\nAre we sacrificing the well-being of delivery workers?\n\nSep 13, 2023, 05:04am\n\nPresident Halimah bids farewell to Istana staff\n\nAug 10, 2023, 02:21am\n\n'These are emotions which you cannot control': President Halimah bids farewell at NDP 2023\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fd62b6c4a3fda23842b1fdd74ffa066cbc3562c251122ca5de5abde187d65815/mi_halimah_270122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "President Halimah Yacob tears up as she speaks during an appreciation event for Covid-19 service staff, at the Istana on Jan 27, 2022.", "caption": "President Halimah Yacob tears up as she speaks during an appreciation event for Covid-19 service staff, at the Istana on Jan 27, 2022.

Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University to offer programmes and fellowships to journalists here, said SMT's English, Malay and Tamil Media Group editor-in-chief Warren Fernandez.\n\nHe added that the plan in the longer term is for the SPH Media Academy to extend its programmes to the whole media industry in Singapore, and also to some journalists around the region.\n\nMr Fernandez was giving an update on the work of SMT since it was set up on Dec 1 when he stressed that talent development was one of the key focuses for the not-for-profit entity.\n\nCiting The Straits Times' senior health correspondent Salma Khalik, he said she had written authoritative pieces on the Covid-19 pandemic which were widely read, helping to raise awareness about the issues and also counter misinformation.\n\nHe added that she had built up her knowledge and insights on the subject from covering the health beat for many years, and said The Straits Times would need journalists like her who can cover issues from climate change to trade and technology.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 12:27pm\n\nST has Government's full backing to stay relevant in

this regard, the new academy will play an important role in training journalists, especially in helping them hone their digital skills.\n\nDescribing the academy as a huge investment, Mr Fernandez said that for a start, the academy will review and revamp all of SMT's existing training programmes to make sure that they are relevant in this digital age.\n\nVeteran journalist Paul Jacob, who is deputy editor of The Straits Times, has been appointed dean of the academy.\n\nMr Jacob, who has covered defence and was also a foreign correspondent in Indonesia in the 1990s before becoming an editor on the foreign and political desks, will have a team made up of representatives from all of SMT's newsrooms.\n\nMr Fernandez said this will ensure that all newsrooms have training programmes tailored to fit their needs.\n\nGiving a glimpse into the academy's plans, he said that it will partner with the best international media training institutions to offer programmes and fellowships for journalists.\n\nThe academy has signed an agreement with the Poynter Institute in Florida and is firming up an agreement with the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University to participate in its fellowship programmes.\n\nIt will also build on existing partnerships with the World Association of News Publishers and Adjunct Professor Mario Garcia of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, as well as work with local institutions such as Nanyang Technological University, the National University of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, and the Civil Service College.\n\nFor a start, the academy will focus on training journalists from SMT, but it will \"bring in others and grow that as we go along\", said Mr Fernandez.\n\nHe added: \"The point is about using this to not just skill up our people but help develop the whole media industry, the whole ecosystem that we have in Singapore, and also bring in journalists from around the region for some of these programmes, and then form relationships and partnerships with them.\"\n\nSPH MEDIA TRUST\n\nSKILLS TRAINING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22,

The longer runway is intended to help reposition Singapore again as a business and lifestyle destination and ensure the country maintains its competitive edge in the long term.\n\nThe last two night races were cancelled\n\ndue to the pandemic while last year's edition was the last of the four-year extension signed in 2017. Singapore Airlines' title sponsorship also ended last year.\n\nThe latest contract is from 2022 until 2028 with this year's race scheduled for Oct 2 at the Marina Bay Street Circuit.\n\nMr S. Iswaran, Minister for Transport & Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, said: \"Even as we deal with the immediate challenges of the pandemic, it is important that we focus on our recovery and long-term growth.

Some, like in Bahrain, Spain and Monaco, early in the year had reduced capacities before venues in Austria, England and the United States began welcoming full houses.\n\nThe majority of races required adults to be fully vaccinated and/or supply a negative test result though mask wearing and social distancing were loosely enforced.\n\nSingapore has already hosted several international events in recent months.

ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIM\n\nThe Singapore Grand Prix is on a different scale though.\n\nThe 2019 race, the last time it was staged here, drew a three-day total of 268,000 spectators - the second-highest after the 300,000 total at the 2008 maiden race.\n\nOverseas visitors generally comprise 40 per cent of race-goers here and the race weekend contributes about $130 million annually in tourism receipts.\n\nThere have been 12 editions since 2008 and together, they brought more than 550,000 unique foreign visitors, contributing over $1.5 billion in tourism receipts.\n\nThe tourism sector was battered by Covid-19. Last year, there were 330,000 visitor arrivals and an estimated $1.9 billion in tourism receipts - much lower than the 2.7 million arrivals and $4.8 billion in receipts in 2020.\n\nIt is also only a fraction of the 19 million visitors and $27.7 billion in receipts from before the pandemic in 2019.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFormula One: Singapore GP open to circuit revamp with NS Square project due to start in 2022\n\nLunch With Sumiko: What car does F1 boss Chase Carey drive?

The new site, scheduled to start construction in March, will be completed by the end of 2025.\n\nLast year's F1 drivers' championship was one of the most dramatic in recent memory, with\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen claiming his first world title\n\nat the season finale in Abu Dhabi, beating seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes under controversial circumstances.\n\nIn this year's provisional calendar released by F1 last October, it listed a record 23 races.\n\nThe 2022 season begins on March 20 in Bahrain. China will again not host a race for the third straight year due to the pandemic. Excluding the Middle East, there are only two races in Asia, Singapore on Oct 2 and the Japanese GP a week later.\n\nAs recently as 2013, there were six stops in the region - Malaysia, China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and India.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nIn the Driver's Seat: One of closest title battles in history ends in confusion, controversy\n\nSporting Life: On an electric F1 night, a gritty celebration of sport\n\nJonathan Wong\n\n, Assistant Sports Editor\n\nformula one\n\nSINGAPORE GRAND PRIX\n\nSingapore GP\n\nF1\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 4, 2024, 02:02am\n\nHPL asks to halt trading ahead of Ong Beng Seng's court session\n\nOct 3, 2024, 11:31pm\n\nProperty tycoon Ong Beng Seng to be charged on Oct 4\n\nSep 20, 2024, 11:13am\n\nF1 rakes in big bucks but not everyone benefits from it\n\nSep 17, 2024, 07:10am\n\nLive screening of Singapore Grand Prix at 5 community hubs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBest USD Fixed Deposit Rates in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/853aafa7611bf900c498235e1e43d7bbc1e068c88af2b2ee3a3e60f922e409e8/hzgp270122stfile.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "With international travel showing some signs of recovery, the agreement is the longest renewal with the Formula One Group.", "caption": "With international travel showing some signs of recovery, the agreement is the longest renewal with the Formula One Group.

The other son was identified as Aston Yap Kai Shern.\n\nAt about 3.10pm on Thursday, Yap was seen arriving at the scene in a black van. He wore a red shirt and dark pants and walked with his head lowered. He was handcuffed and surrounded by police officers.\n\nHe was then taken to the canal, the area around which had earlier been cordoned off by the police.\n\nPolice officers were seen surrounding the area, preventing outsiders from entering.\n\nBefore Yap entered the canal, which was wet and grimy, he put on into knee-high black boots.\n\nTwo officers were seen placing at least four arrow markers in the area.\n\nOne marker was placed at the playground, near an exercise machine, one was placed in the canal, while another was placed on the steps leading down to the canal.\n\nMany offerings of snacks, flowers and notes had been placed on a path by the canal.\n\nAs Yap walked past the offerings, he looked at them for a moment.\n\nHe and the officers then climbed into the canal and walked on until they were out of sight.\n\nYap was in the area with the police officers for about 35 minutes, and was then taken away in the black van he had arrived in.\n\nSome investigating officers remained at the scene.\n\nAt about 5pm, these officers also left and the police cordon tapes were taken down.\n\nThe two boys were found in the canal between 4.23pm and 6.25pm last Friday.\n\nYap had called the police for help on Friday. He\n\nwas arrested the next day.\n\nThe boys are believed to have had special needs and attended a school in the Eng Kong estate area.\n\nDuring the court proceedings on Monday, the police prosecutor asked for Yap to be remanded for one week with permission to be taken out for investigations, including scene visits.\n\nThe case has been adjourned to Jan 31 for further mention.\n\nPolice said the boys were found on Friday evening lying motionless in the canal and were pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic.\n\nIf convicted of murder, Yap faces the death penalty.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nRosalind Ang\n\nMURDER/MANSLAUGHTER\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4f114f2c38e3db41519cd49d0c2435810ebab2428ab4c07303cf92a7473a31c4/xavieryap.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Xavier Yap Joun Houn taken by the police to the canal near the Greenridge Crescent playground on Jan 27, 2022.", "caption": "Xavier Yap Joun Houn taken by the police to the canal near the Greenridge Crescent playground on Jan 27, 2022.

They are intended to discourage the excessive consumption of disposable bags and promote the use of reusable ones.\n\nThe guidelines are part of governmental recommendations to cut waste generated in Singapore.\n\nThe majority of supermarkets in Singapore will be expected to implement this mandatory charge in their stores. The charge will not apply for online purchases.\n\nSupermarkets will also need to disclose the number of bags they issue, the total amount charged for them and how they use the proceeds.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 29, 2025, 01:20am\n\nWhat is the difference between the many locally farmed eggs in Singapore?\n\nMore related stories\n\nEnvironmental groups have been calling for a charge on disposable bags for years. A 2018 study done by the non-profit Singapore Environment Council found that shoppers take 820 million disposable carrier bags from supermarkets a year, an average of 146 bags a person.\n\nSuch efforts led the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment (MSE) and NEA to convene a work group in September 2020 to address the excessive consumption of disposable items in Singapore.\n\nDiscussions of this work group, which comprised 55 members of the public of diverse backgrounds, resulted in the recommendation of a charge for disposable carrier bags in January 2021.\n\nAfter three months, NEA and MSE then collectively agreed to develop an appropriate charging model for disposable carrier bags at supermarkets in Singapore.\n\nThe NEA crafted the guidelines announced on Thursday after consultation with over 1,000 stakeholders on various platforms and through focus group discussions, as well as looking at case studies from abroad.\n\nPublic feedback on these guidelines are now being sought through Reach, the Government's feedback unit.\n\nThe topics currently put up for feedback are the proposed charging model, amount to be charged, coverage of the scheme, and the implementation timeline.\n\nReaders keen to provide feedback on the guidelines can do so from Friday to Feb 17 at this website:\n\nhttps://go.gov.sg/feedbackcarrierbagchargepr\n\n.\n\nGena Soh\n\nSUPERMARKETS\n\nTAXATION\n\nShopping\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 19, 2025, 05:45am\n\nDon Don Donki brings back plastic bags after 7 months of discontinuance\n\nMar 25, 2025, 11:39pm\n\nFairPrice launches $1m fresh protein initiative for vulnerable groups\n\nMar 25, 2025, 12:16am\n\nCold Storage, Giant customers can expect cheaper products, wider variety after takeover\n\nMar 24, 2025, 05:54am\n\nAll Cold Storage, Giant outlets in S'pore to be sold to M'sia group this year\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dffb4e99bbf4975c19d22e05b770e2df1890082b721c00dd276335273091afef/AK_ntuc_270122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "NS55 credits can be used at FairPrice outlets.", "caption": "NS55 credits can be used at FairPrice outlets.

Which is more than can be said for him, at least on social media.\n\nThose reacting to the video were mostly supportive and many called for him to be named and shamed.\n\nColleen said it happened five years ago. She has moved on, and is apparently happy with her life now.\n\nHere is one of her videos:\n\nView post on TikTok\n\n@colleeeniie\n\n#storytime\n\n#fyp\n\n#foryoupage\n\n#kidneydonor\n\n♬ I am at ur moms house - Elizabeth Chetwynd\n\nDATING/RELATIONSHIPS\n\nsocial media\n\nKIDNEY DISEASES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/01a8648ae9581d7a205e001d60ca07b0eacb6b2e4cc6b52958215c2b8ffc6227/kidney27new.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "COLLEEN LE / TIKTOK"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

For even though he is only 37 years old, he has trouble standing up on his own - the result of end-stage chronic kidney disease.\n\n\"My legs are very, very weak... when I go up a kerb, I have to get someone to help me balance,\" Mr Sharil, who has been on dialysis for about a year and a half, told The Straits Times on Wednesday (Jan 26).\n\nDr Behram Ali Khan, medical director of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), said that there has been a worrying increase in patients with chronic kidney disease here in recent years.\n\nA person is said to have this condition when they have had kidney disease for more than three months, he said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 22, 2025, 11:45pm\n\n'I was very shocked': Man with active lifestyle diagnosed with kidney disease\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn Singapore, this is typically the result of hypertension, diabetes, or a combination of the two.\n\n\"Both of these conditions are very prevalent in Singapore,\" said Dr Behram, adding that based on several studies, about two out of three Singaporeans are at risk of developing chronic kidney disease in their lifetime.\n\n\"There's a continuous and progressive trend of more patients entering dialysis every year,\" he said, noting that the NKF has been seeing over 100 applications for admission every month, up from about 60 per month a few years ago.\n\nAssociate Professor Jimmy Teo, head and senior consultant at the Division of Nephrology in the National University Hospital's Department of Medicine, said he has also seen more patients referred for kidney disease in recent years.\n\nReferring to the Singapore Renal Registry Annual Report 2019, which was published in mid-2021, Prof Teo pointed out that the number of patients on definitive dialysis here had almost doubled from 741 in 2010 to 1,202 in 2019.\n\n\"If you have the same number of doctors and nurses and facilities, you cannot cope with that. If it comes in a big wave, then that's when you have a big problem - which is essentially where we're at now, at the cusp, or seeing the early part of it,\" said Prof Teo.\n\nDr Behram said there are a number of factors that could lead to someone developing chronic kidney disease. These include genetic predispositions, being overweight, a sedentary lifestyle, diet, smoking, and old age.\n\nProf Teo said that Singapore's ageing population, combined with greater screening efforts, could be behind the rising number of patients in recent years.\n\nIn the case of Mr Sharil, his condition was the result of a love for sugary drinks in his younger days, as well as a reluctance to seek help for nearly two decades.\n\nAfter being diagnosed with diabetes in the late 90s, he did not get any professional treatment for his condition until 2020, as he worried about the financial costs.\n\n\"After (diagnosis), I went to National Service, and my salary was not that high. I needed to give money to my family as well... at the time I was young, so I didn't think much of it, I thought never mind, sure can cure,\" he said.\n\nHis condition worsened until one day in 2020, he realised he was so breathless he could not walk or even lie down. After going to the hospital, he was told his lungs were full of fluid and his kidneys were no longer functioning.\n\n\"How I wish I could turn back time! I would take better care of myself,\" said Mr Sharil.\n\nDr Behram said there are several ways to tackle chronic kidney disease, including treating underlying conditions such as high blood pressure and high sugar.\n\nA kidney transplant is the best option for those with kidney failure, he added, encouraging people to donate their kidneys as the waiting time for a kidney from a deceased donor here is very long.\n\nDr Behram said that lifestyle modifications are important too, such as exercising more, monitoring weight, quitting smoking, and eating better.\n\nProf Teo added that this includes avoiding added salt, eating lots of fruits and vegetables, and choosing whole grains. This is to avoid overloading whatever kidney function is still intact.\n\nSuch lifestyle modifications can also help to prevent chronic kidney disease from developing in the first place.\n\nProf Teo also said that 80 to 90 per cent of patients with diagnosed kidney disease will need medication. These include a new class of drugs known as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, or SGLT-2 inhibitors.\n\nSuch drugs block sugar and sodium from being reabsorbed by the kidney.\n\nOne particular drug, dapagliflozin, not only treats diabetes and high blood pressure but also reduces the progression of chronic kidney disease, said Dr Behram.\n\nProf Teo and Dr Behram both agreed that early screening and treatment is also critical in tackling the disease.\n\n\"If you are above 30 and have any other risk factors like high blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, are overweight or have family members with kidney disease, you should definitely get medically screened,\" said Dr Behram.\n\nProf Teo said that identifying the disease early and preventing it from progressing is \"the most crucial task\" to focus on.\n\nHe added: \"Get treated earlier. There are some breakthroughs in treatment that can significantly reduce the risk of end-stage kidney failure... you can make a positive impact on your life.\"\n\nTimothy Goh\n\n, Health Correspondent\n\nKIDNEY DISEASES\n\nDOCTORS/SURGEONS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 4, 2025, 01:05am\n\nSingapore's pioneer kidney transplant surgeon dies at 95\n\nJul 8, 2024, 04:04am\n\nMother of 2 is first woman to don SOC red beret\n\nJun 11, 2024, 03:05am\n\nMan, 70, has a kidney that is almost 100 years old\n\nDec 14, 2023, 09:34am\n\nTaiwan hospital removes over 300 kidney stones from woman who prefers bubble tea to plain water\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/22dd18944ea326c159a51d3da9d5f869cbb4032332f786e5ba795b5cd371097e/AK_mss_270122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Mohamed Sharil Sham has end-stage chronic kidney disease and  has been on dialysis for about a year and a half.", "caption": "Mr Mohamed Sharil Sham has end-stage chronic kidney disease and  has been on dialysis for about a year and a half.

Omicron is now the dominant variant in Thailand, accounting for 94.6 per cent of patients. The Delta variant accounts for 5.4 per cent.\n\nThe Omicron variant accounts for virtually all imported cases, with Delta making up the remaining 0.6 per cent.

But it enjoys the unanimous support among the 54 African federations.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 11, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nKopitime: There should be live screening, watch parties for ACL Two\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn his speech, Infantino stressed the importance of making football more inclusive for countries outside of Europe.\n\n\"This topic is not about whether we want a World Cup every two years, but about what do we want to do for the future of football,\" he said. \"If we think about the rest of world and the vast majority of Europe, then we have to think about what football brings.\n\n\"Football is about opportunity, about hope, about the national teams. We cannot say to the rest of world, 'Give us your money, but watch us on TV.' We need to include them.\n\n\"We need to find ways to include the whole world to give hope to Africans so that they don't need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find maybe a better life but, more probably, death in the sea.\"\n\nThe Swiss added that the biennial World Cup might not be the answer to the migrant crisis.\n\nHis comments were met with anger, with HRW European media director Andrew Stroehlein saying: \"My colleagues at Human Rights Watch interview refugees around the world pretty much every day.

The case was referred to the coroner and investigations showed that the cause of death was dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n\"We seek the public's understanding to avoid speculation or spreading of rumours that may add to the family's grief during this difficult time.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt details her medical history with the two centres - stating that she was first admitted to the NUHCS for management of her cardiac condition in July 2021.\n\nIt said: \"At the time, Covid-19 vaccination was not assessed to be a direct cause of her heart failure. Other causal factors such as genetic causes were considered, taking into account her family history.\"\n\nIt adds that later in September, Ms Seah underwent a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) heart scan, with the results suggesting that an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle) was the underlying cause of her condition.\n\nThe statement adds that she then sought a second opinion and treatment for her cardiac condition at the NHCS in December 2021.\n\nIt said: \"During her hospitalisation, the medical team discussed with her and her family on how to better manage her cardiac condition with various device implantation options,\n\n\"As the patient needed time to consider the options, a follow-up appointment was scheduled in January 2022. Unfortunately, she passed away a day prior to the appointment. NHCS has met the patient's family and addressed their concerns.\"\n\nEarlier, a social media post on Facebook by a user named Neubronner Jeremy - who identified himself as her boyfriend in other posts - said Ms Seah's heart issues began after her vaccination.\n\nIt read: \"It was sometime in May that she took her second Pfizer vaccination. By June, she was having heart palpitations.\"\n\nThe post was accompanied by a photo of a memo signed by a \"Dr R Wong\" from NUHCS dated October 2021 which read: \"The above is suspected to have Covid vaccine side effects on the heart. Kindly consider an alternative Covid vaccine as the booster regime.\"\n\nAccording to the post, Ms Seah died at home on Jan 12.\n\nThe Straits Times has contacted the user for comment on the NUHCS and NHCS statement.\n\nMs Seah's death triggered condolence posts on Facebook accounts related to the local football scene.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nUnvaccinated 92-year-old woman is first Omicron-related death in Singapore\n\nNavigating the bumps in Singapore's road to living with Covid-19\n\nRelated Stories\n\nOmicron variant can survive up to 21 hours on skin: Study\n\nChina's mRNA vaccine triggers immune response in 95% of recipients in first stage of trial\n\nHong Kong researchers discover oral drug combination that could treat Covid-19\n\nOmicron 'sub-variant' throws up new virus questions\n\nPfizer CEO sees annual Covid-19 vaccine rather than frequent boosters\n\nHow did S'pore leaders handle Covid-19?

It is a story of a strong, loving family that plays tennis together.\n\nWhat do you know about the Williams family when you first read King Richard?\n\nReinaldo Marcus Green:\n\nI didn't know much about the family at all. I wasn't an avid tennis fan. My allegiance was to Venus and Serena as Black excellence in the sport. I would say that of Tiger Woods, too.\n\nDirector Reinaldo Marcus Green (left) with Will Smith on the set of the movie, King Richard.PHOTO: WARNER BROS.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut, in learning about the family, it became such a rich tapestry. The script was great-Zach Baylin wrote a beautiful screenplay. Part of my job was to work with him to figure out how to make it deeper. What we were looking for, what we were trying to say? And those were the things that we spent the next few months trying to hammer home in the process.\n\nThe story about a father of athletes resonated with you. How are you connected with the script?\n\nMy father, in his mind, was raising two baseball players. So we - similarly to the Williams - spent the first third of our life on a baseball diamond. I don't remember much of my childhood outside of the baseball field. I played on countless teams, all-star teams and travelling baseball.\n\nWe grew up in a single-parent household, so I had a father who was always there. We just assumed that that's how most people grow up with their parents - with this overabundance of love and commitment of time that our father gave to my brother and I.\n\nI played college baseball. I had two major league tryouts. I didn't make it, but I had taken it pretty far. I knew what it was like to be a high-level competitive athlete and what that challenge is like - the things that you face, the pressures once you get to a certain level.\n\nWhat do you want to bring to your film?\n\nWhat was more important than making a tennis movie was making a movie about a family - a family that plays tennis. We all know that Venus and Serena are two of the greatest athletes of all time… but what makes our film special? Those are the questions that I ask myself. Let's dig deeper into this family.\n\nThe Internet portrays Richard to be one way, and the family portrays him to be another. This isn't just about two girls who were robotically playing tennis and becoming champions. They were two girls who were infested with love. They had the full support of older sisters and parents who devoted their lives to making the girls' lives richer - not in terms of money, but in terms of how they treat themselves, how they respect themselves. That's the journey that you see and that we go on in the film.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nHow was it working with Will Smith not only as your Richard but also as a producer?\n\nI thought it was a perfect role for Will for a lot of reasons. He's definitely of an age in his life where I thought he can give the gravitas to this particular performance.\n\nI had seen Will in Concussion (2015) and a couple of other movies where he had taken some prosthetics or taken an accent to certain levels... I wanted to make sure whatever we were going to do for this film was not going to be a distraction to the performance itself.\n\nIt was about finding the balance with somebody as eccentric and as well-known as Richard is. But Will Smith is playing that role. So part of it was, how do we make Will disappear? So it was about really finding the right level of prosthetics to offset his look enough for him to disappear. He's still handsome, despite eating muffins for a couple of months!\n\nEverybody levels up when Will Smith is in a scene. So, you get incredible performances by virtue of how giving he is offscreen. He didn't run to the trailer when it was time for the girls to be on-camera; he was there.\n\nAunjanue Ellis (left) as Oracene 'Brandy' Williams in King RichardPHOTO: WARNER BROS.\n\nWhat about Aunjanue Ellis who plays the girls' mum, Oracene?\n\nI can't say enough amazing things about Aunjanue. We all know it's called King Richard, but our secret weapon is really Oracene Price. She should get all the credit in the world for what she was able to bring to breathe life into that mother. She just brought depth and dimension.\n\nAnd the girls who play Venus and Serena, Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton, are also unbelievable...\n\nThey are just great actors. We were fortunate that they had some experience coming into this. This wasn't their first rodeo. Saniyya had worked with legends, Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. Demi had worked with a legend in Forest Whitaker.\n\nWhat was truly a revelation for us was how close they were going to become as sisters. They love each other. There were times where it was, like, \"Hey guys, we're rolling. Come on!\" They were just sisters. It was amazing. But, it wasn't just the two of them. All five girls - Mikayla LaShae Bartholomew, Daniele Lawson, Layla Crawford, along with Saniyya and Demi - were truly a family.\n\nDemi Singleton, Serena Williams, Venus Williams and Saniyya Sidney attend the 2021 AFI Fest Closing Night Premiere screening for King Richard at TCL Chinese theatre in Los Angeles on Nov 14, 2021.PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nI thank their real parents because they were on-set every single day. You have some set moms and dads who just drop them off - but these were sitting with them, making sure that they got lunch, making sure they got to school.\n\nIt's a testament to a story of parenting, in front of and behind the camera. These girls could not do it without their parents being there. It was amazing to watch.

I understood stopping life for a little while, but they cannot continue to stop life because of politics. And right now they're stopping because of politics.\"\n\nHe added: \"If I die, I die, but I'm not going to be controlled.\"\n\nWhile it is not known if the legendary singer was vaccinated, it did not stop Stern saying on his SiriusXM radio show on Tuesday (Jan 25): \"Poor Meat Loaf got sucked into some weird f***ing cult. And somehow really believed that - he made a statement, 'I'd rather die a free man than take that vaccine'. And now he's dead.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nMore related stories\n\nStern, 68, who is known for his no-holds-barred style, added: \"I wish the family would come forward and say, 'Ya know, when Meat Loaf was laying there in the hospital and he couldn't breathe, he said, 'I made a mistake. I should have taken the vaccine'. Like all these anti-vaxxers, they all say, 'I made a mistake'.\"\n\nHe expressed on The Howard Stern Show last week that hospitals should not admit unvaccinated patients.\n\nAddressing anti-vaxxers, the shock jock said: \"It's time for you to get it. Now, if you don't get it, in my America, all hospitals would be closed to you.\n\n\"You're going to go home and die. That is what you should get.

On the beach, you need to wear the mask.\n\n\"I prefer the UK restrictions because it's going to be very difficult to visit the family there. I'm fully vaccinated but I don't want to get the vaccine every nine months.\" -\n\nEngland previously lifted restrictions on July 19, so-called \"Freedom Day\", but then introduced new rules as the Omicron wave arrived.\n\nHealth minister Sajid Javid credited the country's booster programme for allowing restrictions to be lifted.\n\n\"Our vaccines, testing and antivirals ensure we have some of the strongest defences in Europe and are allowing us to cautiously return to Plan A, restoring more freedoms to this country,\" he said.\n\nFrom Thursday, passengers on London's transport network will still be required to wear face masks but they will no longer be mandatory in secondary school classrooms.\n\n\"It was traumatic for them, they couldn't hear the teachers, the teachers couldn't hear them,\" Ms Hynes said of the mask rules in school.\n\nUS holidaymaker Ethan Letson, 24, agreed with London Mayor Sadiq Khan's decision to mandate face coverings on the capital's trains and buses.\n\n\"I still wear the mask on public transport, I will wear it in very crowded areas like the Underground. It's so tight down there, you could get sick at any time,\" he said.\n\nUnlike Scotland and Wales, which set their own health policy, England kept nightclubs and bars open over the festive period.\n\nBut businesses still took a heavy hit as punters stayed at home.\n\nHospitality workers in the business district around St Paul's said things had only just started to improve.\n\n\"The last week, business has started to pick up again. Around Christmas it was dead,\" said bartender Lewis Colby, 39.\n\n\"People aren't so scared anymore, trains are busier coming into work, people are starting to drink more.\"\n\nDespite the lifting of restrictions, those who test positive for coronavirus must still self-isolate for a minimum of five days.\n\nMr Johnson said he also hopes to scrap those rules when they expire on March 24.\n\nBritain\n\ncovid-19\n\ncoronavirus\n\nVACCINATED TRAVEL LANE/VTL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 15, 2024, 10:49pm\n\nS'pore govt officer in London warned for leaving kids home alone\n\nAug 31, 2024, 04:39am\n\nOasis concert tickets relisted for more than $10k minutes after pre-sale\n\nAug 28, 2024, 12:16am\n\nAdele invites Singapore fan onstage at her concert in Germany\n\nAug 14, 2024, 03:33pm\n\nTaylor Swift set for emotional London return after terror threat\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6d65b9b8dc9f2111268e96dbd460210426d1478e3c779bcfd0669852fe60c474/md_englandcovid_27012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Despite the lifting of restrictions, those who test positive for Covid-19 must still self-isolate for a minimum of five days.", "caption": "Despite the lifting of restrictions, those who test positive for Covid-19 must still self-isolate for a minimum of five days.

And while he does not leap over tall buildings in a single bound, he is a pretty mean miler on the racetrack.\n\nHero has still to demonstrate super-equine qualities - but he is getting there.\n\nThe son of Warrior's Reward was a good winner at the trials on Tuesday morning and, if he can bring that form to the races, he could be super, indeed.\n\nHero had Manoel Nunes doing the navigating in that 1,000m hit-out and the Brazilian jockey would have had nothing but praise for the way Hero handled himself.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nCarrying the No. 1 saddlecloth in the last of five trials, Hero was parked fourth on settling and improved to third when the field fanned out for that run home.\n\nNunes was never bothered that Victorem (Mohd Zaki) and Broadway Success (apprentice Jerlyn Seow Poh Hui) were battling for the lead.\n\nHe just kept Hero interested as he warmed the saddle from his vantage point in third spot.\n\nIt was the second time that Nunes was riding Hero in a trial. But this latest one would have seemed so different.\n\nIn that earlier trial a fortnight ago, Hero was no hero. He plodded along, finishing last of seven runners and some eight lengths behind the winner, Longhu.\n\nYet, there he was on Tuesday morning, ears pricked and eager to get on with the job.\n\nNunes continued to keep him in check until the furlong mark.\n\nThen, and as if he was releasing the handbrake on a souped-up roadster, he sent Hero after the leaders.\n\nJust like that, it was job done.\n\nHero hit the front at the 150m mark and then pulled away to win by 13/4 lengths.\n\nBroadway Success slotted in second, with Victorem a long way back in third.\n\nHero had arrived at Kranji in late November 2020 after having run in three races in Australia, where he finished second on one occasion.\n\nThat was in a 1,600m race at Swan Hill in Victoria.\n\nHe had his first start last July and, two starts later, he opened his Kranji account.\n\nThat was over the mile and he won it with a sustained run from way back in the field.\n\nRizuan Shafiq had taken over riding duties from Danny Beasley and Hero would have given him a good feel when winning by half a length.\n\nHowever, the next time Hero goes to the races, just have a punt on him - never mind who is in the driver's seat.\n\nIf Nunes felt good winning on Hero, it must have felt even better when he steered Dixit Dominus to take the first trial of the morning.\n\nIn months and years gone by, we have seen horses score easy wins on Tuesday and Thursday mornings when trials are run.\n\nBut few - if any - would have been easier than the winning run by Dixit Dominus.\n\nThe three-year-old from Michael Clements' yard simply broke the hearts of his rivals.\n\nSent to the front soon after the jump-out, he was seven lengths clear at the 600m mark.\n\nInto the straight and he began to pull away even more.\n\nIndeed, with 250m to go, he had built up such a commanding lead that the other runners would have needed a pair of binoculars to catch sight and keep track of that fast-fading figure of Nunes on Dixit Dominus.\n\nFor the record, Dixit Dominus went on to win by 201/2 lengths and he ran the 1,000m in a not-too-shabby 60.69sec - easing up.\n\nThe three-year-old had an inauspicious debut, finishing fifth to Dancing Light on Jan 8.\n\nThat was then. Now is now. And right now, you do not need to understand Latin to know that Dixit Dominus is in a good place.\n\nWait for him to have his second race start.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBuilding Wealth at Every Age: Essential Strategies for Your 20s, 30s, 40s & Beyond\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/05b5b6d1e056521b1062faee7ad5f63495628bef21649e03b87199c1d6bb7f4e/race_5c.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Fitzsimmons-trained Hero in his first Kranji win on Aug 15.

That day, he was the first leg of that Jerlyn Seow \"double\".\n\nHe will again have Singapore's only woman jockey in the saddle on Saturday.\n\nIt is a good booking as, sure as ever, she has a good record on the gelding.\n\nIt is worth noting that when The Shadow last won, it was in a Class 5 event as was the case when he ran second to Kimitonara in November.\n\nHe now has to take on Class 4 opposition. Can the Michael Clements-trained runner defy promotion?\n\nAs for Brutus, he was impressive when he beat War Pride a fortnight ago.\n\nThat day, when ridden by Rizuan Shafiq, he came from third at the top of the stretch to beat War Pride by a neat length.\n\nIt was his second win on the trot, having won in October when trained by Mark Walker. He is now under the care of Donna Logan.\n\nBrutus has won four races at Kranji - with four different jockeys. Ruan Maia was the first. Next came Hakim Kamaruddin.  Then Seow and, last but not least, Shafiq.\n\nCome Race 3 on Saturday, he will have Shafiq in the saddle.\n\nElliot Ness slots in light for jockey Wong Chin Chuen in Race 6. His last win was way back in April but his recent shows have been commendable.\n\nAt his last start, his saddle slipped back shortly after the start placing his rider, apprentice Seow, at a huge disadvantage.\n\nHorse and jockey still managed to continue well and hold down fourth spot.\n\nA handsome chestnut who races in the colours of the Fortuna NZ Racing Stable, Elliot Ness is closing in on $100,000 in earnings.\n\nA win on Saturday - which is not out of the question - could be the tipping point which sends him into the six-figure club.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nThe Business Times\n\nSecurity, scale and savings: How zero trust boosts defences while driving business transformation\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6885f4b5b207541496609051316f0e9dca4f19d6d7bf5f1153d3a06ccb1b397c/race_12f.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Brutus beating War Pride in a Class 4 race over 1,200m just a fortnight ago.\n", "caption": "Brutus beating War Pride in a Class 4 race over 1,200m just a fortnight ago.

He also won five medals across four World Table Tennis (WTT) Youth Contender events in Europe.\n\n\"These really motivated me because I didn't have much success (previously), except being the world No. 1 so they meant that I was heading in the right direction, said the Secondary 4 student, who is aiming to qualify for the Commonwealth and Asian Games and World Table Tennis Team Championships this year.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 20, 2024, 09:51am\n\nKoen Pang, Izaac Quek stun China's world No. 1 pair to reach WTT finals\n\nMore related stories\n\nTeammate Jingyi also has a busy year ahead after making the step up to the national team. The 16-year-old, who was the youngest member of the team that retained Singapore's bronze medal at last year's Asian Table Tennis Championships, admitted that the transition has not been easy as she had to change her playing style, which resulted in her not being able to sustain rallies for as long as before.\n\nZhou, who is now a full-time player, said: \"I told myself that it's a normal process... Things will pick up slowly again and it is getting better now, so it's a good change.\"\n\nShe will compete in three WTT Youth Contender events in Europe next month, where she hopes to win a medal or reach the finals, before she turns her attention to her medal target at the SEA Games.\n\nShe added: \"More importantly, I hope to be able to get more exposure and see how adults and people better than me play so that I can learn from them and become a better player myself.\"\n\nWednesday's awards ceremony at the SSP's Woodlands campus also saw badminton player Jaslyn Hooi picking up the Annabel Pennefather Excellence accolade alongside fencer Cheung Kemei.\n\nHooi, 21, clinched the biggest title of her career last September, winning the women's singles at the Polish International.\n\nShe said: \"Winning (the title) felt really good but thinking back, I'm also really happy about the progress that I've made because we're always focusing on something to improve on and when I won, I felt like what I've been doing is right and it motivates me to be better.\"\n\nWorld No. 100 Hooi is aiming for an individual medal at the Hanoi SEA Games in May and hopes to break into the top 50 this year after seeing the success of teammates Loh Kean Yew and Yeo Jia Min.\n\nShe said: \"We do the same training so when they succeed, I look back at what they've done differently so that I can learn from them. What inspires me is their commitment, dedication and effort put into training.\n\n\"That makes me believe that Singapore badminton can make it to the world stage generation after generation and I hope more players can be like them.\"\n\nBy\n\nLaura Chia\n\nRead articles by Laura Chia\n\ntable tennis\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS SCHOOL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 19, 2024, 11:03pm\n\nSportSG dismisses poison pen letter's claims against Feng Tianwei\n\nNov 11, 2024, 10:59pm\n\nKoen Pang and Izaac Quek qualify for World Table Tennis Finals\n\nOct 19, 2024, 11:24pm\n\nTable tennis 'train-ing' at Esplanade MRT station\n\nOct 12, 2024, 11:10pm\n\nKoen Pang, Izaac Quek bag silver at Asian Table Tennis Championships\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9f8f9b6983415bb5df1191bce33b49084ce490156936103184f367221941661a/hzpaddlers260122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Izaac Quek (left) and Zhou Jingyi were awarded the Moo Soon Chong Outstanding Student-Athlete of the Year (Secondary).", "caption": "Izaac Quek (left) and Zhou Jingyi were awarded the Moo Soon Chong Outstanding Student-Athlete of the Year (Secondary).

A rate of more than one shows that the number of new weekly Covid-19 cases is increasing.\n\nSingapore reported 4,560 new community coronavirus cases on Wednesday.\n\nAbout 65 per cent of them or 2,983 were detected by antigen rapid tests, indicating that they had no symptoms or only mild symptoms.\n\nThe remaining 1,577 were detected through polymerase chain reaction tests.\n\nA total of 272 Covid-19 cases were imported.\n\nAs at Wednesday, Singapore recorded a total of 327,602 Covid-19 cases, with 850 deaths.\n\n91 per cent of Singapore's eligible population have completed the full vaccination regimen, and 56 per cent of the total population have received their vaccine booster shot.\n\nBy\n\nNadine Chua\n\nRead articles by Nadine Chua\n\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH)\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nThe Straits Times\n\n'Nobody deserves to be alone': Why this couple has fostered over 20 children in the past 22 years\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ad78c89b203c9660ee2cee87ca4fc28c6f66a89d549fdc3f8b5061a6778ace29/yq-oxy-26012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Singapore reported 4,560 new community coronavirus cases on Jan 26, 2022.", "caption": "Singapore reported 4,560 new community coronavirus cases on Jan 26, 2022.

These are the highlights of the PAC's findings:\n\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra)\n\nThe AGO had flagged weak controls over user accounts that had full access to the operating system of Acra's online filing and information retrieval system, BizFile+.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance informed the PAC that the root causes were oversight by an Acra officer; the authority's vendor not following procedural controls; and software incompatibility issues. Going forward, Acra will emphasise the AGO's findings in staff training programmes and incorporate advisories into compliance checklists among other measures.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 3, 2025, 10:38pm\n\nGE2025: WP to get two NCMP seats in the next Parliament, on top of 10 elected MPs\n\nMore related stories\n\nHealth Promotion Board (HPB)\n\nAbout 341,000 fitness trackers not put to use for the HPB's National Steps Challenge resulted in $5.39 million of public funds being wasted. Some of the units had become mouldy and the warranties for all the excess trackers had expired at the end of 2021.\n\nThe Ministry of Health told the PAC that HPB had over-estimated demand for the trackers and pre-emptively topped up its stock.\n\nObsolete or faulty trackers have since been disposed of, while the working ones have either been used to replace and exchange for faulty trackers and those with expired warranties, or to support various companies in their health initiatives.\n\nMoving forward, HPB will adopt smaller batches of initial and top-up buys, and monitor demand on a real-time basis. It has also started daily accounting for trackers at various distribution points, and will conduct a full stock count bi-annually.\n\nResponding to the AGO's findings about lapses in the management of HPB's loyalty programme between April 2018 and June 2020, the statutory board said it took action to claw back the rewards from those who had made improper redemptions.\n\nSome $6,300 worth of rewards had been paid for by HPB out of $14,900 worth of health points accumulated by 594 accounts belonging to people who have died. The board also lodged a police report over the fraudulent accounts which have been frozen.\n\nHPB is exploring the integration of SingPass data for authentication and verification by the end of this year.\n\nHealth Sciences Authority (HSA)\n\nThe AGO had found that HSA had been buying required items like chemicals, laboratory devices and consumables on an ad hoc basis instead of aggregating its requirements and purchasing them through tenders.\n\nThe authority's total expenditure on small value purchases between April 2018 and June 2020 was substantial, at $8.02 million. There were also lapses in its outsourced IT contracts and IT application controls.\n\nHSA has since established period contracts or framework agreements where feasible; tightened processes; stepped up controls and checks; and instituted proficiency courses and briefings for both staff and outsourced vendors.\n\nHousing Board (HDB)\n\nHousing grants totalling $405,000 were disbursed to ineligible applicants, and the AGO had found that quotations for some items could have been created or altered to give the impression that they were obtained from other suppliers.\n\nHDB has since recovered grants disbursed to ineligible applicants, verified those who were eligible or correctly assessed for their grants, and requested additional documents from others. One applicant could not be contacted as at the end of last year.\n\nOther steps taken by HDB include the establishment of procedures on income assessment and automated checks on declarations and eligibility where possible, by March this year.\n\nFor the irregularities in quotations, the root cause, according to the Ministry of National Development, was a supervisory lapse on the part of consultants and HDB staff. A police report has been made, and a demerit point system implemented to guard against any future lapses in diligence, among various measures.\n\nMaritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)\n\nThe AGO found several lapses and errors in a $430,000 tender for event and venue management services for a 2018 MPA event. The MPA officer in charge had also engaged in detailed discussions with the tenderer that was later awarded the contract, before the tender approving authority had made a decision.\n\nThe Transport Ministry told the PAC that a panel of investigation was appointed to scrutinise the past three years of tenders handled by the same project team. Action will be taken against officers found accountable for \"weak supervision and leadership\" and \"poor-quality staff work\", among other issues.\n\nMPA has committed to improving both staff training and procurement policies and procedures through manuals, briefings, centralised processes and other initiatives.\n\nMinistry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)\n\nThe AGO had called for improvements in both ministries' administration of facility management contracts. It had found supporting documents created or backdated to satisfy AGO's queries, and weaknesses in MHA's integrated logistics management system. Both ministries eventually made police reports on the possible fabrication or falsification of records.\n\nMOE and MHA told the PAC that their lapses were due to people and process factors, including inadequate monitoring, poor or complete lack of documentation and overly prescriptive specifications, among other reasons.\n\nBoth ministries said they would strengthen oversight and step up checks.\n\nMOE has held the relevant managing agents accountable while rectifying overpayments and underpayments made. It has also rolled out a mobile app for school personnel to report facility management-related faults.\n\nFor MHA, a task force was set up in June last year to propose enhancements to processes and map out training and learning opportunities for officers.\n\nNational Arts Council (NAC)\n\nThe NAC had been found to have lapsed in the rental management of its 37 arts housing premises, with 74 non-tenants using its spaces for activities unrelated to the arts.\n\nThe PAC was told that NAC was aware and supportive of tenants co-locating \"closely-related\" entities at the sites, as these entities help sustain and complement the main art practice. But there was no formal process to approve such entities.\n\nNAC has since cleaned up these entities, issued a circular in July last year on the need to seek official approval, and instituted annual checks.\n\nNational Heritage Board (NHB)\n\nThe NHB had lapsed in record keeping and tender approval, with heritage items missing, bids not evaluated and purchases often made from the most expensive option.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) told the PAC that limitations in IT systems were the root cause, with some parts of NHB still manually maintaining records. Physical objects have since been properly accounted for, records updated, and operating procedures improved.\n\nNHB also engaged an external consultant in September 2019 to streamline its processes, and plans to upgrade its infrastructure for tagging and stock-taking by the end of FY2024.\n\nThe lapses in tender evaluation were attributed to inexperienced procurement staff. NHB has since set up a workgroup to improve future tenders, and established new procurement training and process frameworks.\n\nNational Library Board (NLB)\n\nThe AGO had found lapses in NLB's procurement of a digital film projection system worth $4.75 million. There was inadequate assurance that principles of value for money, fairness and transparency had been adhered to.\n\nThe PAC was told by the Ministry of Communications and Information that the NLB had formed an internal review panel, and identified weaknesses in duty of care on the part of officers involved in procurement, on top of gaps in certain stages of the procurement process.\n\nNLB has also stepped up briefings, guidance and training for its officers, while strengthening its processes and identification of conflict of interest among other improvements.\n\nPeople's Association (PA)\n\nThe PA's management of two large development projects, Our Tampines Hub and Heartbeat@Bedok, had been flagged by the AGO for lapses and possible irregularities. It led to the PA making a police report and suspending staff who may have falsified quotations and doctored documents.\n\nThe PAC was informed that staff oversight was mainly to blame, along with external consultants' lack of familiarity with government regulations.\n\nPrice fluctuations in contracts have been revised and standardised; contract variations reviewed and various processes formalised, MCCY told the PAC.\n\nAmong other measures, a task force has been set up to strengthen governance of Our Tampines Hub, and internal audit checks stepped up across all development projects starting from April 2022.\n\nPublic Service Division (PSD)\n\nMore than 9,000 possible erroneous medical and dental claims paid to ineligible officers or pensioners over a period of more than two years were administered by the PSD, resulting in the possible overpayment of around $500,000.\n\nPSD told the PAC the lapses could be attributed to systems and records not being fully synchronised, as well as human error.\n\nHuman resource and payroll systems will be enhanced to automate updating and include controls to flag anomalies. PSD will also step up efforts to educate and train officers, and perform regular post-payment analytics on claims.\n\nThe PSD and Accountant-General's Department will look into the specific erroneous claims flagged by the AGO.\n\n\"For those which might suggest an intent to game the system, officers would be asked to explain and account for the claims, and stern action would be taken if there were attempts to be dishonest,\" the committee noted in its report.\n\nSingapore Polytechnic (SP)\n\nSP did not put up the required reports concerning two tenderers who had withdrawn their bids before the awarding of the tender.\n\nThe AGO had called such withdrawals a serious matter and grounds for debarment from being awarded government tenders for a period of time.\n\nMOE told the PAC that the relevant SP officer had been unaware of the procurement debarment rules, which had \"inadvertently\" not been communicated to finance officers.\n\nThe polytechnic instituted a new process from July last year, where the office of the director of finance disseminates new finance-related circulars from the Government to all finance section heads at the beginning of each month.\n\nSINGAPORE PARLIAMENT\n\nPUBLIC SERVICE DIVISION\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 28, 2025, 10:51pm\n\nGE2025: Is my vote really secret?\n\nApr 28, 2025, 10:46pm\n\n'Mission Possible': Voting for WP in Punggol GRC will benefit all S'poreans, says Pritam Singh\n\nApr 22, 2025, 03:31am\n\nTearful Louis Ng announces exit from politics, says he wants more time with family\n\nApr 14, 2025, 07:16am\n\nGE2025: Key days and announcements to look out for in the lead-up to the election\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b15f5d720ece4270badb84f6b1765950841e3c1f2096ad469f7b32dcb4ce490b/mi_Sg_260122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Public Accounts Committee asked individual agencies to address causes of their lapses and detail the follow-up actions taken.", "caption": "The Public Accounts Committee asked individual agencies to address causes of their lapses and detail the follow-up actions taken.

Job requirements take priority and hybrid work provisions can be varied depending on the workforce's readiness - for instance, new hires may not be able to work from home as much at the beginning.\n\nPSD said public service officers may also be reskilled to mitigate any disruption to their jobs due to hybrid work arrangements. Personal assistants could take on additional roles in coordination, or knowledge or event management, while counter staff could manage live chats or attend to citizens via video-conferencing.\n\nPSD also has a strategy to look after employee well-being, be it overwork from the blurring of lines between the home and the office, or feelings of social isolation.

These include low-income and single-parent households.\n\nHow much each household receives will depend on the number of people in it. A family of four will receive an average of $250 every month. Reviews and assessments are carried out by volunteers every six months to monitor improvements in the families' conditions, with the amount in donations adjusted accordingly.\n\nWhile Red Cross Singapore has been running the programme since 2013, it is the first time the FairPrice Group has come on board as a sponsor.\n\nFood stall assistant Ng Kok Peng, 46, a beneficiary of the programme, was retrenched from his job as a renovation project manager in January last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Though he was able to find a job subsequently, he had to take a $1,000 pay cut.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 24, 2025, 01:11am\n\nSavings for NTUC Union and Link members, including 50c kopi or teh at Kopitiam\n\nMore related stories\n\nMr Ng, who is a single parent and the sole breadwinner of a family with two children, aged six and seven, as well as the caregiver of his 76-year-old mother, said he struggled to pay his children's expenses.\n\nOn Wednesday (Jan 26), he was presented with $250 in FairPrice vouchers by Singapore Red Cross chief executive Benjamin William and FairPrice Group, Group CEO Seah Kian Peng.\n\nSaid a happy Mr Ng: \"With these vouchers, I can afford expenses for my children without having to worry about whether I can afford daily necessities.\"\n\nSingapore Red Cross CEO Benjamin William (second from right) presenting Chinese New Year goodies to Mr Ng Kok Peng, a beneficiary of the programme.PHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO\n\nThe public can contribute to this initiative by donating to beneficiaries via the Red Cross website or through volunteering, where one can collect and deliver food vouchers and befriend the families.\n\nSo far, more than 30 FairPrice Group employees have signed up to be befrienders for the programme's first cycle. Among them is Ms Isabel Ong, 26, senior executive, partnerships at FairPrice Online.\n\n\"This is not just about giving vouchers. You get to be on the ground and speak to the beneficiaries, and see what other issues they have that were not flagged,\" she said.\n\nOn the importance of befriending, Mr William said: \"Beyond their physical needs, many of these families also need someone to talk to. It is important that we reach out with a human face and human hand when we interact with those in need.\"\n\nThe efforts to assist vulnerable households with their household needs come amid rising inflation, with\n\nSingapore's core inflation rate in December last year\n\nclimbing by its fastest pace in nearly eight years.\n\nMr Seah said helping families manage the cost of living is something that has always been important to FairPrice Group.\n\n\"We have collaborated with the Red Cross for many years but this programme is more significant. It is something very relevant to us, and something we agree we can do more of, especially in this period where Covid-19 hit many Singaporeans very significantly,\" he added.\n\nRyan Goh\n\nFairPrice\n\ncharities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 7, 2025, 07:49am\n\nFairPrice offers discounts on housebrand products over 12 weeks\n\nJan 14, 2025, 04:02am\n\n151 FairPrice outlets to open on Day 1 of Chinese New Year\n\nJan 3, 2025, 06:34am\n\n$6 return voucher for $60 worth of CDC vouchers spent at FairPrice\n\nDec 5, 2024, 07:14am\n\nFalling beer ad injures elderly woman at Woodlands FairPrice\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8dea610e0a68c2810445f299947ae2e5bd158973b3af3726d9f0d9991ef52c05/yq-fairprice-26012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The amount will be committed over a period of three years, and will be dispersed once every six months.", "caption": "The amount will be committed over a period of three years, and will be dispersed once every six months.

I knew I was heading in the right direction,\" the Greek said.\n\n\"The conditions might have changed a bit but so did my mind. I tried to adapt. It just worked.\"\n\nLast year's French Open finalist regained his timing and hit the ball majestically, reeling off 30 winners - 17 on his forehand - and broke Sinner's serve four times.\n\nSinner, rated as one of the hottest young talents on the men's circuit, did not get a break point in any of Tsitsipas' 14 service games and was blown away.\n\nTsitsipas broke immediately when the Italian overhit a forehand and served out strongly to take the opening set in 36 minutes.\n\nThe 23-year-old grabbed another break in the third game of the second set before rain stopped play and forced the stadium roof to be closed with more threatening weather forecast.\n\nHe was relentless and powered his way to a double break in the third set, which gave Sinner no way out.\n\nTsitsipas has reached the semi-finals twice before in Melbourne and became the first Greek player to reach a Major final when he lost to Novak Djokovic in last year's French Open.\n\nSinner was bidding to join compatriot Matteo Berrettini in the semi-finals.\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas\n\nAUSTRALIAN OPEN (TENNIS)\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 24, 2023, 06:10pm\n\n'Different' Tsitsipas powers into Australian Open semi-finals\n\nSep 23, 2022, 10:50pm\n\nTearful farewell as Federer's last match ends in defeat, fiery protest at Laver Cup\n\nApr 17, 2022, 03:35pm\n\nTsitsipas downs Davidovich Fokina to defend Monte Carlo crown\n\nJan 28, 2022, 11:50am\n\nMedvedev takes down Tsitsipas to set up Nadal date in Aus Open final\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d2f323e8ae21b6f3668765459c122d4b8753c4a3ebce3b906cc50192f0c32212/mi_stefanos_260122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas celebrates after winning the men's quarterfinal match against Italian Jannik Sinner of Italy on Jan 26, 2022.", "caption": "Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas celebrates after winning the men's quarterfinal match against Italian Jannik Sinner of Italy on Jan 26, 2022.

Fake mobile app\n\nVictims are told to download mobile applications from unverified websites so they can supposedly accept lucrative jobs using the app.\n\nThey are told to transfer funds to bank accounts or cryptocurrency wallets provided by the scammer.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 06:24am\n\nMan charged for collecting $150k in cash, jewellery for scammers\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn return, they are promised a commission after a number of assigned tasks are completed. Such tasks appear to be aiding businesses.\n\nThe supposed commission they have \"earned\" is then reflected in the mobile app.\n\nBut when victims try to cash out, they realise they are unable to do so.\n\nPHOTOS: SINGAPORE POLICE FORCE\n\n2. Warning letter\n\nThe second type appears to have evolved from the first.\n\nThose who fall victim to the first type and try to quit and cash out will be sent warning letters that bear fake letterheads of the local authorities.\n\nVictims are pressured into making further transfers into bank accounts or cryptocurrency wallets to avoid having legal action purportedly taken against them.\n\n3. Easy part-time job\n\nVictims are told they can earn a commission by completing easy tasks, such as liking social media posts, as part of purported part-time affiliate marketing jobs.\n\nThey are led to websites that entice them to sign up for packages in order to be offered such jobs, with the amount of commission they are to be purportedly paid depending on the package they pay for.\n\nThey are then told to transfer money to the bank accounts of unknown individuals as payment for the packages.\n\nBut they soon find that they do not get paid, and they are unable to withdraw the supposed commissions.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nJob scams the next big worry, with $6.5m lost in first half of 2021: Anti-scam centre\n\nS'pore is known as a trustworthy place, so why are there so many scams?\n\n4. Movie tickets\n\nPHOTOS: SINGAPORE POLICE FORCE\n\nScammers convince victims they can earn a commission by buying and selling movie tickets through an unverified app that they are instructed to download.\n\nVictims are told they have to top up their app accounts to buy the movie tickets and would purportedly receive a commission from ticket sales.\n\nThe scammers then provide the victims with bank accounts belonging to unknown individuals for payment to be made.\n\nBut, as with the previous scam, the victims do not get paid and they are unable to withdraw the purported commissions.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n41 people lost $203k in 'Filmgo' movie ticket buying scam\n\n$6.5 million lost to job scams in first half of 2021\n\n5. Shopee Pay\n\nPHOTOS: SINGAPORE POLICE FORCE\n\nVictims are\n\ntold to download a fake mobile app called \"Shopee Pay\"\n\nfrom an unverified website to place orders from which they would receive commissions.\n\nThe app, which is unrelated to e-commerce platform Shopee, looks legitimate as scammers are spoofing an actual platform. The unverified app is a spoof of Shopee's real digital wallet called ShopeePay, which is accessed through the real Shopee app.\n\nShopee does not have a standalone app for its digital wallet.\n\nVictims are instructed to deposit funds into their Shopee Pay account so they can place the orders. Depositing the funds requires them to purchase cryptocurrency and transfer it to another wallet.\n\nThe Shopee Pay app then reflects the funds they have supposedly deposited.\n\nBut when the victims try to cash out, they are unable to do so or have their accounts suspended.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nAt least 11 people lose $53k to job scam involving fake mobile app Shopee Pay\n\nLured by $2 payout, woman in S'pore lost over $70,000 in job scam\n\nThe following 6S Anti-Scam Self-Protection Principles were developed by the Home Team Behavioural Sciences Centre to help Singaporeans defend themselves against scams:\n\n1. Spot the signs - Recognise the tactics that scammers use.\n\n2. Stop and think - Ask yourself or others if a statement, message or job offer could be true.\n\n3. Slow down, don't rush - Do not rush into providing your personal or banking details.\n\n4. Speak to others - Check with others to verify the authenticity of a claim before doing anything.\n\n5. Safeguard personal details and passwords - Never disclose personal information, even if the request appears to be legitimate.\n\n6.

But when I asked my parents, they were uncertain about it,\" she added.\n\nHer place of birth being China on identification documents was another giveaway, and Neo said her parents' answers would always differ whenever she broached the topic.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 19, 2024, 03:09pm\n\nS'porean singer Qiu Feng Ze teases fans on what's up and coming\n\nMore related stories\n\nShe also realised once that there were no baby photos of her - her parents only had pictures of her from the age of three.\n\nNeo said \"the suspicion went on\" and she started questioning her parents again years later when she was expecting her first child, as her mother seemed \"very unaware of how a pregnancy should go\".\n\nThings came to a head when the topic of blood types resurfaced following a check-up. Neo made separate calls to her mother and father, both of whom gave different answers.\n\nShe said, \"At that moment, I knew something was wrong. And I guess from there, they also knew that, 'Oh no, I can't hide it any further.'\"\n\nIn the video, Neo asks her parents why they adopted her and the reason they chose adoption in the first place.\n\nNeo's parents then opened up about her adoption process, which took around three to four months.\n\nHer father said: \"From the first day, we have always treated you as our very own,\" while her mother added, \"I forbade anyone (to) mention the word 'adopted'.\"\n\nHer mother admitted that she had wanted to keep the adoption a secret forever, telling Neo, \"And I'm so afraid that once I tell you, you will leave the house and not come back anymore.\"\n\nDuring the session, Neo shared her feelings of loneliness, guilt and resentment. She also apologised for not spending enough time with her parents.\n\nShe said, \"You all raised me to who I am today. You all never expected anything in return.\"\n\nNeo's video has been met with positive reception from netizens, many of whom praised her bravery and raw honesty.\n\nSome said the interview made them cry, while a few longtime fans also noted how much Neo has grown since her teenage years.\n\nCherlynn Ng\n\nAsian Celebrities\n\nparenting\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 20, 2024, 08:43pm\n\nEason Lee goes from performing at funerals to singing in concerts\n\nJun 18, 2024, 07:24am\n\nWonder Woman Amy Yip wows at 58th birthday bash\n\nMay 7, 2024, 06:37am\n\nOnce 'afraid' of Singapore, Sammo Hung now sings its praises\n\nJan 10, 2024, 03:00am\n\nChinese actress Jia Ling loses 50kg to play boxer in new movie\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/380d82edb18d5e774566977b184a641e1bc8db633f331af770c488a24630cf9b/dsdds.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "SCREENGRABS FROM YOUTUBE"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c5ff2f71ee0953fc96c8ac7d8c265ed9d5c158d9be68567323e8c124a4801d00/448270498_2909867502487071_8090949000254441241_n.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "S'porean singer Qiu Feng Ze teases fans on what's up and coming", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a16370209d469705df22336d881c5155fc2fabb03b4a82f108e4db806da372bd/passportde.jpg?w=885", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0f95b3f0142010a7c4b59edd84812d6ea74d3dee8d66483041b92044ab33e282/familyddd.jpg?w=885", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/482b46370252d73e57ce12e9fae5c05f3a83411adff9ed20d3b44e05c5d16e08/img-20240616-wa0019_0.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Eason Lee goes from performing at funerals to singing in concerts", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

And they were initially told that airport hotels were full.\n\n\"Shame on you,\" Ms Irene Caselli, who described herself as a journalist covering early childhood, told Scoot, and its parent company Singapore Airlines, in one of her tweets.\n\nIn an update a few hours later, she said they had a hotel room, \"after making a big fuss here and calling the Italian embassy\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 8, 2025, 12:31am\n\nMan arrested for shoplifting twice in Changi Airport transit area\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt is never easy to be stranded at an airport, especially with a young child, but if this passenger was looking for sympathy, it looked like there wasn't much of it on offer, online at least.\n\nMost of those commenting on her tweet felt she should have known better and many felt her behaviour was self-entitled or \"going full Karen on everyone\" as one put it.\n\nThis was one comment: \"Why is this Singapore Airline's fault? She bought a budget airline ticket and expects to be treated like a princess?\"\n\nAnd this was another: \"You decided to fly in the midst of COVID with a kid on budget airlines. You paid for a budget ticket, but demand a full fare service. You should not omit that detail, many reading this won't know Scoot is a budget airline.\"\n\nComparisons were made: \"Imagine taking a Ryanair or Easyjet flight and expecting them to book a hotel room for you when a flight is cancelled…\"\n\nAnd the comparisons were not just with the airline, with one asking: \"Can you imagine if it was other airports?\"\n\nAnother said: \"I can think of worst (sic) places to sleep than Changi Airport.\"\n\nIncidentally, if you Google \"best airport to sleep in\" every one of the top sites that come up lists Changi as No.1. Among them is the World Economic Forum, quoting The Guide to Sleeping in Airports.\n\nThere were those who felt she was using social media to put pressure on the airline.\n\n\"Obviously a terrible situation but (it) seemed clear the individual who posted this wanted help by aggressively calling out some businesses.\"\n\nSome did sympathise with the woman. But even among those, there were those who argued that she need not have pointed fingers or called out the airlines as shameful.\n\n\"I think you should calm down and take a deep breath before making the situation worse. Most of the negative comments have some truth in it. You might want to think about it.\"\n\nAnd another said: \"Look, it's a shame this happened at all. We do pity the plight of the family. But dumping responsibility on someone/something else is very immature and reeks of self-entitlement.\"\n\nScoot said it had reached out to affected passengers after its TR722 Singapore-Athens-Berlin flight had to be cancelled on Tuesday (Jan 25)  because of bad weather.\n\nAnd SIA tweeted later: \"Hi Irene, we seek your understanding that the airport hotels were fully booked yesterday. We note that @Flyscoot has reached out to you and assisted with booking a hotel room as one has just been made available.\"\n\nCHANGI AIRPORT\n\nbudget airline\n\nsocial media\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:00am\n\nCertis officer, 47, dies after collapsing at NDP rehearsal\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:21am\n\n'I still can't get over it': Flight, cabin crew mull over new course after Jetstar Asia closure\n\nJun 18, 2025, 10:34pm\n\nNearly 40 employers offer 450 roles at job fair for retrenched Jetstar Asia staff\n\nJun 11, 2025, 10:35pm\n\nMan arrested for allegedly shoplifting twice in Changi Airport transit area\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7b41f9b874de07c8d8f5af2515af302566b2bd2a1a759a3e82bbf664f7073a99/scoot26a.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "IRENE CASELLI / TWITTER"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4a1ef5768947d48e2e2f3db6103e388ac5095d1350b739f390ef2abc9ceb619d/hzperfumes070725.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man arrested for shoplifting twice in Changi Airport transit area", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/30ec25ea01bdda8727c22da8e6d7dd2761e2461a880797dc39a4cd0bd6171b5c/kc-accident2106.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Certis officer, 47, dies after collapsing at NDP rehearsal", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Red grouper was priced at up to $75 a kg, from $30 to $40 a kg in November.\n\nWhile the fish merchants association said the price increase is normal during the Chinese New Year period, stallholders said\n\nthe increase is exacerbated by floods in Malaysia last month\n\n. Vendors added that suppliers in China have also been snatching up stocks.\n\nSingapore's fish supplies come mainly from Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nFishmonger Michael Yak, 47, who runs a stall at Tiong Bahru Market, said: \"The price increase can't be helped.

She is selling red grouper at $45 a kg, up from $30 before.\n\n\"As supply is low, customers must order these fish in advance,\" she said. Walk-in customers may not get what they want, she added.\n\nMr Ang Jwee Herng, president of the Singapore Fish Merchants' General Association, said that the two types of fish are typically around 50 per cent more expensive during the lead-up to Chinese New Year due to high demand.\n\n\"These are the most popular types of fish during the Chinese New Year period, so there's increased demand. It isn't any different from previous years,\" he said.\n\nSeabass and golden pomfret for sale at Clementi 448 Market and Food Centre on Jan 26, 2022.

Fishmonger Lee Kok Weng, 33, who works there, said: \"At the start of the month, rabbitfish was $30 a kg because the quality was good. But the stocks this week are quite normal, so we lowered the price to $26 a kg.\" The price of marbled goby at his stall remained the same at $45 a kg.\n\nMadam Irene Lim, 64, a legal secretary who was shopping at Ghim Moh, said: \"I buy fish only during festive seasons, so the price increase is acceptable to me especially when businesses at markets have been affected (by the pandemic).\"\n\nThe price of prawns hovered at around $20. A market vendor at Toa Payoh West was selling prawns at $25 a kg, up from $20 a kg last month, while a vendor at Clementi was selling them at $20 a kg, up from $15 a kg last month.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nOmicron outbreak to delay goods for Chinese New Year and drive inflation\n\nFood supply hit ahead of CNY, Ramadan after floods wipe out Malaysian farms\n\nVegetable prices also continued to creep up.\n\nMr Jerry Tan, vice-secretary of the Singapore Fruits and Vegetables Importers and Exporters Association, noted that the lack of workers in Malaysian farms meant that vegetable prices are prone to fluctuation.\n\nHe said: \"It's harder to tell for vegetables like tang oh and Chinese cabbage, but tomatoes from Malaysia are priced on the high side at the moment due to labour shortage.

She is understood to be transiting in Singapore for a week following her exit from the ongoing Australian Open.\n\nOn Wednesday, she was seen practising with her coach, Torben Beltz, and Singaporean player Roy Hobbs, who has the most Davis Cup match wins for the Republic.\n\nThis time, there was a considerable increase in the number of onlookers at Raducanu's practice session, those who had been present on both days told ST.\n\nOver 30 people caught a glimpse of the 19-year-old British star in action from the outside of the tennis court facility, with the hot morning sun appearing hardly a bother.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 31, 2022, 03:21am\n\nDefending champion Emma Raducanu crashes out in US Open 1st round\n\nMore related stories\n\nInside, almost 50 others watched from a balcony situated above the tennis courts, some of whom were armed with cameras fitted with ultrazoom lenses.\n\nSources tell ST that the Tanglin Club had even set up a queue system so it could ensure safe management measures were adhered to by the eager crowd.\n\nRaducanu was seen exchanging different types of shots with Hobbs, with Beltz by her side giving her pointers.\n\nShortly before noon, the session ended and the teen was soon whisked into a waiting van.\n\nA swarm of fans gathered at the vehicle but were unsuccessful in getting photos or an autograph, although they did receive a big smile and a wave from the tennis star as her van began to move off.\n\nOne observer, who gave her name only as Audrey, lives opposite the club's tennis courts and said she had learnt of Raducanu's presence in Singapore from ST's report.\n\nHaving watched the teen's entire two-hour session, she said: \"It's so different to see a player in person and on television.\n\n\"Even with the close-ups on TV, you don't get to see their personality but here, you do.\n\n\"She seems so personable, chatting with her training partner, smiling a lot and having snacks during breaks at the side of the court.\"\n\nAudrey said she has a strong interest in tennis and has a daughter aged 11, who plays in the national developmental training squad but could not watch Raducanu train because of school. But she was keen to pass on her observations to her daughter.\n\n\"I will definitely tell my daughter that Emma was very serious about warming up, stretching, stuff like that... you know how kids are, they just want to hit the ball,\" she said.\n\nStudent Justin Hsieh wore a rueful look as he exited the Tanglin Club without a photo with Raducanu.\n\n\"Her agent said no photos (were allowed) because yesterday too many people asked already,\" said the 13-year-old, who plays socially. \"But at least I got to watch her train and play a bit, and that was interesting.\"\n\nIt is not known where Raducanu is headed after her Singapore pitstop, but the next tournaments on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour will be held in Dubai and Doha in February.\n\nRaducanu made history in 2021 by becoming the first qualifier to win a Grand Slam title.\n\nBut she was knocked out of the Australian Open in the second round after a loss to Montenegro's Danka Kovinic last Thursday.\n\nPlaying in her first main draw at Melbourne Park, Raducanu was hampered by blisters on her serving hand.\n\nThe BBC Sports Personality of the Year, who had also suffered from Covid-19 last month, had beaten 2017 US Open Champion Sloan Stephens in three sets in the first round.\n\nWatch ST's video here:\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz and Laura Chia\n\nEMMA RADUCANU\n\ngrand slam\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 14, 2022, 02:11am\n\nMartic outlasts Raducanu at Indian Wells\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bdea4fd476a84ad0b8ddd7a09f8cfb0db78d0756f083537665e3c3204d1c1c5e/emma26a.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Fans watching Emma Raducanu's practice session at the Tanglin Club on Jan 26, 2022.", "caption": "Fans watching Emma Raducanu's practice session at the Tanglin Club on Jan 26, 2022.

If not, it could have easily ended up in my mouth without noticing at all,\" it said.\n\n\"I immediately went out of my room to check with my mom if she (had) encountered the same horror too. Fortunately there wasn't, but I told her not to eat it because most likely it came out from the same main pot.\"\n\nThe user said he subsequently returned to the stall to show them the cockroach.\n\n\"I am still a fan of this porridge, in fact I think it's one of the best in SG easily. But definitely not buying anymore from the Tampines branch again. Still supporting the Hougang branch and hope this message will be a meaningful one to all. Thanks.\"\n\nHe also alleged that the stall removed his feedback from their Facebook page.\n\nThe post has garnered some 400 shares and over 100 comments, including a response from someone at the Tampines stall.\n\nThe person apologised and said the stall would do better, but also told Kieron Goh to \"please be fair to us before you comment\".\n\nThere was an explanation of how the porridge was cooked and how the kitchen was cleaned. The long process involves a lot of stirring, at the end separately for each portion. Regular cleaning and spraying also made it unlikely that such creatures would grow in the kitchen. It was also pointed out that the cockroach looked large and still \"intact\".\n\nMeanwhile,\n\nSin Heng Kee Porridge said\n\nit was aware of the incident and had contacted the person-in-charge.\n\nThe company distanced itself from the outlet, which it said was not affiliated with its Yishun and Hougang branches.\n\n\"They have not gone through any form of training from us whatsoever. They simply are using our name because they are related to our ancestors,\" Sin Heng Kee Porridge said.\n\n\"I repeat, we are not the same company so eat there without comparing with us as like I said, they have never been through any of our training.\"\n\nIn response to a query from Stomp, SFA said it had received feedback and was investigating the matter.\n\n\"Food safety is a joint responsibility.

This is double the figure a week ago and the first time that the number has surpassed the 8,000 mark.\n\nThe nationwide tally stood at 749,979, with a death toll of 6,588.\n\nHealth officials warned that the daily figures could grow exponentially to 30,000 next month, given how fast Omicron is spreading within the community now.\n\nHow the next four weeks of virus control pans out will be key, they said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nFrom Wednesday, South Korea will tweak its virus response system to focus on early detection and treatment of high-risk groups so as to stop their symptoms from becoming too severe.\n\nFree polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at public health centres, which was previously offered to everyone, will now be prioritised for more vulnerable groups. They include people aged above 60, those who had close contact with Covid-19 patients, and those who hold a doctor's note for testing.\n\nThose who are not considered a priority will have to take the self-administered antigen rapid test (ART). Free test kits will be available at public health centres.\n\nThe new system will be imposed first in four regions where Omicron is fast spreading. They include the whole of South Jeolla province and three cities in Gyeonggi province - Gwangju, Pyeongtaek and Anseong.\n\nIn Gwangju, for instance, nearly 80 per cent of all new infections last week were of the Omicron variant.\n\nThe system will be expanded to the whole country either later this week or early February, health officials said.\n\nThe government also decided to cut the isolation period for Covid-19 patients from 10 to seven days, so as to ease the burden of managing massive quarantine numbers.\n\nFully vaccinated people who have come into close contact with Covid-19 patients will no longer be required to quarantine. Instead, they can just monitor themselves and report to the health authorities via a mobile phone app.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nSouth Korean city presents model for Covid-19 home recovery\n\nSouth Korea extends distancing curbs ahead of holidays, Omicron wave\n\nThe Omicron wave comes at a time when South Koreans are set to celebrate one of their biggest festivals - Seollal, or Lunar New Year.\n\nPrime Minister Kim Boo-kyum has already urged people not to travel or visit their home towns during the five-day long weekend, from Jan 29 to Feb 2.\n\nA current ban on gatherings of more than six people will still apply, as well as a 9pm curfew on businesses such as restaurants and cafes.\n\nSouth Korea has imposed a 9pm curfew on businesses such as restaurants and cafes.

Japan has a shortage of bioinformatic researchers critical for genomic studies but he has not been able to fill the gap with foreign talent over the past two years.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:31am\n\nS'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"My lab, for sure, is slowing down and our centre for this type of analysis. We are struggling,\" Dr Carninci, a deputy director at Riken, whose prize-winning research in genetics has been cited in 60,000 papers.\n\n\"Internationalisation in science is definitely critical, because you don't have all the expertise in the same country.\"\n\nMany countries sealed borders to keep Covid-19 at bay. The United States saw international student enrolment drop 43 per cent in the autumn of 2020 from the previous year, while some 80,000 immigrant worker visas expired unused last year.\n\nBut Japan stands out with the strictest borders among Group of Seven countries. It has effectively\n\nbanned all new non-residents since March 2020.\n\nOnly China, with its zero-Covid-19 target, has been more closed off among major economies.\n\nThe stakes are high. A government-affiliated study showed Japan last year fell to 10th place globally in publication of noteworthy scientific papers, just behind India. Twenty years ago, it was No. 4.\n\n'Own goal'\n\nNearly half of Japan's four-year private universities failed to fill all places for first-year students in 2021, up 15 percentage points from the previous year, according to an official at the Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of Japan, which represents private educators.\n\nWhile the biggest reason was a drop-off in the number of Japanese students, the decline in foreign students was also felt, the official said.\n\nMore than 100 academics and international relations experts signed a letter last week asking Mr Kishida to reopen borders.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nJapan widens Covid-19 curbs as infections surge past 60,000 for the first time\n\nJapan to maintain most border restrictions to prevent Covid-19 spread until end of February\n\nPeople shut out have protested outside Japanese embassies and an online petition calling for students and workers to be let in has more than 33,000 signatures.\n\nThe government said last week it would make an exception and allow 87 state-sponsored students in.\n\n\"It's a giant own goal for Japan after decades of masterful use of soft power,\" said Dr Wesley Cheek, a sociologist who recently left Japan for a research post in Britain.\n\n\"People like me, who'd usually be applying for grants to continue our research in Japan, just have to take a pass for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nInternational students can work part-time in Japan and have traditionally provided a pool of what Japanese refer to as \"odd-job\" workers in places like convenience stores, in a country long wary of letting foreign workers in.\n\nEven before Covid-19, there were not enough foreign students to meet labour demand, said Mr Yohei Shibasaki, an international hiring adviser to service and tech companies He estimated there were about 170,000 students from trade and language schools in Japan before the pandemic, most of whom worked part-time.\n\nMr Hiroshi Mikitani, chief executive of e-commerce group Rakuten, which hires foreign engineers, has said the curbs should be reconsidered as they are not practically effective and are \"only a minus for the economy\".\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nOmicron pushes Japan to consider living with Covid-19 like the flu\n\nBump in support for PM Kishida as tough border restrictions cheered in Japan\n\nThe plight of international students, some dreaming for years of study, can be heart-wrenching.\n\nOn social media and in interviews, they described paying tuition for classes they took online in the middle of the night, losing scholarships, and months of stress waiting for change.\n\nSome have exhausted savings. Some have given up and gone elsewhere.\n\nJapan is no longer the main destination for study and research in East Asia, with more students now going to South Korea, said Mr Davide Rossi, who runs an agency promoting study abroad.\n\nMs Sujin Song, 20, a science major from South Korea, has lost her scholarship but tries to do lab work for her classes online.\n\nShe was blocked again from entering Japan in November.\n\n\"I really liked Japan but now I feel betrayed,\" Ms Song said.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nXenophobia spills into Japan's Covid-era debate on immigration: Report\n\nUS embassy in Tokyo warns of suspected racial profiling by Japanese police\n\nJapan\n\ncovid-19\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22, 2025, 07:40am\n\nFormer S'pore basketball coach's wife, missing for 2 years, confirmed dead in Japan\n\n10\n\nMay 20, 2025, 12:18am\n\nS'pore man arrested in Japan for allegedly committing indecent acts involving boy in onsen\n\nApr 6, 2025, 04:16am\n\nSingaporeans believed to be among 47 injured in bus collision on Tokyo expressway\n\nApr 3, 2025, 12:30am\n\nMFA officer who took nude photos of male customers in Tokyo bathhouse dismissed\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/82ee1a12b5edbd1b697293d169e95a600ce3a0d9800d17a82d058f0980e5ecce/JAPAN-HEALTH-VIRUS-030402.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Japan stands out with the strictest borders among Group of Seven countries.

They will have to stay within Nongsa in Batam and Lagoi in Bintan.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 18, 2025, 09:31am\n\nTwo men involved in Bali villa murder deported from Singapore\n\n3\n\nMore related stories\n\nTravellers returning from the two holiday islands must serve a seven-day stay-home notice (SHN), as Singapore has yet to reciprocate Indonesia's move to open up for quarantine-free travel by sea.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday that Singapore will discuss with Indonesia\n\nhow it can make the new travel bubbles for its visitors to Bintan and Batam a two-way one,\n\nhopefully without taking too long.\n\nMr Chua Choon Leng, general manager of Batam Fast Ferry, which will operate the travel bubble trips to Batam, said that he has received about 30 calls so far from interested travellers. It aims to start the travel bubble trips on Friday.\n\nIt also plans to introduce daily or twice-daily ferry trips to Batam, up from its current schedule of one trip every two days.\n\n\"Some people don't mind the SHN, as they just really want to travel,\" said Mr Chua.\n\n\"Within Nongsa, there are five resorts, three golf courses and a beautiful seaside,\" he added.\n\n\"It's really not a bad place to spend three or four days in.\"\n\nHe said that those interested were more concerned about the costs for the Covid-19 tests required to enter Singapore and Indonesia. These fees could go up to about $300 for a return trip.\n\nHe also cautioned that ferry ticket prices will increase, owing to the need to house workers within the travel bubble area in Batam and the routine Covid-19 testing the workers have to undergo.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nS'pore, Indonesia to discuss two-way bubble with Bintan and Batam, continue talks to expand air, sea travel: PM Lee\n\nA spokesman for another ferry operator, Sindo Ferry, said the firm hopes it will be given the chance to take part in the travel bubble scheme. She said the firm's phone has been ringing non-stop with inquiries about the bubble.\n\n\"Previously, Nongsa and Lagoi have always been the target destination for golfers and also resort lovers,\" the spokesman added.\n\n\"However, we do think that people might still have the wait-and-see approach since it has just been kicked off.\"\n\nBoth ferry operators said the travellers between Singapore and Batam in the last two years have mostly comprised returning nationals and people travelling for work.\n\nNongsa Resorts said the interested travellers from Singapore so far are made up of those who want to play golf and those who want to travel but not take flights.\n\nNongsa Point Marina and Resort in Batam.

He will be finishing fast from the rear.\n\nRACE 2 (1,650M)\n\n9 Gorgeous Inheritor closed rapidly first-up this campaign to grab fourth. He has his fair share of talent and looks ready to win.\n\n3 Daily Beauty is competitive. He is down to a winnable mark now. The question is the wide gate. It will make things difficult.\n\n1 All You Know is also stepping away off a suitable rating.\n\n6 Happy Jai Jai is chasing back-to-back wins. Joao Moreira sticks aboard and gate two gives him his chance once more.\n\nRACE 3 ( 1,200M)\n\n6 Sunny And Gold is unlucky not to already be a winner. He has gone close on a number of occasions and, with even luck from gate two, he shapes as the one to beat.\n\n5 Oriental Amigo slots into a similar category. The strong booking of jockey Vincent Ho commands respect.\n\n2 Mission Smart has shown flashes of ability at times. He has his share of ability but race-fitness might be against him.\n\n12 Raging Blaze should get a nice run from the middle draw.\n\nRACE 4 (1,650M)\n\n10 Mister Arm is a winner in the grade below. Still, he did well last start in this grade and it would not surprise to see him at his best. Expect he gets every opportunity close to the speed under Vagner Borges.\n\n9 Chater Pins will give them a head start. He is racing well and a first win looks close.\n\n4 V Chevaliers loves the course and distance. He is a threat off this handicap.\n\n6 Courageous Knight is coming to hand. Gate two gives him his chance in a tough contest.\n\nRACE 5 (1,650M )\n\n7 Bulletproof narrowly missed last time. Purton hops up and once again he gets his chance. He is the in-form horse of the field.\n\n2 Dr Winning has come to hand of late. He is a winner already in this grade and he pairs favourably with Moreira.\n\n6 Toycoon is still without a win. Do not discount as his turf form - albeit not equal to his dirt form - is still good.\n\n3 More Than Enough gets the chance to reverse his form. This course and distance are suitable.\n\nRACE 6 (1,200M )\n\n11 Mega Bonus is racing well. He got off the mark well two starts ago and, if he can offset the tricky gate, he remains the one to beat. He just needs a clean run close to the speed.\n\n3 Wind Speeder is coming to hand. He did well in a muddled race last start. Expect further improvement.\n\n2 Triple Triple is capable. He gets his chance and does appear fit.\n\n8 Regency Star draws favourably. He is a threat from gate two with Alexis Badel engaged.\n\nRACE 7 (1,000M)\n\n10 Star Of Wuyi rattled home last time but was slightly unlucky at the end. He is on an upward trajectory and, with a clean run, he can finish ahead of them. The light weight is ideal.\n\n3 Forte can improve again with one run under his belt. The booking of Purton warrants respect.\n\n8 Pretty Queen Prawn is coming to hand. Gate six and the engagement of Jerry Chau has him commanding some respect.\n\n4 Scotch Tycoon roared home for an almighty win at long odds last start. He will contest the finish.\n\nRACE 8 (1,650M)\n\n10 Oscar Glory lost narrowly in a tight finish last start behind Navas Two. This is the right form - especially with that horse winning again. He is the one to beat.\n\n4 Invincible Missile is after back-to-back wins. He is holding his condition.\n\n11 Sky Forever chased hard for a close-up second last time. He is improving with each run.\n\n1 Maldives has drawn favourably. Gate one is ideal for Purton to get the best out of him.\n\nRACE 9 (1,200M)\n\n12 H Z Tourbillon trialled very well. He showed ability early on and he should be favoured by a quick tempo. He looks wound up to perform first-up with the light weight.\n\n1 Astrologer is already a two-time winner from four starts.

You cannot ask for anything better from a first- season galloper.\n\nOr, for that matter, any racehorse.\n\nWell, those are the credentials Red Ocean brings into the Class 3 sprint over the 1,400m on Saturday.\n\nIf he holds up his side of the bargain, he will be hard to catch.\n\nTo lift his stock even further, Red Ocean was one of the star performers on the training track yesterday morning.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nWith Matthew Kellady in the saddle, the son of Ocean Park breezed over the 600m in 39.1sec.\n\nIt was a dominant piece of work and it would have pleased his connections who, so far, must surely have no complaints with what their boy has done on the racetrack.\n\nRed Ocean arrived at Kranji at the tailend of the 2020 season and settled in nicely.\n\nShane Baertschiger, his trainer from Day One, was patient with the then-three-year-old gelding and it was only after a couple of trials that he eased his charge into a race.\n\nIt was a baptism of fire - and Red Ocean was burnt to a crisp. In that race over the 1,200m, Red Ocean finished last in a field of 14.\n\nUndaunted, Baertschiger sent him back to the trials. He won that hit-out, beating Sugar Rush in a head-bobber.\n\nHe continued to improve and, two starts later, he began paying for his board and lodging when finishing fourth in a Restricted Maiden race over the 1,400m.\n\nAlthough beaten by many lengths, his connections must have taken positive signs from that outing.\n\nAt his next start, they sent him off as the $35 third favourite. He did not have the brightest of passages in that 1,400m sprint. But there was enough in the tank and Red Ocean went on to win the race, beating Con Speranza by half a length.\n\nHe must have liked that winning feeling because, the next time, he toyed with his rivals and gave them a galloping lesson, winning that \"Novice\" event by three lengths.\n\nThat was in July and Red Ocean had truly arrived.\n\nDanny Beasley had been the jockey on both those wins. He would make that three on the trot when, in November, Red Ocean stamped his authority on his rivals, winning a Class 4 race by over five lengths.\n\nThe break from racing saw Baertschiger send Red Ocean back to the trials. He won his last one and then, at his last outing less than a fortnight ago, he led all the way over the mile.\n\nThat day, Kellady was on the reins and it looks likely that the Baertschiger stable jockey will want to guard that seat jealously.\n\nAnd why not? From what we have seen of Red Ocean, he is a star in the making and, for him, the season has just begun.\n\nAlso impressive on the training track was Prodigal.\n\nA fine-looking chestnut, he was never off the bit when running the 600m in 38.1sec. Shafrizal Saleh did the steering.\n\nPrepared for the races by Michael Clements, Prodigal is a one-time winner from six starts. He scored at the second time of asking.\n\nThat was in May and he beat Golden Sprint in a 1,400m race on grass.\n\nFrom then until now, he has had four trials and, the last time, he raced home after having a ragged passage to take fourth in that race won by First Chief.\n\nHe was expected to improve at his next outing - which was supposed to be at the meeting just concluded.\n\nBut he was a reserve and he never did get to start.\n\nIt must have been disappointing for his connections.\n\nBut Clements has kept him ticking over nicely and yesterday's workout would have ensured that he holds form going into Saturday's action.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

That run came after a four-month break, so he should come on in leaps and bounds and go close.\n\n(3) EXCEED EXPECTATION and (10) LADOOSHKA were hampered when running well last time. The former was making his local debut and could have much more to offer on the Poly. Ladooshka races for a stable in good form and also tries the Poly, but has a lot more to do from a wide draw.\n\n(6) GIAMBATTISTA's last form line is not proving strong but he could have done with a better pace. He is holding well.\n\nRACE 3 (1,800M)\n\n(1) HEAD GARDENER turned in a much better performance with blinkers fitted last time. He has not been consistent but hopefully the blinkers have done the trick.\n\n(8) STATEOFUSA held form well before a no-show over further. He has not drawn as well as in his last few but needs to be considered on his recent Poly effort.\n\n(6) DUKE OF ORANGE has been disappointing but, on pedigree, he should do better over this longer distance.\n\n(10) ROYAL OASIS should be in the money at the weights.\n\nRACE 4 (1,900M)\n\n(4) HEARTSEASE and (3) CHELSEA FLOWER had wide draws and lots to do in their last race. Both have drawn better and need to be taken seriously. Heartsease looks better than her one win from 11 starts, especially when glancing at her earlier form.\n\n(2) ISLA MORADA should be in the fight, judging from her last two from bad draws. It has been a while since she last won though.\n\n(5) CONSOL QUEEN has dropped in ratings and could upset the favourites if ready after a rest.\n\nRACE 5 (2,000M)\n\n(6) QUE FOR YOU allowed (7) RISE to get by her, tiring late after setting the pace last time. Now she is in receipt of a lot of weight and could get her chance in the sun. There are, however, more in the race with claims off lower weights.\n\n(3) NAME OF THE GAME flew up over shorter last time and, back over a more suitable trip, can add to her tally.\n\nShe is closely matched with (1) PORT ADELAIDE, who has the best of the draws and is holding form well. She needs a good pace and that is where Que For You comes in.\n\nRACE 6 (2,000M)\n\n(1) FIGHT SONG ran a cracker last time, especially since he jumped from the widest gate and came from many lengths back. He is distance suited.\n\n(2) RUN TO DENMARK could take advantage if allowed to set his own fractions. He is overdue for a win.\n\n(3) MAGICAL MIDLANDS and (4) SPRING FLING are versatile and have performed well on the Poly.\n\nRACE 7 (1,200M)\n\n(5) WISHFUL GIRL LINN impressed when dropping to this distance and could follow up.\n\n(6) RETAIL THERAPY has beaten her before and is better off at the weights, so is not one to take lightly. She has not been at her best but had excuses last time.\n\n(1) IRISH BELLE is fast and, if she breaks away, they may not catch her.\n\n(9) FLASHY KAITRINA looks to have dropped enough in ratings to be competitive in this field.\n\nRACE 8 (1,200M)\n\n(4) CAPE EAGLE ran well in a decent field first time. He can improve on the Poly.\n\n(9) PARKTOWN impressed last time and has won on the Poly, so needs to be taken seriously. He and (10) PURPLE POWAHOUSE, however, have a bit of work to do from wide barriers.\n\n(2)TWO OF US was beaten a neck the last time he raced on the synthetic surface\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Responding to queries from The Straits Times on Tuesday (Jan 25), it said the online shop, which opened on Jan 3, is sold out.\n\nWhen ST visited its flagship store in New Bridge Road on Tuesday afternoon, there was a long queue and customers had to queue for about an hour. Many customers visited the outlet as the online shop was sold out.\n\nA Lim Chee Guan spokesman told ST that more customers went online to purchase its products compared to last year.\n\n\"They would be able to order in the comfort of their homes without needing to queue for their bak kwa,\" she said, adding that customers who ordered their goodies online this year could choose delivery or self-collection.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 17, 2025, 02:16am\n\nM'sia cookie supplier files report after S'pore customer allegedly ghosts her over unpaid bill\n\nMore related stories\n\nCustomers ST spoke to said they were not bothered by rising Covid-19 cases as they were vaccinated and following safe distancing measures at the shop.\n\nWhen asked if its bak kwa prices have increased from previous years, the spokesman said its signature sliced pork is priced at $36 per 500g pack - compared to $34 last year.\n\n\"This will be the standard pricing throughout the 2022 CNY period,\" she said.\n\nMiss Li Biru, 24, a Chinese national studying in Singapore Management University, queued for an hour to buy it, as she had heard good things about the brand.\n\nShe said in Mandarin: \"I decided to buy only at the last minute. I went to the shop as I heard that the online shop was sold out.\"\n\nOn the Covid-19 risk, she said: \"I have not paid attention to Covid-19 for quite a while and with the adherence to safe management measures and being vaccinated, I am not too worried.\"\n\nMr Nigel Koh, 29, also queued for an hour to buy bak kwa for his company.\n\n\"There aren't many brands locally that offer the same taste as Lim Chee Guan, it's one of the better ones in the market. Even though I have to queue for it, it's worthwhile to soak in the festive season, especially since I'll have family and friends visiting who will enjoy it.\"\n\nRegarding the risk of getting Covid-19, he said: \"I feel that sooner or later we will get infected, but as long as we put on masks and observe safe distancing measures, we should be safe for now.\"\n\nAsked if he was bothered by the price increase, he said: \"It's the festive season, so the price will increase.

This means each team in the eight-team SPL will play 28 league games, up from 21 last term.\n\nTo help teams better manage their squad to cope with the added games, clubs will also be allowed to name more substitute players on the bench - nine, up from seven - and use more replacements - five, up from three.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 24, 2022, 09:33am\n\nSPL champs Lion City Sailors sign Brazilian defender Henrique for $2m\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe season is scheduled to end on October 15, before the Singapore Cup begins on October 25.\n\nAs previously reported, the upcoming season will also see a reduction in the minimum number of Under-23 Singaporean players required to start games, with the quota for each team down from three to one.\n\nUp to 1,000 spectators will be allowed at each match, with those above the age of 18 required to be fully vaccinated.\n\nTickets are priced at $10 for adults and $5 for concession holders. Clubs, however, reserve the right to amend pricing with a maximum cap of $15, said the FAS.\n\nAll SPL matches will also be broadcast live via Singtel TV and StarHub TV, as well as live streaming online via the SPL Facebook page and YouTube channel.\n\nBy\n\nSazali Abdul Aziz\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by Sazali Abdul Aziz\n\nsleague\n\nSingapore Premier League\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 18, 2022, 08:37am\n\nTampines midfielder Nakamura signs new 5-year deal, eyes S'pore citizenship\n\nNov 9, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nNew FAS leadership must make S.League work\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Thus population immunity against DenV-3 is low, and more people are susceptible to infection with this serotype,\" said NEA.\n\nWhile the two-year outbreak created cross-protective immunity in the community, it is short-lived and likely to be waning, leading to weekly dengue cases rising since the end of last year, the agency said.\n\nCross-protective immunity to dengue virus serotypes is the protection against one dengue virus serotype due to pre-existing immunity developed from past exposure to a different serotype. Studies show that it generally lasts between a few months and a few years.\n\n\"Concerted community action and sustained (mosquito) control efforts are urgently required, to prevent escalation of dengue case numbers to outbreak levels,\" NEA said.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti mosquito population remains high in areas such as Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, Hougang Avenue 7, Marsiling Drive/ Marsiling Road, and Champions Way/ Woodlands Avenue 1.\n\nNEA conducted about 631,000 inspections last year and uncovered about 18,500 mosquito breeding habitats.\n\nIt took 8,700 enforcement actions against owners of premises for mosquito breeding. About 480 summonses and 43 stop-work orders were issued to construction sites, and 54 contractors were charged in court for repeat offences.\n\nNEA said that in anticipation of homes and other premises being decorated with ornamental plants for the upcoming Lunar New Year season, it has inspected all plant nurseries.\n\nIt also distributed dengue prevention packages, which included posters to remind plant sellers and buyers to maintain vigilance and prevent mosquito breeding.\n\n\"Those decorating their homes and premises with ornamental plants are urged to take care of these plants and prevent them from becoming mosquito breeding habitats, by making sure that water does not accumulate in the flowerpot plates or on top of the hardened soil,\" added NEA.\n\nBy\n\nNadine Chua\n\nRead articles by Nadine Chua\n\ndengue\n\nNEA\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 25, 2024, 12:33am\n\n6 dengue-related deaths reported between April and June\n\nNov 21, 2023, 05:02am\n\nProject Wolbachia to be expanded to five more residential areas in the south and east from 2024\n\nSep 6, 2023, 08:43am\n\nResurgence of previously dominant dengue virus strain could lead to surge in cases: NEA\n\nDec 5, 2022, 02:50pm\n\nMore than 30,000 dengue cases reported in 2022, six times that of 2021: NEA\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/053e75b2d780795729383b9eab6b48a80fd9e9831e415ec7fc04fdf86ca379f1/mi_fogging_250122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The uptick in dengue cases continued for a fifth week with 183 cases reported last week.", "caption": "The uptick in dengue cases continued for a fifth week with 183 cases reported last week.

I had a lot of fun out here. I was able to serve well and find a lot of forehands in the centre of the court and I was happy to take the game on,\" she said.\n\nThe Australian believes she is a superior player now to when she was beaten by eventual champion Sofia Kenin in a semi-final in Melbourne in 2020.\n\n\"I have grown as a person. I have grown as a player. I feel like I am a more complete player,\" she said. \"I have a couple of more years of experience under my belt in handling different experiences and problem solving out on the court.\n\n\"I think it is a credit to my team.

This caused the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to disburse matching contributions under the Baby Bonus Scheme.\n\nChan was fined $90,000 on Tuesday (Jan 25) after she was convicted of 30 counts of breaching the Child Development Co-Savings Regulations. Another 124 similar charges were taken into consideration.\n\nShe paid half of the fine on Tuesday and will have to pay the remaining amount by July 25.\n\nAs part of the Baby Bonus Scheme, parents can open a special savings bank account, a CDA, and be the trustees of the account.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 06:56am\n\n12,000 lower-income households to get $60 transport vouchers by end-July\n\nMore related stories\n\nTo help build savings in the accounts, the Government would match any savings deposited into the account on a dollar-to-dollar basis up to a certain amount, depending on when the child was born.\n\nThe court heard that sometime in 2011, Chan came up with a \"matching scheme\" where she would give loans to parents who owed outstanding school fees or other childcare expenses to Sweetlands Childcare.\n\nThe scheme involved withdrawing funds from the childcare centres' bank accounts and depositing them into each child's account to get the MSF to make its contribution.\n\nSince Chan was an \"approved person\" under the Sweetlands Childcare brand, she could make withdrawals from CDAs for authorised purposes.\n\nBut she used contributions from MSF to pay the outstanding school fees owed to the childcare centres, which was not allowed.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Cheng Yuxi told the court that on Sept 7, 2010, Chan was wrongly advised over the phone by a MSF customer service staff member that her scheme was allowed.\n\nBut before she committed her first offence, MSF officers told her she should not make the deductions from the CDAs for loan repayment. She was advised again in May 2011 and April 2014.\n\nBut Chan made the unauthorised transactions till March 2015.\n\nIn total, $133,674 was deducted for loan repayments and Chan has refunded $5,880.\n\nDPP Cheng told the court that Chan's acts \"compromised the structure of the CDA and its purposes\" and questions were raised in Parliament on what the MSF intended to do to tighten control over the CDA.\n\nSince the offences, among other measures, MSF has closely monitored Sweetlands Childcare centres and amended the terms and conditions of the approved persons or institutions to clearly state that withdrawing money from a CDA to recover money that the person has deposited into it is not allowed.\n\nChan's lawyers Julian Tay and Theodora Kee from Lee and Lee told the court that their client was forced to step down from her role at Sweetlands Childcare.\n\nThey argued that she did not gain from the scheme, and said: \"Her desire all along was for all children to have access to pre-school education.\"\n\nFor each charge of making unauthorised withdrawals from a Child Development Account, Chan could have been fined up to $20,000.\n\nJean Iau\n\nMINISTRY OF SOCIAL AND FAMILY DEVELOPMENT\n\nCHILDCARE CENTRES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:05am\n\nFewer marriages and births in Singapore in 2024: MSF\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:30pm\n\nProgramme that provides free marriage and family counselling expands to 11 centres\n\nJun 10, 2025, 04:28am\n\nMan, 26, barred from conducting fundraising for charity\n\nMay 31, 2025, 09:58pm\n\nMSF will keep building on collaborative approach in supporting families\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2ce47e79b217b7ee4d4fd4b7fdec71c16d85dc11438c8d6739c18b8a0292290e/gavel-1238036-1278x855_revjun212022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9becdf4beed86dfdac70f83515c327c835d96a76bf5187cdc1d2a9df7fac7e3c/AKsgbus2030122.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "12,000 lower-income households to get $60 transport vouchers by end-July", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9f8f1cf0cfd6f2eb04ed6e7cd9485ed49a6c456494d6150143eb11547e399afb/GIN7127.JPG?w=318", "alt_text": "Fewer marriages and births in Singapore in 2024: MSF", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

All three alleged offenders are Singaporeans.\n\nIn a statement last Sunday (Jan 23), the police said that preliminary investigations revealed that the two men had allegedly worked together to submit false vaccination data.\n\nKoh is believed to have referred clients to them.\n\nMOH had earlier said that it will be issuing notices of suspension to the four clinics which Quah owns or is clinic manager of, as well as revoking their approvals to conduct rapid tests for Covid-19.\n\nThey are Wan Medical Clinic in Bedok, Mayfair Medical Clinic in Woodlands, Mayfair Medical Clinic (Chong Pang) in Yishun, and Ong Clinic & Surgery, also in Yishun.\n\nQuah had also been working part-time as a laboratory director at the Diagnostics Development Hub's (DxD's) clinical diagnostics laboratory.\n\nDxD, which is funded by the National Research Foundation and led by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research , has since suspended Quah.\n\nChecks with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority show that Quah is also listed as a director at the PPD Global Central Labs, a biomedical company in Singapore.\n\nPPD, an American company with offices around the world, is owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific.\n\nHe has been placed on leave by Thermo Fisher Scientific which told the Straits Times: \"The allegations do not involve Dr Quah's role as a director of global central laboratories within Thermo Fisher's clinical research business... Dr Quah has been placed on leave while we review the allegations.\"\n\nThe cases involving Koh and Chua have been adjourned to Jan 28.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\n, Court Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/482d707655793f5c7ef12a75d14a21ddd91a0ce6f8af2c23b135c6245acff7e8/hzquah250122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jipson Quah is said to have falsely reported to MOH about patient vaccine information.", "caption": "Jipson Quah is said to have falsely reported to MOH about patient vaccine information.

Liu then spent most of his life getting passed among relatives after the accident.\n\nThrough help from social media and the police, Liu tracked down his birth parents last month. They had since divorced and started new families.\n\nWhen Liu was first reunited with them, the family seemed happy,\n\nbut they began to quarrel\n\nafter Liu asked his parents for a separate place to live, which they could not afford.\n\nLiu with his biological mother, whom he tracked down in December 2021. PHOTO: WEIBO\n\nLiu said his parents did not allow him to live with them and refused to let him visit their homes. He said he asked them to \"either rent or buy a place for me because I have been homeless\".\n\nHe said his mother, Zhang, then blocked his number and social media accounts, calling him a \"white-eyed wolf\" - a Chinese term used to describe someone who is ungrateful and cold-hearted.\n\nZhang told Chinese media that she cut off contact with Liu to return to her \"peaceful life\".\n\n\"Wouldn't you stay away if he were your child and was being so defensive that he even recorded your conversations? His father has remarried, and so have I. He tried to force us to buy him a home, but we are not well-off enough for that,\" she was quoted as saying.\n\nIn the past week, Liu had publicly argued with his parents. In his 10,000-word suicide letter, he said he had been \"abandoned twice by his biological parents\".\n\nLiu said the row with his parents triggered an avalanche of online abuse.\n\n\"There have been people attacking and cursing me on Douyin and Weibo in the past couple of days,\" he wrote in the suicide note. \"I have been told to 'go to hell' and have been called various curse names, such as 'scheming son of a b****', 'disgusting' and 'sissy'.\"\n\nLiu said the online attacks became unbearable. He also said in the note he had been bullied and called a \"deserted child\" by his schoolmates in the past, and claimed that a male teacher had sexually abused him but he had kept that a secret for most of his life.\n\n• National Care Hotline: 1800-202-6868 (8am - 12am)\n\nMental well-being\n\n• Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222 (24 hours) • Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444 (24 hours) /1-767 (24 hours) • Singapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-283-7019 • Silver Ribbon Singapore: 6386-1928 • Tinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788 and www.tinklefriend.sg • Community Health Assessment Team: 6493-6500/1 and www.chat.mentalhealth.sg\n\nCounselling\n\n• TOUCHline (Counselling): 1800-377-2252 • TOUCH Care Line (for seniors, caregivers): 6804-6555 • Care Corner Counselling Centre: 1800-353-5800\n\nOnline resources\n\n• mindline.sg • My Mental Health • Fei Yue's Online Counselling Service • Tinkle Friend • Community Health Assessment Team\n\nChina\n\nsuicide\n\nsocial media\n\nMental Health\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/31defeb053506acca2bfb12d80895557d741d4d8150c015bb2f579ac3ab477cc/61ee6d932b43ff00185e3339.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Liu Xuezhou, 17, said in his suicide note that he'd been \"abandoned twice by his biological parents\".", "caption": "Liu Xuezhou, 17, said in his suicide note that he'd been \"abandoned twice by his biological parents\".

Any child aged five to 11 can now walk in without an appointment for Covid-19 vaccination from Mondays to Thursdays.\n\nThe businessman, who had been waiting to make an appointment to get his daughter inoculated since the vaccination drive for children her age began in early January, was eager to skip the waiting process.\n\nOn Tuesday, he took his daughter to Hougang Community Club, one of the 15 paediatric vaccination centres for children between the ages of five and 11, after school at around noon.\n\nMr Tay said: \"I was in a hurry to get my daughter vaccinated because, with the rising Covid-19 cases in the community, I did not want her to fall seriously ill.\"\n\n\"I hope that the vaccine will be available for even younger children to keep them safe as well.\"\n\nThe introduction of walk-ins for younger children comes after the Ministry of Health's (MOH) director of medical services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, announced last Friday (Jan 21) that children below the age of 12 were starting to form the majority of hospitalised Covid-19 cases in Singapore.\n\nPreviously, only children who were accompanying their sibling to a vaccination appointment could get a jab without booking, under the \"sibling walk-in\" arrangement that began on Jan 10.\n\nWith the coming Chinese New Year season, when people are likely to gather more often, parents are taking advantage of the new walk-in system to protect their children from infection.\n\nMs Rachel Seah, a 33-year-old housewife who took her five-year-old daughter to get vaccinated at Clementi Community Centre, said: \"As Chinese New Year is coming and we will be taking her to the zoo and an exhibition, we thought that it would be safer to get her vaccinated.\n\n\"If we didn't have those plans, we would still encourage her to get vaccinated, but we would not have been in such a rush.\"\n\nSome parents wanted their children vaccinated to drive up Singapore's vaccination rate.\n\nEngineer Samir Piriyev, 39, who took his daughter, 11, to Clementi Community Centre, said: \"We want to be part of a safe and healthy community and also hope to contribute to Singapore's goals to increase the national vaccination rate.\"\n\nHowever, not all parents have felt the need to rush to get their children inoculated, mostly because they had already secured vaccine appointments for them.\n\nThe Straits Times found that only two out of the 10 parents who took their children to Hougang Community Club to get vaccinated were walk-ins.\n\nThe other eight were there for their children's scheduled appointments.\n\nThe vaccination process on Tuesday was smooth and quick at Clementi Community Centre and Hougang Community Club.\n\nThe Straits Times noted that queues were short and moved quickly at both venues at around 1pm.\n\nMadam Priyadarshini Vasudevan Mukundarajan, 38, a housewife who was with her 11-year-old daughter at Hougang Community Club, said: \"The process was very simple and smooth, and only took about 15 minutes.\"\n\nGena Soh\n\nand\n\nBryan Cheong\n\nVACCINES\n\ncoronavirus\n\ncovid-19\n\nvaccination\n\nCHILDREN\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b9ffbbf44949d008eee236edfef89c101cc1c6209e07fcca59ab520ab3fef089/childvax.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Children with their parents and guardians waiting outside Clementi Community Club for their Covid-19 vaccination jab on Jan 25, 2022.

Last year was really hard and I did everything that I could with my team to just really reset this off-season and focus on starting fresh and new and really just starting from zero and not worrying about last year,\" she said.\n\n\"Wow, that's gone well so far. I'm really proud of myself and so thankful to my team and my friends and my family for helping me through what was a really tough year last year.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 27, 2022, 12:06pm\n\nTop seed Barty crushes Keys to make Australian Open final\n\nMore related stories\n\nBanging down back-to-back aces to claim the first set, Keys roared to a 3-0 lead in the second before a rare wobble on serve gave French Open champion Krejcikova a break.\n\nUnbowed, Keys unleashed a blistering forehand return winner down the line to break back and sealed the match with a thumping first serve that Krejcikova could only push long.\n\nThe 26-year-old booked her second Australian Open semi-final, seven years after making the last four at Melbourne Park as a 19-year-old sensation.\n\nThat year, it took Serena Williams, the eventual champion, to stop her.\n\nWilliams said after the victory it was an honour to play\" someone who will be number one in future\".\n\nIt has not quite gone to script, with Keys now carrying a ranking of 51 and still searching for an elusive major title four years after Sloane Stephens denied her in the 2017 US Open final.\n\nShe will need to beat either Australian top seed Ash Barty or compatriot Jessica Pegula to reach the final but with her bazooka forehand and her serve firing, she will hope to trouble either.\n\n'Hottest place on Earth'\n\nKrejcikova held firm for a few games but as five break points piled up at 3-2 in the first set, she finally buckled on serve, pushing a simple forehand into the tramlines with an open court begging.\n\nIn a flash the Czech was 5-2 down and calling for the trainer despite showing no signs of physical problems.\n\nThe delay failed to slow Keys' momentum, and she served out strongly to take the set in a four-game burst that unlocked the match.\n\nWith Krejcikova struggling in the heat, Florida-based Keys upped the ante and battered the Czech into submission with a string of blazing forehands.\n\n\"I train in Orlando in the summer, which I think is the hottest place on Earth in the summer,\" said Keys. \"I'm pretty used to (heat) just because I train in that all of the time, which I think is definitely a bonus for me - even though in the summer I wish I didn't live there and I lived somewhere nicer.\"\n\nKrejcikova said that while the conditions had affected her performance, she did not want to take credit away from Keys.\n\n\"I didn't feel good,\" she said. \"It was the heat with some physical conditions that started to bother me after five games... I wanted to finish the match, to try to do my best. I wasn't really able to do that.\n\n\"I really don't want to take the victory from Madison ... she really deserves the win and deserves to get the credit.\"\n\nMadison Keys\n\nAUSTRALIAN OPEN (TENNIS)\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 25, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nKonta and Zhang continue their dream run\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dbb5cf5b2df7d35dd4530d3b2458d279842b0a7b516877eb8b142c2246e4bbaa/ac_madison_250122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Madison Keys booked her second Australian Open semi-final after seven years.", "caption": "Madison Keys booked her second Australian Open semi-final after seven years.

He departs Vicarage Road having lost 11 of his 14 matches.\n\n\"The Hornets' Board recognises Claudio as a man of great integrity and honour, who will always be respected here at Vicarage Road for his efforts in leading the team with dignity,\" Watford said in a statement.\n\n\"However the board feels that, with nearly half of the Premier League campaign remaining, a change in the head coach position now will give a new appointment sufficient time... to achieve the immediate goal of retaining Premier League status.\"\n\nWatford, promoted last season, are in 19th position after seven defeats and one draw in their last eight games. They are without a victory in nine games in all competitions, their longest winless run since 2013.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe 70-year-old Ranieri took charge in October after Xisco Munoz parted ways with the club just seven league games into the season and with Watford in 14th place.\n\nIt continues the revolving door policy operated by the club's owner Gino Pozzo. Since Javi Gracia's exit in 2019, Watford have now sacked further five managers. The Hornets are looking for their 15th manager since the Pozzo family bought the club in 2012.\n\nItalian Ranieri is best known in England for guiding Leicester City to a fairy-tale Premier League title in 2016 but he has failed to work his magic since.\n\nAt Fulham, he was axed after just 106 days in charge in 2019, with the club eventually relegated from the Premier League after his dismissal.\n\nRanieri's Watford reign started ominously after Liverpool thrashed them 5-0 in his first game.\n\nAmid talk of player unrest at his methods, Watford's 4-1 win against Manchester United in November was Ranieri's second and final victory with the club. But the win was notable because it triggered Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking.\n\nWatford was Ranieri's fourth spell in the Premier League. In addition to Fulham, Leicester and Watford, he also worked at Chelsea.\n\nWatford will hope to have a new manager in place in time for their crucial showdown at fellow strugglers Burnley on Feb 5. They have been linked with Diego Martinez, a Spaniard who left his job as Granada boss last May.\n\nepl\n\nWATFORD\n\nClaudio Ranieri\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b2a386cde3b21d4ed8706f0d5cda29acca2f9b9a1990531315255f960a4f3431/2022-01-22t140820z_700915225_rc2y3s959cdw_rtrmadp_3_soccer-england-wat-nor-report.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The 70-year-old Ranieri is best known in England for guiding Leicester City to a Premier League title in 2016 but has failed to work his magic since.", "caption": "The 70-year-old Ranieri is best known in England for guiding Leicester City to a Premier League title in 2016 but has failed to work his magic since.

They will feature 14 designs, including one designed by local artist Sam Lo and commissioned for this year's 50th anniversary of the Chingay parade.\n\nAt the launch of the Chingay50 buses on Tuesday morning (Jan 25), Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong, who is deputy chairman of the People's Association (PA), said: \"It's part of life every year that we have a Chingay parade. It's hard to believe it's now been 50 years since the procession first plied our streets. It started off as a street procession, and gradually became a big part of how we celebrate New Year's, and also brought in cultural vibrancy.\"\n\nHe added: \"Not many people are able to see the procession in the same way as in the past. So by having the reimagined floats on different bus routes, more people can see and be on the floats. This will help to bring people closer to the festivity.\"\n\nOn how PA came up with the idea of the reimagined bus floats, Ms Tan Swee Leng, director of arts and culture in PA, said: \"Some people will remember waiting along the streets to catch a glimpse of Chingay floats coming down their way where they are staying. We wanted to replicate that as part of the commemoration of the 50th anniversary, but at the same time do it in a safe manner (during the pandemic).\"\n\n\"At the end of the day (Chingay) is really about bringing people together and celebrating our people, our culture and our heritage.

I was essentially raped on camera.\"\n\nAccording to the documentary, Manson later pressured Wood to tell journalists there had been no actual sex during the filming of the video.\n\nWood's mother recounts hearing through a crew member that Manson was giving Wood absinthe \"and whatever else\", and that she was unable to consent when he went off script.\n\nManson's lawyer Howard King denied the allegation in a statement to AFP.\n\n\"Of all the false claims that Evan Rachel Wood has made about Brian Warner, her imaginative retelling of the making of the Heart-Shaped Glasses music video 15 years ago is the most brazen and easiest to disprove, because there were multiple witnesses,\" he wrote.\n\nMr King said Wood was \"fully coherent\" during the three-day shoot and \"heavily involved in weeks of pre-production planning and days of post-production editing of the final cut\".\n\n\"The simulated sex scene took several hours to shoot with multiple takes using different angles and several long breaks in between camera setups...Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.\"\n\n'Phoenix Rising'\n\nManson has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault,\n\nincluding Game Of Thrones (2011 to 2019) actress Esme Bianco.\n\nLos Angeles police last year confirmed they\n\nwere investigating domestic violence allegations\n\nagainst the singer.\n\nManson, who has long cultivated a controversial image with his ghostly make-up and stage name evoking serial killer Charles Manson, has parted ways with his record label Loma Vista Recordings and Hollywood agency CAA since the allegations became public.\n\nBut he continues to record music, appearing on rapper Kanye West's album Donda last year.\n\nPhoenix Rising documents efforts by Wood and other sexual assault survivors to extend the statute of limitations for sex crimes, allowing women more time to seek justice following abuse.\n\nThe Sundance film festival - taking place online again this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic - runs until Jan 30.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nGame Of Thrones star Esme Bianco sues Marilyn Manson for alleged rape, abuse\n\nMarilyn Manson faces LA sheriff investigation after abuse allegations\n\nFILM FESTIVALS/AWARDS\n\nDOCUMENTARIES\n\nMusic\n\nassault\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4a99bff144cc25fbeb922519aeed96930bbcb1ff169eac52781017749066106b/ac_kimcol_250122%2520%25283%2529.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "American actress Evan Rachel Wood said Marilyn Manson raped her during what was supposed to be a simulated scene.", "caption": "American actress Evan Rachel Wood said Marilyn Manson raped her during what was supposed to be a simulated scene.

They will have roles in engineering, data science, machine learning and product management.\n\nAmong other projects, the team here will work on developing new product experiences, surfacing more personalised content for users, and boosting the speed and reliability of the platform.\n\nThe engineering centre's director, Mr Silvanus Lee, said that its Singapore-based data science and data engineering teams build Twitter's core data sets and metrics.

All further collaborations with Dee Kosh have been put on hold indefinitely.\"\n\nSeveral firms that Koshy previously worked with, including Huawei, foodpanda and Lenovo, also said earlier that their engagements with him had ended.\n\nPower 98, where he used to host weekday night shows, said in 2020 that he had been put on leave and that the radio station \"does not tolerate any form of harassment\".\n\nFor each count of offering cash to a youngster below 18 in exchange for sexual services, an offender can be jailed up to two years and fined.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCelebrities, Aware weigh in on sexual harassment claims against DJ Dee Kosh\n\nAmerican man allegedly sent message telling recipient to offer cash to minors in exchange for sex\n\nJail for repeat offender who offered cash to underage girl in exchange for sexual services\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\n, Court Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3faa2055d4a39789355a46e5cc5547123f09d0eb6a70890b49b4be6d0ee91834/deekosh2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Local radio DJ and Youtuber Dee Kosh will plead guilty to sexual offences.", "caption": "Local radio DJ and Youtuber Dee Kosh will plead guilty to sexual offences.

Most allow the sender ID field to be customised with the name of the business instead of the default unfamiliar number.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 06:24am\n\nMan charged for collecting $150k in cash, jewellery for scammers\n\nMore related stories\n\nSome countries require businesses to pre-register for sender IDs, meaning users have to provide information and supporting documents to an authority for approval. Singapore does not currently enforce pre-registration.\n\nUsing a service based in Europe, ST was able to send and receive SMS messages that appeared to be from banks such as UOB and Standard Chartered, as well as government agencies like the Ministry of Health and the Central Provident Fund Board.These messages appeared in the same thread as previous legitimate messages, including transaction notifications.\n\nUsing a service based in Europe, ST was able to send and receive SMS messages that appeared to be from banks like UOB and Standard Chartered.

ST PHOTO: REI KUROHI\n\nCode scrapers and Web hosts\n\nThere are also free tools that can be used to download or \"scrape\" a website's code, which will allow a scammer to easily recreate its appearance.\n\nWebsite domains can also be bought cheaply. ST found that a one-year licence for a website ending in \".com\" can be bought for $20 to $30, while one ending in \".sg\" can go for about $60.\n\nA scammer can upload the stolen website code to the Web host and quickly create a fake version of a bank's log-in page or a government website.\n\nWith some basic coding know-how, existing fields can be modified to send the information entered to the scammer's server instead of the bank's, and new fields asking for other information such as credit card details can be added.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nScam alert: From OCBC SMS scam to fake Iras e-mails, here's what you need to know\n\nImprovements in digital banking security will restore customers' faith: Experts\n\nRecognising fake messages and websites\n\nLast week, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Association of Banks in Singapore\n\nannounced new measures aimed at curbing SMS phishing scams.\n\nOne of them is that banks will no longer send clickable links in SMS messages. Any future links in messages purportedly sent from banks are therefore likely to be fake.\n\nBanks, government agencies and telcos in Singapore have also indicated that they will sign up for the Infocomm Media Development Authority's SMS SenderID registry, which is designed to prevent unauthorised users from spoofing the sender IDs of banks and other institutions.\n\nHowever, it is not a foolproof move. The Business Times reported last Thursday that several companies that have signed up to the registry can still have their sender IDs spoofed.\n\nPhishing messages can also be sent by other means such as e-mail.\n\nTo avoid falling prey, do not click on links that appear to lead to websites dealing with sensitive information. Instead, use official apps to access these services or manually enter the official website address of the bank or agency into the browser.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n4 common types of scams and how to recognise them\n\nIs contactless payment safe? 5 tips to protect yourself in the wake of OCBC SMS scams\n\nRei Kurohi\n\n, Tech Correspondent\n\nSCAMS\n\nBANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:21am\n\nPolice probe 536 over scams, unlicensed moneylending\n\nJul 12, 2025, 04:11am\n\nMore NSFs may be deployed to fight scams online, say police\n\nJul 10, 2025, 07:48am\n\nMan charged over $80,000 money mule activities\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/76e690afc10daae6ed48b6183fe8f9360d316658b8ac8adabf352a3f8bda1337/mi_phone_240122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The tools can be used to send SMS messages that carry the same sender identification address as those used by legitimate banks and agencies.", "caption": "The tools can be used to send SMS messages that carry the same sender identification address as those used by legitimate banks and agencies.

The width of the policy band and the level at which it is centred remained unchanged.\n\n\"This move builds on the pre-emptive shift to an appreciating stance in October 2021 and is appropriate for ensuring medium-term price stability,\" MAS said.\n\nMAS manages monetary policy through exchange rate settings, rather than interest rates, letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed policy band.\n\nIt adjusts its policy in three ways: the slope, mid-point and width of the policy band, known as the nominal effective exchange rate, or S$Neer.\n\n\"MAS had assessed that a shift in its policy stance was necessary to ensure price stability in light of accumulating external and domestic cost pressures, even as the strength of the economic recovery remained uncertain,\" it added.\n\nThe tightening came a day after data showed Singapore core consumer prices or core inflation in December\n\nrose by the fastest pace in nearly eight years.\n\nOn Tuesday, MAS also raised its forecasts for inflation this year.\n\nIt now sees core inflation at 2 per cent to 3 per cent in 2022, from the 1 to 2 per cent expected in October last year. Overall inflation is seen at 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, from the earlier forecast range of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nS'pore reviewing 2022 inflation forecasts as consumer prices rise to new highs in December\n\nSingaporeans' expectations of rising inflation ease with policy intervention: Survey\n\nAnn Williams\n\nMAS/MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE\n\nINFLATION/PRICE LEVEL\n\nSINGAPORE ECONOMY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d438f29cc18050184920c430de879b21933a308673de9eb4c0d1740e812187a5/AK_mas_250122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "MAS also raised its forecasts for inflation this year.", "caption": "MAS also raised its forecasts for inflation this year.

One of the challengers was Seson, who prevailed by a head from the unlucky Stenmark in a quick 1min 09.93sec. He paid $50.\n\nStenmark \"raced in restricted room passing the 200m mark\". By the time apprentice jockey Jerlyn Seow got him out, it was too late.\n\nThe $366 outsider Exdream flew home third, just a neck away. He is back in form.\n\nSeson's win may have come in a modest race, but it was just the tonic Burridge needed not only to forget his slow start, but also the boredom of quarantine.\n\nThe Australian tested positive for Covid-19 on a trip back home.\n\nHe actually travelled to Australia twice in the last 30 days, mainly to take his Singapore-based grandson Charlie home to spend Christmas with his family on the Gold Coast.\n\nBut it was on his second visit this month to bring Charlie back that both grandfather and grandson tested positive.\n\n\"When Charlie was positive, I was then negative. But, when I went to pick him up at the airport last Wednesday to bring him back to Singapore, I was positive. I'm now in isolation for seven days as they changed the rule,\" said the 67-year-old.\n\n\"We were supposed to have come back already, but I had to change my flight to next Sunday. I'm still positive, and worse still, my sister's also got it.\n\n\"I have no symptoms, though, which is good, touch wood. I don't feel crook or anything.

Once he peeled Limited Edition into the open on the outside, there were no prizes for guessing where the thicker end of the prize money was heading.\n\nLimited Edition went on to score a soft win - by half a length from Universal Empire - in 1min 11.79sec.\n\nRenzo had every chance but had to settle for third, another half a length away.\n\n\"After the horse ran a disappointing race in May last year, we realised he was not right. He was very sore,\" said Ong.\n\n\"It was not easy to get him right, but Dr Dan Shaw put in a lot of effort to get him right.\n\n\"He did a bone scan and all his four fetlocks had problems. No surgery was required, but just long breaks, and Dan did a lot of work on him.\n\n\"He was very attentive to the horse, and would come by to check on him very often. To me, Dan doesn't get enough credit for his fantastic work at the club.\"\n\nOng also credited his New Zealand owner, Alan Young.\n\n\"He's been very patient and left it to us to look after his horse's best interests,\" he said.\n\n\"He trialled very well (third) behind Katak a couple of weeks ago. That's when I knew he was in the right form.\n\n\"With Universal Empire running second, it was an even better result for the stable.\"\n\nLimited Edition now has a record of three wins and six placings from 20 starts for more than $130,000 in prize money.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nEnjoy free installation & more with 10Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/78fbf8a2887301bc99edcd6324bbb3fd519a5650d43b21b43c24512e5a77987e/race_3b.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Rizuan Shafiq-ridden $110 outsider Limited Edition (No. 3) getting past his fancied stablemate Universal Empire (No. 2) in Saturday’s $50,000 Class 4 event over the Polytrack 1,200m. \n", "caption": "The Rizuan Shafiq-ridden $110 outsider Limited Edition (No. 3) getting past his fancied stablemate Universal Empire (No. 2) in Saturday’s $50,000 Class 4 event over the Polytrack 1,200m.

They are also required to get tested again within 72 hours of arriving in Beijing.\n\nThere is concern, however, about asymptomatic cases circulating in the community since the city reported the first instance of the less severe but highly transmissible Omicron variant two weeks ago.\n\nHealth officials have blamed overseas mail as the source for the variant and are continuing to mass disinfect parcels while telling the public to reduce their international shopping. Those who have received goods from outside China have reported their health tracking kit alerting them that they could potentially be at risk of Covid-19.\n\nThe Straits Times has seen notices sent to several residential compounds in central Beijing popular with foreigners ordering people to undergo testing because some of their neighbours had recently visited Fengtai.\n\nThe authorities are also targeting those who recently bought medications for cough, cold and fever. During a previous outbreak in October, several people had tried to self-medicate after exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19, even going on to play mahjong with friends.\n\nChina is the last major country in the world still pursuing a \"zero-Covid\" policy with its borders still largely shut to foreigners and every case triggering a slew of stringent measures including centralised quarantine for close contacts.\n\nMinute details like one's movements in the fortnight leading up to a positive Covid test are also released in the media. One such announcement provided Beijingers with a glimpse of those who keep the city running regardless.\n\nContact tracing showed that a 44-year-old man, identified only by his surname Yue, worked at 27 different work sites and garbage collection centres over two weeks, beginning only at midnight.\n\nNetizens dubbed him the \"hardest-working person among the floating population\" - a hashtag that amassed over 60 million views on social media platform Weibo - drawing attention to deep inequality in China.\n\nBut, for now, residents are just worried that even harsher measures could be implemented in the city that has enjoyed relative freedom since early 2020.\n\n\"I bought some cold medicine because it's winter and I was having a runny nose, which is common, but now I have to stand in the cold to get tested,\" said Miss Jenny Deng, 22, who was in the queue near the Sanlitun shopping district just after lunchtime.\n\n\"The rules are changing all the time and I don't really understand all of them. But we have to comply, I suppose.\"\n\n- Additional reporting by Lina Miao\n\nBy\n\nElizabeth Law\n\nRead articles by Elizabeth Law\n\n2022 beijing winter olympics\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 15, 2022, 05:25am\n\nEileen Gu takes second medal of Beijing Games but settles for silver\n\nFeb 10, 2022, 05:56am\n\nWinter Olympics: US star Chloe Kim scorches to snowboard halfpipe gold again\n\nFeb 8, 2022, 08:18am\n\nWinter Olympics: US-born Eileen Gu wins gold for China\n\nFeb 8, 2022, 07:56am\n\nUS-born Chinese figure skater in tears after another Olympic flop\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nUNIQLO\n\nNew diverse jeans everyone’s wearing, from slim to wide fits\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7509d9cb9f8dda78dd30f252c37cb0b9e383a015159419af991e0b123d065357/wgtbjcovidqueue240122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "With just over a week to go before the Winter Olympics and a growing covid-19 outbreak, local authorities have been rounding up residents for testing.", "caption": "With just over a week to go before the Winter Olympics and a growing covid-19 outbreak, local authorities have been rounding up residents for testing.

Carriers welcomed the government's decision, which comes ahead of the half-term school holidays next month, followed by spring break and the busy summer season.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 4, 2025, 12:31am\n\nMan arrested for supplying drugs to Liam Payne\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We believe testing for travel should now firmly become a thing of the past,\" said Mr Johan Lundgren, the chief executive officer of discount carrier EasyJet Plc. \"We now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer.\"\n\nAirline shares fell steeply amid a broad market selloff. EasyJet was down 4 per cent at 1.28pm in London. British Airways owner IAG SA lost 6 per cent and Irish discounter Ryanair Holdings was off 5.5 per cent.\n\nOmicron setback\n\nTravel was starting to come back in the fall, just before the rapid spread of the Omicron variant reversed a loosening of border policies for those who were inoculated.\n\nThe number of international flights currently scheduled from the UK during the February half-term holiday are up sixfold from a year ago but remain 41 per cent below 2020, before initial European lockdowns took effect, according to data from aviation analytics firm Cirium. Spain is the most popular destination followed by Ireland.\n\n\"This is a landmark day for passengers, businesses and UK Plc,\" said Mr Tim Alderslade, who heads the Airlines UK industry lobby. \"Nearly two years since the initial Covid restrictions were introduced, today's announcement brings international travel towards near-normality for the fully vaccinated, and at last into line with hospitality and the domestic economy.\"\n\nBritish Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to give more detail on the new policy in a statement to the House of Commons on Monday.\n\nThe UK has been easing its \"Plan B\" Covid-19 restrictions that were implemented across England in December when the Omicron variant spread quickly through the population.\n\nPeople are no longer being asked to work from home, and rules forcing people to wear face masks in shops and on public transport will be dropped from Jan 27.\n\nMandatory Covid-19 passes for businesses will also end this week.\n\nBritain\n\ncovid-19\n\nvaccination\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 15, 2024, 10:49pm\n\nS'pore govt officer in London warned for leaving kids home alone\n\nAug 31, 2024, 04:39am\n\nOasis concert tickets relisted for more than $10k minutes after pre-sale\n\nAug 28, 2024, 12:16am\n\nAdele invites Singapore fan onstage at her concert in Germany\n\nAug 14, 2024, 03:33pm\n\nTaylor Swift set for emotional London return after terror threat\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4e6be996ab7fae7a1621a39acc4badf736929dafb5cbd5f5b8e6c284f60c8187/mi_arrivals_240122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The new rules are part of a general easing of Covid-19 restrictions as the UK starts to treat the virus as endemic.", "caption": "The new rules are part of a general easing of Covid-19 restrictions as the UK starts to treat the virus as endemic.

The other was a side view of a boy with a sunset in the background.\n\nThey were cremated at about 9pm following a Buddhist prayer service at 8.15pm.\n\nEarlier, at around 7.15pm, a white Nissan car, believed to be ferrying the older sister of the boys, was seen entering Mandai Crematorium.\n\nMr Fong Chun Cheong, the funeral director of Singapore Yin Feng Shui Funeral Services, told The Straits Times that the boys were cremated at the same time.\n\nMr Fong earlier said that he had advised the family to cremate the bodies as he could not be sure of their condition.\n\nThis was because no embalming had been done on the bodies over the past four days, said Mr Fong, who previously said he is a family friend.\n\nLast Saturday, the police said they had received a call for help on Friday at 6.25pm from the boys' father who was at a playground in Greenridge Crescent.\n\nHis sons were later found lying motionless in a nearby canal. They were pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic.\n\nOn Monday morning, Xavier Yap Jung Houn, 48, was charged with the murder of Ethan Yap.\n\nThe police prosecutor asked for Yap to be remanded for one week with permission to be taken out for investigations, including visits to the scene of the incident.\n\nOnly one charge was tendered in court on Monday.\n\nThe offence of murder carries the death penalty.\n\nBy\n\nNadine Chua\n\nRead articles by Nadine Chua\n\nMURDER/MANSLAUGHTER\n\ncrime\n\nTwins\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/39c0c32bd7e27ac0b994e09d6f9d3c980959c6cc689475e0edff646137e9a2a3/hztwins240122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Hearses carrying the bodies of the twins arriving at Mandai Crematorium on Jan 24, 2022.", "caption": "Hearses carrying the bodies of the twins arriving at Mandai Crematorium on Jan 24, 2022.

The head of the World Health Organization said on Monday (Jan 24) that the planet can end the Covid-19 emergency this year, although the virus last week killed someone every 12 seconds.\n\n\"We can end Covid-19 as a global health emergency and we can do it this year,\" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the UN health agency's executive board.\n\nTo do so, countries need to work harder to ensure equitable access to vaccines and treatment, track the virus and its emerging variants, and keep restrictions in place, he warned.\n\nThe WHO has for months demanded that countries do more to accelerate the distribution of vaccines in poorer nations, calling on all countries to vaccinate at least 70 per cent of their populations by the middle of this year.\n\nHalf of the WHO's 194 member states missed the previous target of vaccinating 40 per cent of their people by end-2021 and 85 per cent of people in Africa were yet to receive a single jab, Dr Tedros said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 14, 2025, 01:01am\n\nCommunicable Diseases Agency to be set up to enhance agility in responding to outbreaks\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We simply cannot end the emergency phase of the pandemic unless we bridge this gap,\" he said.\n\n\"On average last week, 100 cases were reported every three seconds, and somebody lost their life to Covid-19 every 12 seconds,\" he added.\n\nCovid-19 has killed more than 5.5 million people since it first emerged in late 2019 and case numbers have been driven to record levels by the new Omicron variant.\n\nSince the strain was first detected in southern Africa nine weeks ago, Dr Tedros said 80 million cases had been reported to the WHO - more than in all of 2020.\n\nOmicron appears to cause less severe disease than previous variants and Dr Tedros confirmed that \"the explosion in cases has not been matched by a surge in deaths\".\n\nThe WHO chief said the world would need to learn to live with Covid.\n\n\"We will need to learn to manage it through a sustained and integrated strategy for acute respiratory diseases,\" he said, emphasising it was \"dangerous to assume that Omicron will be the last variant, or that this is the end game.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" he said, \"globally the conditions are ideal for more variants to emerge.\"\n\n\"The potential for a more transmissible, more deadly variant remains very real.\"\n\nWHO\n\ncovid-19\n\nVACCINES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 1, 2024, 09:08am\n\nS'pore wins WHO Healthy Cities award for Nutri-Grade labels\n\nAug 25, 2024, 12:13am\n\nNo quarantine for residents returning from mpox-affected countries\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nFeb 2, 2024, 02:35am\n\nNew cancer cases to soar 77% to 35m by 2050, WHO warns\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/585305df30a960adfd6df624db2f2b058cebf75fb7dc35993ed9f264d81638da/teddy.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO: AFP"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/422368f82773661db2aba3bc7641caaf468927fa4a9263ae30e86ab8bfb4ac77/WJ__6453.jpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Communicable Diseases Agency to be set up to enhance agility in responding to outbreaks", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cc579b56fc180bd18eb2155d17bcdf5f095b1164279334863543cf3c9228c3ac/markdrinks01.JPG?w=318", "alt_text": "S'pore wins WHO Healthy Cities award for Nutri-Grade labels", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He also hurled a racial slur at the sergeant.\n\nThe 54-year-old Singaporean was on Monday (Jan 24) sentenced to 12 weeks' jail and a fine of $2,000. He pleaded guilty to six charges for offences including three counts of harassment.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Choong said Chandrasegaran was drunk on July 2 last year when he went to a Rowell Road restaurant in Little India and started shouting incoherently at its customers.\n\nAn employee alerted the police and officers asked Chandrasegaran to leave the area. But he lay down on a pavement beside the eatery and was arrested.\n\nHe was out on bail on Aug 22 last year when he was seen wearing a mask below his chin while boarding bus service 21. He complied when the driver asked him to don it properly.\n\nThe DPP said: \"The accused then began speaking incoherently to the victim. The victim attempted to converse with him, but subsequently decided to call the SBS Transit Control Centre for assistance, which in turn called the police.\n\n\"The victim asked the remaining passengers to alight from the bus, leaving him and the accused alone... The accused again pulled his mask below his chin and continued speaking incoherently with the victim, but the victim ignored him.\"\n\nChandrasegaran got off the bus about 10 minutes later.\n\nCourt documents do not state what happened next and he was consuming beer alone last September when he developed chest pains.\n\nAn ambulance took him to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) where he became uncooperative with staff and repeatedly asked them to release him so he could go for a smoke. They allowed him to leave at around 2am.\n\nAn auxiliary police officer was escorting him to a drop-off point when Chandrasegaran accused the man of insulting his mother and abused him with vulgar language.\n\nChandrasegaran was drunk on Oct 31 last year when he went to a police post in Jalan Bukit Merah and complained of chest pains.\n\nAn SCDF sergeant arrived at around 11pm and Chandrasegaran insisted on going to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) even though SGH was nearer.\n\nHe abused the officer with vulgar language and uttered a racial insult before leaving for TTSH on his own.\n\nTwo days later, an intoxicated Chandrasegaran approached a station master at Farrer Park MRT station and claimed that he had misplaced his mobile phone in a taxi.\n\nDPP Choong told the court: \"The accused was unable to describe the taxi and insisted that the victim call the investigation officer in charge of the accused's earlier offences. The victim suggested that he go to a police station.\"\n\nUnhappy, Chandrasegaran scolded the man and directed an obscene word at him.\n\nThe victim alerted the police and Chandrasegaran was charged in court later.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2ce47e79b217b7ee4d4fd4b7fdec71c16d85dc11438c8d6739c18b8a0292290e/gavel-1238036-1278x855_revjun212022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

For example, he cannot access the Internet or social media, or issue public statements without the approval of the ISD's director. He is also not allowed to travel out of Singapore without approval.\n\nDaniel was first investigated by the ISD in September 2017, when he was 15 years old. He had posted on social media defaced images of President Halimah Yacob and called for militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to behead her.\n\nISD learnt that he was introduced to pro-ISIS social media groups by a foreign online contact.\n\nGiven his young age and the assessment that he did not pose an immediate threat, Daniel was not dealt with under the ISA then and was instead given counselling to steer him away from problematic ideology.\n\nBut Daniel remained staunchly supportive of ISIS and was discovered by the ISD to be willing to help the terror group's online propaganda efforts. He was even ready to undertake other activities if called upon to do so.\n\nIn January 2020, the ISD detained him. At 17, he was then the youngest to be detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA), before the case of a 16-year-old emerged last year.\n\nThe department said that Daniel's detention was a \"sobering wake-up\" call to the teenager and it gave him a chance to turn his life around.\n\nWhile in detention, the teenager received monthly religious counselling sessions to help him improve his understanding of Islam and correct the misguided beliefs he was introduced to by ISIS.\n\n\"In the process, Daniel... gained an appreciation of Singapore's multiracial and multi-religious context,\" said the ISD.\n\nHe also saw a psychologist to reduce his vulnerability to radical influences, and had a mentor to guide him on his personal goals.\n\nAt the same time, Daniel worked with his school and three Religious Rehabilitation Group volunteers, who are also trained teachers, to continue his education.\n\nThey tutored him and guided him in his self-studies. The ISD said that, during the Covid-19 circuit breaker period, arrangements were made for his tutoring to continue through video conferencing.\n\nDaniel was allowed to sit for the national examinations while in detention. He scored four distinctions out of five subjects in his GCE Normal (Technical) level examinations in 2020, and passed all his subjects in his GCE Normal (Academic) level examinations last year.\n\nThe relationship between Daniel and his family members has also improved, and the ISD noted that his family members visited him regularly while he was in detention.\n\nThe department said that Daniel will continue to be supported as he re-enters life in the community.\n\n\"Since his release, he has successfully enrolled in his choice course of study at a post-secondary institution. ISD will continue to work with Religious Rehabilitation Group and the Inter-Agency Aftercare Group to ease his reintegration into society,\" it said.\n\nBy\n\nHariz Baharudin\n\nReporter\n\nRead articles by Hariz Baharudin\n\nINTERNAL SECURITY ACT\n\nterrorism\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 10, 2025, 06:29am\n\nStudent, housewife dealt with by ISD\n\nJan 9, 2025, 06:29am\n\nISD detains 3 self-radicalised men who made preparations to fight overseas\n\nNov 22, 2024, 06:04am\n\nS'pore woman under probe for suspected terrorism-related activities\n\nJul 15, 2024, 02:04pm\n\nSelf-radicalised S'porean teen, 14, given ISA restriction orders\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/86f1fc76eadd859a0e89b5893e51f230413046df36f71e0d7c2664f8781a900e/ak_sgpol_240122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Under a restriction order, the teenager is no longer detained but must abide by several conditions and restrictions.", "caption": "Under a restriction order, the teenager is no longer detained but must abide by several conditions and restrictions.

He also played in the Europa League the following season and scored in the 1-1 draw with RB Salzburg.\n\nHenrique played in the second-tier European club competition again in 2019, before going on loan to Saudi side Al-Wehda and Brazilian club Atletico Goianiense.\n\nThe 1.9-metre defender is expected to be an upgrade from compatriot Jorge Fellipe, a Player of the Year nominee in the 2021 season when the Sailors won their first Singapore Premier League (SPL) trophy as a privatised outfit.\n\nHenrique is said to possess aerial prowess, astute positional sense, good composure and a strong ability to distribute the ball from the back. He is expected to gel with local defenders such as Hariss Harun, Amirul Adli and Tajeli Salamat.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 25, 2022, 12:26pm\n\nSingapore Premier League kicks off Feb 25; Cup competition returns\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt is understood that the Sailors paid Vitoria 1.3 million euros (S$2 million) to get their new man, who arrived on Jan 12 to serve a 10-day quarantine and participated in his first Sailors training session on Monday (Jan 23).\n\nHe said: \"I wish I could have been part of the team when the club won the league last year. But I am excited about everything else that the club is doing off the field as well - the Sailors project is very ambitious, and I'm delighted to be able to play a part in making that vision a reality.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to working with Diego (Lopes) and club head coach Kim Do-hoon, who won the AFC Champions League. With so many of the squad having international experience with the Singapore team, I'm confident we will grow to be a team to be reckoned with.\"\n\nSince privatising the Sailors in 2020, owners Sea Limited have pumped in significant investment to strengthen the club.\n\nAfter finishing second in the SPL in their first season, they spent a league-record 1.8 million euros to sign Brazilian playmaker Lopes from then-Portuguese top-division club Rio Ave.\n\nLast year, they pipped Albirex Niigata to win their first SPL title and qualified for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League, where they are drawn into Group F alongside Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds, Chinese champions Shandong Taishan and the winners between South Korea's Daegu FC and Thailand's Buriram United.\n\nIn November, they signed former South Korean captain and striker Kim Shin-wook on a three-year deal that is understood to be worth more than $3 million. They also have Singapore's top two custodians in the squad after recruiting goalkeeper Izwan Mahbud to join Hassan Sunny.\n\nAnd the Sailors are not done with their foreign recruitment, as they are still in the market for a wide forward.\n\nCoach Kim said: \"Pedro comes with qualities that will help the team improve even further. We are very clear that we must work to become competitive at the Asian level, and I'm confident that Pedro will help us on our journey.\n\n\"I can't wait to get started with the team in 2022. With the likes of Shin-wook and Pedro, along with the local players we have brought on board, I believe we will be more effective in improving our football.\"\n\nBy\n\nDavid Lee\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by David Lee\n\nsleague\n\nLion City Sailors\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 18, 2022, 08:37am\n\nTampines midfielder Nakamura signs new 5-year deal, eyes S'pore citizenship\n\nNov 9, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nNew FAS leadership must make S.League work\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nChina Market Revival - Here’s Why It Matters\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2f73f8af8a2b98aee8f4022ea4af633606dceafee3f85c50f12889493a80db62/mi_pedro_240122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The 29-year-old was previously with Portuguese top-tier club Vitoria Guimaraes from 2015 to 2021.", "caption": "The 29-year-old was previously with Portuguese top-tier club Vitoria Guimaraes from 2015 to 2021.

This was because no embalming had been done for the bodies over the past four days.\n\nHe added: \"Under Chinese customs, we wouldn't want those who are older to send off their children. So normally, if a child passes away, there will not be a wake or the wake will be held for three days.\"\n\nBut these are special circumstances, he noted.\n\nLast Friday, the brothers were found motionless in a canal near a playground along Greenridge Crescent after their father called the police for help at about 6.25pm. They were pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic.\n\nThe boys' father, Xavier Yap Jung Houn, 48, was arrested late on Saturday for his suspected involvement in their deaths.\n\nOn Monday,\n\nhe was charged with Ethan's murder\n\n.\n\nThe police prosecutor asked for Yap to be remanded for one week with permission to be taken out for investigations, including scene visits.\n\nYap's lawyer, Mr Anil Singh Sandhu, told the court the family was grieving the loss of the two young children.\n\nEthan and Aston, were said to have special needs and were believed to be students of a school in the Eng Kong estate area.\n\nAng Qing\n\nMURDER/MANSLAUGHTER\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/73b99e14a5d71e3415f5d4898063e3f752aa863aa4698bdc9d44e2f329f01954/wgtmortuary240122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The boys were cremated  at Mandai Crematorium on Monday, Jan 24, 2022.", "caption": "The boys were cremated  at Mandai Crematorium on Monday, Jan 24, 2022.

Hopefully, this time around they are really going ahead,\" she told The Straits Times.\n\nBut recovery takes time.\n\n\"They (Singaporeans) need to talk to their bosses, find colleagues to stand in while they go on holiday. Not like bosses in Indonesia who are more flexible and may tolerate last-minute leave requests,\" she added.\n\nWahyudi Soeriaatmadja\n\n, Indonesia Correspondent\n\nindonesia\n\nTourism\n\nTRAVEL AND LEISURE\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 05:17am\n\nSIA, Scoot flights from Changi Airport to Bali among dozens cancelled after Indonesia volcano eruption\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nMan to be charged for buying KrisFlyer accounts illegally to use air miles on purchases\n\nMar 8, 2025, 11:47pm\n\nIndonesian man allegedly flashes at air stewardess on Singapore-bound flight\n\nJan 25, 2025, 01:00am\n\nCPIB arrests businessman wanted in Indonesia for alleged corruption\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0c52a4779fa20bf9561c0a33a788e87c6e3f95273b39642f6908b47b7082fb0d/af_sgbintanbatamvtl_240122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Under the arrangement, travellers from Singapore are allowed to enter Indonesia via Nongsapura ferry terminal in Batam and Bandar Bentan Telani ferry terminal in Bintan.", "caption": "Under the arrangement, travellers from Singapore are allowed to enter Indonesia via Nongsapura ferry terminal in Batam and Bandar Bentan Telani ferry terminal in Bintan.

He had been initially charged with murder.\n\nHe was sentenced to five years' detention - the first person here to be sentenced under a provision in the Children and Young Persons Act that allows the court to impose detention for murder, culpable homicide, attempted murder or causing grievous hurt.\n\nProsecutors had sought five to seven years' detention, while the defence asked for three to five years.\n\nThe boy, who has been remanded at the Singapore Boys' Home since his arrest, will likely continue to be detained there as he studies for his O levels this year.\n\nShould he go on to take his A levels or N levels, he will be transferred to prison, which offers the necessary academic support, Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Shui Hui told the court.\n\nThe boy, his parents and his younger brother cannot be named under the Act.\n\nThe court heard that the boy was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when he was one year and eight months old.\n\nHe initially enrolled in Pathlight School for Primary 1 but transferred to a mainstream school shortly after as he was deemed to be sufficiently high functioning.\n\nIn 2018, when he was 12, he was diagnosed with internet gaming disorder and attended various counselling and therapy programmes to manage both disorders.\n\nThe court heard that he had a difficult relationship with his father, whom he saw as being \"highly controlling\" for limiting his access to his mobile phone and computer games.\n\nHis father monitored the boy closely and set regular tasks and assignments for him, including laundry duties, homework and assessment books.\n\n\"When the accused occasionally failed to comply with the deceased's instructions, the deceased would hit the accused and swear at him,\" said the DPP.\n\nMore On This

harbouring thoughts of killing his father, after the man forbade him to play computer games for a month.\n\nOn the morning of Dec 11, 2010, after the boy's mother left for work, the father, who was doing laundry, became agitated when he could not find the detergent scoop.\n\nThe boy became angry with his father when the man asked if he had hidden the scoop, but nevertheless, helped to scoop the detergent with his hands.\n\nAfter going back to his room, the boy thought about killing his father to be free from him.\n\nHe took a knife from the kitchen, but on realising that it was too big to hide in his pocket, took a shorter fruit knife instead.\n\nAfter hearing his father telling his younger brother that he had thrown the scoop away, the boy took the knife from his pocket and stabbed his father in the neck.\n\nAs his father screamed, the boy placed the knife in the sink, ran back to his room and locked the door, while his younger brother called for an ambulance and also called their mother.\n\nShortly after, the boy came out from his room, apologised to his father and younger brother, and pressed a towel on his father's neck to stop the bleeding.\n\nHowever, the man collapsed and was taken unconscious to the Changi General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nThe boy was arrested after he admitted to the police that he had stabbed his father.\n\nA psychiatric assessment by the Institute of Mental Health found that the boy's ASD and obsessive-compulsive traits did not cause or contribute to the offence.\n\nPsychiatric reports stated that the boy had sufficient maturity to understand and judge the nature and consequences of his conduct when committing the offence.\n\nHis risk of violent reoffending was also assessed to be low.\n\nMore On This

counsel Shashi Nathan said this was an extremely tragic case that \"decimated the family\".\n\nHe said the boy told him, \"I miss my Papa\", the last time they met at the Boys' Home.\n\n\"Addiction to gaming was his escape into fantasy,\" the lawyer told the court. \"The reality is a constant daily reminder that he has destroyed his family.\"\n\nIn his mitigation plea, he said the boy frequently argued with his father over game use and at times, hacked into his parents' laptops to play games late into the night.\n\nThe lawyer said that the boy's younger brother stopped speaking for some time after the stabbing, and that his mother was diagnosed with cancer shortly after his arrest.\n\nMr Nathan added that his firm, Withers KhattarWong, decided to return his fees to the boy's mother as she had very little savings left.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nPolice investigating after girls filmed fighting in carpark\n\nTeenage girl ganged up with friends to rob and beat up cabby, steal cigarettes

Jan 31 is the deadline for declaring donations, filing GST returns and paying property tax bills.\n\nScams in general, including those targeting taxpayers, have also been on the rise in recent weeks.\n\nLast Friday, Iras warned of a scam e-mail purportedly sent by Iras and signed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Mr Ng Wai Choong, where recipients are told to\n\nbuy an \"approval pass\" to receive funds from billionaire Bill Gates.\n\nOCBC Bank said last Wednesday that it will make goodwill payouts to all customers affected by a recent spate of SMS phishing scams.

He was 73.\n\nMugler's daring collections came to define the decade's power dressing, with his clothes noted for their structured and sophisticated silhouettes, showcased by his extravagant shows.\n\n\"I always thought that fashion was not enough on its own and that it had to be shown in its musical and theatrical environment,\" he once said.\n\nIn later years, he dressed Beyonce and Lady Gaga - and in 2019 came out of retirement to create Kim Kardashian's Met Gala look.\n\n\"We are devastated to announce the passing of Mr Manfred Thierry Mugler on Sunday January 23rd 2022,\" said a post on the designer's official Facebook account.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\nHis agent Jean-Baptiste Rougeot, who said the designer had died of \"natural causes\", added he had been due to announce new collaborations early this week.\n\nShowman at heart\n\nBorn in Strasbourg in December 1948, as a young teen Mugler joined the Opera du Rhin's ballet company before studying at the School of Decorative Arts.\n\nFrom a young age he created his own clothes, adapting items bought at nearby flea markets. He moved to Paris aged 20, initially to work with another ballet company - but was more successful with his own wardrobe.\n\nMugler soon became a freelance stylist and worked for various fashion houses in Paris, London and Milan.\n\nIn 1973, he took the plunge and created his own label \"Café de Paris\", before founding \" Thierry Mugler\" a year later.\n\nHis designs exacerbated and celebrated women's forms: shoulders accentuated by padding, plunging necklines, constricted waists and rounded hips.\n\n\"Dancing taught me a lot about posture, the organisation of clothing, the importance of the shoulders, the head carriage, the play and rhythm of the legs,\" said Mugler.\n\nA showman at heart, he organised spectacular presentations of his creations pioneering the modern spectacle of the 21st century fashion show.\n\n\"Today's fashion shows are a continuation of what Mugler invented. The collections were pretexts for fashion shows,\" recalled Didier Grumbach, former CEO of Thierry Mugler.\n\nHe had showmanship in his blood: for the 10th anniversary of his label in 1984, he organised the first public fashion show in Europe with 6,000 attending the rock concert-like show.\n\nBut nothing compared to the 20th anniversary celebration in 1995, staged at the Cirque d'Hiver.\n\nModels including Jerry Hall, Naomi Campbell, Eva Herzigova and Kate Moss paraded alongside stars such as Tippi Hedren and Julie Newmar with the spectacle culminating in a performance from James Brown.\n\nLater years\n\nThe 1992 launch of his company's first perfume \"Angel\" - in collaboration with Clarins, which acquired a stake in the company before taking control in 1997 - was a runaway success.\n\nClarins shuttered Thierry Mugler ready-to-wear in 2003, a year after the designer reportedly left the brand, but continued the scent business with \"Angel\" rivalling Chanel's No.5 for the top spot in sales.\n\nRenowned for his work with celebrities, he counted Grace Jones and Hall among his muses, and had a long-running creative collaboration with David Bowie - even dressing him for his wedding to Iman.\n\nDespite seemingly retiring from fashion's frontlines in the early 2000s, Mugler continued to impact culture and worked with Beyonce on her \"I am...\" world tour.\n\nIn later years the designer suffered a series of accidents requiring facial surgery, and rebuilt his body with intensive bodybuilding while engaging in meditation and yoga.\n\nobituary\n\nFASHION DESIGNERS\n\nFashion\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 12, 2025, 12:38am\n\nFormer Singapore cricketer and coach Arjun Menon killed in Malawi\n\nMay 1, 2025, 01:29am\n\nWorld's oldest person, a Brazilian nun, dies at age 116\n\nApr 22, 2025, 07:50am\n\nPuan Noor Aishah, S'pore's first first lady, remembered for grace and service\n\nApr 17, 2025, 02:49am\n\nPM Wong pays tribute to Cultural Medallion recipient Yusnor Ef\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nUnited Overseas Bank\n\nHurry, the more you save the more chances you earn to win\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2d6975ae18b44b375e70a4205159b1b026c5b583896398527f8b94be0608bcc2/thierrymugler.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "French designer Thierry Mugler, who reigned over fashion in the 1980s, died on Jan 23, 2022 at the age of 73 of \"natural causes\".", "caption": "French designer Thierry Mugler, who reigned over fashion in the 1980s, died on Jan 23, 2022 at the age of 73 of \"natural causes\".

But they are divided on whether and how to manage a return to school after lengthy periods of remote learning.\n\nStudents in NSW and Victoria will have to wear masks and receive regular rapid antigen tests when they return to in-person classes next week. Queensland, however, postponed the return to school to Feb 7 to avoid a spike in transmission.\n\n\"The peak does not mean the end,\" Queensland Chief Health Officer John Gerrard said, warning of a \"possible extension of the peak\" when schools return.\n\nAustralia\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/13ca26843e408902e76d9f63e1613aadc4f3c2426522a98e3e5d721f64aed811/ac_healthcareworker_240122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Healthcare workers administer Covid-19 tests at St Vincent's Hospital drive-through testing clinic, in Sydney, on Dec 17, 2021", "caption": "Healthcare workers administer Covid-19 tests at St Vincent's Hospital drive-through testing clinic, in Sydney, on Dec 17, 2021 PHOTO: REUTERS"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Heartening Flyer, the $18 second favourite, closed in strongly under jockey Shafrizal Saleh, but the $13 favourite was safely home by half a length in 1min 23.03sec.\n\nThe $144 outsider Elite Incredible finished third, another half a length away.\n\n\"Katak was very good. I always felt very confident on him. He gave me a very nice ride. I feel he has improved a lot since last year - and the longer the races, the better it will be for him,\" said Beasley, who will ride his regular partner Lim's Lightning in the Kranji Mile.\n\nKatak was a $20 beaten favourite in his Kranji debut on Sept 4 last year in a Class 2 race over the Polytrack 1,200m, before finishing 10th to Lim's Lightning in the Group 1 Raffles Cup over 1,600m just two weeks later.\n\nFour weeks later, he beat all but Hard Too Think by half a length in the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Cup over 1,800m.\n\nHe would have been one of the favourites in the Group 1 Singapore Gold Cup on Nov 14 if he were not lame left fore just a couple of days before the time-honoured race.\n\nHe had to be treated and was declared fit to run only on raceday morning.\n\nDespite the setback, he finished a gallant fourth to Lim's Lightning.\n\nLe Grange was pleased to see a more settled Katak at the parade ring on Saturday.\n\nHis charge was not sweating, unlike previously when he had run half the race even before starter's up.\n\n\"Mind you, he's still not fully wound up. That first race back will bring him on,\" said Le Grange.\n\n\"I will now run him in a Class 1 race over the mile on Feb 26 and probably look for another race before the Kranji Mile, which is his main target.\"\n\nThe Kranji Mile on May 21 is the first feature of the season.\n\nKatak's victory also brought great satisfaction for Le Grange. After all, it has rewarded the entire's owners' leap of faith. They had to endure an anxious wait of a year before their horse reached Singapore due to the strict quarantine protocols over the African Horse Sickness outbreak in the last decade.\n\nThe South African trainer thanked Katak's owners, Marsh Shirtliff and his son Guy, and Bryn Ressell for \"such a massive undertaking which can take a lot out of the horse\".\n\n\"It's unbelievable, and it's a great thrill he's won today. I look forward to a good season with him. But, like I said, what I really liked today is how he has matured mentally and physically,\" he added.\n\n\"He's still an entire. The owners do some breeding in South Africa, and, after he won today, I've not seen any signs of coltishness. So, at this stage, there is no plan to geld him.\"\n\nCheck here for Saturday's Singapore results:\n\nresult24.pdf\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4d060978a4f2d0ec7185dab94287ac6d06a533f016946bbd4f1b54151eb9bf0b/race_10b.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Katak (No. 2) breaking through in his fifth Singapore start under a good ride from jockey Danny Beasley in the $85,000 Class 2 event over 1,400m on turf on Saturday.

He paid $17.\n\nAlqantur was third to Bounty Rainbows in his first trial and then won his subsequent heat.\n\nOn both occasions, he was ridden by jockey Louis-Philippe Beuzelin, who kept Alqantur a handy fourth after jumping swiftly from Gate 1 on Saturday, as Bounty Rainbows led from Dabble and Xiyou.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nDabble kept annoying Bounty Rainbows, who caved in under pressure after straightening.\n\nBut no sooner had Dabble found the lead than Alqantur lunged to challenge under Beuzelin's hard riding.\n\nDespite looking a bit green, Alqantur raced away to score emphatically in 1min 10.41sec.\n\n\"He's an exciting young horse who was prepared in New Zealand, where he always showed ability in his educational trials,\" said Clements, the 2020 Singapore champion.\n\n\"He was still green at his initial trials. But he has stepped up and improved each time he has come out. At his first barrier trial, he looked really uncomfortable. He had his head up and it was a bit of a worry.\n\n\"But he never does that in his trackwork. So we figured he didn't like the kickback and, at his second trial, he had a bit more room, and he won it nicely.\n\n\"Today, he had a good barrier and there was some speed in the race. We just told Louis to settle behind the leaders. He had an ideal race. Once he went around the couple in front, he ran away from them in the straight.\"\n\nAlqantur is one of only four Al Rashid's horses left in Clements' yard, while the squad under Mark Walker, who has left Kranji, have been either sold or transferred.\n\nAt the peak of the emerging Middle-East team's presence at Kranji, Clements trained the bulk of their horses, with the likes of So Hi Class, Day Approach, Kassab and Al Meqdam, among some of the winners he saddled.\n\nBut Kuwaiti businessman Fahad Ibrahim Khalid Al-Rashid, who also races horses in Dubai, the US, England, Australia and Malaysia, noticeably took a step back in Singapore towards the end of last season. A first omen surfaced last October, when six horses were moved to the headquarters in Dubai - Jacksa, Almugir, Zahau, Day Approach, Mellad and Al Meqdam - with more joining the exodus in the ensuing months.\n\nOut with the old, in with the new and quality over quantity would seem to be the mottos defining the yellow-brown silks' new direction in Singapore.\n\n\"Fahad gave me a budget at the beginning of last year to buy young horses and Alqantur is one of the four I bought,\" said Clements.\n\n\"He was moving the older ones along and was shifting his focus to a new younger stable of horses.\n\n\"Like some owners of late, it's a bit of sit-and-wait to see how the racing industry goes in the next year or so.\"\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ffc0dae8616e021fb3369c67c13cb666e18b616a2de71811bb97fd8cfadfa63e/race_2c.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Michael Clements-trained Alqantur winning first-up with jockey Louis-Philippe Beuzelin astride at Kranji on Saturday.", "caption": "The Michael Clements-trained Alqantur winning first-up with jockey Louis-Philippe Beuzelin astride at Kranji on Saturday.

Kennedy Jr, who compared vaccine mandates to the Holocaust - took to the microphone in front of the white marble Lincoln Memorial to decry the rules.\n\nLike other Covid-19 restrictions aimed at reining in a disease that has infected more than 70 million people in the US, killed more than 865,000 and brought much of daily life around the globe to a stuttering halt for two years and counting, vaccine mandates have become a deeply polarising political issue.\n\n\"Mandates and freedoms don't mix, like oil and water,\" another speaker said.\n\n\"Breathe. Inhale God, exhale fear,\" exhorted yet another to applause from the crowd, made up of people of all ages, including children, and largely unmasked.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:19am\n\nOver 7m Covid-19 deaths recorded\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I'm not anti-vaccine, but I'm anti this vaccine,\" Ms Michelle, a 61-year-old physical therapist from Virginia who declined to give her last name, told Agence France-Presse.\n\nShe said the messenger RNA serums developed by companies such as Pfizer and Moderna in record time were \"too experimental\" and \"rushed\".\n\nThe mRNA vaccines, given to millions of people around the world in the past year,\n\nhave been proven safe and effective,\n\nas well as being hailed as potential gamechangers in modern medicine.\n\nMs Michelle, who paused in the interview to sing the national anthem with other demonstrators, said she has a religious exemption from taking the vaccine - but that to continue coming to work in Washington she has to get tested every week.\n\nTo her regret, her son, who initially had also resisted taking the vaccine, has now relented.\n\n\"He went and got it without me knowing - so much peer pressure,\" she said.\n\n'My body, my choice'\n\nPeople gather on the National Mall while protesting vaccine and mask mandates, in Washington on Jan 23, 2022.

There are also many anti-Biden posters and a few flags bearing the name of his predecessor Donald Trump - under whom the vaccines were developed and who has taken credit for them.\n\nMr Isaac Six, 34, shrugged off the difficulty of being unvaccinated while in Washington, where proof of vaccination is now required to go to restaurants and other public places.\n\n\"It's okay, we're saving money,\" the 34-year-old charity worker said with a laugh.\n\nVaccines in general \"are wonderful, they have helped millions of people\", he added.\n\nBut mandating these vaccines, which like all vaccines are not 100 per cent effective at preventing transmission, is \"completely irrational\", he argued.\n\nWhat worries him are policies adopted \"out of fear and panic\" and \"by one person\".\n\n\"I would like to see more of the legislative process involved, the people that we elected to represent us be the ones to actually pass legislation,\" he said.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nUS studies highlight the need for Covid-19 boosters to fight Omicron\n\nUS Supreme Court blocks Biden vaccine-or-test Covid-19 policy for large businesses\n\nRelated Stories\n\nOmicron 'sub-variant' throws up new virus questions\n\nPfizer CEO sees annual Covid-19 vaccine rather than frequent boosters\n\nHow did S'pore leaders handle Covid-19?

It gave trainer John Size his seventh victory.\n\n\"He's run many horses down the last few years. He's a champion and, obviously, the race wasn't run to suit him today,\" said Purton, of Golden Sixty.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I was really happy with the way the race was run. I was in a lovely rhythm and I knew he was going to give me a kick.\n\n\"But, with Golden Sixty in the race, you're never home until you pass the post.\n\n\"I thought with the way the race was run, and the position we were in, if I could just get first run on him and have him try and run me down again, that was what I was thinking. Fortunately today, we were able to hold on.\"\n\nWaikuku beat Golden Sixty by 3/4 lengths in 1min 34.82sec.\n\nRussian Emperor was third, a similar margin away.\n\nSent off as a 14-1 chance, Waikuku stepped away cleanly from Gate 4. He settled behind Healthy Happy, who led for the most part, before taking over around the 350m mark.\n\n\"He is (a good horse) on his day and he's shown that and Golden Sixty has had to fight really hard to get past him a couple of times,\" said Purton.\n\nSize, who previously savoured Stewards' Cup glory with Electronic Unicorn (2002 and 2003), Super Kid (2004), Armada (2007) and Glorious Days (2013), was also pleased.\n\n\"The horse has trained up very well since the beginning of the season. He's done everything correctly,\" he said. \"He hasn't had a moment's problem and he's kept on improving as every month has passed.\n\n\"So, to get a nice run like that today, he was able to capitalise on it and kick on and win the race.\"\n\nVictory in yesterday's HK$12 million (S$2.07 million) contest has taken Waikuku's earnings to HK$43.8 million. He is now an eight-time winner in Hong Kong, after arriving from Ireland where he was trained by John Oxx.\n\nThe horse was Purton's third Stewards' Cup winner, after Fellowship (2010) and Beauty Generation (2019).\n\nGolden Sixty was nothing short of courageous, clocking a slick 21.95sec for his final 400m - a Herculean performance, especially from the tail of the field.\n\nBut now, it is onwards and upwards for the brilliant son of Medaglia d'Oro. He will next be tasked with either the Group 1 Queen's Silver Jubilee Cup over 1,400m or defend his crown in the Group 1 Citi Hong Kong Gold Cup over 2,000m on Feb 20.\n\n\"The horse is okay - he appears to have pulled up well,\" said trainer Francis Lui.\n\n\"It was just the draw. The way the race was run, he needed to be closer. But, from the inside, it wasn't possible today.\"\n\nEarning HK$2.64 million for second, Golden Sixty has edged closer to the HK$100 million mark. Beauty Generation holds the record of HK$106.23 million. - HKJC\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/38e2f80234bce1c2e47049fc5a9c28e175ecd3e8186195cacbeaf571a190f6fd/image_-_2022-01-23t210914.097.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Waikuku winning his second Group 1 Stewards’ Cup yesterday.", "caption": "Waikuku winning his second Group 1 Stewards’ Cup yesterday.

She could make amends.\n\n(3) ONLY HEARTS is her biggest threat. This filly was a promising second first-up. She was caught late on a wet ground.\n\nThe well-bred (4) ADITI showed good pace in Only Hearts' race and finished third as the beaten favourite. Expect improvement.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nWatch out for the first-timers, especially (5) BAUBLES AND BEADS, who is bred for speed.\n\nRACE 2 (1,100M)\n\nNice race with a bunch of well-bred first-timers to make it interesting.\n\n(3) GLADATORIAN may be the one to attract the support, as he is a well-bred son of Vercingetorix.\n\n(1) QUESTION MASTER and (5) IRON MONGER should be precocious. Watch the betting.\n\n(11) SUPERIOR FORCE has not disgraced himself in two starts. The colt could get into the picture if not minding the switch from Greyville to Scottsville.\n\n(12) COLOUR OF MONEY was the beaten favourite on debut. He could improve, especially if the going is fast.\n\nRACE 3 (1,200M)\n\nTrainer Michael Roberts has been in good form. His partnership with the promising apprentice Rachel Venniker has yielded results.\n\n(12) NOBLE STORM could be their next successful runner, as her form is decent. She has run well at this venue. She finished behind (13) WINTER JOURNEY but had excuses. She gets a 2.5kg claim. Winter Journey should prefer a longer trip.\n\n(7) RUN AGAIN, who made a fair debut at this course, is a bigger threat. She could have made big improvement.\n\n(16) LADY MACBETH is getting better with racing. Watch out.\n\nRACE 4 (1,400M)\n\n(5) PREEMPTIVE STRIKE has had good draws but has not capitalised. Still, he has run decent races. He may just appreciate this track with its longer straight.\n\n(3) PASHTUNWALI ran a bit below par last time but might have just needed it. From a good gate, he could take advantage.\n\nHe finished ahead of (12) WINTER AIR, who was an impressive winner in his second start and could have more to come.\n\n(7) MASTER VISION can score an overdue win in this distance.\n\nRACE 5 (1,400M)\n\n(1) GO MAN GO was knocking on the door before a rest. He races fresh and has pole position, so should have every chance.\n\n(8) VIA SALARIA will make it hard for him, though. He also looks due and is back at his favourite course.\n\n(4) SPRING HIGH is in good form and should appreciate being back over 1,400m.\n\n(10) MR GONZALES won a nice race last time but is in a stronger field. Still, he cannot be ruled out.\n\nRACE 6 (1,000M)\n\n(5) FLYING THE STAR is back at her happy hunting ground. She should give a good account if not minding the drop in distance.\n\n(3) MISS LIALAH is coming out of a good-form race, in which she did not finish far behind the winner. She was also cut in the race. However, she is dropping to the minimum trip and will have a bit more to do at the business end.\n\n(8) ANCIENT EPIC maintained her form out of the maidens with a solid second in a stronger race. She rates as the one to beat.\n\n(10) STING RAY, (1) SCENT OF A WOMAN and (11) LUNA ECLIPSE have claims.\n\nRACE 7 (1,200M)\n\n(13) AFTER THE RAIN set powerful fractions in the L'Ormarins Queen's Plate. Back home at Scottsville, he could maintain his unbeaten record. But this is quite a race with plenty more classy individuals to take on.\n\n(4) MOUNT PLEASANT was eye-catching in his penultimate start. Like After The Rain, he found 1,600m a bit far last time. He could bounce back.\n\n(7) SOCRATES would be deserving after a string of top efforts.\n\n(14) PEARL OF ASIA, (1) FULL BLAST and (11) SPYDAS CORNER can do it, too.\n\nRACE 8 (1,600M)\n\n(13) CYBER TIME has the form but not the draw. He has been brought along steadily and has not let his side down. But he will have to pull out all stops to open his account from Gate 13.\n\n(11) NAPOLEON has also been given a task from a wide gate. He is still learning and has room for improvement.\n\n(10) NTABAZONDI was expected to make progress second-up but had to avoid a fallen horse. He needs to be taken seriously as this longer straight must suit.\n\n(4) COUNTRY ICE, (5) LIKETHECLAPPERS and (9) THUNDER MASALA could show more.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/faaa8fb4e1fcdd1e0521923e1d47d9f9659769ffa144dd97721ade86d37b530e/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1e42f2ebaf825e27fbdd96b8eb09029f407904f0079182b89b5cf6da850cce04/IMG_0407.JPG?w=150", "alt_text": "Group 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/19dff88cc7965ccfdbc79a552d70c14a01d47aebda5812b4674fbe32f64412ff/tnpcard1.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Race cards for July 15 & 16", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

It focuses on six groups, such as newlyweds, parents and single parents.\n\nSpeaking at the AfA's launch in August last year, Ms Sun said there has been concern over the falling number of marriages and the trend of married couples breaking up sooner.\n\nFor example, 16 per cent of couples who wed in 2006 ended their marriages before their 10th wedding anniversary - almost double the 8.7 per cent of those who married in 1987.\n\nThe first year can be challenging as couples adjust to married life, Mr Palaniappan said, which is why the Joy programme caters to newlyweds.\n\n\"When you are dating, you try to please the other person. When you are married, you become yourself and some find that their spouse has become very different,\" added Mr Palaniappan, who runs a consultancy firm.\n\n\"I always tell couples, marriage is like riding a bicycle, you have to keep pedalling. Once you stop, you fall. So don't take your spouse for granted.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nHe solemnises 500 to 600 marriages a year, and it's not even a paid job\n\nMinor Issues: Secrets of a blissful marriage\n\nMrs Joanna Portilla, 50, a solemniser of 15 years, is also part of the Joy programme. Like Mr Palaniappan, she has couples who turn to her for advice when they run into marital problems.\n\nThey include a woman who discovered her husband's infidelity and another whose husband has a sex addiction.\n\nMrs Joanna Portilla solemnising the marriage of Mr Bryan Cheong and Ms Shannon Lim on Oct 15, 2021.PHOTO: ST FILE\n\nMrs Portilla, an educator who has been married for 20 years and has a teenage son, said: \"Some people find it very hard to talk to their families, as they don't want their families to worry.\n\n\"So it may be easier for them to talk to a third party like a solemniser, especially if they have a good relationship with us. We can provide advice and perspective.\"\n\nBoth Mrs Portilla and Mr Palaniappan volunteer their time to solemnise marriages and mentor couples in the Joy programme. They are also members of the AfA's focal area 2 - support for newlyweds.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nS'porean marriage solemniser Joanna Portilla: It's in my blood.

At the same time, His Majesty also agreed to undergo a respiratory examination at IJN,\" said Royal Comptroller Fadil Shamsuddin.\n\nIn Dr Mahathir's case, no details of his ailment have been made public, although a spokesman for his office told The Straits Times that he was hospitalised at the cardiac care unit.\n\nHe had checked into IJN on Dec 16 for \"investigations\" before undergoing an unspecified elective procedure earlier this month. Before December, Dr Mahathir was last in IJN in 2018 with a chest infection.\n\nPrime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob visited the former leader on Saturday evening, fuelling rumours that the former leader was in critical condition.\n\nCommunications and Multimedia Minister Annuar Musa has urged the public not to speculate about Dr Mahathir's health.\n\n\"We ask the public not to spread any news about Tun M's condition, except those which come from the family or hospital officially.

And business in Chinatown is looking up too.\n\nMs Lim Poh Tee, 56, had hoped that larger groups of visitors would be allowed this Chinese New Year, so that her sons and their families could celebrate together\n\nBut when she heard that the group size of only up to five will remain for the festive period, she and her children made slight adjustments to their planned visits. The group size allowed last Chinese New Year was up to eight.\n\nThe retiree, who has three sons in their 20s and 30s, and five grandchildren ranging from 1½ to 12 years old, is understanding of the situation, adding that prevention is better than cure.\n\nShe told The Straits Times in Mandarin: \"My sons and their families will be visiting me separately on the first day and second day of Chinese New Year.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 17, 2025, 02:16am\n\nM'sia cookie supplier files report after S'pore customer allegedly ghosts her over unpaid bill\n\nMore related stories\n\nAt a press conference last Friday (Jan 21), the multi-ministry task force tackling the Covid-19 pandemic said Singapore is likely to see a \"significant wave\" of cases as the more infectious Omicron variant spreads through the community.\n\nNoting that about 70 per cent of daily cases are now of the Omicron variant, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said existing safe management measures will be maintained through the festive period to lower the risk of transmission and reduce the stress on the healthcare system.\n\nMost of the people The Straits Times spoke to said they were going ahead with their Chinese New Year plans despite the surge in cases.\n\nA bank employee, who wished to be identified only as Ms Goh, said her family would continue last year's practice of visiting only immediate family members.\n\nThe 35-year-old also plans to take her two sons, aged five and eight, to the zoo on the second day of Chinese New Year.\n\n\"We will likely move on or keep our distance at a particular exhibit when there is a large group of people,\" she added.\n\nMs Goh said her family had also been taking antigen rapid tests on a weekly basis.\n\nSecretary Jana Tee said she and her siblings would take turns to visit their mother with their families, so they could adhere to the safe management measures.\n\nThey would also take measures such as wearing masks and washing their hands frequently.\n\nShe added: \"(Covid-19) has been going on for two years. We will just have to carry on with how we are doing things currently. It has already become the norm.\"\n\nDr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said people should maintain safe distancing in homes that they visit.\n\nHe also suggested keeping homes well ventilated and avoiding the use air-conditioning if possible.\n\n\"Use a KF94, KN95 or N95 mask if you have one. Double-mask your surgical mask and tie it with a mask extender tightly,\" said Dr Leong.\n\nAssociate Professor Hsu Li Yang from the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School Of Public Health said it would be best if the public could either avoid visiting elderly persons who are unvaccinated or take a swab test before doing so.\n\nAs Singaporeans stay home for reunion dinners, some businesses in Chinatown are seeing an improvement in sales compared with Chinese New Year last year.\n\nMadam Low Sai Teng, 68, who owns a seafood stall with her husband in the Chinatown Complex wet market, said business had increased by about 40 per cent this year.\n\nShe said in Mandarin: \"I think that because of the restrictions (of five people) this year, more people are intending to buy ingredients and cook at home.\"\n\nMr Yip Wei Keong, 59, who owns a Chinese sausage and waxed meat stall in Chinatown Street Market, said his business had gone up by about 20 per cent this year.\n\nHe said in Mandarin: \"Most people have taken their booster shots so it's safer for them (to go out). The weather has also been quite good recently, so people are more willing to come out for a walk and immerse themselves in the festive atmosphere.\"\n\nYeo Shu Hui and Dominic Low\n\nchinese new year\n\ncovid-19\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 20, 2025, 02:52am\n\nStranger allegedly assaults couple near Esplanade after accusing them of filming her\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 03:45am\n\nTemple plans to hire 'burly' security guards following attack on volunteer\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 12:59am\n\nDevotee allegedly starts fight with temple volunteer after misunderstanding\n\nFeb 12, 2025, 09:40am\n\nFive vehicles destroyed after fireworks stall in Selangor catches fire\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSteady Returns Amid Volatility?

Then surely a picture of its colourful characters - puppets with floppy hair, ping-pong ball eyes and puff ball-tipped tails - would trigger memories.\n\nThe musical, an iconic children's television show created by the late American puppeteer Jim Henson, ran for four seasons from 1983 to 1987.\n\nA reboot of the original series, Fraggle Rock: Back To The Rock, made its 13-episode debut on Jan 21 on Apple TV+.\n\nThe Fraggles are a fun-loving group of furry cave dwellers designed by Henson to entertain while encouraging an understanding and embracing of diversity.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 16, 2025, 09:45am\n\nFree playgrounds your kids will love, from Bidadari to Tengah\n\nMore related stories\n\nAccepting differences, in oneself and others, is a recurring theme of the series.\n\nBut a lot has changed in the world of kids' entertainment since Red, Boober, Wembley, Mokey, Gobo and other Fraggle friends first sang and danced on air. Will today's children embrace the puppet-centric show?\n\nFraggle Rock: Back To The Rock's showrunners Matt Fusfeld and Alex Cuthbertson, who also executive produce, are hopeful.\n\nSpeaking to The Straits Times over a video call, Fusfeld, 43, acknowledges that children - including his own nine- and six-year-olds - get plenty of \"distractions\" from the likes of smartphones and online games.\n\n\"Roblox looms large, for sure. But there's just something timeless, magical and undeniable about puppets. When kids get their eyes on them, they'll be like, 'Oh my god, this is otherworldly.' It's not even like animation.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I can see how transfixed my kids are when they see them. So Fraggle Rock is like a real world compared with Roblox, which is just a computer game, really.\"\n\nCuthbertson, 41, also has two kids aged three years and nine months. Being parents, both are concerned about the content that children are watching these days, including on YouTube, and take pride in the research that they put into the series.\n\n\"If we were approaching a theme or a subject in a particular episode, we always met with an expert to talk about how to depict it in really responsible ways,\" Cuthbertson says.\n\nWhile they hope that fans of the original series would feel connected to the reboot, they are just as excited about getting a new generation of young viewers to fall in love with Fraggle Rock.\n\nEach 30-minute episode provides ways for parents and their children to bond.\n\nFusfeld says: \"If a family would sit down and really immerse themselves in this world - without looking at their phones - and talk about the joy, the silliness and the comedy for half an hour, I can't think of anything better than that.\"\n\nThe complete first season of Fraggle Rock: Back To The Rock is streaming on Apple TV+.\n\nIce Age is back too\n\nCrash, Eddie, Zee and Buck in The Ice Age Adventures Of Buck Wild.PHOTO: 2022 DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC\n\nAlso making a comeback to woo young viewers is the Ice Age franchise.

The cluster has been linked to a wedding, and involved travel between the country's North and South Islands.\n\nA family flew from Auckland in the North to the South Island wedding attended by 100 people. The family and a flight attendant tested positive.\n\nNew Zealand is now imposing a limit of 100 customers indoors in hospitality settings and for events such as weddings, or 25 people if the venues are not using vaccine passes.\n\n\"Our strategy is to slow the spread of Omicron down,\" Ms Ardern told reporters.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We know we will see far more cases than we have in the two years of the pandemic to date. But the difference to previous outbreaks is that we are vaccinated and we are even better prepared.\"\n\nAnnouncing that her wedding, scheduled for later this month, would not go ahead, Ms Ardern said she was sorry for anyone caught up in a similar scenario. She was due to marry long-term partner Clarke Gayford, a television presenter. The couple have a three-year-old daughter.\n\nAsked by reporters how she felt, Ms Ardern replied: \"Such is life.\"\n\nShe added: \"I am no different to, dare I say it, to thousands of other New Zealanders who have had much more devastating impacts felt by the pandemic, the most gutting of which is the inability to be with a loved one sometimes when they are gravely ill. That will far, far outstrip any sadness I experience.\"\n\nMs Ardern encouraged more people to get a booster dose of a vaccine before Omicron takes hold.\n\nAbout 56 per cent of those eligible have had the third shot. \"We need to get that number higher, quicker\", she said.\n\nShe outlined three phases in the government's response.\n\nStage one, when there are fewer than 1,000 cases a day, will still be a \"stamp it out\" approach with contact tracing, polymerase chain reaction testing and self-isolation.\n\nStage two will be an adjustment phase with the focus on those at greater risk of severe illness.\n\nStage three, when there may be thousands of daily cases, will see changes to contact tracing, shorter isolation periods and a test-to-work regime to ensure essential businesses and supply chains continue to operate.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nNew Zealand rules out lockdowns as it prepares for Omicron outbreak\n\nNew Zealand could again delay border reopening due to Omicron\n\ncovid-19\n\nNew Zealand\n\ncoronavirus\n\nJACINDA ARDERN\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/588ed076022b83919efbf08d5741aba67cb740696e570456d3cc9037bcc93b74/jacinda23.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "File photo showing New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, her partner Clarke Gayford and their baby daughter Neve, in happier pre-pandemic times, at the United Nations in 2018.", "caption": "File photo showing New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, her partner Clarke Gayford and their baby daughter Neve, in happier pre-pandemic times, at the United Nations in 2018.

We fought for everything and had a few chances to score the second goal.\"\n\nSouthampton made the perfect start with a goal that would not have looked out of place in City's collection.\n\nFull back Walker-Peters advanced down the right and played in Oriol Romeu and when the Spaniard returned the pass Walker-Peters dispatched a stunning finish across Ederson with the outside of his right foot for his first Premier League goal.\n\nGuardiola looked far from happy on the touchline as City laboured and the visitors were fortunate when Broja slotted past Ederson after being played through but he was ruled offside.\n\nRaheem Sterling wasted a glorious chance when Phil Foden's pass found him unmarked in front of goal but he fired straight at Fraser Forster.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: Rashford last-gasp winner sees Man United leapfrog West Ham into fourth\n\nOn The Ball: Lukaku the personification of Chelsea's misfiring attack\n\nJan Bednarek's glancing header forced Ederson into a reflex save shortly after halftime and from another James Ward-Prowse delivery Broja nodded against the woodwork.\n\nAfter that it was all about Southampton's defence against an increasingly lively City attack.\n\nThe hosts got lucky when Rodri crashed a shot against the crossbar but they switched off soon after when Laporte was left unmarked to De Bruyne's delivery past Forster.\n\nDe Bruyne curled a shot against the post and City laid siege to the Southampton goal but, for the second time this season, found Southampton a tough nut to crack.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: Villa win at struggling Everton as objects rain down from the stands\n\nFootball: Sargent double helps Norwich climb out of relegation zone\n\nepl\n\nmanchester city\n\nFOOTBALL MATCHES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:33am\n\nTickets for Singapore Festival of Football to go on sale on April 25\n\nJan 30, 2025, 05:52am\n\nEPL lawyer 'blown away' seeing illegal streaming boxes at Sim Lim Square\n\nNov 27, 2024, 10:32am\n\nEPL gets S'pore court order to block 50 websites, apps streaming illegally\n\nAug 26, 2024, 12:10am\n\nSon Heung-min's brace eases Tottenham to 4-0 win over Everton\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nChina Market Revival - Here’s Why It Matters\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b45eb21a99042dfaadf5564f7a38ea241b6771abed3bc6b1fe4ab9d8d9c0e7b9/epl23.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Kyle Walker-Peters (centre) celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Southampton.", "caption": "Kyle Walker-Peters (centre) celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Southampton.

Police investigations are ongoing.\n\nAfter the bodies were discovered on Friday, an alert was sent out that night to taxi drivers to be on the look out for a man of unknown race, wearing grey shorts and sports shoes, and last seen at Greenridge Crescent at 3pm.\n\nThe alert, which police confirmed came from them, has since been stood down.\n\nOne resident, who declined to be named, said she saw officers carrying two bodies onto a vehicle at around midnight.\n\nShe added that she noticed how, a few hours before the bodies were removed, a yellow car that was parked on the road was towed away.\n\n\"It's quite a secluded and quiet park and it's beautiful,\" she said. But she added that because of mosquitoes, her grandchildren preferred to play in a connecting park.\n\nThe playground is surrounded by landed terrace and semi-detached homes.\n\nBodies of the two boys were found near the Greenridge Crescent playground, on Jan 21, 2022. ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG\n\nResidents of Eng Kong estate said the neighbourhood is peaceful and the park is usually quiet in the evening.\n\nOne resident, who wished to be known only as Mr Raj, said he exercises frequently at the playground.\n\nThe 57-year-old added that he saw police vans and uniformed men with red berets circling the nearby forest when he was returning home at about 10pm on Friday. He was saddened to hear the news, especially as it is nearing Chinese New Year, he said.\n\n\"I've been here about 25 years and it's such a safe place for everybody. You can be here alone at night and it's a safe place.\"\n\nThe incident on Friday had spooked residents interviewed.\n\nA domestic worker who lives near the playground said she heard a girl shouting for help at about 6.30pm on Friday, just before the bodies were found. The helper, who declined to be named, thought it was just children playing.\n\nBut 15 minutes later, she saw police officers in the area, and soon after, they came knocking on her door asking for information. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force vehicles also lined the streets of the quiet neighbourhood.\n\nResidents said police officers had approached them on Friday night to ask them if they had any closed-circuit television footage of the area.\n\nMP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC Sim Ann said in a Facebook post: \"This is a grave tragedy, and unthinkable especially to anyone who is a parent.\n\n\"I know the news is deeply shocking and upsetting to our community.\"\n\nShe urged residents to avoid speculation and to wait for official information from the police.\n\nShe added: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the children who have lost their lives so tragically.\"\n\nOsmond Chia, Jean Iau and Ang Qing\n\nMurder\n\ncrime\n\nBukit Timah\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 21, 2025, 01:35am\n\nProsecution calls for Mitchell Ong to be charged with murder of Audrey Fang\n\nDec 10, 2024, 08:50am\n\nWoman in Hougang knife attack dies; man to be charged with murder\n\nOct 15, 2024, 04:06am\n\nMan accused of killing woman at Maxwell taken to crime scene\n\nSep 22, 2024, 04:06am\n\nMan allegedly killed in early-morning fight in Little India\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e75d735136a7a9c295c17c2656e602c86c40e76821d8793e630f8810133c88eb/yu_drain2201.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "The bodies of the two 11-year-old boys were found in the canal near Greenridge Crescent playground, on Jan 21, 2022.", "caption": "The bodies of the two 11-year-old boys were found in the canal near Greenridge Crescent playground, on Jan 21, 2022.

The island is linked to Lazarus, Seringat and Kias Islands. The beach on Lazarus is a popular spot among those who visit the island cluster.\n\nThose arriving from Sentosa will need to walk about 1km to the kiosk from Seringat Jetty.\n\nWhile the SDC spokesman said the number of proposed operating days wass to be confirmed, procurement documents state the kiosk could operate for 205 days a year, including Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, as well as school holidays.\n\nWhere appropriate, the appointed operator can monitor demand and further calibrate its opening days, added the spokesman.\n\nThe operator will be allowed to sell canned and bottled drinks, although the sale of alcoholic drinks will be prohibited.\n\nIt will also not be allowed to rent or sell any motorised mobility devices, such as electric bicycles, and portable barbecue pits.\n\nMr Gusdiharto Pratomo, 46, who explored St John's Island with his son last year using their own bicycles, said that, on a bike, he could cover most of the island in a day, something not possible on foot.\n\n\"It may seem like a small cluster, but you can't see everything just walking,\" said the product manager in the information technology industry.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nSt John's Island lagoon to open to public for education, conservation activities\n\nBendera Bay on St John's Island to be opened to public via scheduled programmes\n\nSince the Covid-19 pandemic started, visitor numbers to the Southern Islands have ballooned, with travel-starved Singapore residents looking for recreation options within the country.\n\nThere were bout 200,000 visitors in 2021 - more than twice the number for 2019.\n\nVisitors can also look forward to more activities at Bendera Bay - a lagoon on St John's Island's eastern side - led by volunteer group Friends of Marine Park.\n\nDr Karenne Tun, director of the coastal and marine branch at the National Parks Board's National Biodiversity Centre, said the group organised more than 40 volunteer-led activities last year, such as beach and underwater clean-ups and citizen-science research at Bendera Bay.\n\nIn 2022, the board will continue to partner the group through ground-up programmes and activities at the bay that foster a sense of stewardship and community, added Dr Tun.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nInteractive: Explore the unseen beauty of Singapore’s Southern islands\n\nIsland-hop and uncover the allure of the Southern Islands\n\nNg Keng Gene\n\nCYCLING/BICYCLES\n\nParks And Recreation\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/10119cb06c24987f2cb0f0a94fc8c13372a64f169b44b5fd92018a10d0709504/yq-stjohns-22012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The new kiosk will be located about 400m away from the jetty on St John's Island.", "caption": "The new kiosk will be located about 400m away from the jetty on St John's Island.

on Feb 1.\n\nDemand for popular items such as hotpot sets, which several e-commerce platforms like Lazada, Shopee and Amazon said is higher than last year's, comes with the tightened Covid-19 restrictions.\n\n\"There was a notable increase in purchases for ART self-test kits, suggesting that while Singaporeans are looking forward to (visiting), they are doing so responsibly and (have become) accustomed to a Covid endemic lifestyle,\" said Lazada chief executive officer Loh Wee Lee.\n\nThe multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic had announced on Friday (Jan 21) that\n\nthe maximum number of visitors to a household will remain capped at five\n\n, a limit set in November last year.\n\nIt also said that existing safe management measures, including limiting group sizes for dining at restaurants to five individuals, will continue to be enforced over the Chinese New Year period.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 17, 2025, 02:16am\n\nM'sia cookie supplier files report after

certain items, like self test kits, are in higher demand.\n\nOn Friday, the task force encouraged family members to take a self-administered ART before visiting relatives who are seniors.\n\nCelebrations will be watered down for the second year running with the annual Chinese New Year bazaar at Chinatown cancelled.\n\nThe authorities said additional safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers\n\nwill be deployed at Chinatown hot spots to curb crowding\n\n.\n\nGiven the curbs, people have taken their shopping online.\n\n\"Compared to last year, we have seen a more than 40 per cent increase in our Lunar New Year buyers,\" said Lazada's Mr Loh, who added that this year's sales were led by strong demand for groceries, beauty items and clothes.\n\nShopee said that since the first week of January, sales across their food and beverage (F&B), home and living, and home appliance categories had more than doubled in the lead up to Chinese New Year.\n\nCertain product categories like household cleaning tools and Chinese New Year goodies stood out for the online retailers.\n\nDuring Lazada's Chinese New Year sale from Jan 8 to 16, the most popular products included food items like bird's nest and abalone, handheld and robot vacuum cleaners, as well as Chinese New Year fashion.\n\nVideo game consoles also saw a spike in sales.\n\nAmazon's top product categories during their sale period included household cleaning tools and appliances, and laundry products, as shoppers prepared for spring cleaning.\n\nBeer was also a popular category.\n\nShopee said it saw a greater volume of in-app searches on Chinese New Year-related keywords from as early as December last year, with high demand for items like home decorations, hotpot ingredients and goodies like pineapple tarts and bak kwa.\n\nThis year, the e-commerce platform partnered with the Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng constituency office to introduce the Digital Chinatown e-bazaar, where brick and mortar vendors listed items.\n\n\"Digital Chinatown showcases several home-grown merchants without a prior digital presence, such as Yue Hwa Chinese Products, a long-standing department store that brings authentic Chinese products and delicacies to customers on Shopee,\" said a spokesman for the platform.\n\nYue Hwa's online store on the platform lists products such as peanut and soya bean dipping sauces, and pre-packed sliced rice cakes and noodles for hotpots.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nInflation puts pressure on prices of Chinese New Year goodies\n\nBag-A-Buy: Festive goodies from

New Year goodies before buying them, but now I just rely on word of mouth and Instagram reviews, and buy directly from home-based businesses,\" said Ms Lim, a senior manager in communications.\n\nShe added that she also stocked up on drinks and frozen food off Lazada-owned online marketplace RedMart.\n\nHowever, others like account manager Hannah Goh, 28, prefer to pick up their groceries from the wet market.\n\nSaid Ms Goh: \"Especially for hosting hotpot dinners at home, freshness, good quality and being able to buy seasonal items are more important... you can't ever be sure of what you'll

It then follows the Singapore River and winds southwards to Berlayer Creek.\n\nOn Saturday, more nodes along the route, with amenities such as solar-powered charging points at Changi Bay, Sengkang Riverside Park and Jalan Kayu, were also unveiled.\n\nCyclists near these nodes can now enjoy better connectivity, with the addition of two bridges at Changi Bay Point and a 290m bridge - the longest in Singapore across a canal - connecting both banks of Sengkang Riverside Park.\n\nA shelter and lookout point at Changi Bay Point on the eastern half of the Round Island Route.PHOTO: NATIONAL PARKS BOARD\n\nAnimals also get new housing along the route with the installation of otter holts for the furry creatures to use as breeding places, and marine tiles that act as artificial homes for sea creatures.\n\nThe Round Island Route is part of efforts to transform Singapore into a City in Nature under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, said Mr Heng on Saturday.\n\n\"As part of these efforts, we are adding more nature parks, intensifying greenery and nature in our parks and gardens, and restoring nature into our urban areas,\" he said.\n\n\"By 2030, every household will be within a 10-minute walk from a park.\"\n\nMr Heng added that the completed route will be \"three times the length of Singapore\" and will connect green spaces on the circumference of the island.\n\nFollowing Saturday's launch, NParks will continue to strengthen the connectivity and landscaping of the first half of the Round Island Route, as well as widen paths where possible, said Ms Kartini.\n\nA timeframe for the construction of the western half of the route was still being worked out, Ms Kartini noted, but users can expect more rustic sights with the future path taking in Kranji and Sungei Buloh.\n\nLast year, more than $315 million was committed to developing a network of eight recreational trails spanning 360km, including the Round Island Route.\n\nAsked if NParks was concerned that crowds could overwhelm scenic segments of the new route, Ms Kartini encouraged members of the public to maintain safe distancing and said the board might cordon off lookout points that get too congested.\n\nShe added: \"And maybe (visitors should) not be too hasty to come to these places because you can take your time to enjoy and appreciate these new spaces that we have opened up for the public.\"\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCycling path that connects Lakeside and Chinese Garden MRT stations unveiled\n\nStudy to look into reclaiming space for 120km of new cycling paths in western S'pore\n\nAng Qing\n\nCYCLING/BICYCLES\n\nnational parks board\n\nPARKS/NATURE RESERVES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6a89a9426a46fb8b7f9b7cd5c412ff566889d7fd249137b1db7af36c6d695b51/md_cyclists_22012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Round Island Route will be the longest recreational connection looping around the island.", "caption": "The Round Island Route will be the longest recreational connection looping around the island.

He added that he is from Singapore Yin Feng Shui Funeral Services and has been engaged by the boys' mother to help the family with the proceedings.\n\nHe said the others in the group comprised the boys' sister, who is in her early 20s, and family friends.\n\n\"They just want closure and to be left alone…They just want to have peace,\" said Mr Fong.\n\nThe 40-year-old added that he had met the boys before, describing them as \"lively and energetic\".

They want to look back further in time, and find out how galaxies started in the very beginning. They want to look at the first stars that lit up the universe.\"\n\nHis fascination with space began as a boy. His parents took him to the library, where he would flip through picture books about space. He moved on to astronomy-related books when he was older, and still keeps up with the latest space-related developments through online articles and podcasts.\n\n\"I just find it fascinating how it's like the final frontier for humans. I like the mystery of it and how we haven't explored so much of space,\" he said.\n\nMr Chua's father is a private-hire car driver and his mother works at the Defence Science and Technology Agency as an assistant executive.\n\nMr Chua has been doodling planets, stars and the solar system in sketchbooks since he was a young boy.\n\nHis flair for drawing led him to enrol in a business innovation and design diploma course at the Singapore Polytechnic, where he picked up graphic design.\n\nHis idea of space illustrations came about when he was browsing other space-related Instagram accounts, which were quite text-heavy.\n\n\"I thought that I could translate (content) into comics for people to be more interested in,\" he said.\n\nHe has come up with about 100 such drawings, depicting planets having conversations and conveying a fact or theory. He takes three to four hours to complete one illustration using Adobe Illustrator.\n\nThe feedback he got was unexpected, he said. \"I received direct messages from people around the world supporting what I did, asking if I sold merchandise and if they could buy a book of my drawings.\n\n\"Some pre-school teachers from overseas e-mailed me to say they liked my work and used it to teach their kids.\"\n\nHe added: \"I think it's because no other (comics creator) does this space-related stuff, and I was helped out a lot by other comic creators who gave me shout-outs on Instagram.\"\n\nHe hopes to compile his drawings into a children's book and explore turning his drawings of the planets into plushies, among other merchandise such as posters and keychains.\n\nHe is also considering getting patrons, or subscribers who would pay a small monthly sum for his content.\n\nMr Chua's dream is to work for Nasa in its Washington headquarters, as part of its public outreach team.\n\n\"For now, I just hope to create awareness and spark some interest in space content for kids,\" he said.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nNanosatellite with Singapore start-up's thruster deployed into space on SpaceX mission\n\nS'pore NGO aims to bring space technology to earth\n\nAmelia Teng\n\nSINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nSPACE AND COSMOS\n\nNASA\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 12, 2017, 10:56pm\n\nSIT student lands audit job while on attachment\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9b1335ddbc6d38f2faefaa5711425ba15b78e84261ada73c0a6833806d31ece7/wgtjarrodchua210122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Nasa paid Jarrod Chua $1,000 to modify one of his illustrations into a postcard format, to use in its public outreach efforts.", "caption": "Nasa paid Jarrod Chua $1,000 to modify one of his illustrations into a postcard format, to use in its public outreach efforts.

It wouldn't hurt them to show some respect to all opponents, to other players,\" said an unamused Pavic, who won gold with Mektic at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"We saw yesterday also with Medvedev how it was. That's how they are here, we're used to that.\n\n\"But like I said, it wouldn't hurt them to show some respect.\"\n\nMektic had praise though for the Australian duo, saying: \"The guys played really well. They're a nasty team to beat here and that's it.\"\n\nThe unpredictable Kyrgios was at his colourful best in defeat to Medvedev, dealing out all his assortment of underarm serves and tweeners before a partisan home crowd while embroiled in a running battle with the chair umpire.\n\nHe defended his antics afterwards, saying: \"That's why the crowd is the way it is, that's why the tickets are the way they are, that's why the views are the way they are.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nTennis: Medvedev defuses Kyrgios fireworks to advance in Melbourne\n\nTennis: Nadal repels Khachanov to reach last-16\n\nAUSTRALIAN OPEN (TENNIS)\n\nMEN'S TENNIS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6d7db342b635bc3394b1b35dda8c603b8d7f12d2b5f67ba26f3e68a129399ff9/2022-01-20T113610Z_1003966117_UP1EI1K0W87BG_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-AUSOPEN.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Fans cheer for Australia's Nick Kyrgios during his second round match against Russia's Daniil Medvedev.", "caption": "Fans cheer for Australia's Nick Kyrgios during his second round match against Russia's Daniil Medvedev.

There was an uptick in bookings for tours, with robust bookings during the school holidays.\"\n\nAcross the categories, attractions clocked the most transactions at 1.62 million, generating about $112 million in revenue.\n\nThis is followed by hotels, with 510,000 transactions and generating about $144 million in revenue.\n\nThere were 380,000 transactions for tours, followed by bundled packages, which saw 71,000 transactions.\n\nThe vouchers also had a multiplier effect, which resulted in additional spending at tourism and related businesses, STB said.\n\nIt added: \"We thank Singaporeans for supporting our local tourism businesses, and we hope that they will continue to explore and rediscover Singapore in 2022.\"\n\nBy\n\nAdeline Tan\n\nRead articles by Adeline Tan\n\nTourism\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:05am\n\nSTB revokes licences of 5 travel agents\n\nJun 9, 2025, 01:55am\n\n4 Singaporean tourists in private-hire car injured in accident near Genting\n\nMay 14, 2025, 05:48am\n\nOnly a third of S'pore travellers will wake aisle seat passenger to get to the bathroom: Survey\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a60c733ba07b60ea44ec8619c262f8ab638054dd4c3d9a4162de161c7db0cb26/yq-srv-21012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Close to $300 million in SRV transactions were recorded, with almost $180 million in voucher form.", "caption": "Close to $300 million in SRV transactions were recorded, with almost $180 million in voucher form.

Nothing else was on my mind then,\" said Mr Woo, who returned to man's home and found out that the man was recovering in hospital.\n\nMr Woo, a senior airport emergency officer, was one of more than 100,000 responders in the community involved in the SGSecure Responders' Network, whose efforts were recognised during an appreciation event on Friday (Jan 21).\n\nAt the event, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) announced an expansion of the responders' network to include volunteers who can report suspicious items and behaviour, including suspected cases of radicalisation.\n\nThe network will also be expanded to those who can share news from credible sources to prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\nCurrently, responders in the network are alerted to nearby cases of suspected cardiac arrest and small fires on the app that they can choose to attend to.\n\nSince the network was launched in 2019, the response rate from these volunteers has increased from 30 per cent in 2019 to 45 per cent last year.\n\nTogether with SCDF's myResponder initiative, which was launched earlier in 2015, the joint pool of responders has responded to 62,000 activations and saved more than 30 lives.\n\nMembers of the public who wish to join the network can download the SGSecure app and register on it.\n\nSCDF Community First Responders and community partners were also lauded at the event.\n\nOne of the community partners, Singapore Red Cross Academy, is currently working with the Home Team on a behavioural insights study to find out how to increase responders' registration.\n\nSpeaking as the guest of honour at the event, Minister of State for Home Affairs as well as Sustainability and the Environment Desmond Tan, stressed the importance of the role that responders play.\n\nHe cited a statistic that stated that a cardiac arrest victim's chances of survival drops by 7 per cent to 10 per cent every minute if CPR or an automated external defibrillator (AED) is not applied.\n\nOn the expansion of the network, Mr Tan said: \"These are roles that anyone can undertake. We hope that the broadening of the scope of SGSecure Responders will allow more people to join the network - in particular, those who may not yet have the confidence to perform CPR or (use an) AED or to put out fires in our neighbourhoods.\"\n\nHe added that for those worried about accidentally hurting someone or being blamed for doing something wrong unintentionally, existing laws protect them so long as what they have done is in good faith and with reasonable care.\n\n\"Remember, every action counts. If you see someone in need, please step forward to help,\" he said.\n\nFor IT engineer Ian Patrick Edema, 50, six of his colleagues who were ship captains and responders, or \"angels\" according to Mr Edema, came to his rescue when he suffered cardiac arrest while in the pantry of his office in June 2015.\n\n\"(Doctors) told me that the captains were part of (the reason) why I'm alive because if I had passed out and nobody had done anything, and if no oxygen went to my brain, I could have come out as a vegetable,\" he told the media.\n\n\"They are the reason I am alive,\" he added.\n\nBy\n\nJean Iau\n\nRead articles by Jean Iau\n\nMINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS (MHA)\n\nSCDF\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b9dbffc4d93d36aa16bf4db24a9e6f6fb1c70bb5fff9c17e7126966bdfa2af36/yu_jnmha2101.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Desmond Woo is one of over 100,000 responders in the SGSecure Responders’ Network. \n", "caption": "Mr Desmond Woo is one of over 100,000 responders in the SGSecure Responders’ Network.

The seven-year-old is now owned by Tan Aik Pheng.\n\nST PHOTO: SALWA SUANDI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 21, 2022, 03:05pm\n\nTwo talents for Ong's barn\n\nHe takes charge of Mr Clint and So Hi Class, both running in today's penultimate event\n\nShare this article\n\nBy the lofty standards he set himself last year, it must seem like a quiet start to the new season for trainer Jason Ong.\n\nThree meetings and 21 runners later, he has only a winner to show. That was Blitz Power, who took the Class 5 event over 1,400m last Saturday. But the 33-year-old trainer is not pushing any panic buttons.\n\nHe knows there is a long way to go and, in time, his stable will begin to show results.\n\nIf you recall, last season saw Ong saddle 26 winners to finish as the top local trainer at Kranji.\n\nHe said in an interview recently that he is replenishing his barn and expects to see results in the latter part of the season. Well, the replenishing has begun.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nOng was recently offered the opportunity to take over two tried-and-tested gallopers. Needless to say, he grabbed the chance.\n\nThe horses were 2019 Singapore Gold Cup winner Mr Clint and the Irish-bred middle-distance performer So Hi Class.\n\nOng has not mucked around once he secured their takeovers. They came to him race-ready, even if Mr Clint might be more ring-rusty, having not raced since May.\n\nBut so far so good. Ong gave the pair a couple of blowouts in barrier trials and he came away happy with their showings.\n\nIndeed, he is even ready to run them in races and both will see action in the same race today - the $75,000 Class 2 sprint over 1,400m, which is the main race of the day.\n\n\"Owners were aware that the Al-Rashid Stable (So Hi Class' owner) were cutting down on their numbers. A lot of us were keen to buy their horses and, as I myself did not have any horses of that high ratings, I was keen to add them to my yard,\" said Ong.\n\nMr Clint has a rating of 97, while So Hi Class is at 83.\n\n\"Some partners were interested in So Hi Class and each one of them took a share in him.\n\n\"So Hi Class has trialled really well. The 1,400m may be too short for him first-up but he's fit enough.\n\n\"As for Mr Clint, it was different as the owner (Tan Aik Pheng) just bought him from Al-Rashid and put him with Alwin Tan.\n\n\"He never got a chance to run for Alwin as the owner then decided to send him over to me.\"\n\nThough Mr Clint, a Power seven-year-old, has not been seen since his unplaced effort in the Group 1 Kranji Mile last May, Ong said he received him in good order from Tan, who had already prepped him up nicely.\n\n\"He's a good old horse who's still very keen in his trackwork. When he has company, he wants to lead,\" said Ong.\n\n\"Obviously, he has wear and tear issues, so we've spent a bit of time with him and worked with the Singapore Turf Club vets to get him right.\n\n\"The 1,400m will also be too short for him, but let's see how it all goes.\"\n\nOng will be a fairly busy man this afternoon with eight other entries, including a debutant, Song Of Nature, in the $75,000 Restricted Maiden race over 1,200m.\n\nIn four barrier trials, the All Too Hard three-year-old was placed three times, and will be ridden by Koh Teck Huat, his trial rider in the last three.\n\n\"I'm happy with his preparation. His trials were pretty good,\" said Ong. \"He's still very raw, though. I am just hoping that he can handle raceday conditions.\"\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/73939b41f38b06e6d579962a306635c66f4a0bddd7d166959e8955323ee3e3e2/race_9b.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Clint has won five times, including the Group 1 Singapore Gold Cup over 2,000m in 2019 (left) in the colours of Oscar Racing Stable.

He should enjoy reverting to this distance. With further progress, he could fight out the finish.\n\n(6) GUY ALEXANDER finished behind Auld Mug on debut but could get closer with that experience and natural improvement.\n\n(9) RED KITE gets weight from her male rivals. She has the form and experience to contest the finish.\n\n(10) PHEDRA showed signs of a return to form last time and could confirm.\n\n(7) RUN RUDOLPH RUN need not be special to feature.\n\nRACE 2 (1,000M)\n\n(1) ACT NATURALLY had few friends in the betting on debut but defied a market drift to finish a pleasing fourth over this course and distance. She ought to have come on since and should play a leading role.\n\n(5) MY MIA also finished fourth first-up and should improve for that experience.\n\nThe well-bred newcomer (6) ST KITTS is expected to run well on debut and the market is likely to speak in her favour.\n\n(2) BODY ELECTRIC and (3) CALL ME THE BREEZE are the other first-timers to note if attracting support.\n\nRACE 3 (1,000M)\n\n(5) JAYRANI is one of just two in the line-up with previous race experience. He boasts stronger form. The betting should provide some clues on the chances of the newcomers. On paper, (2) CHARLIE MALONE, (6) KAPUZINER and (9) WECANGOALLNIGHT make plenty appeal.\n\n(8) TROMPIE and (4) FURIE NOCTURNE are worth monitoring.\n\nRACE 4 (1,200M)\n\nThe well-bred (1) PANZANELLA is improving with every start and is likely to have more to offer after a last-start second over this track and trip.\n\n(2) SHE'S MY CAPTAIN and (4) MISS GREENLIGHT fit similar profiles. Both are likely to be competitive over this trip and should not be maidens for much longer.\n\n(13) WAYWARD GIRL and (7) LA VIDA are likely improvers after fair debut efforts. They must be closely watched.\n\n(3) LITTLE MISS PINK and (5) JURY DUTY are others to consider for the exotics.\n\nNewcomers (10) SILKY SECRET, (11) SIMPLY MAGIC and (12) TANGO MIST are not without chances.\n\nRACE 5 (2,000M)\n\n(2) HINCKLEY has made good improvement with blinkers. The colt will also enjoy the step-up in trip.\n\n(3) AENEAS has taken time to come to hand, but is another who could relish going the extra distance.\n\n(5) DOUBLE DUET was second over this track and trip last time and could have a say again.\n\n(4) FLOW FOREVER caught the eye when running on fourth last time. He is likely to pose a threat over this distance.\n\n(8) HIGH DUDGEON and (9) MAGIC MOMENTS have the form and experience to make their presence felt in receipt of weight.\n\nRACE 6 (2,000M)\n\nThe well-bred (1) FOLLOW THE STAR will enjoy the staying trip. She also boasts consistent form at a higher level. She could prove hard to beat with the drop in class.\n\nStablemate and last-start winner (5) OFFICIAL SECRET has improved with the step-up to this trip and is likely to pose a threat if making further progress.\n\n(3) FYNBOS was too far behind from the wide draw to make an impression in a Listed race last time. The mare should fare better in this grade from pole position.\n\n(6) SONG and (2) FRENCH DECLARATION are capable of making their presence felt, too.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/faaa8fb4e1fcdd1e0521923e1d47d9f9659769ffa144dd97721ade86d37b530e/saprev_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The appeal panel was fair in their judgment and I would like to thank them,\" said O'Hara, who has trained several hundred winners, including a few in the major races, in over 30 years.\n\n\"I'll take a break and then decide what to do next.\"\n\nThe horses who tested positive, all last year, were:\n\n- Buuraq, who finished second in Race 3 on April 10;\n\n- Don't Tell Tilly, who finished second in Race 5 on April 18;\n\n- Awesome Conqueror, who won Race 9 on May 29;\n\n- Tigarous, who won Race 1 on July 25 and\n\n- High Voltage, who finished third in Race 1 on Aug 22.\n\nThe urine samples of Buuraq, Don't Tell Tilly, Awesome Conqueror and Tigarous returned positive to ranitidine. The drug is used to treat stomach and intestinal ulcers, and prevent them from coming back after they have healed.\n\nIt is a histamine and blocker, which decreases the amount of acid created by the stomach.\n\nThe sample of High Voltage returned positive to oripavine and morphine. Oripavine is a substance that is convertible into thebaine, which in turn is convertible into morphine, which is used to treat severe pain.\n\nThe five horses were disqualified from their races.\n\nO'Hara was fined $10,000 on each charge. In addition, he was fined $5,000 for having \"in his possession a medication which contained the prohibited substance, ranitidine, which had not been supplied or approved by the Singapore Turf Club Veterinary Department\".\n\nAll his appeals were dismissed.

He has shown his touch of class at times. With one season under his belt and a roaring condition rectified, he can win.\n\n2 Turbo Power gets back to his preferred course and distance. He should be able to shine under Alexis Badel.\n\n8 Splendid Star has more ability than his record suggests. He should be worth a place.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n7 Lucky Gor is stepping out off the back of several solid trials. Chance with the strong booking of Joao Moreira for his debut.\n\nRACE 2 (1,400M)\n\n3 Hinchinlove is consistent. He should roll forward under Derek Leung and be hard to catch.\n\n2 Highland Fortune is in solid form. He has drawn favourably, which should ensure he has got plenty in the tank for a big finish.\n\n8 The Golden Scenery will benefit from a hot tempo. He has a powerful finish but he may need a few favours.\n\n4 Circuit Three is a chance at odds with the good gate.\n\nRACE 3 (1,200M)\n\n7 Super Wealthy is coming to hand nicely. If they run along, he is the one who can rapidly steam over the top of them. This is a step-up in class, but he looks capable and ready.\n\n2 Wellington's best would see him cross the line first. Concerns are how he has come into the race.\n\n3 Courier Wonder is consistent. Expect another big run but the concern is he tends to shy away from the whip and race waywardly in the straight.\n\n8 Master Eight is looking to extend his unbeaten sequence to six. He did just enough last start, but this is a very big step-up for him.\n\nRACE 4 (1,400M)\n\n4 Millennium Falcon has hit a bright patch. He looks capable of a return to winning ways. He should have every opportunity with Zac Purton astride from Gate 7.\n\n5 Beauty Live was impressive on debut. He closed in strongly - like a very nice horse with a stack of upside.\n\n6 Dandy Years can figure. The wide gate is tricky but he has claims.\n\n2 Lifeline Vision closed in nicely last time. Do not discount, especially in this grade.\n\nRACE 5 (1,200M )\n\n7 Rock Ya Heart is returning to Sha Tin - which looks ideal. He has come through a number of strong races. With even luck, this contest appears more than suitable.\n\n3 Team Spirit won well last time. He is well placed to repeat, as long as he crosses in without fuss from the wide barrier.\n\n6 Excellent Daddy is stepping out for the in-form Benno Yung. He is coming to hand nicely.\n\n1 Jumbo Fortune is making his debut. He looked like a mixed bag in the trials but his Australian form suggests he is quite talented.\n\nRACE 6 (1,800M )\n\n3 Pakistan Friend appeals at a price. He was held up at the crucial stages in his last start. When he got out, he was caught a touch flat-footed but quickened up before being caught without momentum.\n\nHe can make a run for it from Gate 3.\n\n8 Shanghai Dragon is consistent. He will roll forward and get his chance.\n\n9 Super Elegance found form last time. He will be coming hard from the rear. A good each-way chance.\n\n1 Darci Joy is the class runner. Remaining in Class 4 is suitable.\n\nRACE 7 (1,600M)\n\nGroup 1 The Stewards' Cup\n\n1 Golden Sixty is Hong Kong's superstar. He can further stamp those claims with his 17th consecutive win. But he will rightly be a short-priced favourite.\n\n6 Healthy Happy scored well first-up in his last start from the front. He is expected to make the running again. He can stick on.\n\n2 More Than This filled second spot behind Golden Sixty last time. He will be there once more.\n\n5 Sky Darci is next best. He has claims.\n\nRACE 8 (1,200M)\n\n9 Baebae Tsoi has a bit of talent. He did well first-up and his latest trial was sound. Expect he can make a run for things from the inside draw for leading trainer Frankie Lor.\n\n4 Leslie did well for second on debut behind a smart winner. Purton hops up now and a win looks close.\n\n1 Classic Moon scored a barnstorming win on debut. Expect he settles back for a strong finish.\n\n3 Marvel Dragon is a winner in the grade above. He is a solid chance, especially on a place line.\n\nRACE 9 (2,000M )\n\n14 Natural Storm is better than his record suggests, especially after a lacklustre first-up effort over an unsuitable distance. The quick back-up suits. He has won second-up previously.\n\n1 Charity Go is the class runner. Expect he is the favourite. If so, that might be a price worth taking on, especially as the topweight.\n\n3 Winning Dragon is coming to hand. He has form at the top level before being imported. Third-up from a good gate should allow him to showcase his best.\n\n5 Enzemble is a threat over this course and distance.\n\nRACE 10 (1, 400M)\n\n13 Star Brite raced without room in the straight last time. He is progressing well and is third-up. With a clean run, he can make his presence felt with a light weight.\n\n10 Seasons Bliss is a serious talent. He bungled the start last time. He should test this group if he manages to jump with them.\n\n1 Circuit Stellar is progressing. Expect another improved effort.\n\n6 Navas Two boasts a pair of solid wins.\n\nThis is difficult but he is in very good form.\n\n• Comments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Some have a lot of prior infections. They have different levels of vaccination.\"\n\nAdded Mr Wong: \"We don't think it is prudent to relax or ease measures during this particular period....We don't know exactly what the impact will be on our healthcare system, or even on the broader issue of potentially a high rate of absenteeism and disruption of business operations. And that disruption can easily take place not just for businesses, but even for essential services including healthcare.\"\n\n\"Let's get through this wave first before we even think about the next bound,\" he said.\n\nThe minister noted the possibility that the virus could continue on its present trajectory, becoming milder and more like a flu - thus spelling a transition from pandemic to endemic.\n\n\"But it's too early to tell,\" he said. \"So long as there are large segments of populations around the world remaining unvaccinated, the risk of mutation remains and you never know what the next variant will look like...There are still uncertainties for the rest of the year.\"\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nFellow co-chair, Mr Ong, said that in the middle of a crisis with every variant unique in itself, the Government has to judge each situation and make decisions along the way.\n\nHe reiterated that Singapore has taken a \"middle path\" compared to countries either remaining closed with \"zero-Covid\" policies or eagerly opening up after each viral wave, only to throttle back restrictions.\n\n\"It's tiring, but on the other hand, we've made progress,\" said Mr Ong. He pointed to how Singapore had gone from imposing two-month circuit breaker restrictions in response to double-digit clusters in 2020, to implementing two-person group size limits to deal with the Delta variant surge last year.\n\n\"This year, with Omicron, we are quietly hopeful that we can go through this wave with the current posture, which I think allows most of us to carry on with our lives quite normally,\" said Mr Ong. \"And after this wave, there's no doubt we will be even more resilient.\"\n\nTrade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said that with every wave and every variant, a bit more about the virus is understood and along with it, more tools to fight the pandemic.\n\n\"The key is to focus on getting our people vaccinated and boosted and at the same time observe the safe management measures that we've put in place to keep everyone safe as much as possible,\" he added.\n\nHe said the authorities understood that many Singaporeans were fatigued by the pandemic and its restrictions looming large for two years and counting.\n\n\"All of us are very eager to get to the end and hopefully reach endemicity soon,\" he said. \"But I would advise that we have to exercise caution. We can't rush these things.\"\n\nRead next - New VTL testing rules, suspension of hospital visits: Latest Covid-19 rules at a glance\n\nJustin Ong\n\n, Political Correspondent\n\nCOVID-19 - SINGAPORE\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It appeared to be recorded with a phone placed behind a gym machine and aimed at a man in a white t-shirt.\n\nCaptions in the video said she recorded the video to confirm her suspicions as the man \"kept staring at my direction\", and included the hashtag \"#gymcreeps\".\n\n\"Watch how he slowly checks out the girl,\" read one line, as the man paced around the gym, pausing for a moment to look in her direction.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 1, 2025, 07:57am\n\nCustomer's dispute with Singapore fashion brand over wardrobe malfunction goes viral\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt was not clear what exactly the man was looking at, however.\n\nAn anonymous TikTok account, @dontanyhowrecord, then responded to Lim's video. The sole video on the account claimed via captioning that the person who was allegedly \"staring\" at Ms Lim was watching an episode of Mr Bean.\n\nThe response video showed a TV located above the machine that Ms Lim was using while she recorded her video. A white circle marked where her camera had likely been placed.\n\nWoman turns off comments on all videos, then apologises\n\nOnline commenters came to the defence of the man, whose face was fully visible in the video.\n\nRealising her faux pas, Ms Lim turned off comments on all of her videos and published a statement on the matter on Jan 20.\n\nHer statement detailed her account of what happened in the gym, why she uploaded the video, and an apology.\n\nShe explained that she uploaded the video to highlight that \"everyone should feel safe in a public space that is commonly dominated by males. And females should be free to choose their outfits based on their likes and preferences and shouldn't be judged for it\".\n\nHowever, she conceded there was \"no concrete evidence\" to show that the man was staring at her, and acknowledged the potential harm her video could have caused to the man.\n\n\"I'm sorry to the guy I've posted in the video. Also, I don't have your contact. Please reach out to me so I can apologise to you personally too,\" she wrote.\n\nTIKTOK\n\ngym\n\napology\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 30, 2025, 01:52am\n\nBoy, 10, loses pocket money watching Pokémon on TikTok\n\nJun 27, 2025, 02:42am\n\nElderly man loses $55,000 in TikTok 'store' scam after being lured by 'beauty'\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:04am\n\nWoman called 'embarrassing' for using CDC vouchers on date, sparks online debate\n\nJun 17, 2025, 07:29am\n\n'For which country?': TikTok video of National Day roadblock sparks debate about who really calls Singapore home\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/061f7a0d5366fa1d1a79a676ef378b7c90b078ce5e7a192a2f7ea68d9c3d5e47/red.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "SCREENSHOTS via @MICHXLIM, @DONTANYHOWRECORD / TIKTOK"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/46c75a7b55adbb6017231f0dc36e75981b5a8de14bdac55557b339024ef987ce/NEWS13.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer's dispute with Singapore fashion brand over wardrobe malfunction goes viral", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a6d04ec3aa4510f151aaa48a767d5433d482e4ef3c6f5945fa9e781766791219/ezgif.com-gif-maker-2.png?w=1418", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1d240d8e7d3ad3fceb843c50b4029f5aaf69269c071239ebfda409dfb77c9c3c/screen-shot-2022-01-20-at-1.42.05-pm.png?w=1398", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7d8894695596eb993d455cf0823147b405960e86c2ef23c97413a620c6bf190f/apology1.png?w=1399", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d21c6c4e6f05a47844d32a33826403a7400833e9ccd5bebc2d1f2fbb7b667c4c/apology2.png?w=1392", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/62f2bc9efe1e6ffadcc3d7e7faf98793600fe6db362620a834293b096bf3dd80/apology3.png?w=1401", "alt_text": "787", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dbe1184496f13a898b81ac8b767b25b7bde6e70b813beb4d4b7ff52ba5d5f91a/Pokemon.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Boy, 10, loses pocket money watching Pokémon on TikTok", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Moments later, the bus crashed into the lorry.\n\nA motorcycle also drove into the bus moments after the crash.\n\nDPP Lim said: \"(Ong) failed to keep a proper look out when travelling straight ahead and thus failed to slow down in time. He thus collided into the lorry travelling ahead of him.\"\n\nDuring the collision, an eight-year-old boy who was seated at the front of the bus was flung forward, whilea woman, 58, fell sideways onto the aisle.

There (was) CCTV (footage) which might have thrown light on the matter, but (it) turned out to be inconclusive.\"\n\nDetails about the baby cannot be disclosed as individuals below 18 years old are covered under the Children and Young Persons Act.\n\nDuring earlier proceedings, the court heard that Nenti was engaged to work for the household in July 2019.\n\nThe baby's father testified last year that he was on his way home from workin August that year when his wife called him and said she had found scratch marks on their daughter's legs.\n\nThe man said he checked on the baby after he reached home just after 6pm and saw the scratches. When confronted, Nenti denied causing them, the court heard.\n\nSuspecting that Nenti could be the one who inflicted the injuries, the father alerted the police.\n\nOfficers soon arrived at the flat and took the maid away. The man said there was no more contact between him and her after that.\n\nNenti was no longer working for the household when the man noticed that two teats of the baby's milk bottles appeared to have been enlarged.\n\nHe had earlier told Judge Ng that their openings were initially small and circular in shape. The two teats, however, appeared to have wider openings with slits.\n\nIn her earlier statements to the authorities, Nenti admitted that she had intentionally scratched the baby's legs.\n\nInitially, she had also admitted that she had cut the teats as she was \"angry\" with the child's mother who had purportedly scolded her every day.\n\nThe maid, however, denied scratching the child and cutting the teats when she testified in court last year.\n\nDefence lawyer Josephine Costan, who represented Nenti pro-bono, told the court on Friday that there was no evidence that the maid had committed the offences \"save for her statements\".\n\nIn delivering his verdict, Judge Ng quoted a report from the Health Sciences Authority which stated that it could not be determined if the teats had been tampered with as \"defects of visually similar appearance could also have been produced through wear and tear\".\n\nHe added: \"It is reasonable that the accused had perceived that the police did not believe her and that she had to admit to the allegations in order for the investigations to be completed soon and for her to return to Indonesia early.\"\n\nThe judge also said that he is \"satisfied that it is unsafe\" to convict Nenti of any of the three charges based on her retracted confessions \"in the light of the circumstances of the totality of evidence adduced at trial\".\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\n, Court Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c4d6b040e9b54770ae9d3df66945be1d8dbf070cc7dd416fa5ddaeb6eb21cd1a/yq-nenti-21012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Nenti had been accused of committing the offences in a Punggol flat in 2019.", "caption": "Nenti had been accused of committing the offences in a Punggol flat in 2019.

Thirty-five per cent of infants in the first three months of life slept an average of 8 to 11 hours a day, instead of the recommendation of at least 14 hours.\n\nWhen it came to pre-schoolers, excessive screen time was an issue, as 95 per cent of them had an average of two hours of recreational screen time a day on weekends, when the advice is to keep it to below an hour a day.\n\nMost of the respondents are mothers (80 per cent) and had a university education (63 per cent).\n\nDr Koh said a child's health in early childhood has a lasting impact on health and well-being later in life. For instance, obesity in childhood predisposes the child to adult obesity and chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\n\"A fat child can become a fat adult, that adage is true,\" he noted. It is thus essential to adopt healthy lifestyle habits from young.\n\nDr Benny Loo, a consultant at KKH's general paediatrics service and sport and medicine service, acknowledged the child-minding challenges that parents have, particularly in this pandemic.\n\nDr Loo, who is also chairman of the guidelines' workgroup, said the key is in integrating the various advice as much as possible for the best results.\n\nFor instance, in a day, an infant aged four to 11 months should have at least 30 minutes of tummy time, zero screen time, and 12 to 15 hours of sleep.\n\nHe or she should also not be restrained or left unattended for more than an hour at a time.\n\nThe set of guidelines was developed by the KKH-led Integrated Platform for Research in Advancing Metabolic Health Outcomes of Women and Children. It is one of the main programmes by the SingHealth Duke-NUS Maternal and Child Health Research Institute.\n\nThe recommendations go beyond the existing national activity guidelines for children aged below seven, which were released in 2013 by the Health Promotion Board.\n\nA summary of the integrated 24-hour activity guidelines for early childhood can be found at bit.ly/33U8Bz4\n\nEarlier in the year, the integrated platform launched the 24-hour activity guidelines for older children and teenagers aged 7 to 18.\n\nJoyce Teo\n\n, Senior Health Correspondent\n\nHEALTH AND WELLBEING\n\nKK Women's and Children's Hospital\n\nbabies\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 1, 2025, 07:25am\n\nMore than half of older women in Singapore face bathroom woes\n\nApr 28, 2025, 02:11am\n\nWoman collapses, foams at the mouth as her liver function is reduced to 20%\n\nMar 7, 2025, 04:19am\n\nFree colorectal cancer screenings from now until April\n\nOct 7, 2024, 04:17am\n\nWoman diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer 10 days after wedding\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f9c379bce6a2ee18177d452f5e303910a2f45d26e5316e073e535e58437429b9/yq-preschool-21012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The guidelines standardise advice in four main areas - physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, as well as diet and eating habits - for young children, within a 24-hour period.", "caption": "The guidelines standardise advice in four main areas - physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, as well as diet and eating habits - for young children, within a 24-hour period.

We're working closely with both hospitals to ensure there's sufficient bed capacity for the children,\" he added.\n\nThe situation is compounded by the increase in numbers of children with non-Covid-19-related respiratory infections who also may require hospital care.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nBased on local data of those below 12 years of age with Covid-19 between Oct 1, 2021, and Jan 16, 2022, Singapore had 14,380 children infected with the coronavirus, among whom four had severe infection needing either oxygen supplementation or intensive care. This corresponds to an incidence rate of 0.03 per cent, or 30 in 100,000 cases, Prof Mak added.\n\nFifteen children in this group developed multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. This is a condition where the child's immune system overreacts after a Covid-19 infection, typically two to eight weeks later. This represents an incidence rate of 0.1 per cent, or 100 per 100,000 cases, which is higher than that reported in some other earlier studies internationally.\n\n\"The rate of severe Covid-19 infection in children or having a severe complication after Covid-19 infection is not trivial,\" Prof Mak said.\n\n\"It's important for us to note that while infections in children are generally less severe than in adults, infections are not mild.\"\n\nThe children who needed oxygen treatment or intensive care ranged in age from less than one to nine years, all of whom were unvaccinated. Under the national vaccination programme, three out of four of them would have been eligible for vaccination, he said.\n\n\"This reinforces the need to better protect our children against Covid-19 and the risk of a bad outcome. We've launched our vaccination programme for these children between five and 11 years of age, and we have seen a good take-up of vaccines so far.\"\n\nClara Chong\n\ncovid-19\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d762198bdee9c8ffda0101d49182ad4106b356cbc710f2e204aa3791476e6524/yu_kids2101.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "More children with Omicron infections are being admitted for treatment, but do not require long hospital stays or intensive care.", "caption": "More children with Omicron infections are being admitted for treatment, but do not require long hospital stays or intensive care.

Entertainment, which was previously Safra Radio.\n\nIn the Triton study conducted last year with 3,000 individuals aged 15 and above, listeners rated highly on metrics such as visiting an event or advertiser's website or social media page after hearing it on SPH Radio stations.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 21, 2025, 01:26am\n\nListen, watch, win: So Drama!

Its deejays include well-known personalities like Glenn Ong and The Flying Dutchman, whose real name is Mark van Cuylenburg.\n\nA separate survey by market research firm Milieu Insights found that Money FM 89.3 remains the most influential radio station for the second year in a row with the highest rate of conversion to action among listeners.\n\nMoney FM 89.3 listeners rated the station highly for the survey metrics of news, topical discussions and interviews with experts, which were much higher than industry average, according to the survey which had more than 2,000 respondents.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese radio station UFM 100.3 holds the highest average listenership among Chinese radio stations for listeners aged between 25 and 34 .\n\nSPH Radio's general manager Sim Hong Huat thanked listeners for tuning in.\n\n\"I'm happy that our survey results reflect our growth and continued commitment to deliver relevant, engaging and empowering content to our listeners. I am confident that we will see our numbers grow in 2022 as we have a very exciting year planned for our audiences,\" he said.\n\nSPH Radio runs three English radio stations, namely Money FM 89.3, One FM 91.3 and Kiss FM; and two Chinese ones - UFM 100.3 and 96.3 Hao FM.\n\nAnjali Raguraman\n\nradio\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 18, 2025, 01:52am\n\nDJ Jean Danker's post-divorce dating life?

He consumed a bottle of whisky at Club Illusion in Clarke Quay before he became drunk and left at around 3am.\n\nWhen he saw two strangers - Mr Law Beng Chong, 47, and Ms Lim Seongyeon, 25 - he cursed at them and lunged towards them.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 07:28am\n\nEx-cleaner jailed over guard's death near 1-Altitude rooftop bar\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe pushed Ms Lim onto the ground and punched Mr Law twice in the face, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Darren Sim.\n\nThe police arrived at around 3.15am and noticed Kim was getting agitated as an officer spoke with the victims.\n\nKim kept inching towards the duo, refusing to cooperate with the officers, and took out his phone to film the incident.\n\nHe shouted repeatedly at the victims, cursed at an officer and said he would sue all of them.\n\nKim asked one of the officers for his card before walking off. He cursed at the officer and said thrice: \"I want to go to prison.\"\n\nUrging the judge to sentence Kim to a week in jail and a fine of $2,800, DPP Sim said in his submissions: \"The manner of the attack was violent... It was unprovoked and one-sided.\"\n\nHe noted that there was no serious injury and that Kim paid compensation to the victims. The amount was not stated in court documents.\n\nDefence lawyers Andre Jumabhoy and Elaine Low asked the judge to issue a fine of $5,000, adding that Kim had taken responsibility for his offence and stopped alcohol consumption.\n\n\"He planned to commence a start-up but it was floundered by the (Covid-19) pandemic. Uncertain of the future, he went out and drank more than he ordinarily did,\" said Mr Jumabhoy, who added that Kim has been married to a Singaporean for around four years and holds a master's degree.\n\nIn a separate case, a British man headbutted a stranger in the nose at the now-defunct Kilo Lounge in Tanjong Pagar.\n\nTyson Wayne Plant, 33, was on Thursday (Jan 20) fined $5,000 after pleading guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt. His job was not stated in court documents.\n\nOn Aug 18, 2018, he argued with unknown patrons after drinking with a friend in the nightclub, and one of them punched his face.\n\nSingaporean Macaulay Nick Olinik, 30, stepped in to defuse the situation, but as he walked away, Plant headbutted him in the nose, fracturing it.\n\nMr Olinik fractured his hand after the incident, but this was not caused by Plant, noted DPP Keith Thirumaran, who left Plant's sentencing to the court.\n\nHe added that Plant had been fined in 2017 for drink driving.\n\nDefence lawyer Yusfiyanto Yatiman said in mitigation that Plant acted out of anger as he was punched before that, but clarified that his client was not drunk.\n\nPlant paid $12,000 to the victim last year (2021) to cover medical and transport bills and expenses linked to the fractured wrist, although it was not caused by him.\n\nHanding him a fine of $5,000, the judge said: \"I hope the accused understands that his own actions have caused injury and alcohol definitely played a part.\n\n\"(Alcohol) has caused you to come to court twice. If it causes you to do such things, you might want to reconsider consuming it at a public place.\"\n\nThose who voluntarily cause hurt can be jailed for up to three years and fined up to $5,000.\n\nBy\n\nOsmond Chia\n\nRead articles by Osmond Chia\n\ncrime\n\nalcohol\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 05:24am\n\nJail, caning for immigration offender who gave $36k in bribes\n\nJul 15, 2025, 12:23am\n\nKallang Wave Mall knife attack: Man to be charged with attempted murder\n\nJul 14, 2025, 06:24am\n\nMan charged for collecting $150k in cash, jewellery for scammers\n\nJul 14, 2025, 06:05am\n\nJail for woman who received over $640m, including scam proceeds\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Business Accounts in Singapore: Make Your Company’s Idle Cash Work Harder\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f40901fe6968475c22504c1bb0d098dd164c4ef5c45cb47a7c4394cbc1788a24/yq-kimeuiw-21012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": " Kim Eui Woong pleaded guilty to three charges for offences that include voluntarily causing hurt, and was fined $7,300.", "caption": "Kim Eui Woong pleaded guilty to three charges for offences that include voluntarily causing hurt, and was fined $7,300.

{"article_url": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/steep-fall-physical-activity-during-circuit-breaker-period-health-promotion-board", "site_title": "Steep fall in physical activity during circuit breaker period: Health Promotion Board", "publish_date": "2022-01-21T09:20:00", "content": "Median daily moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity duration also decreased from 129 to 59 minutes.\n\nST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 21, 2022, 09:20am\n\nSteep fall in physical activity during circuit breaker period: Health Promotion Board\n\nShare this article\n\nWhile hard-core exercise enthusiasts did not let the pandemic slow them down, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) found a steep decline in physical activity from March 2020 through the circuit breaker that ended on June 1 that year, with median daily step count falling from 8,050 to 4,320.\n\nMedian daily moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) duration also decreased from 129 minutes to 59 minutes during that period, data released by the HPB on Friday (Jan 21) revealed.\n\nHPB is behind the successful National Steps Challenge, which is currently in its sixth season and has drawn more than 1.7 million participants across five seasons since 2015.\n\nTo motivate Singaporeans to keep active amid Covid-19, a bonus round of the challenge was organised from March to August 2021, which led to the median daily step count rebounding to as high as 8,000 and the median daily MVPA duration rising to 122 minutes at its peak.\n\nAbout 80 per cent of those who completed both \"Steps\" and \"MVPA\" reward tiers in the bonus round also remained active, continuing to clock steps and MVPA until the end of the challenge.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 23, 2025, 11:38pm\n\nMore than 13,400 families to receive healthy grocery packs\n\nMore related stories\n\nFor Ms Rachel Low, she chanced upon the challenge in 2015 when it started. The then 38-year-old executive in the semiconductor industry, feeling upset that she had to buy larger dresses to fit her growing frame, was determined to change her lifestyle.\n\n\"When I first started the challenge in 2015, I was not very confident. I did brisk walking of about 5,000 steps a day then and slowly increased the number,\" she told The Straits Times (ST) on Thursday (Jan 20).\n\nMs Low's discipline and consistency allowed her to lose about 25kg in less than a year to achieve a healthy body mass index. She eats healthier, cutting back on sugars, and is consistent in her exercise plan, which is to walk at least 40 minutes a day, and attend gym classes on weekends.\n\nThe National Steps Challenge aims to encourage participants to be physically active by logging their daily fitness activities, and hopes to get Singaporeans to embark on an active lifestyle by leveraging technology such as smart wearables.\n\nFor a sedentary adult, walking the recommended 7,500 to 10,000 steps daily can help lower high blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels, and improve glucose control, HPB said.\n\nEngaging in higher levels of MVPA has also been associated with lower risks of cardiovascular diseases and depression.\n\nAnother finding which HPB made is that technology is not a barrier for senior participants, with the use of wearables and reward mechanics motivating them to adopt healthier behaviours.\n\nSign-ups among seniors aged 60 and above grew by 15 times, from 16,000 in Season 1 to more than 240,000 in Season 5. The number of seniors who clocked more than 10,000 steps daily increased by almost 35 times from Season 1 to Season 5.\n\nAn example is Mr Louis Loh, who heard of the challenge back in 2018 through a friend. The 84-year-old, who has high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol, hardly exercised prior to the challenge.\n\n\"The wearable is very useful as it helps me keep track and manage my health,\" he told ST. Currently, the part-time sports assistant walks one to two hours daily, clocking at least 10,000 steps.\n\nThe first half of the sixth season of the challenge has seen more than 620,000 sign-ups, with registration still ongoing as at December 2021.\n\nIt was reported in December last year that this \"unanticipated\" surge in interest in the challenge led to a shortage of fitness trackers needed for participation.\n\nIn an update on Thursday (Jan 20), HPB said stocks have been replenished and it is working with partners to ensure supply at distribution points.\n\n\"Participants can get updates on the availability of appointment slots for tracker collection on HPB's Facebook page and National Steps Challenge website,\" HPB said.\n\nAmid an ongoing pandemic, this season's challenge includes monthly thematic events, with the first in December nudging participants to wrap up 2021 on a healthy note by achieving their fitness goals and sharing their personal stories on how they kept active. More than 140,000 sign-ups were recorded.\n\nThe nudges also include recommendations to participate in physical activity programmes organised by HPB.\n\nSeason 6 will conclude on March 31 this year and HPB will be modifying the challenge from April. Instead of seasonal runs spanning six months, the challenge will be an ongoing programme and details will be released later.\n\nClara Chong\n\nhealth promotion board\n\nEXERCISE/FITNESS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 1, 2024, 09:08am\n\nS'pore wins WHO Healthy Cities award for Nutri-Grade labels\n\nSep 23, 2024, 06:54am\n\nFairPrice Group links mobile app with Healthy 365 app\n\nAug 22, 2024, 08:38am\n\nSurvey shows S'pore residents work out more, smoke less\n\nAug 22, 2024, 07:24am\n\nSalt, sauces, instant noodles, cooking oil to display grades\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/265e972e93072e7310390a4e8cc3a8f2305706234b0f8d1b6511723b5ee383a2/yq-sghealth-21012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Median daily moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity duration also decreased from 129 to 59 minutes.", "caption": "Median daily moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity duration also decreased from 129 to 59 minutes.

article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 21, 2022, 09:03am\n\nJota double against Arsenal fires Liverpool into League Cup final\n\nShare this article\n\nLONDON (AFP) - Diogo Jota fired Liverpool into the League Cup final against Chelsea as the Portugal forward's double sealed a 2-0 win at Arsenal in the semi-final second leg on Thursday (Jan 20).\n\nJota put Liverpool on course for Wembley with a first half strike and he clinched their berth with a late second goal in north London.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side will face Chelsea in the final on Feb 27.\n\nJota's 13th and 14th club goals this season underlined his value at a time when Liverpool are without Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane due to the African Cup of Nations.\n\nThe Reds, who last lifted the League Cup in 2012, are back in the final for the first time since 2016 as they aim to win the competition for a record ninth time.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt will be Klopp's fifth cup final with Liverpool since he took charge in 2015.\n\nIn the week that Liverpool's former chief executive Peter Robinson died aged 86, it was fitting the club returned to the final of a tournament they won four years in a row under his stewardship in the 1980s.\n\nFor Arsenal, it was a frustrating loss after they managed to grind out a 0-0 draw in last week's first leg at Anfield despite Granit Xhaka's red card.\n\nMikel Arteta's youthful side were exposed by battle-hardened opponents, emphasising the improvements still needed to revive the Gunners.\n\nThomas Partey's stoppage-time dismissal for two bookings in quick succession rubbed salt into their wounds.\n\nArsenal were unable to field a team when they successfully asked for last weekend's north London derby against Tottenham to be postponed.\n\nBut Arteta sent out close to a full strength side just days later as fit-again trio Takehiro Tomiyasu, Emile Smith Rowe and Martin Odegaard all returned.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher replaced Alisson Becker in goal for Liverpool and quickly repaid Klopp's faith with a superb save in the fifth minute.\n\nDeadly Jota\n\nAlexandre Lacazette's free-kick was headed for the top corner until Kelleher scrambled across to tip it onto the crossbar.\n\nBut Klopp's men cut through the Arsenal defence to take the lead in the 19th minute.\n\nRoberto Firmino's deft backheel found Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield and his raking pass reached Jota on the left flank.\n\nCutting inside to the edge of the Arsenal area, Jota's impudent nutmeg took him past Tomiyasu and, with three defenders arriving in a vain attempt to block, the Portugal forward scuffed a low shot that trickled past slow to react keeper Aaron Ramsdale.\n\nArsenal were rocked by that blow and struggled to lay a glove on Liverpool for the rest of the half.\n\nThey had a golden opportunity to get back on level terms immediately after the interval when Albert Sambi Lokonga's lofted pass sent Lacazette clear on goal, only for the French striker to balloon his shot over the bar.\n\nKaide Gordon, Liverpool's 17-year-old forward, wasted an equally good chance with a hurried close-range effort that flew high into the crowd.\n\nIbrahima Konate was close to putting the tie beyond Arsenal's reach with a towering header that hit the foot of the post.\n\nIn a wide-open finale, Liverpool substitute Takumi Minamino saw his shot blocked on the line by Ben White before Gabriel Martinelli's rising drive forced a good stop from Kelleher at the other end.\n\nJota made sure Liverpool would not rue those missed chances as he ran onto Alexander-Arnold's pass and chipped Ramsdale in the 77th minute.\n\nThe goal was subject to a lengthy VAR check for offside, but Jota and Liverpool were eventually able to celebrate their place at Wembley.\n\nliverpool\n\narsenal\n\nLEAGUE CUP\n\nepl\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025,

So it does not change the actual epidemic situation which we are experiencing.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, we have been living with Covid-19 and the Omicron variant quite carefully and calmly, with a less restricted posture, where we can meet in groups of five... The fact is that with vaccinations working well and the Omicron variant being less severe, the top-line infection number is becoming less and less meaningful in our response to Covid-19,\" he added.\n\nMr Ong also pointed out that the top-line infection number comprises mostly people who are vaccinated while experiencing mild symptoms, which from a public health standpoint, is not something to be overly concerned about.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe had also discussed this issue with World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week over a Zoom call, said Mr Ong, who noted that it was \"well acknowledged\" by Dr Ghebreyesus and his experts to start to live normally with the disease.\n\nIn addition, two sets of figures will be included in the daily statistics. Besides positive cases detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, those who had gone to their GPs with mild symptoms and taken an antigen rapid test (ART) will be counted in a separate set of figures.\n\nMr Ong noted that when the arrangement had begun on Jan 6, there were around 100 to 200 cases a day that were not counted under the daily Covid-19 figures.\n\nHowever, with more Omicron cases which are milder in nature, Mr Ong said that more GPs will be prescribing this protocol to patients.\n\nCases under this classification had risen quickly to 400 to 500 cases a day last week, and over 1,000 cases a day this week. Therefore, these figures will be added to the daily updates on infection numbers for a clearer picture on the epidemic situation in Singapore.\n\nTotal cases with the Omicron variant:\n\n12,078 individuals\n\nNeeding oxygen supplementation:\n\n34, or less than 0.3 per cent versus 0.8 cent with the Delta variant\n\nDeaths in the last 20 days:\n\nMuch fewer - nine days with no deaths, seven days with one death each, the rest of the days had three or fewer deaths\n\nCases in the ICU:\n\n14 patients, all due to Delta\n\n300 patients occupying about one-quarter of 1,100 isolation beds, which can be ramped up to 2,500 on short notice\n\n200 patients occupying 6 per cent of 3,200 beds in Covid-19 treatment facilities, which can be ramped up to 4,000 beds by the end of January and 5,000 beds by the end of February\n\nCheryl Tan\n\ncovid-19\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/981bf4fe76f6d3ceb1840b31c42274091180d4e68dff5565ce417131b317936f/nmmrt21012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "As the Omicron variant has \"clearly dominated\" the current infection wave, this is a change in case definition and how statistics are compiled.", "caption": "As the Omicron variant has \"clearly dominated\" the current infection wave, this is a change in case definition and how statistics are compiled.

They are not allowed to to attend congregational and worship services, enter attractions or cinemas, or dine in at restaurants.\n\nAnd from next month (Feb1), they will be prevented from doing more activities, such as use of all indoor sports facilities, including privately owned ones.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nSaid Mr Ong: \"The chances of unvaccinated Covid-19 patients needing ICU care or dying is many times that of the fully vaccinated - from seven times more for those aged 80 years and above, and 50 times more for those in their 30s.\"\n\nBased on that, the 120,000 unvaccinated adults could result in 5,800 of them ending up seriously ill or dying.\n\nEven though they are unlikely to all get infected at the same time, Mr Ong stressed that \"5,800 is not a small number\", and noted that at its peak, \"our maximum ICU occupancy was 176\".\n\nWith 176 beds occupied, the healthcare system was already under a severe strain, he said.\n\nEven if the 5,800 getting seriously ill is spread over a couple of months, \"it will be a significant load on our healthcare system, enough to displace many patients suffering from acute complications of cancer or severe chronic diseases who may need urgent medical care\".\n\nMr Ong said that this large number will \"degrade the overall quality of care of the healthcare system, which will ultimately affect everyone, especially those non Covid-19 patients who are critically ill.\"\n\nThey will also consume a lot of costly Covid-19 drugs.\n\n\"And all this can be avoided if unvaccinated individuals have chosen to take their jabs instead,\" he said.\n\nThe biggest risk is among older people.\n\nMr Ong pointed out that the risk of unvaccinated people falling severely ill or dying goes up with age, from 7.2 per cent for those in their 60s, to 14 per cent for people in their 70s, and 24 per cent for people aged 80 years and older.\n\nWhile the figures cited were based on infection with the Delta variant, which causes more serious illness than the current Omicron wave, they may still be relevant.\n\n\"We have not seen the full impact of the Omicron wave in Singapore,\" Mr Ong said.\n\n\"Now is not the right time to take a gamble to remove VDS on the hunch that Omicron may be less severe for the infected unvaccinated. We cannot gamble on the health of Singaporeans.\"\n\ncovid-19\n\nVACCINES\n\nhospital\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But this is to protect their health and welfare.\"\n\nHe added that the authorities will review the need for these restrictions when the community situation improves.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 28, 2024, 08:25am\n\n'I really wanted to live': SQ321 passenger on turbulent trauma\n\nMore related stories\n\nSingapore reported 1,001 new cases with the Omicron variant on Thursday. Of these, 952 were local cases and 49 were imported.\n\nThe weekly Covid-19 infection growth rate also rose to 2.17 on Thursday, the first time since Sept 19 last year that Singapore's weekly infection growth rate has gone above 2.\n\nMOH said hospitals and homes will have the discretion to allow visitors for exceptional cases, for example, if the patient or resident is critically ill.\n\nTo ensure that patients and residents remain connected with their loved ones, hospitals and homes will help to facilitate alternative methods of communication, such as through telephone or video calls.\n\nSome patient groups will continue to be allowed visitors on a case-by-case basis, as assessed by the hospitals.\n\nThese are patients who are critically ill, paediatric patients, birthing or post-partum mothers, and patients who require additional care and support from caregivers.\n\nThese patients would be allowed only one pre-designated visitor, with one visit per day.\n\nThose who are critically ill may be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors, with a maximum of two visitors at the patient's bedside at any one time.\n\nAll visitors to hospital wards must wear face masks with good filtration capability, such as surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabrics.\n\nNo eating or drinking will be allowed in the wards. Visitors must not use the patients' toilets in the wards, and must avoid sitting on patients' beds.\n\nVisitors to hospital wards and homes will also need to produce a valid negative antigen rapid test (ART) result obtained within 24 hours of the visit.\n\nThe ART is compulsory for all visitors regardless of vaccination status, except for those who have recovered from Covid-19 and can present a valid pre-event test exemption notice.\n\nFully vaccinated or medically ineligible visitors can perform an unsupervised self-administered ART or choose to go for supervised ART.\n\nThose who opt for an unsupervised self-administered ART will be required to show evidence of a valid ART result, for example, present a time-stamped photo of the dated ART result and a photo ID for verification.\n\nVisitors who are not fully vaccinated will need to take a supervised ART from approved test providers. Results from unsupervised self-administered ART will not be accepted for this group of visitors.\n\nAdeline Tan\n\nHOSPITALS\n\nNURSING HOMES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 23, 2024, 07:01am\n\nInsurance nightmare strands S'pore PR in South Korea\n\nJul 12, 2024, 02:51am\n\nMore senior citizens abandoned at Malaysia hospitals\n\nJul 2, 2024, 02:45pm\n\nEx-celebrity chef Lisa Fong recovering from bout of ill health\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 02:35am\n\n12 injured after balcony in Chiang Mai resort collapses\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nWhy Outdoor Roller Shades Are a Game Changer\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3bf712e59b7e7b76e5acfb2f9e77b45a7df9a3301f85231ad0e3b408877fc803/yu_hospward2101.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The suspension of in-person visits will last from Jan 24 to Feb 20.", "caption": "The suspension of in-person visits will last from Jan 24 to Feb 20.

This will take immediate effect.\n\n\"We urge those with non-emergency conditions, including children, to avoid seeking treatment at hospitals and to consult their primary care doctor instead,\" MOH said.\n\nThose who test ART positive at non-clinical settings but who identify themselves as potentially at risk should still visit a doctor for medical advice even if they feel well, MOH added.\n\nPatients who are on protocol 1, recovering well and whose symptoms have improved, can also transit smoothly to protocol 2.\n\nThis means that they can be discharged earlier and return to normal activities if they test negative on a self administered ART taken 72 hours or more after their first positive Covid-19 test.\n\nThis will be progressively put in place in the coming couple of weeks, where protocol 2 can be applied to all low-risk, asymptomatic individuals who are in protocol 1 settings.\n\nThese include Covid-19 Treatment Facilities, those who test positive for predeparture tests, pre-event testing, rostered routine testing and mandatory traveller tests and tests taken at the end of Stay-Home Notice periods, so long as their medical conditions allow it.\n\nClara Chong\n\ncovid-19\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThe Underrated Strategy That Keeps Your Investments on Track\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/62da98ee2266acbffdd9ca77ad31804820c3277b251c3c4545fc54e28e988138/yu_cccovid2101.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The change is because of the shorter infectious period of the Omicron variant.", "caption": "The change is because of the shorter infectious period of the Omicron variant.

We need everyone to do your part, uphold safe management measures wherever you go and test yourself regularly.\n\n\"If you feel unwell, even if it's just mild flu-like symptoms, please do not take any chances. Better to take precautions and work from home,\" he added.\n\n\"If you can't work from home and if you have to go to the office and you say 'I'm feeling quite alright, it's just mild symptoms' then it's best to take an ART (antigen rapid test) to make sure you're not infectious before you go to the office.\"\n\nSaid Mr Wong: \"In that way, even if one person were to catch the virus, it will not spread to others in the organisation and result in a massive disruption in the entire organisation.\"\n\nSingapore's director of medical services Kenneth Mak noted that hospitals are also reviewing their service continuity plans and closely monitoring staff numbers.\n\nCountries like Australia, Britain and the United States have had high healthcare staff absenteeism rates due to healthcare workers getting infected with Covid-19, leading to a \"severe degradation\" of healthcare and other essential services, Associate Professor Mak said.\n\nSingapore's hospitals have plans in place to augment staff and will activate these if required, he added.\n\nMOH will be working closely with the hospitals to ensure no significant disruption of healthcare services, he said.\n\nProf Mak also explained that with the healthcare system raising its preparedness posture, hospitals have to be careful in how much elective non-urgent clinical treatments they can provide.\n\n\"I seek the understanding of all Singaporeans,\" he said. \"Hospitals may again have to delay the scheduling of such non-urgent treatments at this time, until we are confident that we're over the peak for Omicron cases in the community.\"\n\nJustin Ong\n\n, Political Correspondent\n\nCOVID-19 - SINGAPORE\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nFeb 14, 2025, 01:01am\n\nCommunicable Diseases Agency to be set up to enhance agility in responding to outbreaks\n\nDec 3, 2024, 11:21pm\n\nPM Wong has Covid-19 for the first time 'after all these years'\n\nSep 2, 2024, 12:57am\n\n2,102 people in S'pore have died from Covid-19 up to June\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/512466f66c0bf79fa6589ad10e825de1500bf484b66de1a21af899188a26fa8d/wgtwfhoffice210122.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Employers must also ensure that employees physically onsite do not participate in social gatherings and have their meal breaks individually.", "caption": "Employers must also ensure that employees physically onsite do not participate in social gatherings and have their meal breaks individually.

This proportion could be even higher - close to 90 per cent or more, he added.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nSo far, most of the Omicron cases have been mild, especially among those who have been fully vaccinated and even more so for those who have received a booster shot, said the minister, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force handling the pandemic.\n\nAs a significant proportion of the workforce may be infected with Covid-19, businesses should put in place robust continuity plans to mitigate disruptions to their operations, particularly those in the essential services, Mr Gan added.\n\nFinance Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Mr Gan and Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, said it is very likely that the Omicron peak will exceed the previous peak from the Delta variant.\n\nNoting that the authorities have said the Omicron wave could rise to 15,000 daily cases, Mr Wong said it is \"very possible\" that the peak may well be higher than that.\n\nOther countries have seen an Omicron infection rate of about 400 infected persons per 100,000 persons, he said.\n\n\"Now if you translate that to Singapore's population, we are talking easily 20,000 to 25,000 infected cases a day,\" Mr Wong added.\n\nBut he stressed that the focus should not be on headline infection numbers, but on the number of people who are severely ill and who need hospital or intensive care.\n\n\"And in that regard, we are hopeful that we can ride through this Omicron wave without having to tighten our measures,\" he said.\n\nMr Gan acknowledged that many people have hoped for safe management measures (SMMs) to be relaxed ahead of the holiday period.\n\n\"However, it is important that we continue with our existing SMMs to help prevent overloading our healthcare system, even as we experience a surge in cases from the Omicron variant,\" he said.\n\nThis means that the permitted group size for Chinese New Year remains at five people, with households allowed to receive only five unique visitors a day.\n\nRestaurants are also not allowed to take bookings for multiple tables of five, unless all members are from the same household.\n\nTo free up hospital capacity for the impending Omicron wave, the Health Ministry will reduce the isolation period for fully vaccinated people who are unwell and have tested positive to a maximum of seven days, down from 10 days currently. The same applies to children under 12.\n\nThis is because studies from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases have shown that people with Omicron infections have a lower viral load than if they had been infected by the Delta variant.\n\nHowever, unvaccinated people will still have to be isolated for 14 days if infected.\n\nPeople will also be allowed to leave isolation earlier if they are recovering well and whose symptoms have improved, even if they are warded in treatment facilities.\n\n\"These changes enable us to deal more nimbly with Omicron and minimise disruption to normal activities for fully vaccinated and boosted persons even as case numbers continue to rise,\" MOH said.\n\nLinette Lai\n\ncovid-19\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/579cdba21bd7432461a75e8919ec4ed10a6300b9aed6454eec2d7f7e1a34cb11/nmcrowd21012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "So far, most of the Omicron cases have been mild, especially among those who have been fully vaccinated.", "caption": "So far, most of the Omicron cases have been mild, especially among those who have been fully vaccinated.

They go about their duties in a serious manner, but they remain in good spirits. If that's something I can feel, I'm sure the patients can feel it too. Like how viruses, fear and panic are contagious, so are love, calm, joy and kindness.\n\n\"We've seen scenes like this all around the world now, so it's perhaps not as shocking to see hospital staff in full personal protective equipment (PPE) two years on, but my respect for the healthcare workers has only increased because while we all feel the pandemic fatigue, they are right on the front lines and I don't think anyone of us can imagine the mental and physical stress they face daily.\"\n\n2.Ng Sor Luan\n\nSign of the times: A montage of the reminders for people to keep their distance during the pandemic, taken from March to December 2020.ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN\n\n\"In the second half of March 2020, social distancing stickers and tape started popping up all over Singapore to encourage people to keep at least 1m away from one another. It was surreal to see these appearing all over clean and neat Singapore; I thought this might not happen again and decided to record it.\n\n\"In the beginning, all I saw were marking strips of yellow, black, or red. But people quickly became creative - large or tiny stickers, overlaid or otherwise, some even came with jokes or handwritten notes. Worn-out tape and stickers later showed how long the pandemic had gone on.\"\n\n3. Chong Jun Liang\n\nPeople crossing the Causeway towards Woodlands Checkpoint in Singapore on March 17, 2020, two hours before Malaysia's movement control order came into force.ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG\n\nThe Malaysian government gave barely 24 hours' notice when it announced a two-week nationwide travel ban in a bid to beat Covid-19. It was a rude shock to more than 350,000 people who use the land crossing daily, most of them Malaysians working or studying in Singapore. I reached Johor Baru at about 7.30pm and started to photograph the chaotic jams, following a stoic crowd who decided that walking across the Causeway was faster than taking a car or bus.\n\n\"At that moment, who knew that the borders would end up closed for almost two years before the vaccinated travel lane (VTL) was put in place? The last time the Causeway shut down dates back to World War II, when the British bombed it in a futile attempt to stop the Japanese advance.\"\n\n4. Mark Cheong\n\nInside the migrant workers' S11 Dormitory @ Punggol on April 21, 2020.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG\n\n\"This was where one of the first Covid-19 clusters in migrant worker dormitories was identified. It was one month into the lockdown, and what you don't see in this picture are the frustrated yet curious eyes that greeted us when we got to the main courtyard, which was as far as we were allowed to go. The workers were asked to go back to their rooms, as being in the general corridors was not encouraged.\n\n\"Looking at this picture, I am reminded of the extremely frustrating and sorry situation that dormitory residents had to deal with. It serves as a reminder of how good the rest of us have it, and how some of the restrictions that affected our daily lives were incredibly First World problems, compared with what migrant workers went through during those months.\"\n\n5. Kevin Lim\n\nA worker cannot help but tear up after a nasal swab at the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital on April 28, 2020.ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIM\n\n\"The test collects a sample of nasal secretions from the back of the nose and throat, causing discomfort to nerve endings that may elicit tears and coughing. This Bangladeshi migrant worker started tearing up after his swab. At that point in time, I had yet to experience a swab myself. From the look of it, the process seemed largely uncomfortable and I wanted visual evidence.\n\n\"This photo was taken during a time when migrant workers were maligned and blamed for the number of Covid-19 cases. I had hoped that the photo could add to the discussion of their living environments, provoking thought and challenging mindsets along the way. The face represents, for me, one of the many Covid-19 cases which arose in migrant worker dormitories that brought to light their overcrowded situation.\"\n\n6. Benjamin Seetor, Mark Cheong\n\nDrone image of Toa Payoh Swimming Complex on May 5, 2020, during the circuit breaker.ST PHOTO: BENJAMIN SEETOR, MARK CHEONG\n\n\"This was part of a feature called\n\n'A city at a standstill'\n\n, where the idea was to capture popular tourist spots, shopping strips, recreational facilities and other areas that were usually crowded before the pandemic. We wanted to document what the country looked like from above with these drone photos.\n\n\"Looking at the photo now, the emptiness of what we know as a 'bustling' city seems surreal. As much as we enjoyed the space and peacefulness during the circuit breaker, we hope the virus will be defeated soon and the world can reconnect once again.\"\n\n7. Gavin Foo\n\nOffice workers with packed lunches in June 2020, one week after the circuit breaker formally ended.ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO\n\n\"This was when people were allowed back in their offices, but dining out was not. I had to find a picture to illustrate this transitioning phase, and chanced upon these office workers stepping out of Market Street Interim Food Centre with their purchases. What stood out for me were the red plastic bags they were holding, against the dark green backdrop. It helped that they were all walking in one direction.\n\n\"When I look at the picture now, I feel that we are all still trying to play our part amid the pandemic - head in one direction, united - but the destination remains unknown.\"\n\n8. Jason Quah\n\nThe multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic holding a meeting on Jan 7, 2021.ST PHOTO: JASON QUAH\n\n\"This was just before the meeting commenced. I was in the room as the task force members came in, and was allowed to take photos for around two minutes. There was minimal room to manoeuvre physically, so the challenge was to capture nuances in body language, gestures and expressions that reflected the gravity of these meetings.\n\n\"It was a rare opportunity to observe and take photos of politicians in a more candid setting, compared with the staged or carefully orchestrated 'diary' events which I previously photographed them at.\"\n\n9. Kua Chee Siong\n\nMr Ng Khee Chee with a photograph of his mother, Madam Chin Chye Yin, when she was in hospital. He could only communicate with her virtually. ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG\n\n\"It was heartbreaking for me to listen to Mr Ng's story, about how his family could not say their last goodbyes to his mother. During the portrait session, I had asked Mr Ng to sit at the spot at the dining table where his mother used to have her meals. I then gently asked him to think about his mother. He tried to be stoic but was obviously holding back his emotions in front of us - tears started to well up in his eyes but he didn't let them flow.\n\n\"After covering the pandemic for two years and being consumed with news on the latest Covid-19 numbers and emerging variants, Mr Ng's story still deeply touches me and brings home the risk of infection. It could happen to any of us.\"\n\n10. Lim Yaohui\n\nA radiographer preparing to take a chest X-ray of a Covid-19 patient at the Singapore General Hospital on Nov 16, 2021.ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI\n\n\"The medical staff knew exactly what to do inside the ward and carried out their duties professionally. I have the utmost respect for them because they are on the front line treating Covid-19 patients, taking care of them so that they can return to their loved ones in better health one day.\n\n\"For this shoot, I remember that a few days before, I had to try five different models and sizes of N95 masks before 'passing' a mask-fitting test. I then had to declare a negative antigen rapid test result on each of the three days I went inside the hospital to take photos.\n\n\"After every shoot, I would use alcohol wipes to sanitise my equipment, spray my shoes with sanitiser when I got to the doorstep of my house, and shower and wash my clothes straightaway. The virus may be invisible to the naked eye, but it does not mean it does not exist.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n'Till today, we have no closure': Trials of Covid-19 survivors, pain of bereaved captured in new book\n\nHow healthcare workers have 'carried the can' in Singapore's Covid-19 battle\n\nWhere to buy the book\n\nWhere to buy the book\n\nIn This Together: Singapore’s Covid-19 Story retails for $28 (with GST) at major bookstores.\n\nIt is also available online at\n\nthe Straits Times Press website.\n\ncoronavirus\n\ncovid-19\n\nphotography\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\n6 Timeless Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett’s Final Berkshire Hathaway Meeting\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dc5d5c80478fbaa863acdd1c008558491eac1752d6c298be5cbe78aa5f8e7bf9/best_covid_pics_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Straits Times picture desk has documented the coronavirus and its impact on Singapore since it struck in January 2020.", "caption": "The Straits Times picture desk has documented the coronavirus and its impact on Singapore since it struck in January 2020.

In fact, it was the only way to travel across the country until the 1960s.\n\nWhen construction of the national highway began in the 1960s, stairways and footpaths at the trail gradually fell into disrepair.\n\nThe historic trail runs across mountain ridges and lush valleys. It also plays the vital role of connecting towns and villages with hundreds of historic and cultural sites along the route including nine Dzong fortresses.\n\nThe Trans Bhutan Trail is touted by outdoor enthusiasts as one of the most challenging routes in the world.\n\nbhutan\n\nheritage\n\nTourism\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 23, 2022, 09:15am\n\nBhutan welcomes back tourists after Covid-19 with honey, turmeric and SIM cards\n\nJul 1, 2022, 01:31am\n\nBhutan to welcome tourists for first time since Covid-19\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSingapore Bank Stocks in 2025 - Opportunity or Risk?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5e8041cc3fb4a9e99ea1e5797b5f369de370e3a6ced2f0ae1b06ad57e8813468/transbhutantrail.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The 403km trail will be officially inaugurated by the King of Bhutan in March with international visitors being allowed to walk the trail beginning from April.

She went to the Find My app on her iPhone.\n\n\"It showed me my whole route. It said 'the last time the owner saw your location was 15:02' and I was like, 'that's now, I'm at home',\" the report quoted her as saying.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 18, 2025, 12:31am\n\nCreative Technology retrenches 40 workers\n\nMore related stories\n\nShe called the police and Apple, which confirmed that the device was an AirTag, but she could not find where it had been planted.\n\nBBC reported that it had spoken to six other women with similar experiences. One said she had found an AirTag taped to the inside of a bag. Others had not been able to locate the tags.\n\nSome women have put out posts on social media about finding unknown AirTags on their cars and in their belongings.\n\nIn an earlier report, The New York Times said it had spoken to seven women who believed they had been tracked with AirTags.\n\nIt described the experience of Ms Erika Torres, a graduate music student in New Orleans, and included her YouTube video in its report.\n\nApple, which introduced the AirTags in April 2021, claims that it has better security features than rival products.\n\nPeople with an iPhone would be alerted if an unregistered AirTag was moving with them. And the AirTags would make a beeping noise when separated from an owner for a period of time.\n\nBut critics say the beep is too soft. The devices can also be turned off remotely, for instance when the person being tracked has reached her home. This could be why many were unable to find the devices.\n\nAnd it makes those who do not use an iPhone even more vulnerable. In December, Apple released an app that will alert Android users to rogue AirTags, but only a tiny fraction of them have downloaded it. And it is not automatic, meaning users have to manually activate it.\n\nAirTags are also more of a risk because of how common Apple products are, said Ms Eva Galperin, a cybersecurity director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who studies stalkerware.\n\n\"Apple automatically turned every iOS device into part of the network that AirTags use to report the location of an AirTag,\" the NYT report quoted her as saying. \"The network that Apple has access to is larger and more powerful than that used by the other trackers. It's more powerful for tracking and more dangerous for stalking.\"\n\nSome local police departments in North America have reportedly started warning residents about the devices.\n\nAirTags are sold in Singapore with prices starting from $45, according to the Apple website.\n\nWatch Ms Torres' video here:\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nApple\n\nsecurity\n\nPRIVACY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 20, 2024, 02:04am\n\niPhone 16 launches to cheers and applause at Orchard store\n\nMar 1, 2024, 01:40pm\n\nApple users urged to update devices after app vulnerability found to give attackers access to data\n\nOct 31, 2023, 02:31am\n\nApple revamps Mac line-up and pricing with new family of chips\n\nOct 10, 2023, 09:28am\n\nAirport technician nabbed for helping smuggle hundreds of latest iPhones into Vietnam\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nFind the Best Fixed Deposit Rates\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d23c8bfbdf5c4896edbb6b63fd1950f7c83eee47f905faa49a1d1ec90e57b564/airtag21.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ms Erika Torres, whose YouTube video about apparently being tracked by an unknown device was shared by The New York Times.", "caption": "Ms Erika Torres, whose YouTube video about apparently being tracked by an unknown device was shared by The New York Times.

There were many instances where she later found out it was a design from a luxury brand.\"\n\nThe reality star was set to appear on variety show Omniscient Interfering View and hit talk show Knowing Bros, but their producers have decided to edit out her portions in the wake of the scandal.\n\nEven fellow Single's Inferno contestant Kim Hyeon-joong, 28, who was romantically linked to Song on the show, had distanced himself by unfollowing her on Instagram.\n\n\"There has been a lot of attention (on us) and Ji-ah also wasn't following me. I didn't want unnecessary rumours to start circulating so that's why I decided to unfollow her too,\" he said on Wednesday (Jan 19) to Maeil Business Paper, a South Korean news outlet. \"There were no other reasons.

Although he beat Proof Perfect by just a neck in 1min 00.20sec, his win was very fluid.\n\nEvidently, both are coming back to hand. They should be closely watched.\n\nRidden by leading jockey Manoel Nunes, Crystal Dragon flew to the front shortly after jumping.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Jason Lim-trained five-year-old showed plenty of zest, tearing away to lead by about eight lengths. He was out to win. Nunes pushed him all the way up the straight.\n\nHis rivals narrowed the gap towards the end, but the second-best horse, Quarter Back, could finish only 33/4 lengths behind.\n\nCrystal Dragon's win was in his second start in Restricted Terms over the Polytrack 1,100m in a modest 1:05.37. He led all the way with jockey Michael Rodd astride.\n\nThe chestnut Australian-bred gelding must have gone sour after that. He failed in his subsequent seven starts.\n\nHe was rested after his last-start fifth on July 25 last year. From yesterday's trial, it is clear Crystal Dragon is breathing fire again.\n\nKeep monitoring him. Should he continue to show his fiery side, it should be time to jump on the bandwagon.\n\nThe James Peters-trained Circuit Mission was one of the last to leave the stalls but cruised up pulling double on the inside for jockey A'Isisuhairi Kasim.\n\nOcean Crossing led, but Proof Perfect overtook him at the bend. Strong N Best moved up to third on the outside. Circuit Mission was just behind.\n\nProof Perfect went wide turning for home. Ocean Crossing straightened up on the shortest route home to draw level.\n\nCircuit Mission loomed up between the pair under his own steam. He went on to beat the hard-ridden Proof Perfect by a neck.\n\nThis is a big improvement on his trial nine days earlier when he ran fourth to Katak.\n\nThe seven-year-old Irish-bred is a horse to watch now that he is hoering in Class 3.\n\nAfter his hat-trick, he contested in five feature races, including the Group 1 Singapore Derby. But he was unplaced in all.\n\nHe showed a return to form two starts back on May 15 last year, finishing third to So Hi Class over 1,600m in Class 3.\n\nSomething must have gone amiss, as he was rested for 61/2 months. He resumed on Nov 27, the final day of last season, and finished a four-length fourth to Heartening Flyer over the Poly 1,200m.\n\nA short rest after that first-up run must have done him a world of good. His mannerisms suggest he is on the winning trail. Watch him.\n\nYesterday's Kranji barrier trial results:\n\nTRIAL 1\n\n1 Lim's Puncak Jaya H\n\n(D Beasley) 2 Melody Fair H (M Lerner) 3 Supernatural (O Chavez) 4 Battle Win (N Zyrul)\n\n5 Kinabalu Prince (Y Salim)\n\nMargins and time: Nk, 3, shd, 6 3/4 (1min O1. 00 Sec)\n\nTRIAL 2\n\n1 Crystal Dragon H (M Nunes)\n\n2 Quarter Back H\n\n(S Shafrizal) 3 I'm A Conqueror H (Chavez)\n\n4 Starfortune (L Beuzelin)\n\n5 Infinite Wisdom (R Shafiq)\n\n6 Super Extreme 7 Hex Mark\n\n8 Tavi Will Do (Lerner)\n\nMargin l and time: 3 3/4, 1 1/4, 1, 5 1/4, 1/2, hd, 5 1/2 (59.74 sec)\n\nTRIAL 3\n\n1 Circuit Mission H\n\n(K A'Isisuhairi) 2 Proof Perfect (PH Seow) 3 Ocean Crossing (Shafrizal)\n\n4 Strong N Best (S John)\n\n5 Paletas 6 Lim's Passion (Beasley) 7 Legend Of The Sun (Nunes)\n\n8 Jupiter Gold (Lerner) Margins and time: Nk, 2 1/2,\n\n3 1/2, 2 3/4, 1 3/4, 1/2, 1/2 (1:00.20)\n\nTRIAL 4\n\n1 Resolution H (Shafrizal)\n\n2 First Chief H (John)\n\n3 Lim's Spin H (Beasley)\n\n4 Karisto 5 Mandrake (Lerner) 6 First Choice (Seow)\n\n7 Gold City\n\nMargins and time: Hd, 3/4,\n\n1/2, 2 1/2, 1/2, 201/4 (59,62 sec)\n\nTRIAL 5\n\n1 Miracle H (Nunes) 2 Charger (Seow) 3 Fate To Win (A'Isisuhairi) 4 Royal Pavilion\n\n5 Easylights (Chavez)\n\n6 Lim's Hopefully (Beasley)\n\n7 Northern Star (TH Koh)\n\nMargins and time: 1/2, 1/2,\n\n3/4, 1/2, 2 1/4, 3 1/4 (1:00.86)\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSalary Insights in Singapore - Where Do You Stand?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6d72131e27cbafbb79bb472e52ade3c451f0b52a96ee6bf0a6e3db425a8131c0/t2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Jason Lim-trained Crystal Dragon showed his rivals a clean pair of heels with leading jockey Manoel Nunes astride in Trial 2 at Kranji yesterday morning.

Actually, it was not a bad effort, just that he went too fast which suited the swoopers.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Hideyuki Takaoka-trained four-year-old New Zealand-bred led for the first few hundred metres. He was then overtaken slightly by Buddy Buddy.\n\nThe pair went like the clappers, leading by many lengths. Con Speranza kicked ahead in the straight. He was well clear and still going strong with 200m left .\n\nFor a moment, it looked like victory was his, but his swift pace began to take its toll.\n\nSwamped late, he finished seventh - but only 31/4 lengths behind the winner, King's Command, who went on to finish a respectable eighth in the Group 1 Singapore Gold Cup over 2,000m.\n\nOscar Chavez, his rider that day, said it was not his intention to lead. But his mount overraced to clinch the rabbit's role.\n\nHe attempted to settle the horse, but it overraced on the outside of Buddy Buddy. Con Speranza initially responded to his riding in straight, but weakened in the concluding stages.\n\nAlso take note that it was the bay gelding's first and only attempt over 1,800m. He is more of a 1,600m galloper. His only win three starts back was over this distance in Class 4.\n\nIn his last start on Nov 20, Con Speranza ran a good third behind Rambo over 1,600m. He did not have a good jump, was stuck in midfield and wide.\n\nChavez was asked why his mount settled further back in the field, as opposed to his normal racing pattern.\n\nHe said that, bearing in mind Con Speranza had raced very fiercely in his previous start, he was instructed to settle midfield if possible. He was not to push the gelding in the early stages to prevent the horse from overracing.\n\nHe noted that his mount travelled only fairly until the home turn. When he was able to shift wider on the track, the gelding ran on well.\n\nSo, there were some genuine excuses in Con Speranza's last two outings. Forget those runs.\n\nWith no speed in tomorrow's race, the Big Valley-owned gelding should end up in a forward position. Just hope that he does not overrace.\n\nIf last week's track bias continues (10 of the 12 winners were from the front bunch), it will be hard to reel in Con Speranza.\n\nThe other top bet tomorrow is Be You in Race 8 (3.30pm).\n\nThe Shane Baertschiger-trained and Auric Stable-owned useful four-year-old has benefited from a half-year break.\n\nHe trialled very well last week. He led cosily from Universal Empire on his outside.\n\nAlthough the Jason Ong-trained galloper eventually won by a head, he was ridden hard, while jockey Matthew Kellady had put Be You on cruise control.\n\nLike Con Speranza, Be You also finished out of board only once from eight outings. That was his last start in the Group 2 Singapore Three-Year-Old Classic over 1,400m. He finished fifth but only 31/4 lengths behind the winner.\n\nBe You has two wins and three seconds. That is an impressive record from a good horse.\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Money Market Funds in Singapore for Smarter Cash Management\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f85120ebdd409bf0b33a6d70ddf320e4d8269cbec9d1a4f79853e820178c1fbe/race_7e.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Con Speranza beating Russian Twist by 11/4 lengths three starts back on Sept 18 last year in a Class 4 race over 1,600m.

It's a nice number to get to but it doesn't stop here, we keep going,\" he said.\n\n\"It's nice to ride a winner for Paul. He's one of the nicest guys here.

Your only concern: will I get more money than I did last year?\n\nLike a journalist who leaves his trade and moves into the PR industry, now, YOU are the one giving the mooncakes, or in the case of CNY, the red packets. And there is a litany of rules and customs to abide by.\n\nFret not, for here is a brief guide to hongbao-giving - the who, what and most importantly, how much.\n\nWho gives and who gets\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 28, 2025, 12:12am\n\nHow much hongbao money will you be getting this Chinese New Year?\n\nMore related stories\n\nSimply put, hongbao is traditionally given out by married couples. There are some who believe that those in their first year of marriage get a pass, but this varies among families. So be sure to check with yours.\n\nThe usual recipients are parents, children and single adults (who are not well-known millionaires).\n\nThere really isn't an age limit to receiving hongbao, but there are some who feel that receiving them in your late 30s is a little awkward - for both giver and recipient. Some families even draw the line when their \"kids\" start earning and living on their own.\n\nAlso, people don't usually hand out hongbao to their colleagues. So if you see unmarried Agnes who works in marketing at some gathering, you don't have to give her anything more than a hello.\n\nNow would you give a wad of cash stuffed in a red packet to your spouse? Well, that would seem odd. Plus, imagine the ramifications if you \"undergave\"? Better don't.\n\nWhat is the right amount?\n\nFirstly, odd-number amounts are considered inauspicious. To that end, so is the number 4, which in Chinese sounds like \"death\", and thus infers misfortune.\n\nApparently, Teochews do not see \"4\" as bad luck, and so some of them don't mind a $4 hongbao. But these are really just unconfirmed whispers…\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule for minimum amounts, and it really should come down to how much you can afford. That being said, $6 is generally a good starting point.\n\nYour parents, in-laws and grandparents should receive the most - as a sign of respect and gratitude - so anything above $200 is ideal.\n\nSiblings and your own children can receive about $50 to $200 (depending on their ages), while distant relatives such as cousins, nieces and nephews can get between $10 and $100.\n\nThen there is the cleaning auntie, domestic helper, and the neighbourhood \"uncle\" that you always greet at the void deck downstairs. Those folks would be happy with anything between $6 and $50.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a symbolic gesture, so give within your means.\n\nEtiquette\n\nShould hongbao be opened in public? No. Please don't do this.\n\nWhile it might be customary to rip the wrapping paper off a Chrtistmas gift as soon as you receive one, tearing open your hongbao and counting the cash in front of everyone is considered impolite. (Do remind your kids if you have any).\n\nGive or receive red packets with both hands, and don't forget those well wishes. A simple \"Gong Xi Fa Cai\" (wishing you enlarge your wealth) often suffices.\n\nHere's a controversial one: writing your name on the hongbao.\n\nSome are not adverse to this practice, but if we truly believe that giving is not an act of recognition, then we should refrain from doing so.\n\nA customer scanning a QR code to receive a DBS Bank QR Gift card, a substitute for the traditional red packet. ST PHOTO: ALPHONSUS CHERN\n\nHongbao vs Digital hongbao\n\nThe best place to get hongbao \"zua\" (paper) is at your nearest bank branch. Many retail brands also make and give out their own unique hongbao to customers, so look out for those. And, if you don't mind spending a little, you can order customised ones online.\n\nFor some, it's important that their hongbao containds fresh, crisp notes straight out of the bank vault (nothing beats the smell of newly minted money). After all, it's the new year and new things are always preferred.\n\nBut while most banks issue new notes before CNY every year, obtaining them often involves a long and arduous wait in a snaking queue.\n\nA convenient and safe alternative would be e-hongbao. But for some reason, the digital method just hasn't caught on among Singaporeans - unlike China where apps like Wechat, Weibo, and Alipay are commonly used to exchange red packets.\n\nTraditionalists, especially elderly folks, aren't likely to be fond of e-hongbao - because the act of giving hongbao from hand to hand is an act of goodwill and symbolises good fortune.\n\nThen again, money is money, right?\n\nhongbao\n\nchinese new year\n\nCNY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 24, 2024, 07:14am\n\nTaiwan boss gives workers $400 hongbao\n\nJan 31, 2023, 01:28pm\n\nM'sian man says S'porean girlfriend complained about $10 hongbao from his parents\n\nJan 7, 2023, 10:10pm\n\nThousands of needy residents receive hongbao, gift packs in charity drives ahead of CNY\n\nJan 4, 2023, 09:54am\n\nCouple collected tens of thousands of red packets over decades\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She also called him a \"white eye wolf\" (a term to describe an ungrateful person), he added.\n\nThe following day, Liu's father, Ding Shuangquan, said in an interview that he did not mind providing for his studies, but claimed that his son had demanded that his parents buy him a house in Hebei.\n\nIt was followed by a rebuttal from the young man who said his father was distorting the truth and \"has not realised his mistake\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 11, 2025, 12:16am\n\nMan who sued late mum's estate gets 38% share of rent for coffee shop over 20 years\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe family saga unfolded on Dec 6 last year when Liu shared a video online, appealing for information of his parents. In it, he recounted how he was sold to a couple when he was about three months old. They died in an accident when he was four, reported the local media, and relatives of his adoptive parents took care of him.\n\nLiu was about to abandon his initial appeal when his adoptive grandparents found a vaccination record. In another post on Dec 15, he revealed his given name was Ding Jing.\n\nIn its mission to crack down on human trafficking, Chinese authorities took an active interest in the case, and in about a week, the Shanxi police identified Ding as his biological father following a DNA test.\n\nAfter a tearful reunion ceremony between father and son, Liu travelled to Sanya to visit his mother.\n\nBoth parents were divorced and have separate families, and he now has three half-brothers and a half-sister.\n\nLiu regularly shared updates of his newfound family love, including photos and screenshots of chat records. In posts on Jan 10 and 11, his photos were captioned: \"A happy child today\".\n\nBut there was no happy ending.\n\nOn his father's accusation, Liu explained he had left his caregiving relatives when he began his search, for fear of implicating them for human trafficking.\n\nHis parents had previously admitted that they sold him for 6,000 renminbi (S$1,270).\n\nSaid Liu: \"I have no place to live now. The school is closed, so I can't live in the dormitory. I will have an internship next year, and I can't live in the dormitory either.\n\n\"All I was asking, is for my parents to rent me a place or find me a home. I didn't expect them to react so violently.\"\n\nHe now feels that his parents had met him only because of public pressure.\n\nIn a separate interview, his mother told reporters that she blocked her son because she wanted her peaceful life back.\n\nShe said: \"I felt bad and wanted to make up to him, so we borrowed money just so he could travel to Sanya, and we could meet.\"\n\nLiu Xuezhou and his biological mother after they reunited.PHOTO: SOHU\n\nLiu has since returned to Shijiazhuang to continue his second year in college.\n\nThe local government has contacted him to assure him that he would still be supported through subsidies for orphans, he said.\n\nLiu told reporters: \"I now want to study hard, finish it and then earn my own money quickly.\"\n\nFAMILY FEUDS\n\nAbandoned\n\nsocial media\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 16, 2025, 01:11am\n\n'I regret getting to know them': Addy Lee opens up about Quan Yifeng and her daughter Eleanor Lee\n\nMay 13, 2025, 02:43am\n\nWoman sues mother for evicting her; judge dismisses her claim of right to stay indefinitely\n\nApr 26, 2025, 02:08am\n\nMan who called nurse 'Covid spreader' fined $3k for lion dance ruckus\n\nMar 19, 2025, 10:25am\n\nMessy feud erupts over ownership of Yishun flat\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d57d5c54ff563ec6c3307717afb93b134df920241908d018175aca0aaf415071/0ce14ba1e5d84ef69eccc70d1ac1c167.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "The happy reunion that was arranged by the Chinese authorities for Liu Xuezhou (left) and his father, Ding Shuangquan (right).", "caption": "The happy reunion that was arranged by the Chinese authorities for Liu Xuezhou (left) and his father, Ding Shuangquan (right).

Chim, cyber-security firm Cybereason's field chief security officer for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"Organisations must ensure the safety and security of their customers' data, or risk losing credibility among consumers.\"\n\nThe registry enables organisations to register the SMS sender IDs they wish to protect. Any unauthorised party that tries to send SMS messages using the registered IDs will be flagged and blocked on mobile operators' networks.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 06:24am\n\nMan charged for collecting $150k in cash, jewellery for scammers\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe adoption of the registry is one of the solutions to combat SMS spoofing that banks will continue to work closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), IMDA, and the police on, following a recent spate of SMS phishing scams targeting OCBC Bank customers.\n\nOn Wednesday (Jan 19), MAS and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) also introduced additional measures, including removing clickable links in SMSes or e-mails sent to retail customers, a delay of at least 12 hours before the activation of a new soft token on a mobile device, and notification to an existing registered mobile number or registered e-mail whenever there is a request to change a customer's contact details.\n\nSome experts said some of the measures introduced by MAS and ABS can be implemented consistently across all sectors.\n\nMr Leow Kim Hock, Asia chief executive of cyber-security services provider Wizlynx Group, believes that Government agencies should remove clickable links in SMSes sent to members of the public.\n\nThis is because the transactions handled by these organisations usually involve personal data or funds of members of the public, which could be compromised by scam links.\n\nBut aside from this measure, each agency should determine independently which other safeguards to adopt, as not all of them may be relevant, he added.\n\nPrivate organisations should do the same, he said.\n\nSome experts said that the measures introduced by MAS and ABS should help reduce the effectiveness of certain scams, such as those involving the change of contact details.\n\nBut others felt that some of the measures may compromise on the efficiency of an organisation's services or may not address all types of scams.\n\nMr Ilia Rozhov, the head of digital risk protection at cyber-security firm Group-IB in the Asia Pacific, also noted: \"There are so many different scams out there that are evolving constantly.

Instead, it would be to ensure that events, social activities and overseas trips can take place safely; as well as to reduce transmission risks, especially to those who are vulnerable to infections,\" wrote the task force, which added that testing would have to be made fast and easy.\n\nOn Dec 26 last year, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that as more employees return to their workplaces from the start of this year, there may be a\n\nhigher risk of Covid-19 transmission in the workplace,\n\nespecially given the higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant.\n\n\"While our workforce is highly vaccinated and hence protected from severe disease, we encourage all firms to implement regular testing for all employees. This will help to detect possible Covid-19 infection early and allow individuals who test positive to take precautions to self-isolate and protect their family, friends and colleagues,\" said MOH at the time.\n\nTimothy Goh\n\n, Health Correspondent\n\ncovid-19\n\nTEACHERS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It was a madhouse inside a floodlit Rod Laver Arena, despite capacity being capped at 50 per cent, with unpredictable Kyrgios dealing out his assortment of unplayable serves and tweeners before a partisan home crowd, while embroiled in a running battle with the chair umpire.\n\nHowever, US Open champion Medvedev showed nerves of steel and dealt with it all to ease through and will now face Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp in the third round.\n\nMedvedev was not happy with some of the antics of the vociferous crowd.\n\n\"I came to win this match and I am happy that I was able to do,\" he said on court.\n\n\"It's not your choice when you get booed between first and second serves, it's not easy, I just had to stay calm.\"\n\nUS Open champ Raducanu crashes out\n\nUS Open champion Emma Raducanu was bundled out of the Australian Open in the second round as she was beaten 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 by Montenegro's Danka Kovinic on Thursday (Jan 20).\n\nThe 19-year-old British sensation, playing in her first main draw at Melbourne Park, was hampered by blisters on her serving hand from early in the first set of a tense contest on Margaret Court Arena but showed great fighting spirit to stay in contention.\n\nWith her usually powerful forehand reduced to a slice, Raducanu let slip a 3-0 lead to lose the first set. But she played on her 98th-ranked opponent's nerves to break at 4-4 in the second and take the match into a decider.\n\nKovinic showed great composure to forge ahead in the deciding set, resisting a Raducanu fightback, and then move 5-3 ahead as the British youngster finally looked a little weary.\n\nA stunning backhand winner sealed victory for the 27-year-old Kovinic as she moved into the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time.\n\nAUSTRALIAN OPEN (TENNIS)\n\nnick kyrgios\n\nDaniil Medvedev\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Nearly\n\n470 OCBC Bank customers lost at least $8.5 million to a spate of SMS phishing scams\n\nlast month, and other banks such as DBS and UOB recently\n\nwarned of similar scams\n\nimpersonating bank employees.\n\nHere are some of the most common types of scams going around.\n\n1. SMS phishing scams\n\nIn the recent scams involving OCBC Bank, fraudsters sent SMS messages claiming to be from the bank to trick its customers.\n\nSome scammers have made use of the same sender identification labels used by the legitimate banks when sending fake SMS messages.\n\nFor example, some of the SMS messages sent to OCBC customers seemed to have been sent by \"OCBC\" and appeared in the same message thread as previous genuine messages.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 06:24am\n\nMan charged for collecting $150k in cash, jewellery for scammers\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe messages often claim there is a problem with the recipient's bank account that needs to be resolved urgently, and include a link to a fake website that resembles the real one.\n\nVictims who enter their log-in information and one-time passwords (OTP) on the fake website can quickly have their accounts breached and their savings stolen.\n\n2. Impersonation scams\n\nAnother type of phishing scam involves crooks posing as authority figures such as the police, job recruiters or government officials.\n\nUsing SMS messages, e-mails or phone calls, they try to convince potential victims to part with money or give up sensitive information such as banking log-in details or personal data such as NRIC numbers.\n\nA variant involves\n\nfake bank hotline numbers being listed on Google search results.\n\nVictims who call these numbers will be connected to scammers pretending to be bank staff.\n\nCommon tactics involve claiming the recipient has got into legal trouble, or offering simple yet well-paid part-time jobs and investment schemes with high interest rates. Victims who respond are asked to pay fees or provide personal information.\n\nThe police, the Supreme Court and the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board recently warned the public of such scams.\n\nAmid the Covid-19 pandemic, many scammers also\n\npretended to be calling from the Health Ministry\n\nand claimed they were requesting information for contact tracing purposes.\n\nThey often mask the caller ID number to appear as a local number starting with the Singapore country code \"+65\", even though they may be calling from overseas.\n\nScammers may also pose as one's contacts. E-mail addresses, for example, can be spoofed to appear as if the message was sent by a colleague or friend requesting money for urgent personal needs.\n\n3. E-commerce and delivery scams\n\nScams involving fake item listings often take place on e-commerce marketplaces, auction sites or trading features on social media platforms.\n\nThe most common type involves listing high-demand items such as gaming consoles or concert tickets for unusually low prices, which tempts users who are looking for a bargain.\n\nOnce payment has been made, the \"seller\" disappears or becomes unresponsive, and the would-be buyer never receives the promised item.\n\nSome scammers claim to be offering \"pre-orders\" that will take some time to arrive in Singapore, which can cause victims to delay making a complaint or report.\n\nAnother related scam involves unsolicited SMS messages or e-mails claiming the recipient's parcel is stuck in transit and that\n\na fee must be paid to ensure delivery.\n\nVictims sometimes fall for such claims even if they had not ordered any item.\n\n4. Love scams\n\nPosing as attractive potential partners, scammers usually target vulnerable victims on dating and social media platforms, often using stolen photos on their profiles.\n\nAfter befriending the victims and gaining their trust, the scammers spin a tale about falling on hard times and ask for money.\n\nThey may also demand gifts or money as proof of the victim's love, or claim they need the money to arrange a visit to the victim's country.\n\nAnother common ruse is for scammers to invite their smitten victims to buy into fake investment schemes or business ventures.\n\nRei Kurohi\n\n, Tech Correspondent\n\nSCAMS\n\nBANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:21am\n\nPolice probe 536 over scams, unlicensed moneylending\n\nJul 12, 2025, 04:11am\n\nMore NSFs may be deployed to fight scams online, say police\n\nJul 10, 2025, 07:48am\n\nMan charged over $80,000 money mule activities\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Women aged 50 and above are recommended to do a screening every 24 months, while those aged 40 to 49 should do one annually.\n\n\"Through early detection and treatment, the survival rate of breast cancer patients can be increased, thereby eradicating breast cancer as a life-threatening disease,\" said Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and National Development, who attended the screening centre's opening ceremony.\n\nThe BCF's community screening bus, the Community Mammobus, will bring affordable X-ray screenings to the heartland once a month this year.\n\nSingaporean women will get a full waiver of the $107 fee if it is their first mammogram, or pay a heavily subsidised rate of just $10 for the screening. Permanent residents also enjoy subsidies, paying $25 for the first mammogram and $35 subsequently.\n\nThe bus will visit the Bishan-Toa Payoh-Sin Ming precinct each month, and will be parked at a community club (CC) in the area, such as Bishan CC and Marymount CC, or outside the Breast Cancer Centre.\n\nThere are limited slots available, and women can register their interest for a mammogram on a first-come-first-serve basis at\n\nhttps://www.bcf.org.sg/our-services/community-mammobus-programme\n\nThe BCF also launched its First Screen Fund to provide low-income women aged 50 and above their first mammogram for free at any polyclinic.\n\nThis complements the Health Promotion Board's Screen for Life programme, which offers subsidised mammograms at polyclinics such that Singaporeans pay $50, while permanent residents pay $75. The screenings cost $37.50 for Merdeka Generation cardholders and $25 for Pioneer Generation cardholders.\n\nMs Staphnie Tang, president of the Breast Cancer Foundation, said: \"We hope that with the initiatives launched alongside the Breast Cancer Centre we will be able to fight breast cancer together as one.\"\n\nGena Soh\n\nCancer\n\nCOMMUNITY CENTRES AND CLUBS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 1, 2025, 09:51am\n\n'If he needs to go, we will let him go': Man who survived acid attack as a baby dies at 26\n\nJun 15, 2025, 12:21am\n\nCancer survivor, 69, is full-time caregiver to 14-year-old son with special needs\n\nJun 10, 2025, 01:43am\n\nWoman fights cancer and heartbreak to give her 3 children a better life\n\nJun 7, 2025, 11:27pm\n\n'I'm preparing for my next life by doing good', says terminal liver cancer patient\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The expansion had allowed Singapore citizens to enter Malaysia, and Malaysia citizens to enter Singapore.\n\nA spokesman also said MTI will temporarily reduce the land VTL capacity and ticket sales by 50 per cent from Friday, as announced last month.\n\nShe added: \"We will continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust the VTL (land) capacity, taking into account the public health situation in both countries and globally.\"\n\nThe number of travellers allowed to cross the Causeway was temporarily halved amid concerns over the spread of the Covid-19 Omicron variant. The move meant that there will be a maximum of 48 buses daily ferrying about 2,000 passengers between Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nA similar capacity cut had also been introduced for all air VTLs, along with stricter testing requirements.\n\nThe two designated bus operators for the land VTL, Transtar Travel and Causeway Link, have reported brisk sales even before the cut in quotas.\n\nCompetition for the tickets have heated up further since, with all tickets for the land VTL sold out till Feb 28.\n\nMalaysia's Transport Minister Wee Ka Siong had said earlier this month that both countries will re-evaluate the current risks before deciding whether to proceed with the 50 reduction in quota.\n\nMeanwhile, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said that between Nov 29 and Tuesday, 44,056 travellers have entered Singapore from Malaysia under the air VTL between the two countries.\n\nThese travellers are made up of 19,645 short-term visitors and long-term pass holders, 21,661 Singapore citizens and permanent residents, and 2,750 children aged 12 years and below.\n\nSingapore Airlines (SIA), which is one of the six carriers offering quarantine-free flights between Singapore and Malaysia, said it continues to see high demand for its VTL flights.\n\nBut a spokesman said SIA is unable to disclose specific figures owing to commercial sensitivity. It said it will continue to adjust its capacity in response to travel demand patterns and passenger arrival caps.\n\nThe VTL scheme has helped to support a recovery in Singapore's air hub, even though numbers remain a far cry of those from the days before the pandemic.\n\nFor instance, the start of a VTL with South Korea in mid-November has allowed about 1,600 travellers from South Korea to enter Singapore.\n\nPassenger traffic through Changi Airport had also reached about 15 per cent of the levels before the pandemic in December, on the back of the holiday season and the expansion of VTLs.\n\nBy\n\nToh Ting Wei\n\nRead articles by Toh Ting Wei\n\ncovid-19\n\nVACCINATED TRAVEL LANE/VTL\n\nmalaysia\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

They must also go for pre-event testing at their own cost, but this will no longer be permitted from Feb 1.\n\nVenerable Seck said it is important to allow only the vaccinated to enter temples as many devotees are elderly, and getting vaccinated is part of the devotees' social responsibility to protect those around them.\n\nChairman of the Sikh Advisory Board Malminderjit Singh said some of its gurdwaras are already not open to the unvaccinated.\n\nMr Singh said: \"Some gurdwaras have advised unvaccinated congregation members to tune in online while other gurdwaras have explicitly requested for only vaccinated individuals to attend prayer services in person.\n\n\"Congregation members have respected this request.\"\n\nST has also contacted the Hindu Endowment Board (HEB) and The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) for comment.\n\nCurrently, only the fully vaccinated, recovered and medically ineligible people or children aged 12 or below can book slots at mosques that offer prayers for more than 50 congregants.\n\nUnvaccinated individuals can only do so at the six single-zone mosques.\n\nUnvaccinated worshippers who currently wish to visit the four Hindu temples managed by HEB - including Sri Sivan Temple in Geylang East and Sri Vairavimada Kaliamman Temple - can do so only on specific days.\n\nMr Dominic Chan, a vaccinated Catholic, told ST he knows unvaccinated people of the same religion who are sad to not get the same freedom to worship only because of their vaccination status.\n\nThe 41-year-old lawyer said: \"While they can understand the need to protect the vulnerable, such VDS make no distinction for common Covid risk factors like age or pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"It is a very painful experience to not be allowed to partake in worship, which has been a very important lifeline through this difficult pandemic period, especially when there is already a toll on mental health.\"\n\nAhead of the Feb 1 rule changes, the Ministry of Education (MOE) updated its website on Wednesday to note that they will not affect full-time students pursuing Nitec/Higher Nitec, diploma or undergraduate degree qualifications to minimise disruptions to their studies.\n\nBut it added that to safeguard the campus population, and as part of national vaccination efforts, all other students such as those on part-time programmes, and visitors will need to be fully vaccinated to enter IHL campuses from Feb 1.\n\nST has contacted various universities and polytechnics for comment.\n\nNg Keng Gene\n\nand\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nVACCINES\n\ncovid-19\n\nreligion\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMar 5, 2025, 12:19am\n\nIris Koh edits social media posts after prosecution says they are in contempt of court\n\nFeb 21, 2025, 07:54am\n\nAnti-vax group founder Iris Koh gets new bailor\n\nFeb 11, 2025, 12:22am\n\nShingles vaccine subsidies for citizens and PRs from September\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I can't walk properly… and when I can, I believe a baby can walk faster than I,\" The Guardian quoted him as saying.\n\nMr Lisala Folau (second from left) swam for around 27 hours after getting swept to sea by the South Pacific tsunami.PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nHe and a niece climbed a tree while his brother ran to seek help. When there was a lull in the waves, they climbed down but just then a larger wave hit.\n\n\"We floated at sea, just calling out to each other,\" he said. \"It was dark and we could not see each other. Very soon I could not hear my niece calling anymore but I could hear my son calling.\"\n\nIn that moment, he decided not to answer, he said. \"The truth is no son can abandon his father. But for me, as a father I kept my silence for if I answered him he would jump in and try to rescue me. But I understand the tough situation and I thought if the worst comes it is only me.\"\n\nHe eventually washed ashore on an uninhabited island. On Sunday morning he swam to another one.\n\nAt one point on Sunday he said he saw a police patrol boat heading to Atata island and waved a rag but those on board did not see him.\n\nFrom the second island, he decided he could attempt to reach the main island of Tongatapu.\n\nAround 9pm, Mr Folau said he staggered ashore there and tried to make his way towards a house.\n\nThat was when he was picked up by a passing vehicle and taken to the driver's home.\n\nIt was estimated that he had swum a total of about 13km. It was not immediately clear what happened to his son and the niece he was with on Atata.\n\nAnother son, Talivakaola Folau, later took to Facebook to express his gratitude: \"A story I'll never forget in my life … While talking with family in Tonga my tears continued to fall when I think of my Dad swimming around in the ocean after the tsunami hit … My heart is broken imagining you drinking in the seawater Dad, but you're a strong-willed man.\"\n\nThe story went viral among Tongan groups on Facebook and other social media.\n\n\"Real life Aquaman,\" said one post on Facebook, referring to the comic book and film character.  \"He's a legend,\" said another post.\n\nAtata, which is about 8 km northwest of Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa, or a 30-minute boat ride, has been almost entirely destroyed in the tsunami.\n\ntsunami\n\nSwimming\n\ndisability\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 16, 2022, 03:12pm\n\n7.3-magnitude earthquake hits east Japan, tsunami warning issued\n\nDec 23, 2018, 03:23am\n\nVolcano-triggered tsunami kills at least 43 in Indonesia\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It appeared to be only a few months old, and Mr Seah added it likely didn't survive without human intervention.\n\nIn the comments section of Mr Loke's post, some netizens shared similar sightings of monitor lizards.\n\nSpotted at Woodlands Waterfront Park in August 2020.PHOTO: YAP ZI JING via MOTHERSHIP.SG\n\nThe situation could soon turn dire for the lizard, said Mr Seah, who has asked hikers to keep a lookout for the reptile on the \"Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network Flora & Fauna\" Facebook group.\n\nThey should call NParks Animal Response Centre at 1800-4761600 if they spot the lizard or any other animals that require assistance.\n\n\"It would be even more helpful if you can stick around to observe or track it (from the designated walking path) until staff arrive on-site,\" he said.\n\nHe warned visitors not to step off the path and to always check for hornets, wasps, snakes and crocodiles.\n\nWILDLIFE\n\nmonitor lizard\n\nNParks\n\nsocial media\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 12, 2025, 07:22am\n\n'I'm feeding the chickens': Bishan woman accused of feeding pigeons denies wrongdoing\n\nMay 25, 2025, 04:50am\n\nYoung forest in Bukit Batok to be cleared for housing; study proposes retaining some vegetation\n\nMay 19, 2025, 11:20pm\n\n200 reports of monkeys in Punggol over 7-month period; some euthanised: NParks\n\nMay 4, 2025, 06:34am\n\nRare butterfly species spotted in Singapore for first time\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I was a little bit nervous to be honest before the game but when I started to warm up, I felt more comfortable.\n\n\"Three goals in three games now, I think it's good. I want to keep going because one of my personal goals is to be more consistent in my performances so I want to keep scoring goals, provide assists, and most importantly, winning games with the team.\n\n\"I don't know so much about the teams in Thailand which makes it more exciting for me. We go into every game trying to win each of them. I just want to win games. If I score, that's a bonus.\"\n\nHaving insider knowledge helps, and that comes in the form of elder brother Irfan, a\n\n24-year-old centre-back who has been at the club since 2019.\n\nIkshan (left) and Irfan Fandi. PHOTO: BGPU_OFFICIAL/INSTAGRAM\n\n\"My brother told me it's a really intense and competitive league. He gave me some expectations of what I should know and how I should go about in the league,\" said Ikhsan. \"I'm adapting really well, I think I fit in to the team really smoothly. The players are really friendly, so it makes it easy to gel off the field and on the field as well and it shows in the games.\"\n\nStill in his early 20s, the man with 25 caps and 11 international goals is keen for opportunities in bigger leagues.\n\nIn an earlier interview with The Straits Times, he said: \"I'm still young and I still have ambitions of playing in a top league in Asia or Europe. I will continue to work hard to establish myself at BG in order to achieve these goals.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: S'pore striker Ikhsan Fandi joins brother Irfan at Thailand's BG Pathum\n\nDavid Lee\n\nIkhsan Fandi\n\nSingapore Football\n\nthailand\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 20, 2023, 10:11am\n\nBack-from-injury Ikhsan Fandi feeling like a footballer again\n\nDec 17, 2022, 02:33pm\n\nCloud over Lions' AFF campaign as chief striker Ikhsan suffers knee injury\n\nAug 22, 2022, 02:27pm\n\nUrawa beat Pathum 4-0 to end Irfan and Ikhsan's Asian Champions League run\n\nJun 10, 2022, 02:15am\n\nBeckham to visit Singapore for Adidas event on June 17\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The story of a migrant worker in Beijing who caught Covid-19 while searching for his missing son provoked shock and sympathy on social media on Thursday (Jan 20), drawing attention to the hardships faced by the floating population in China's big cities.\n\nOn Wednesday, city officials said that asymptomatic Covid-19 infection had been detected in a 44-year-old man they identified by his surname, Yue, in the affluent Chaoyang district.\n\nHis frequent and wide-ranging movements around the city, at odd hours, were widely discussed online.\n\nSocial media users declared Mr Yue the \"hardest-working person among the floating population\" - a hashtag that amassed over 60 million views on Twitter-like Weibo, drawing attention to the deep inequality in China that last year led President Xi Jinping to call for achieving \"common prosperity\".\n\nIn interviews with local media, the former fisherman from central China's Henan province said that he had arrived in Beijing last year, knowing his son, 21-year-old Yue Yuetong, had worked as a cook in the capital.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:31am\n\nS'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat\n\nMore related stories\n\nSince then, he took odd jobs, from garbage collection to moving construction materials, and is the main breadwinner for a six-person household, including his paralysed father.\n\nMr Yue, who is being treated in a Beijing hospital, told China News Weekly that since his son's disappearance in August 2020, he had worked in several provinces searching for him.\n\nIn Beijing, Mr Yue earns around 200 to 300 yuan (S$42 to S$64) per shift and sleeps four to five hours a day.\n\n\"I don't think I'm pitiful, I just want to do my work well, not steal or rob, rely on my own strength, my own two hands, make some money and find my son,\" he told state-run China Weekly News.\n\nMr Yue's son, who turns 21 this year and is among China's roughly 285 million migrant workers who move to cities seeking work and a better life, was last seen in a bus station in Rongcheng, Shandong province, according to an interview Mr Yue gave to the state-run Beijing News that was later deleted.\n\nA police station in Rongcheng told local media that it was investigating.\n\nReuters was unable to reach Mr Yue, whose story emerged as Beijing is on high alert for the spread of the Omicron variant and as Covid-19 outbreaks once again disrupt travel plans ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday when workers including migrants such as Mr Yue typically return home for family reunions.\n\nSome social media users drew attention to the disparity between Mr Yue's movements and another recent Covid-19 case in Beijing who went to a ski resort and a jewellery store before testing positive for the virus.\n\n\"I don't know whether 'common prosperity' is empty words but it's the government's responsibility to ensure every worker can live respectably,\" said another Weibo user who goes by firetrap-virtuallife.\n\nChina\n\ncovid-19\n\nWORKER WELFARE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 30, 2025, 03:04am\n\nSelf-driving public shuttles in Punggol by fourth quarter\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:52pm\n\nSingapore's first private assisted-living pilot ready by 2026\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nMay 16, 2025, 01:14am\n\nSingapore actress Eleanor Lee accused online of insulting China, allegedly dropped from Chinese show\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/85223930eb68b109ce3fa346dc52dc0a34f9205b6cb55a20685ec81541b9aa8b/yq-chinaworkers-20012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": " In Beijing, Mr Yue earns around 200 to 300 yuan (S$42 to S$64) per shift and sleeps four to five hours a day.", "caption": "In Beijing, Mr Yue earns around 200 to 300 yuan (S$42 to S$64) per shift and sleeps four to five hours a day.

The fifth man, who was the driver of the car, did not face any charges.\n\nOn Thursday (Jan 20),Yong, now 32, pleaded guilty to one count of molestation.\n\nHe was the last person linked to this case to be convicted in court.\n\nIn March last year, Yap Chun Chieh, 41, was sentenced to 12 years and three months' jail with 10 strokes of the cane after pleading guilty to one charge each of rape and outrage of modesty.\n\nTay Boon Huat, 29, who sexually assaulted the woman, was earlier sentenced to 10 years and three months' jail with five strokes of the cane.\n\nGan Soon Chai, 36, who filmed the incident on his phone, was jailed for 15 months and fined $20,800.\n\nGan is Malaysian while the other men are Singaporeans.\n\nThe court heard on Thursday that at the time of the incident, Yong was working as a manager at Club V5 Tycoon at Ming Arcade shopping mall in Cuscaden Road.\n\nTay had earlier booked the chalet for his friends from the club to enjoy themselves.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutors Ng Yiwen and Niranjan Ranjakunalan stated in court documents that the victim and her friends arrived at the nightspot at around 3.35am on Sept 17, 2018.\n\nAbout two hours later, the woman's friends got into a drunken dispute outside Club V5 with another group of people.\n\nThe dispute was later resolved and her friends left the premises, leaving her behind.\n\nThe prosecutors said: \"In her intoxicated state, the victim returned to Club V5 (with people including Yong and Tay) and continued consuming alcohol with them.\n\n\"At about 6am, the accused brought the victim, who was unable to walk on her own, to the female toilet, followed by the male toilet on level four of Ming Arcade, where he spent about 15 minutes alone with her behind closed doors.\"\n\nAt around 6.30am, Yong took the woman down to the first floor of Ming Arcade and passed her to Yap. He also told Yap to take her home by taxi.\n\nYong entered a car with his friends soon after. The men were on their way to the chalet when they spotted Yap and the woman at a taxi stand.\n\nYong then persuaded Yap to join them and the latter agreed. Yong also pulled the woman by her arm into the car.\n\nThe group were travelling towards their destination when Yong molested her.\n\nAt the chalet, Yap raped the woman while Tay sexually assaulted her.\n\nAt about 9am, Yap helped the woman to get dressed and took her home in a taxi.\n\nWhen they reached her block of flats, the woman was asleep and Yap decided to take her to the nearest hotel.\n\nAt the hotel, he touched her breasts. At about 7pm, the woman was startled to wake up next to a stranger.\n\nShe paid for the room after Yap told her it cost $70. They then went their separate ways.\n\nThat night, the woman went back to the club to talk to a friend about the incident and recognised Yap. Days later, she approached Yap, who apologised for having sex with her.\n\nShe eventually told her mother about what happened and made a police report.\n\nYong's bail was set at $70,000 on Thursday and he is expected to be sentenced on Feb 16.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\n, Court Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It did not provide specific numbers.\n\nThis comes even as about 3,000 users deregistered from the programme last year. SNDGO said that this forms 0.056 per cent of registered users, and that such cases include long-term pass holders who have left Singapore as well as people who have died.\n\nIt also includes those who have requested to opt out of it for data security reasons.\n\nThen Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan said last May that 1,155 users of TraceTogether had requested to opt out of the programme.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe TraceTogether programme, which identifies people in close contact with a Covid-19 patient via a Bluetooth-enabled app or token, came under the spotlight a year ago when it was revealed that its\n\ndata could be used for criminal investigations,\n\ndespite earlier assurances that it would be used solely for contact tracing.\n\nLegislation was subsequently enacted to restrict the use of contact tracing data to investigations of seven categories of serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, rape and armed robbery.\n\nWhen a user deregisters, all registration data, including his NRIC and contact number, is deleted from the TraceTogether server within three to five working days.\n\nThis means that all the Bluetooth data that a person's device has exchanged with other devices will no longer be associated with him.\n\nGiven the\n\nrising number of coronavirus cases\n\nand the overall shift to treating the disease as endemic, some have questioned if TraceTogether and national digital check-in system SafeEntry remain necessary.\n\nBoth these systems remain important to Singapore's fight against Covid-19, and they will be kept for now, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).\n\nMOH adopted a \"comprehensive and aggressive\" contact tracing strategy at the beginning of the pandemic before vaccines were available so as to slow disease transmission, but the approach has shifted given Singapore's high level of vaccination.\n\nIt now uses these digital tools to perform contact tracing automatically for most cases and focus in-depth contact tracing efforts and resources to prevent and control spread in higher-risk settings.\n\nSuch settings include hospitals, nursing homes and pre-schools, which have potentially vulnerable individuals such as the elderly or those who are not yet eligible for vaccines.\n\nThis kind of contact tracing was also used to slow the spread of the more contagious Omicron Covid-19 variant here to buy time as the authorities worked to better understand the disease. This has since stopped as MOH now better understands the variant, said the ministry.\n\nSafeEntry is now used to\n\ncheck the vaccination status of individuals before they enter venues,\n\nwhile TraceTogether is used to alert individuals through health risk warnings to their recent exposure to cases so that they can take appropriate precautions.\n\n\"These digital tools also allow us to identify possible places of higher-risk exposure, and help to guide public health actions such as the need to adjust safe management measures,\" said MOH. It added that it will regularly review the relevance of existing rules and requirements.\n\nProfessor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, expects that the use of these digital tools will stop soon given Singapore's high inoculation rate.\n\n\"Right now, their main function is to document vaccination status. With our high vaccination rates, that is likely to be unnecessary in the future,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, foresees that while these tools will not be necessary in the long term, there is still a need for these digital tools for at least the next 12 to 18 months.\n\n\"I expect there will be some degree of vaccine-differentiated measures that will be necessary even in an endemic Covid-19 situation, and if so, there will be a need for a platform to register and verify vaccination status,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether TraceTogether and SafeEntry will continue to be used for this purpose, especially in entering premises permitted only for vaccinated people, will depend on how long we intend to continue with vaccine-differentiated measures.\"\n\nHariz Baharudin\n\n, Assistant News Editor\n\ncovid-19\n\nTRACETOGETHER\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

When his son refused, the man pushed him and grabbed a pair of scissors from the kitchen, but did not use it to attack him.\n\nHis daughter called the police for help when the man went to the void deck to cool off.\n\nThe son had a scratch on his neck but did not seek medical attention.\n\nOn March 17 last year, the man went to his family's unit at 6.15am while he was drunk and again quarrelled with his son and hit him several times on his upper body.\n\nHe shoved his son and used a padlock to hit his back multiple times, while repeatedly threatening to kill him, saying: \"I will not stop until I killed (sic) you.\"\n\nHe left after his wife and daughter urged him to calm down and separated him from his son.\n\nBut the man soon returned and slapped and punched his wife's face as she tried to block his attacks. He struck his daughter's face when she shouted at him to stop. He then left the flat.\n\nThe son and the mother were in pain after the assaults but did not seek medical attention, said DPP Chin, who urged the judge to sentence the man to six months and two weeks in jail with a fine.\n\nIn his submissions, he said the man had a history of offences that include robbery, causing hurt with a weapon and breaching PPOs issued on several occasions.\n\n\"He assaulted three members of his family despite two personal protection orders,\" said DPP Chin.\n\n\"There is clear public interest in deterring acts of family violence... this is because they constitute an abuse of the bonds of trust and interdependency that exist between family members,\" said the DPP.\n\nThe man's jail sentence was backdated to Dec 4, 2021 to account for his time in remand. He will spend an additional four days in jail as he is unable to pay the $1,000 fine.\n\nThose who voluntarily cause hurt can face a maximum sentence of three years in jail and a fine of $5,000.\n\nOsmond Chia\n\nabuse\n\nFAMILY FEUDS\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 23, 2025, 05:48am\n\nPre-school teacher jailed for doing nothing to stop colleague from abusing toddler\n\nApr 17, 2025, 02:01am\n\nWoman convicted of allowing boyfriend to abuse her son\n\nApr 17, 2025, 01:57am\n\nBaby's skull fractures after abuse by mum's boyfriend\n\nApr 8, 2025, 10:58am\n\nThe death of Megan Khung: Could intervention have saved her?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It is also plain from his actions that he intended to cause hurt to the victim.\"\n\nDuring the trial, Mr Gui testified that he picked up Ross and his son at the taxi stand of Thomson Plaza shopping mall at around 5pm on Feb 14, 2019.\n\nHe drove off after Ross placed his belongings in the boot. Ross then asked him to go to a particular condominium.\n\nMr Gui had earlier told Judge Soh that he did not know the way there as he could not \"understand\" the name of the property.\n\nHe added: \"I asked for the postal code but could not find it on Google Maps.\"\n\nWhen defence lawyer G. Dinagaran questioned him, Mr Gui denied Ross had offered to direct him to the destination, and said: \"He started to scold me.\"\n\nMr Gui also said that he felt frightened and drove back to the Thomson Plaza taxi stand in Upper Thomson Road.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nTeacher accused of assaulting cabby said he was trying to protect his son who has autism\n\nLawyer jailed 4 weeks, fined after assaulting cabby who declined to give him a ride\n\nThe court heard that a dispute broke out between the two men soon after.\n\nThe prosecutors said in their submissions: \"When the victim pointed his finger at the accused and asked the latter to alight from his taxi, the accused responded by pushing the victim's hand away before exiting the vehicle.\n\n\"The accused then pushed the victim two more times in the chest, causing the victim to take several steps back.\"\n\nThe DPPs also said that as Mr Gui walked to the boot of the taxi, Ross pushed him in the chest another time, causing the cabby to take a few steps back again.\n\nThe court heard that while Ross was reaching into the boot to remove his belongings, Mr Gui put his hand on the accused's upper arm.\n\nThe prosecutors told the court: \"The accused responded by kicking the victim in his leg. As the accused and the victim were holding onto the accused's belongings, the accused kicked the victim once again.\"\n\nAccording to the prosecutors, Ross tried to leave the scene by boarding another taxi with his son, but Mr Gui prevented it from leaving.\n\nThe Canadian and his son then left the premises on foot before the police arrived.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCompany CEO jailed 2 weeks for assaulting taxi driver\n\nMan jailed, fined for assaulting taxi driver after refusing to pay the fare\n\nRoss had testified during an earlier court proceeding that he was \"doing what was necessary to protect\" his son who has autism.\n\nRoss also said that his son, who is not used to sudden changes, took three weeks to calm down after the incident.\n\nThe DPPs stated in their submissions: \"Insofar as the defence asserts that the accused had acted in the exercise of his right to private defence, they bear the burden of proving this on a balance of probabilities. They have entirely failed to discharge this burden.\"\n\nFor assault, an offender can be jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\n, Court Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Of the 12 people who tested positive this month at the clinic, eight were aged under 10. Their symptoms have tended to be mild, such as a fever and runny nose.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:14pm\n\nMOH debunks fake news on S'pore doing first Covid-19 autopsy and jailing those unvaccinated\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Up until the fifth wave of the infection, children who came in with a fever rarely tested positive in an antigen test,\" the director said. \"But now, there's a good chance that an examinee will test positive.\"\n\nInfections among children aged under 10 are on the rise. About half of new patients confirmed over the week to Sunday in Tokyo were in their 20s and 30s, and those under 10 accounted for 6 per cent.\n\nThe number of patients under age 10 was 6.3 times that in the previous week, and those in their 20s and 30s numbered 3.8 times the level in the week before.\n\nThe increase in child patients has led to a proportional rise in the number of nursery school closings.\n\nThe Health, Labour and Welfare Ministry said 86 facilities in 14 prefectures were closed as of Jan 13, more than 10 times the level in the previous week.\n\nExperts say a lack of vaccinations could be behind the rise in child infections, as well as the fact that the omicron variant is highly contagious, making it difficult to prevent infections at home.\n\nAccording to the Tokyo metropolitan government, household infections accounted for half the infections confirmed from Jan 4-10, more than workplace or facility infections.\n\nAmong people infected outside the home, between 31 per cent and 45 per cent of those infected with Omicron passed it to family members in the same household, according to a National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) survey.\n\nThis compared to 11 per cent to 12 per cent of those infected with the variant that was dominant in 2020.\n\n\"We suspect that infections first spread among people in their 20s and 30s at Christmas and other year-end and New Year events, were transmitted to children at home, and then spread among children since the start of the new school year,\" said Kansai University Professor Toshio Takatorige, who specialises in public health.\n\nMany Omicron-infected patients are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.\n\nAmong 191 infected people, 68, or 36 per cent were asymptomatic and 113, or 59 per cent, had mild symptoms, accounting for 95 per cent of the total, the NIID survey found.\n\nNine people had moderate symptoms, and one was in serious condition.\n\nHowever, the older patients are, the higher the risk of serious illness. I\n\nn Okinawa Prefecture, the area where Omicron first began spreading rapidly in the nation, the percentage of Covid-19 patients aged 70 or older rose from 3.5 per cent on Jan 4 to 8.3 per cent on Tuesday.\n\nThe number of patients requiring ventilators, which had remained at zero since November last year, increased to one on Monday and three more on Tuesday, bringing the total to four.\n\n\"We're worried about more infections occurring among the elderly, who are more likely to develop severe symptoms,\" said Dr Koji Wada, a professor of public health at the International University of Health and Welfare.\n\n\"People living with grandparents are urged to take preventive measures, such as wearing masks at home, if they have symptoms.\"\n\ncovid-19\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nJapan\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 14, 2025, 02:45am\n\nS'pore monitoring rise in Covid-19 cases; no indication variants are more transmissible or severe\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:51am\n\nTycoon Sam Goi says dinners with Su Haijin, ministers complied with Covid-19 safe-distancing rules\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:52am\n\nHusband of anti-vaccine group founder faces 12 cheating charges linked to vending machines\n\nJan 26, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDitching the hassle of preparing hongbao by going digital\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

A body was seen floating in the river upon their arrival, and rescuers retrieved the body from the water.\n\nThe deceased, Ms Khoo Yee Joo, was from Kedah in Malaysia, reported Chinese language paper Lianhe Zaobao.\n\nMs Khoo's aunt told Zaobao that she was last seen at the bus stop opposite Chai Chee Industrial Park after she had gotten off work at around 6pm on Sunday (Jan 16).\n\nTwo colleagues were also at the bus stop.

Authorities said an employee had contracted the Delta variant - now rare in the territory - and they ordered the cull as a \"precautionary measure\".\n\nProcess my emotions\n\nLike mainland China, Hong Kong adheres to a staunch \"zero-Covid\" policy, intolerant of even the merest appearance of the virus in the population of more than seven million.\n\nBut the government's latest target appears especially harsh, and swift rebukes from outraged animal lovers have pinged across social media pages.\n\nThe mood Wednesday among parents waiting to give up their pets for \"humane disposal\" was more forlorn.\n\n\"It began as something happy, we bought (the hamster) so the kid can have some company,\" a father, who provided only his surname Tsui, told AFP.\n\n\"Now it has come to this.\" He and his wife had gifted Marshmallow - a grey twitchy-nosed hamster scurrying through plastic tubes - to their five-year-old son.\n\n\"It feels like I'm ending a life,\" Tsui said, adding that he did not dare break the news of Marshmallow's fate to his son.\n\n\"I need to process my own emotions before I know what to say to my kid.\" He added he was disappointed the government did not offer alternatives, such as teaching people how to properly quarantine their pets.\n\nSave as many as we can\n\nHong Kong's hamster hunt has led activists and animal lovers to fret over pets being dumped on the streets en masse for fear of contracting the virus.\n\nCheung, 32, is part of an online community of Hong Kong hamster owners who have volunteered to foster any abandoned due to the policy.\n\n\"It's devastating. I couldn't sleep last night, because I really love small animals,\" he told AFP, providing only his last name over fears about criticising the government's policy.\n\nHong Kong already has a problem with overwhelmed first-time pet owners deserting their furry companions, and Cheung said the numbers are likely to spike after the policy.\n\nHis own two-year-old hamster, Ring, is safe for now, and may soon be joined by others.\n\n\"We want to save as many as we can,\" he said.\n\ncoronavirus\n\nPets\n\nhong kong\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 17, 2023, 01:38am\n\nBeijing subway drops mandatory Covid-19 mask rule\n\nMar 21, 2023, 09:04am\n\nSingapore to do away with colour-coded Dorscon framework\n\nFeb 17, 2023, 01:44am\n\nCovid-19 infection gives similar immunity to vaccination: Study\n\nFeb 9, 2023, 03:58am\n\n6 things you need to know as S'pore moves to Dorscon green on Feb 13\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Singapore reported 1,615 Covid-19 cases in total.\n\nQ: The Ministry of Health (MOH) gives a daily update on the number of Omicron cases in Singapore. Does this mean all other cases belong to other variants?\n\nA:\n\nEach day's Omicron infection numbers include cases that have been reported as part of the overall case count earlier in the week. This is because testing for the variant takes time.\n\nCases which have not been classified as Omicron infections may simply be pending identification, or may belong to other variants.\n\nQ: Do Singapore's daily case numbers accurately reflect the overall number of Covid-19 cases here?\n\nA:\n\nThe daily case numbers reflect only reported Covid-19 cases.\n\nThis means that the daily case count does not include anyone who tests positive with an antigen rapid test (ART) but does not follow up with a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction test, nor people who are infected but asymptomatic and hence may not even get tested.\n\nAt present, those who test ART-positive but feel well are asked to self-isolate for 72 hours. They do not have to report their results nor see a doctor if they test negative after this time period. Such cases would not be reflected in Singapore's daily case count.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nCan Singapore handle the Omicron wave?\n\nSingapore's Omicron wave likely to see a fairly sharp peak, says infectious disease expert\n\nQ: How would we know if the Omicron wave has peaked?\n\nA:\n\nWe would know that the peak is past when Singapore sees a sustained decrease in case numbers over a period of time, Prof Teo said.\n\nBut Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that should the country see such a large number of cases that its testing capacity struggles to keep up, it may be unclear whether the infection wave has peaked.\n\nThis was the case in Australia, where a spike in cases drove up the demand for testing and led to longer wait times for results.\n\nProf Cook added that it is more important to focus on the peak in severe cases, rather than overall case numbers. This peak will lag behind the overall case count, as it takes time for people to develop severe illness after becoming infected.\n\nA large number of severe cases could overwhelm Singapore's healthcare system.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nMakes sense to live with Omicron and treat it as no different from other Covid-19 variants: Experts\n\nOmicron versus Delta: What we know so far\n\nQ: Are Singapore's healthcare protocols different for people with the Omicron variant?\n\nA:\n\nNo, they are not.\n\nMOH applies a single approach to all Covid-19 cases. This is because scientific evidence indicates that\n\nOmicron infections are likely to be less severe\n\nthan those caused by the Delta variant.\n\nIn other words, people recover in the settings that are most suited to their medical conditions. Those who require extra care and monitoring are admitted to hospitals or community treatment facilities, while those whose conditions are stable can recover at home.\n\nThe same goes for imported cases, who recover in hotels or at home.\n\nQ: Do we know which age groups are most likely to be hospitalised after getting infected by this variant?\n\nA:\n\nThe MOH website displays information on the number of patients hospitalised, on oxygen or in intensive care, broken down by age group. But this is not specific to the Omicron variant.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nOmicron optimist, pessimist or fatalist: Which are you?\n\nOmicron may be less severe, but not 'mild', say WHO officials\n\nRelated Stories\n\nS'pore man infected with 2 Covid-19 variants in 8 months\n\nCypriot scientist says findings showing Deltacron Covid-19 variant isn't error\n\nS.

on track but grumpy Ronaldo mars win\n\nShare this article\n\nLONDON (AFP) - Manchester United got back on track with a 3-1 win at Brentford on Wednesday (Jan 19), but Cristiano Ronaldo's petulant reaction to his substitution cast a shadow over their first victory in three Premier League games.\n\nRalf Rangnick's side were indebted to David de Gea for a superb first-half display that kept Brentford at bay before United finally sprang to life in west London.\n\nAnthony Elanga put United in front early in the second half before Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford wrapped up the points.\n\nUnited are the first club to record 300 Premier League away victories despite Brentford's late reply from Ivan Toney.\n\nThey sit seventh in the table, two points adrift of the top four as they chase qualification for next season's Champions League.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut it was Ronaldo's grumpy response to Rangnick's decision to haul him off in the 71st minute that could prove the evening's lasting image.\n\nShaking his head and muttering to himself, Ronaldo appeared to say something to Rangnick as he brushed past him.\n\nAngrily throwing his coat to the floor, Ronaldo pointed at his chest while his team-mates on the bench nervously looked away.\n\nRangnick initially ignored Ronaldo before sitting next to him and patting the Portugal forward on the leg as he attempted to placate him.\n\nThe 36-year-old's strop will raise fresh questions about his willingness to fit into Rangnick's system after his latest underwhelming display.\n\nUnited at least avoided another embarrassing result after losing at home to Wolves and letting a two-goal lead slip in a draw at Aston Villa in their previous two league games.\n\nUnited revival\n\nRonaldo, back after missing two matches with a hip problem, was nearly gifted an early goal when debutant keeper Jonas Lossl dropped a cross at the forward's feet, but the Bees were able to scramble clear.\n\nDespite that scare, Brentford were hardly cowed by United after beating Arsenal and drawing with Liverpool at home earlier this season.\n\nCheck out this tweet!\n\nlink\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: Ronaldo says Rangnick needs time to improve Man Utd\n\nFootball: Man United not just about Ronaldo-Fernandes partnership: Rangnick\n\nOriginally scheduled for December before a coronavirus postponement, Brentford had been made to wait for their first league meeting with United since 1947 and they played as though determined to make up for lost time.\n\nThomas Frank's fired-up team went close through Bryan Mbeumo, whose low shot forced a fine save from De Gea before Vitaly Janelt's close-range effort was blocked by Alex Telles.\n\nBrentford were well on top and Mads Bech Sorensen saw his strike deflected into the side-netting off Bruno Fernandes.\n\nToney tore through United's defence, setting up Mathias Jensen for a shot that was well saved by De Gea.\n\nUnited could not have been any worse in the opening period, yet they played with far more urgency after the interval.\n\nRonaldo nearly gave them the lead when he met Fernandes' cross with a looping header onto the bar.\n\nIt was a warning Brentford failed to heed and, after Toney headed straight at De Gea, Swedish teenager Elanga made the hosts pay for their profligacy in the 55th minute.\n\nFred clipped a pass into the Brentford area and Elanga knocked the ball up in the air before heading past Lossl from close range.\n\nElanga's first goal this season changed the mood completely and United struck again in the 62nd minute.\n\nWith Brentford appealing in vain for offside, Fernandes surged onto Ronaldo's chest down and slipped a pass to Greenwood, who slotted into the empty net for his first goal in seven games.\n\nAfter Ronaldo's temper tantrum, it must have been a relief to Rangnick that Rashford, on as a substitute, notched United's third goal with a fine finish from Fernandes' pass in the 77th minute.\n\nToney scored from close range on 85 minutes but it far too late for Brentford.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nFootball: Man United boss Rangnick says Martial issue 'resolved' after talks\n\nFootball: Rangnick has no qualms about picking Pogba as contract winds

Within hours of the first sales period opening at 6pm, football fans here were among those who registered their interest.\n\nAmong them was Mohamed Alfian, who applied for tickets to one semi-final and the final. The accountant has never been to a World Cup but felt compelled to this time and wanted to \"just try my luck\".\n\n\"This is the first time I will be able to go watch the World Cup in Asia,\" said the 33-year-old Singaporean.\n\n\"The only other time it was (on the continent in Japan and South Korea in 2002), I was still in school. Who knows? This may be a once in a lifetime chance to catch it here in Asia.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 28, 2024, 06:56pm\n\nAge won't determine when I retire, says Messi\n\nMore related stories\n\nBritish football fan James Walton is hoping to travel to a third consecutive World Cup, having been to Brazil in 2014 and Russia in 2018.\n\nWalton, who is the sports business group leader for Deloitte South-east Asia, had applied for eight games in Qatar - four in the Round of 16, two in the quarter-finals and both semi-finals.\n\nWith teams, groups and detailed fixtures not finalised, applying at this early stage means fans do not know who they will end up watching. But this matters little to Walton.\n\nHe said: \"For me, it's all about the football and the atmosphere. Applying at this (early) stage means you also stand a good chance… for Russia, for example, five of my seven applications were successful.\n\n\"Many other fans (around the world) wait to find out when their team is playing but this will only be in the later rounds of balloting.\"\n\nBoth he and Alfian have few qualms about travelling to the Middle East even amid the pandemic.\n\nCalling himself an \"eternal optimist\", Walton added: \"We are heading in the direction of dealing with it as endemic, and with the World Cup being a year out, you've got to take your chances… Anything can happen between now and then.\n\n\"And after my experiences in Brazil and Russia, the World Cup became something that I would try to always go for if I could.\"\n\nLike Walton, Alfian believes the world is adapting to coping with the Covid-19 virus and said he feels secure travelling with global vaccination numbers increasing.\n\nWhile Fifa did not say how many fans would be allowed into stadiums for the first World Cup in an Arab country, individual match tickets were on offer for as little as US$69 (S$93) for international fans - about one-third less than in Russia - but a ticket for the final could cost up to US$1,607.\n\nThe first sales period ends on Feb 8, after which tickets will be allocated. In cases where the number of tickets applied for exceeds availability, tickets will be allocated by a random selection draw.\n\nApplicants will be notified of the outcome of their bids by March 8, along with the steps to follow and the deadline by which to pay for allocated tickets.\n\nSingaporean fan Dmitry, who only wanted to be known by his first name, said he had considered applying for tickets but ultimately decided against it because he did not want to be away from his young child.\n\nHe had attended his first World Cup in Russia - where he was born - and said purchasing tickets for him and his wife then was a breeze, even if he did so as a foreigner having become a Singapore citizen in 2007.\n\nHe paid US$245 for each Category One ticket for two round of 16 games, and US$480 for each Category Two ticket for the England-Croatia semi-final.\n\nDmitry, who works in business development, encouraged fans who are considering travelling to Qatar to take the plunge.\n\n\"100 per cent,\" he said, when asked if he would recommend someone going.\n\n\"You can't imagine the atmosphere, where you have everyone from so many places in one country or city.

Chinese New Year receptions can be held, but by invitation only,\" National Unity Minister Halimah Mohamed Sadique told a news conference. Open houses often involve a constant stream of visitors, including the public, while house visits are closed-door and for invited guests only.\n\nUnder movement curbs last year, reunion dinners were limited to 15 people within a 10km radius. This year, house visits will be allowed throughout CNY celebrations between January 31 and February 15, and there are no travel restrictions.\n\nDatuk Halimah did not state the maximum number of attendees for reunion dinners, but said that immediate family members and close relatives were usually at such gatherings.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 1, 2025, 03:48am\n\nSingaporean drivers beware: VEP fines have started\n\nMore related stories\n\nCelebrations on Chap Goh Meh, or the 15th day of CNY, will be allowed at non-Muslim houses of worship, and lion and dragon dances can be performed.\n\nMalaysian Chinese Association president Wee Ka Siong said his party would have a closed-door reception instead of its usual open house.\n\nA number of states are also taking precautions.\n\nIn Sarawak, reunion dinners are allowed for immediate family members, but open houses, house-to-house visits and lion dances are barred.\n\nThe Penang government is cancelling the Chief Minister's CNY open house for the second year running.\n\nProfessor Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud, chairman of Malaysia's Covid-19 Epidemiological Analysis and Strategies Task Force, told The Straits Times that a spike in Covid-19 cases will depend largely on how well people follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) during events such as family gatherings and prayers.\n\n\"There will always be a risk of spread during Chinese New Year, but this time around compared with last year, most adults would have been vaccinated and hopefully, some adults would have had their booster jabs,\" said Prof Awang.\n\n\"Residents need to somehow make sure congestion does not happen when many guests arrive together, that ventilation is optimal, and guests are reminded to practise mask-wearing and physical distancing even though it involves family members and close friends.\"\n\nTurning to Hari Raya Aidilfitri, he said a rapid roll-out of booster jabs to cover 80 per cent of the population by end-February was crucial to prepare for an Omicron-fuelled outbreak.\n\nDr Sazaly Abu Bakar, director of the Tropical Infectious Diseases Research and Education Centre at Universiti Malaya, also does not expect a spike following the two festivals, largely because 98 per cent of adults - and 78.6 per cent of the population - are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\n\"Malaysians in general have adapted to the new norms of living with SOPs. Hence, I do not foresee major epidemic waves following the two major celebrations of Chinese New Year and Hari Raya. But it doesn't mean it will not happen,\" he told ST.\n\n\"Since most adults have already received two doses of the vaccine, most infections are mild to asymptomatic.\"\n\nArchitect Coe Seng, 40, is among some Malaysians who are being cautious about celebrating CNY.\n\nShe plans to have only a reunion dinner with her immediate family members. As a precautionary measure, since returning to the office on Jan 3, she has been carrying out weekly self-tests on her family members.\n\n\"I will not allow visitors to my house. I just want to protect my family and others. I miss my friends and relatives, but we need to be socially responsible,\" she told ST.\n\nThe Health Ministry said there were 3,229 new Covid-19 cases reported on Wednesday (Jan 19), with 98.8 per cent of those infected showing no or mild symptoms.\n\nHazlin Hassan\n\n, Malaysia Correspondent\n\nmalaysia\n\nchinese new year\n\ncoronavirus\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Both are competent racehorses and both have already opened their Kranji accounts.\n\nHowever, their wins there have been over distances much longer than the 1,400m they will soon have to tackle.\n\nCheval Blanc won over the 1,800m last time while Ima's only win was over the 2,000m.\n\nThe 1,400m does look too short and sharp but there is one thing going for them. Both will carry loads of conditioning into the race.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nOn a morning when gallops involving Saturday's runners were few and far between, both Cheval Blanc and Ima were the exceptions to the rule.\n\nCheval Blanc had jockey Marc Lerner doing the navigating when he covered the 600m in 40.4sec.\n\nAs for Ima, apprentice jockey Kok Wei Hoong was entrusted with steering duties and he guided the five-year-old through the 600m in 40.5sec.\n\nFrom trainer Stephen Gray's yard, Cheval Blanc arrived with a strong reputation. He had eight starts in Ireland and was a winner in a race over 1,408m.\n\nHe arrived at Kranji in August 2018 but began his racing only two years later.\n\nBut he was not idle. Gray, his conditioner since Day One, sent him to seven trials before that first race in mid-August 2020. He finished down the course over the 1,400m.\n\nHe began paying for his keep when he finished second in his next start, narrowly beaten by Ironchamp over the mile.\n\nHe would finish runner-up on two other occasions last year before posting his first win on Nov 20.\n\nThat was over the 1,800m on the Polytrack. He carried stable confidence and went off as the $15 top pick.\n\nFrom the Northern Hemisphere, he turned seven on Jan 1 and his race on Saturday will be his 11th in Singapore.\n\nAs for Ima, he is prepared for the races by Steven Burridge and he will be having his 12th race start on Saturday.\n\nA five-year-old, Ima can sprint and stay. He was second over 1,200m on two occasions last season and his only win came in July when he outstayed his rivals over the 2,000m.\n\nIma has not raced since September. But, in the four months that he has been away from the races, he has had four trials.\n\nWhile the 1,400m might also seem too daunting, he will be presented in the race looking as right and ready as a racehorse can be.\n\nFor those of you wanting to another glimpse of Katak, well, that champion from South Africa will see action in Race 10 - the $85,000 affair over the 1,400m.\n\nThe distance is not his cup of tea. But, with his pedigree, you never can tell.\n\nWell, Katak was another one who was out on the track yesterday but he was not there to make time.\n\nInstead, he cantered two rounds. Word from trackside was that he looked real good.\n\nThat has to be believed. After all, Katak has been turning in good performances in his last two races.\n\nHe finished second to Hard Too Think in the Queen Elizabeth II Cup in October and he ran a huge race when fourth to Lim's Lightning in the Singapore Gold Cup.\n\nOn his day, Katak can be anything he wants to be. Even a sprinter.\n\nSo, do not discount him on Saturday. Give him the respect and he might give you a payday.\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Anything in the 59-second region gets a thumbs up.\n\nTo go under 59 seconds is therefore considered outstanding.\n\nWell, Ararat Lady was truly outstanding when clocking 58.80sec for her jaunt on Tuesday morning.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nAnd to think, she did it while being eased up over the final 100m.\n\nUp in the saddle in Trial 3, jockey Wong Chin Chuen must have realised he was on a flier.\n\nHe had asked the lady to take the lead from the get-go and that is what she did.\n\nWith Boomba, the mount of Oscar Chavez, and Louis-Philippe Beuzelin on Sing Our Song pestering her for most of the journey down to the 600m marker, Ararat Lady seemed to relish the attention.\n\nIndeed, she welcomed the challenge but soon got tired of having the boys just behind her.\n\nThat was at the furlong mark. Taking the bit and giving a snort, she drew clear and, quite truly, put the boys in their places.\n\nUp in the saddle, Wong knew it was \"job done\" and he allowed Ararat Lady to cruise home on her own steam.\n\nStill, at the finish line, she put more than five lengths on second-placed Boomba who, in turn, beat the fast-finishing Quadcopter (Marc Lerner) by half a length.\n\nThat was a clear case of stamping her authority.\n\nSo, you may argue, the trial was on the Polytrack which is a surface Ararat Lady loves. But still, one had to respect her doggedness.\n\nTrained by Tim Fitzsimmons for the AJ's Stable, she truly loves the Polytrack.\n\nHow do we know that? Well, four of her five wins have been on the alternate surface.\n\nIndeed, she is a last-start winner. But that was way back in July, when she charged home from her spot in the box-seat at the home turn to put Al Green to the sword in a 1,100m sprint on the Poly - where else?\n\nAl Green, as we very well know, went on to beat a strong Class 4 field on the opening day of the 2022 season.\n\nAs for Ararat Lady, she has yet to see action this season. When Fitzsimmons eventually sends her out in those flashy silks with the letters AJ emblazoned on the front, do give her plenty of consideration.\n\nOn that win at the trials, she does look ripe and ready for a sixth winning show.\n\nAlthough not in Ararat Lady's league as far as winning times are concerned, Bright Sun was another who knocked home one for the ladies.\n\nRidden by Jerlyn Seow Poh Hui - the only \"lady\" jockey at Kranji - Bright Sun won that three-horse shoot-out in the second trial of the morning.\n\nA \"trier\" who has yet to put a win on the board after 27 outings, Bright Sun had to work hard for the victory.\n\nAlthough leading from the jump-out, she had to contend with Modern Express who bothered her all the way like an irritating fly.\n\nShe never did get rid of him but she still took the trial by a head.\n\nHer 1,000m time was a slow 62.18sec. Then again, both women were not out to break any land speed records.\n\nHowever, her trainer Jason Lim and her connections will draw comfort from the fact that Bright Sun had finished second in two of her last four starts.\n\nIndeed, she has a date with the starter on Saturday. Sure, it is a lowly Class 5 Division 2 sprint over the 1,100m. But, if it brings in a first win, her connections will gladly take it.\n\nTuesday's Kranji barrier trial results:\n\nTRIAL 1 1 Super Talent (O Chavez) 2 Awesome Conqueror (I Saifudin) 3 Fireworks (M Nunes) 4 Missile Rain (N Zyrul) Margins and time: 2, ns, 43/4,  (1min 00.87 sec)\n\nTRIAL 2 1 Bright Sun (PH Seow) 2 Modern Express  3 Sure Will Do (CC Wong) Margins and time: Hd, 1 (1:02.18)\n\nTRIAL 3 1 Ararat Lady (Wong) 2 Boomba (Chavez) 3 Quadcopter (M Lerner) 4 King Louis (T Krisna) 5 Darc Bounty (R Shafiq) 6 Sing Our Song (L Beuzelin) Margins and time: 51/4, 1/2, nk, 41/4,  1 1/4 (58.80 sec)\n\nTRIAL 4 1 Kwazii (Shafiq) 2 Big Tiger (M Akmazani) 3 Classic Thirtysix (Wong) 4 Lim's Dreamwalker (M Kellady) 5 Sun Conqueror (M Zaki) 6 Hugo (Lerner) Margins and time: Hd, 1/2, ns, 3, 51/4 (1:02.09)\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The two who have run put in fair races on debut are (3) CHERE FOR ME and (6) GLITTERFOX. Both deserve respect with that experience.\n\nTrainer Alan Greeff sent out the favourite that day to run third and his supporters will be hoping (1) BOUQUET does better on her debut. Rival trainer Gavin Smith has four runners and, as jockey bookings have not been a good indication of his juveniles, it is uncertain which of them will run best on the day. Watch the betting.\n\nRACE 2 (1,200M)\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n(8) TRUMPS EXPRESS is threatening to win a race and this may well be it. He has the form. Does he have the desire? If his mind is on the job, he will bring this home.\n\n(1) BORN A STAR bled last time out and that spoilt his consistent form. He has had a break and it could bring out the best in him. He is course-and-distance suited.\n\n(4) V V POWER is unreliable but is capable of earning some money.\n\n(16) TEMPLE BAR did not produce her best form last time but could prefer going back to the turf.\n\nRACE 3 (1,600M)\n\n(17) WILDEST DREAMS is a standout in the race but she is one of the reserves. She is from the Western Cape and the race suits. Her good last run last time was an indication that a winning turn may not be far off.\n\n(8) LAURETTA MIA has some fair form and could contest the finish.\n\n(7) IQEMBULABESIFAZANE probably needed her local debut and should improve on that run.\n\n(11) FLY BY improved on the Polytrack last time after a change of trainer and can go one better if as good on the turf.\n\nRACE 4 (1,600M)\n\n(1) DOPPIO ORO is in good condition but may be better on the Polytrack.\n\n(3) JASPERO and (5) RAISE THE STANDARD also have winning chances over a course and distance that should suit.\n\n(2) HOMER FIDGET may have just needed the last run and should be involved at the finish.\n\n(7) MORSE makes his local debut for a very shrewd trainer, so can be included in those novelty bets.\n\nRACE 5 (1,800M)\n\n(1) ALADO'S PRIDE was unplaced last time but was not beaten far and was doing his best work at the finish. He has a wide draw for jockey Muzi Yeni to overcome but does have a winning chance.\n\n(3) LAST OF A LEGEND and (6) FERRARI ICE are both trained by Gavin Smith. The horses have been in good form and, if repeating that form on turf, they could threaten Alado's Pride.\n\n(4) MAGNUM FIRE returns from a break but is not out of it.\n\n(5) GREY PRINCESS did not show her best when trying the Polytrack last time.\n\n(9) ON YOUR MARKS could pop up in the placings and must be considered when planning those quartet bets.\n\nRACE 6 (1,400M)\n\n(1) SAFARI BLUE has come on nicely and is a strong front runner in a smallish field, so will prove hard to catch.\n\nStable companion (2) PEACE IN OUR WORLD looked a classy sort when beating a good field in early 2021 but has not been at his best in his last few runs. He returns from a break that saw him gelded, so if he has his mind on the race we could see him return to form.\n\n(8) MARYAH is clearly talented when she wants to be and trainer Justin Snaith has sent her from Cape Town to spoil the Smith party. It does seem like this race could belong to these three runners. From them, we should get the likely winner.\n\nRACE 7 (1,200M)\n\n(4) SOUND CHECK has been putting in some impressive wins on the Polytrack recently and, although now on turf, has a winning chance.\n\n(5) FLY MY FLAG dominated a good field of sprinters when winning over this course and distance last time. She returns from a break but deserves respect.\n\n(1) JOYFUL NOISE is in good form and could earn some of the minor money.\n\n(2) STEP LIVELY returns to the turf and she could upset all calculations.\n\n(3) GREEN LIGHT GAL is distance suited as well and could run a big race.\n\nRACE 8 (1,200M)\n\n(2) BRASS BELL is better than her recent runs suggest and will like returning to the turf. Can win.\n\n(6) TIMKAT was touched off last time and could be fighting out the finish.\n\n(3) THE GHAN showed improvement last time and must be considered.\n\n(4) EMPERORS DECREE was too far back last time and could be a surprise package.\n\n(16) GREAT GUY has done well on the Polytrack since coming to the Eastern Cape and must be considered as well.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But as Singapore's India Open contingent was recalled home after Yeo Jia Min and a coach contracted Covid-19, Teh, who had not mingled with the group, persisted as he wanted more competition experience.\n\nThe world No. 99 got off to a good start in the first frame against Dharmamer with a series of aggressive play and ferocious smashes, only to meet with stiff resistance afterwards.\n\nThey were neck and neck in the decider, which saw Teh require a few medical breaks to attend to his right hand, after his finger nail had peeled off.\n\nOnly one point separated the duo at the interval, but Dharmamer then raced to a 16-12 lead. Teh closed the gap to 18-16, but his southpaw opponent took the next three points and the win.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 7, 2025, 11:31pm\n\nSingaporean athletes at World Masters Games prove age is no barrier to fitness\n\nMore related stories\n\nTeh said: \"I tried my best to perform today but things just didn't go in my way. I was too rushed in the last two games and made too many unforced errors. I was mentally affected because of some factors, and I will need to be more mature in the future to deal with such situations.\"\n\nNational singles coach Kelvin Ho felt that while Teh showcased his good skills and strokes to make Dharmamer uncomfortable in the first game, he still needs to work on raising the intensity levels.\n\nHe said: \"Jason made quite a few unforced errors in the front court today. Generally, he has more shot variation now but needs to improve on his shot pressure so opponents won't get used to his momentum.\n\n\"We are targeting Jason to get more ranking points so he would be able to play in higher-tier tournaments in the coming months, have more exposure, and be ready for make a challenge to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics.\"\n\nThe National Open Championships 2020 winner will be striving for better results as he is entered for next week's Odisha Open and also the Feb 15-20 Badminton Asia Team Championships. Teh is also expected to play a part in this year's SEA Games and Commonwealth Games.\n\nHe added: \"I hope to achieve stable results at international tournaments to get my ranking up. I hope to break into the world's top 40 or even 30 this year, improve on my independence and consistency on court.\"\n\nBy\n\nDavid Lee\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nRead articles by David Lee\n\nbadminton\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\nLoh Kean Yew aims to be a good father as he juggles both new and old responsibilities\n\nMay 12, 2025, 12:42am\n\nLoh Kean Yew beats Chou Tien-chen to win Taipei Open crown\n\nMay 4, 2025, 11:48pm\n\nShuttler Loh Kean Hean retires; aims to build 'badminton community'\n\nApr 12, 2025, 12:36am\n\nLoh Kean Yew topples world No. 1 Shi Yuqi in thrilling Badminton Asia C'ships quarter-final\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

There were 281 patients in serious condition, and 15 deaths.\n\nNew daily highs were recorded in 28 out of the country's 47 prefectures.\n\nThe surging numbers and planned virus curbs hurt investor sentiment, with the Nikkei 225 index plunging 2.8 per cent to close at its lowest level since Aug 20, 2021, when a state of emergency was in effect across wide areas.\n\nThe 13 prefectures, including Tokyo and its neighbouring regions, will come under a state of quasi-emergency from Friday until Feb 13.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:31am\n\nS'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat\n\nMore related stories\n\nThey join Okinawa, Hiroshima and Yamaguchi, which are already under a state of quasi-emergency from last Sunday to Jan 31 after a spike in cases involving the Omicron variant of the coronavirus that\n\nwas tied to lax regulations at United States military bases.\n\n\"We are fighting against an unknown but with sufficient preparation and without being overly afraid, we will overcome this situation,\" Mr Kishida said on Wednesday.\n\nThe government's top Covid-19 adviser Shigeru Omi said separately that combating the Omicron variant would require more targeted measures.\n\n\"There is no need to ask people to stay home, or to shut down businesses,\" Dr Omi said, adding that the key was to deter large gatherings in poorly-ventilated spaces.\n\nStill, the rapid spread of Covid-19 - the case count on Wednesday was nearly 78 times the 534 reported on New Year's Day - has severely strained medical services.\n\nThe Fire and Disaster Management Agency listed a record 4,151 instances in which ambulances struggled to find a hospital for emergency patients in the week ending Jan 16. This was up 44 per cent from the previous week.\n\nAddressing the strain, Japan Medical Association president Toshio Nakagawa said that the elderly and high-risk patients with underlying conditions would be given priority in Covid-19 treatment.\n\nIn Japan, a quasi-emergency will only be considered by the national government after a formal request is made by prefecture leaders, who also get broader powers to decide on the extent of curbs necessary.\n\nThis has given rise to a hotchpotch of benchmarks and rules across the country.\n\nIn Tokyo, where the case count was in the double-digits at the turn of the year, Wednesday's 7,377 new cases eclipsed the old high of 5,908 cases on Aug 13 last year.\n\nTokyo Governor Yuriko Koike sought the quasi-emergency on Monday after the hospital bed usage rate crossed its threshold of 20 per cent.\n\nThe figure was 25.9 per cent on Wednesday, while Ms Koike has said that a full-fledged state of emergency would be necessary if the usage rate tops 50 per cent.\n\nBut no quasi-emergency has yet been sought by Osaka, which on Wednesday set a new high of 6,101 cases, as its bed usage rate of 31.3 per cent was still under its threshold of 35 per cent.\n\nTokyo and its surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama and Gunma will come under the state of quasi-emergency from Friday, as will Niigata, Gifu, Aichi, Mie, Kagawa, Nagasaki, Kumamoto and Miyazaki.\n\nSome prefectures, like Tokyo, are asking food-and-beverage businesses to stop alcohol service at 8pm and shut by 9pm.

More than 100 victims have received their payouts so far.\n\nDBS Bank on Wednesday also warned its customers about a fake SMS being sent to users claiming to be from the bank.\n\nIt urged customers not to click on links sent through SMS messages and said that it would never ask for account details or OTP (one-time password) over the phone, e-mail or SMS. DBS is actively taking down such phishing sites, it added.\n\nIn the joint statement, MAS and ABS said banks will continue to work closely with MAS, the police and the Infocomm Media Development Authority to deal with the phishing scams.\n\nThis includes working on more permanent solutions to combat SMS spoofing, including adoption of the SMS Sender ID registry by all relevant stakeholders.\n\nThe central bank is also intensifying its scrutiny of major financial institutions' fraud surveillance mechanisms to ensure they are adequately equipped to deal with the growing threat of online scams.\n\nThe MAS and ABS stressed that customer vigilance remains key and outlined several measures customers must take to avoid falling for online banking scams:\n\n- Never click on links provided in SMSes or e-mails;\n\n- Never divulge Internet banking credentials or passwords to anyone;\n\n- Verify SMSes or e-mails received by calling the bank directly on the hotline listed on its official website;\n\n- Verify that you are at the bank's official website before making any transactions, or transact through the bank's official mobile application; and\n\n- Closely monitor transaction notifications so that any unauthorised payments are reported as soon as possible to increase the chances of recovery.\n\nMAS managing director Ravi Menon said that the central bank is deeply concerned about the recent scams and the financial losses suffered by victims.\n\n\"The threat of scams will not go away, but we can reduce our vulnerabilities. This requires a multi-pronged response across the ecosystem,\" he said, adding that the MAS along with other agencies will work closely with the financial industry, telecoms industry, consumer groups and other stakeholders to strengthen collective resilience against scam attacks.\n\nABS chairman Wee Ee Cheong said that the banking industry, along with the MAS and ecosystem players, will continue to strengthen consumer protection measures.\n\n\"We also ask that the public stay vigilant given that scams continue to evolve and are executed quickly.\n\n\"We remain committed to upholding the confidence with which customers can transact online safely, while still maintaining a high level of service,\" said Mr Wee.\n\nChoo Yun Ting\n\nBANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nSCAMS\n\nMAS/MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 11, 2025, 12:01am\n\nDBS, OCBC and UOB to recognise CPF Life payouts as proof of income in credit card applications\n\nApr 7, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nDBS, Bank of China customers' information compromised after data attack on vendor\n\nMar 18, 2025, 02:45am\n\nStanChart offers up to $50,000 coverage against digital scams as part of a revamped savings account\n\nFeb 25, 2025, 11:59pm\n\n13,000 DBS employees to learn AI, data skills as bank plans to cut 4,000 workers over 3 years\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Ex-actress Jacelyn Tay and experts on the dos and don'ts\n\nShare this article\n\nHow would you react when your child comes home from school asking with wide-eyed innocence: \"What is six-nine?\"\n\nActress-turned-wellness health coach Jacelyn Tay, 46, found herself in such a situation in November. Her 10-year-old son Zavier Wong said his friend was making cheeky jokes about it.\n\n\"I was thinking to myself: Oh gosh, how do I tell him? Because he wasn't just asking what is sex, but what is six-nine,\" she recalls.\n\nLater that month when they were on a cruise holiday, she found the right opportunity to have a sex education talk with him. They were sitting at their cabin balcony overlooking the sea and it felt like the \"correct mood\", she says with a chuckle.\n\nThat first serious conversation about the matter with her son was her biggest hurdle because she was unsure how he would take to it.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 24, 2025, 12:59am\n\nThose who were hit as kids are more willing to physically punish their own children: S'pore study\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I'm a health coach. I'm not shy about talking about it, but how blatantly truthful should I be? Would he jump and say, 'What on earth is this?'\" says Tay, who is the founder of wellness centre Body Inc.\n\nAfter the conversation, she found it very easy to talk to him about sexuality and he would continue to ask her questions every now and then.\n\nTay did not want to go into details of their exchanges with The Straits Times, but she shared some of it on her social media earlier this month.\n\nOne question raised by her son was: \"Does it really feel good when (the) penis goes into (the) vagina?\"\n\nAnd what should he do if he feels like having sex?\n\nTay replied that he had to simply \"control\" the urge, though she also confessed to not knowing what the right answer is.\n\n\"Oh man, it is not easy parenting at all,\" she lamented in her post. \"In this time and age, I find it challenging bringing up a wholesome good boy.\"\n\nZavier is her only child. Tay was married for eight years to businessman Brian Wong. They announced their divorce in 2018.\n\nTay has since removed the post, but it is not because she regretted sharing the rather private conversation with her son publicly.\n\nShe tells The Straits Times that her beliefs about sex stem from her Christian faith, which drew divided opinions from people who read her post. \"Out of respect to those who were upset, I took down the post. I don't want to argue about religion.\"\n\nShe went through the comments - both positive and negative - with her son.\n\nAnd in case you are wondering, he gave consent to all the posts related to him. \"And every single picture,\" she adds with a laugh.\n\nTay says she had put up the post to spark a conversation with other parents who may have a better solution to teaching kids about sex. She received many encouraging messages from parents, who are grateful for her candid sharing.\n\nIndeed, the trust and openness she displays towards her son is an approach that family experts agree with.\n\nClinical psychologist Carol Balhetchet, who has more than 20 years of experience counselling children and teenagers, says: \"It is brilliant that she lets her child know that he can talk to her about this intimate subject about sex and being aroused. Kudos to her that she even brought up this topic for discussion on a public platform.\"\n\nMs Tan Joo Hymn, project director for the Birds and Bees programme at Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware), says it is important that children feel they are loved and that they can ask their parents anything.\n\n\"What was good about Jacelyn's approach is that she engaged with her son in the moment, and answered his questions, even if she admitted to not being sure of the right answer and finding the conversation challenging,\" says Ms Tan.\n\nThe trust and openness Jacelyn Tay displays towards her son is an approach that family experts agree with.PHOTO: JACELYN_TAY/INSTAGRAM\n\nExperts that The Straits Times spoke to say having an honest and open talk about sex does not encourage children to try it.\n\n\"Studies show that having conversations with parents about sex helps youth delay sexual activity while preparing them to make healthy decisions about relationships in future,\" says Ms June Yong, a family life expert at Focus on the Family Singapore.\n\nMs Tan says these decisions include having fewer partners and using contraception more consistently, citing research by the World Health Organisation and United Nations.\n\nShe points out that just as Tay's son asked her questions before she thought he was ready, many children may be curious about their bodies and interested in romantic and intimate experiences when they are still \"too young\" in their parents' eyes.\n\n\"They are also bombarded by sexualised images which are used to promote anything from burgers to jeans. No matter how hard parents tell their children that sex is off-limits, they receive many more counter messages every day,\" she says.\n\nSo, for parents who are asked questions about sex by their kids or thinking of talking to their kids about it, what are the dos and don'ts?\n\nDo start early and keep talking\n\nTake a factual, age-appropriate and incremental approach.\n\nSays Focus on the Family Singapore's Ms Yong: \"It is best to start young and start small, tackling topics such as the proper names of body parts and biological differences between male and female.\"\n\nMs Tan of Aware says children can also learn the differences between safe and unsafe touches, and who to approach if something feels wrong.\n\nBooks are helpful resources to jump-start the conversation.\n\nMs Yong recommends titles such as Who Has What?: All About Girls' Bodies And Boys' Bodies by Robie H. Harris and I Said No! A Kid-To-Kid Guide To Keeping Private Parts Private by Zack and Kimberly King.\n\nHowever, ex-actress Tay says parents should not force the topic on their kids if they are not ready. She tried finding opportunities to talk to her son about sex when he was in lower primary, but he was simply not interested.\n\n\"But when our kids start to ask us, that's when we have to face the topic and really address it.\"\n\nDon't feel awkward about the topic\n\nIt is likely that children aged 10 and older will start asking their mums and dads questions similar to those asked by Tay's son.\n\n\"As parents, it's useful to first think through our own attitudes and perspectives about sex and relationships, and then plan what we want to say to our children,\" says Ms Tan who has three kids aged 10 to 17.\n\nParents have to overcome their shyness talking about sex and relationships.\n\n\"Children are very good at sensing our moods. If we are terribly awkward when talking to them, they may conclude that they should not bring up such topics with us anymore,\" she adds.\n\nInstead, they will find other means to find the answers, including from friends and the Internet.\n\nDo explain what happens during puberty\n\nAt primary-school age, it would be helpful to explain to kids what happens during puberty, so they are not caught off-guard. School-based sex education begins only in Primary 5 and that might be too late for some children, says Ms Tan.\n\nMs Yong advises parents to take time to help their kids understand the changes they will experience, and encourage them to raise concerns or questions.\n\nFor instance, a girl will start developing breasts and menstruating. A boy's voice will deepen and he will experience an increase in height, muscle mass and the size of his penis and testicles.\n\nParents with sons can also have conversations about the possibility of erections and wet dreams.\n\n\"We can talk about what these are and when it can happen, for example, during a full bladder, sexual arousal and sleep. Assure them that erections are a normal part of being a male teen and not something to be embarrassed about,\" says Ms Yong.\n\nDr Balhetchet, who has over 20 years of experience counselling children and teenagers, adds that parents should be \"relaxed and factual\" in talking to their son.\n\nDon't instil shame or use fear-based tactics\n\nHolistic sexuality education does not just comprise talking about the physical aspect of sexuality, but involves the whole person, including the intellectual, emotional and relational aspects, says Ms Yong.\n\n\"Most people associate sex with acts of intimacy with a partner, but wholesome sexual attitudes actually begin with loving and accepting yourself and being comfortable with who you are.\n\n\"Parents should be mindful not to instil shame about their children's bodies or use fear-based tactics to turn them off sex, such as perpetuating the myth that sex is dirty or messy.\"\n\nDo attend parenting programmes\n\nLook out for workshops run by Aware and Focus on the Family Singapore to help equip you with evidence-based knowledge about consent, relationships and sex, and tools to begin the conversations with your kids.\n\nFor example, Aware has\n\na workshop titled Birds And Bees next month\n\n.\n\nYou can also get useful tips from the\n\nTalk About Sex column\n\non the website of Focus on the Family Singapore.\n\nA 2020 survey of parents that Aware did with Blackbox Research found that only around half of respondents felt comfortable having age-appropriate discussions with their kids about sexual health, intimate relationships and sex.\n\nThe highest percentage of parents were comfortable discussing topics of sexual health (57 per cent) with their children, followed by romantic and intimate relationships (51 per cent), with sex coming in last (49 per cent).\n\nFor those uncomfortable discussing these topics, the reasons given included embarrassment or a lack of confidence (25 per cent), a lack of the appropriate tools to begin the conversation (35 per cent) and the worry that the discussion would encourage their children to have sex (26 per cent).\n\nSays Ms Tan: \"Many who attended Aware's Birds And Bees workshop for parents said they had not talked about sex in their families when they were young or were given the message that sex was dirty or taboo.\"\n\nDo teach your child about respect and consent\n\nTay reminds her son not to engage in \"dirty talk\" about women's bodies or believe other boys if they say that he is \"not macho\" for never having sex before.\n\nAccording to Ms Tan, many parents are predominantly approaching sexuality education by envisioning their children as potential victims of sexual violence. Far fewer consider the possibility that their kids might be the potential perpetrators.\n\nBut in a study done by Aware in 2016 in collaboration with a tertiary institution in Singapore, one in five young persons said they had verbally harassed someone, and one in 10 had touched, kissed or had sex with someone without the latter's consent.\n\nFour in 10 said they knew someone who had harassed or initiated unwanted sexual contact with someone.\n\n\"These numbers are not insignificant,\" says Ms Tan. \"Therefore, talking about sex and relationships with young persons is important not just to protect them from sexual assault, but also to protect others from being assaulted by them.\"\n\nDo talk about pornography and the sex trade\n\nDuring the course of her work counselling children, Dr Balhetchet has seen boys who had access to Playboy magazines and porn sites.\n\nIn fact, according to a 2016 survey by Touch Cyber Wellness, nine in 10 boys between the ages of 13 and 15 in Singapore have watched or read sexually explicit materials.\n\nIf you think they had accidentally stumbled upon the porn sites, you would be surprised that 54 per cent of boys intentionally sought these out.\n\nIn order to protect their kids, Dr Balhetchet says parents should not shy away from talking about pornography \"because we do not live in a pure world\".\n\nTay says she has been educating her 10-year-old son about porn.\n\n\"I even talked about prostitution,\" she says. \"He was watching Crime Watch and an episode mentioned 'extra services'.\n\n\"I think we need to address all topics related to sex completely because, if not, they will go onto the Internet and search for it.\n\n\"It's unavoidable because they are exposed to it online. No matter how you lock up the access, there will be kids in school who will talk about it, like how my son heard it from the others.\"\n\nTo help make the discussion easier, Ms Yong suggests that parents read Good Pictures, Bad Pictures: Porn-proofing Today's Young Kids by Kristen A. Jenson.\n\nDo continue to engage your teenage children\n\nTeenagers tend to shy away from awkward conversations with parents. They are also at an age where they think they know a lot, says Ms Tan.\n\nA useful way would be to talk about characters in shows or books, ask them what they think about a certain character or whether they would do the same thing in a similar situation. This makes the conversation less personal and therefore less threatening to a teen.\n\nMs Yong adds that parents may want to approach the topic of sex and romance from the perspective of wanting to understand what they think, while also helping them to learn more about it. \"Your teen will want to know the 'why behind the what', so take your time to explain the reasons behind your beliefs,\" she says.\n\nDon't lose your cool\n\nMost importantly, make your child feel safe that he or she can ask you anything. \"And you should respond in a non-judgmental way,\" says Dr Balhetchet.\n\nMs Yong agrees. \"Value connection more than correction. This means that when they do approach you and admit to seeing or doing something they shouldn't have, you'll have to keep your composure and not lose your cool.\n\n\"When you are connected to each other, sex can be just another topic you talk to each other about.\"\n\n\"Mum, dad, I'm in a relationship\"\n\nWhen children confess that they are \"in a relationship\", it is easy for parents to imagine the worst and jump to conclusions.\n\nSometimes, younger children mimic what they see without understanding, and for them, \"being in a relationship\" means going to recess with the same person every day, says Ms Tan from Aware.\n\n\"We should remember that our children have just entrusted us with information that is close to their hearts, and that this is an opportunity for us to have a conversation with them to understand them better,\" she adds.\n\nSome questions that parents can ask in such a situation are: What do you like about your boyfriend or girlfriend? What do you enjoy doing together? How do you feel when you are with him or her?\n\nMs Yong from Focus on the Family Singapore says some teens may think that being in love means having sex with their boyfriend or girlfriend.\n\n\"Help your teens process this by not just talking about sex as a pleasurable act, but by placing sex within the context of a loving, respectful and committed relationship.\"\n\nDr Balhetchet suggests that parents ask their child to invite the boyfriend or girlfriend home to meet them. She says: \"Tell your kid, we're not judging here. We just want to know him or her.\"\n\nFor parents whose kids have not entered a romantic relationship yet, she cautions against setting rules that they cannot date until a certain age.\n\n\"Won't they start lying to you when they have a boyfriend or girlfriend before then?\" she says. \"Instead, why not set rules such as: Whenever you have something troubling you, come talk to me. I'll be here.\"\n\nThis way, you can keep the communication open with your child and be able to see his or her world.\n\nElisa Chia\n\nparenting\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nCelebrities\n\nsocial media\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 16, 2025, 08:55am\n\nDad's emotional support after her mum's death helps taekwondo champ fly high\n\nMar 27, 2025, 10:40am\n\nParents to get 6 weeks shared leave for babies born on or after April 1\n\nMar 23, 2025, 12:00am\n\n'I needed to protect her against dark thoughts': Father of 5, whose wife had postnatal depression\n\nMar 22, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nMore fathers in Singapore seeking help for postnatal depression\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Longines is the official timekeeper for the Commonwealth Games, which will take place in Birmingham from July 28 to Aug 8.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 12, 2024, 03:02pm\n\nEnd 'witch-hunt', says Schooling on controversy\n\nMore related stories\n\nWhile the last year was not smooth sailing for Quah, it has also taught her some valuable lessons that she will be taking into the new year.\n\nShe had enjoyed a strong 2019, which saw her clinch six gold medals at the SEA Games, and had wanted to carry that winning momentum into 2020, when the Olympics were initially scheduled to take place.\n\nBut the pandemic wreaked havoc on the sporting calendar, forcing the quadrennial competition to be postponed by a year. The extra year of training, coupled with the uncertainty and changing schedules, eventually took a toll on her.\n\nIn her two events in Tokyo, she clocked times below her personal best and later lamented that she was not at her physical peak.\n\nShe also felt that she under performed during the ISL season with DC Trident later in the year.\n\nQuah said: \"I didn't expect myself to get tired of all the ups and downs when I did. I was like, 'We will persevere and push through it', but by 2021, it was starting to affect a lot of us.\n\n\"I had a pretty good year in the ISL in 2020. I think it was because of the inconsistency of having to quarantine and start training, that very staccato kind of training that I got tired in 2021. I didn't regulate myself - I wasn't placing enough emphasis on certain things. I wasn't resting enough and by the end of 2021, I realised I had dug a hole of fatigue so deep that I was having trouble pulling myself out.\"\n\nA break at the end of last year did not do much for Quah, which worried her.\n\nBut after taking some time to reflect on her swimming career and the past year, she concluded that she still wanted to prioritise sport in 2022.\n\nQuah has set herself some lofty goals as she hopes to compete in all the major Games, which will pose a challenge given that they are in May, July/August and September.\n\nHaving bagged a bronze with the 4x100m medley relay team in 2018, she also wants to win a medal again at the Asian Games.\n\nWhile she has yet to qualify for the Commonwealth Games, she also wants to see how close she can get to a spot on the podium, no mean feat given the Games will feature world-class swimmers from Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.\n\nAcknowledging that 2022 will not be easy, she said: \"The goal is to get myself so fit that it gives me more options where maybe I wouldn't have to do a full taper and still be able to go fast. Ideally, I would really want to do well in all (the Games). It may be difficult and I may miss the mark at some point, but I know myself and I won't be happy if I don't try.\"\n\nBy\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nRead articles by Kimberly Kwek\n\nQuah Ting Wen\n\n2020 Tokyo Olympics\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 11, 2024, 02:02am\n\nSwimmer Gan Ching Hwee finally gets her Olympic debut\n\nJul 11, 2024, 01:36am\n\nS'pore Aquatics clarifies Quah's omission from Olympic team\n\nJul 9, 2024, 12:50am\n\nQuah Ting Wen fails in appeal for Paris Olympics\n\nFeb 19, 2024, 03:26am\n\nQuah and Sim sisters earn historic swimming relay spot at Paris Olympics\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

After several reminders from Mr Tan that he should not \"make another speech\" when giving a personal explanation, Mr Leong told the House that he got the information off a screenshot from a Telegram chat group that was sent to him by a Facebook friend.\n\nLeader of the House Indranee Rajah, responding to the fact that Mr Leong made allegations based on a screenshot,\n\nissued a stern reminder to MPs to exercise their privilege responsibly.\n\nMs Indranee and Mr Tan had also reiterated this point on parliamentary privilege, after former Workers' Party MP Raeesah Khan\n\nadmitted to lying in Parliament\n\nin a speech she made on Aug 3 last year (2021).\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nIn its post on Wednesday, Parliament explained that a personal explanation is an opportunity for MPs to make a short statement to explain, justify or apologise for his or her conduct with regard to a particular question or occasion, or to correct an alleged misrepresentation.\n\nSuch an explanation can be made after question time, and can be done only after an MP gets advance permission from the Speaker.\n\nThe MP must submit the terms of the explanation to the Speaker beforehand, said Parliament.\n\nIt added that based on Standing Order 25, which sets out the rules for personal explanations, no controversial matter may be brought up during such an explanation, and no debate may arise upon the explanation.\n\nDuring the Jan 11 session of Parliament, Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh pointed out to Mr Tan: \"When a personal explanation is made... you would actually receive the whole statement in full. So the assumption was, when you mentioned personal explanation, you would have had sight of what Mr Leong was going to say.\"\n\nMr Tan said to Mr Singh that Mr Leong had written to him asking to make a clarification, \"so he did not cite the specific issue of personal explanation, but that is the category I am putting it under\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Parliament said other types of explanations in Parliament include ministerial statements made by ministers and other office-holders to explain important issues of public interest and clarifications by MPs on their previous speeches.\n\nMr Tan said that in most instances, MPs have been \"responsible and matured in their behaviour and conduct, and there has been little need for me to crack the proverbial whip\".\n\nHe added that he would not hesitate to be firm when needed, and that it would be remiss of him to do otherwise.\n\n\"I have stated before that I would take a more expansive approach to allow for freer debates in Parliament and have done so for all sides of the House.

Who does that?\n\n\"English is not her first language and I tend to be annoyingly flowery in my speech.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\nMore related stories\n\nWhedon explained that he had joked with Gadot about not wanting to cut a specific scene of hers from the film, saying she would have to tie him to a railroad track and do it over his dead body. According to him, she thought he had said over her dead body.\n\nHowever, when contacted by the magazine, Gadot remembered the exchange differently, saying: \"I understood perfectly.\"\n\nEven before Gadot had come forward, actor Ray Fisher, 34, who played Cyborg in Justice League, had accused Whedon in 2020 of \"gross, abusive, unprofessional and completely unacceptable\" behaviour on the reshoot of the movie.\n\nThe original director of the DC movie, Zack Snyder, had stepped away from the project after his daughter's suicide.\n\nFisher's role, the first black superhero in a DC movie, was cut by Whedon and his skin tone was digitally lightened.\n\nHowever, Whedon denied that he behaved inappropriately and said Cyborg's storyline made no sense and that he had brightened everything in the film in post-production.\n\n\"We're talking about a malevolent force,\" Whedon said, referring to Fisher. \"We're talking about a bad actor in both senses.\"\n\nA television still of Zack Snyder’s Justice League.PHOTO: HBO MAX\n\nThe movie, one of the most expensiveever made, received mixed reviews and flopped at the box office.\n\nFisher, who had his scenes restored in Snyder's cut of the film which was released in 2021 to appease fans, wrote in response to Whedon's remarks on Twitter on Monday: \"Looks like Joss Whedon got to direct an endgame after all.\"\n\nAs for\n\nallegations of abuse on the sets of Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel,\n\nlevelled against him by actresses Charisma Carpenter and Michelle Trachtenberg, he admitted he was \"not mannerly\".\n\nHe added he sometimes had to yell at the cast as \"this was a very young cast and it was easy for everything to turn into a cocktail party\".\n\nHe said that people had been using \"every weaponisable word of the modern era to make it seem like I was an abusive monster\".\n\n\"I think I'm one of the nicer showrunners that's ever been.\"\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nJoss Whedon allegedly threatened Gal Gadot on Justice League set\n\nMore speak up against Buffy The Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon\n\nSuzanne Sng\n\nMovies\n\nactors\n\nsocial media\n\nbullying\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Some victims have lost life savings built up over the years for their families.\n\nThe victims received unsolicited SMS messages purporting to be from the bank, claiming there were issues with their banking accounts and they had to click on a link given in the message to resolve the issue.\n\nThe link led to fake bank websites and victims were asked to key in their Internet banking account login details.\n\nMany victims of the latest scams were fooled because\n\nthe SMS sender name \"OCBC\" was spoofed by the scammers\n\n, and the fake SMS messages were grouped in the same SMS thread with genuine ones sent previously by OCBC for one-time passwords (OTPs) and transaction alerts.\n\nOCBC said on Monday\n\nit had been making goodwill payments to affected customers\n\nsince Jan 8.\n\nIn a separate statement on Monday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said\n\nit would consider supervisory actions against OCBC\n\nand that it expected all customers to be treated fairly.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Straits Times reported that\n\nseveral OCBC customers had received payouts from the bank\n\n, but the victims declined to reveal details of the payouts, citing non-disclosure agreements they had signed.\n\nSome victims that ST spoke to on Wednesday said they are happy with OCBC's decision.\n\nOne of them, a 38-year-old man, said the bank should have told the victims about the full payments instead of making them wait in anticipation. The fintech professional lost about $10,000 via the scam.\n\n\"Also, why do they need a non-disclosure agreement if everyone is getting a full payout?\" he said.\n\nAnother victim, Adam (not his real name), said: \"Since the phishing scam is creating more awareness and causing people to lose confidence in OCBC, reimbursement is the only way to stop the negative impact on its brand image.\"\n\nThe 36-year-old, who works in the home renovation industry, lost about $5,000. \"I'm happy that all the victims can sleep well again, and put the traumatic experience to an end,\" he added.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nWhy some OCBC customers in SMS scams did not get OTPs\n\nMum of 7 kids loses $100k in SMS scam: What we know so far and how to avoid such scams\n\nRei Kurohi\n\nand\n\nDominic Low\n\nocbc\n\nBANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 17, 2025, 02:41am\n\nWin a Brompton G Line bicycle worth $4,000 in ST-OCBC Cycle 2025 contest\n\nDec 23, 2024, 03:22am\n\n4,000 junior OCBC employees to receive $1,000 one-time payouts\n\nNov 7, 2024, 10:57pm\n\nOCBC to offer cross-border payments in over 50 digital wallets\n\nOct 12, 2024, 11:07pm\n\nPhish head curry: Woman loses $33k to malware scam\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0abd442bbe2b1ffa1f9e3082e1f48f8fefe3d0a845397f0896052fa493fd25f3/yq-ocbc-19012023.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "More than 100 victims have already received the payouts.", "caption": "More than 100 victims have already received the payouts.

Its sister ship, World Dream, joined in November 2017 and operated cruises from Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nSince sailings resumed in November 2020 during the pandemic, World Dream has received at least 200,000 passengers and had been seeing strong demand for its 2022 sailings.\n\nGenting Hong Kong also owns two other cruise brands - Star Cruises, which operates in the Asia Pacific, and luxury brand Crystal Cruises, which is headquartered in Miami, Florida.\n\nThe three cruise brands are collectively known as Genting Cruise Lines.\n\nIn a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Wednesday, the firm said it had \"exhausted all reasonable efforts\" to negotiate with creditors and stakeholders.\n\nThe company's available cash balances are expected to run out by around end-January, it added.\n\nMV Weften said earlier this week that it will file for bankruptcy after failing to secure funding for the completion of its \"Global One\" mega-liner.\n\nThe ship, which had been designed to carry about 5,000 passengers, was due to leave the shipyard in 2021 and had been designed for the booming Asian cruise market.\n\nThe firm decided to declare bankruptcy after lengthy discussions with German officials were not fruitful. It needed about S$921 million to finance the completion of the ship.\n\nGenting Hong Kong flagged on Tuesday that it had planned to file for provisional liquidation with courts in Bermuda, where it is registered.\n\nIt also warned investors that cross defaults amounting to US$2.78 billion (S$3.76 billion) may follow.\n\nGenting Hong Kong reported a record loss of US$1.7 billion in May 2021, as the Covid-19 pandemic continued to decimate the hospitality industry.\n\nIn 2020, it reported a consolidated net loss of about US$1.72 billion, compared to US$159 million in 2019.\n\nIts full-year revenue also fell from US$1.56 billion in 2019 to US$367 million in 2020, mainly due to the suspension of cruise operations since February 2020.\n\nMany cruise operators were forced to halt operations especially at the start of the pandemic when countries closed their borders and prevented cruise ships from docking.\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 on cruises led to an estimated loss of about $77 billion in global economic activity and more than 500,000 jobs between mid March and September 2020, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.\n\nBy\n\nAdeline Tan\n\nRead articles by Adeline Tan\n\nCRUISES\n\ncoronavirus\n\nTOURISM & TRAVEL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nSep 8, 2024, 11:16pm\n\nAn all-durian cruise experience aboard Genting Dream\n\nApr 1, 2024, 05:59am\n\nCruise passengers left in the lurch on Good Friday\n\nOct 14, 2023, 03:03pm\n\nMan charged after telling cruise operator its ship would explode if it did not return his money\n\nSep 11, 2023, 08:08am\n\nParents bring photo of deceased son on board cruise ship to fulfil his dream\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c1cad2eb467daaaa98984683babb6c9057d3dbddd1ebe1f01dd6436e7898a185/yq-dreamcruise-19012022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Dream Cruises' World Dream is one of two cruise lines allowed to operate cruises to nowhere in Singapore.", "caption": "Dream Cruises' World Dream is one of two cruise lines allowed to operate cruises to nowhere in Singapore.

There is also a gag order on his identity.\n\nThe court heard that two Land Transport Authority (LTA) enforcement officers were looking out for errant users of motorised PMDs at around 7am on Oct 30, 2020 when Jin was spotted unlawfully riding her device on a footpath along Hougang Street 91.\n\nThe two men followed her in a van before one of them alighted and walked towards her. He showed her his LTA pass and told her to get off her PMD.\n\nJin sped away instead of stopping, the court heard.\n\nThe boy and his mother were at a bus stop in Hougang Street 93 when Jin rode towards them at around 7.10am.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Zhou Yang said: \"The accused failed to keep a proper lookout and her PMD hit the victim's right arm and hand.\n\n\"As a result of the pain, the victim bent forward and started crying. He was unable to bend his fingers on his right hand as a result of the injury caused by collision.\"\n\nThe police were alerted and an ambulance took him to KK Women's and Children's Hospital where he was found with a bruised right shoulder.\n\nThe child was given a day's medical leave.\n\nMeanwhile, Jin continued riding the device to her boyfriend's home where she was arrested that afternoon.\n\nInvestigations later revealed that she was riding an unregistered PMD.\n\nOn Wednesday, the court called for a report to assess her suitability for probation.\n\nJin is expected to be sentenced in March.\n\nFor causing hurt to another person by performing a negligent act, an offender can be jailed for up six months and fined up to $2,500.\n\nBy\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nRead articles by Shaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f7308692facb48a83585f97e7ad90669224ed7a39d660b2f744f2b41e36efcd2/yq-pmd-19012023.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jin Ng Teng (blocked) pleaded guilty to three charges under the Active Mobility Act.", "caption": "Jin Ng Teng (blocked) pleaded guilty to three charges under the Active Mobility Act.
